I’m very glad I did it at that time because if not I would have probably started drinking so much more.  My fiancé is also sober and it is a great help.  However, I have now been smoking so much more.

I have been smoking cigarettes for 18 years and I was down to about a pack a week before I stopped drinking.  Now I’m smoking about half a pack a day.  I am worried that this is just a replacement mechanism and I don’t know how to smoke less because I’m worried I’ll start drinking again if I do.

Any advise?",2

It's still hard. I still struggle with it. I don't have the ability to push myself like I used to. When I'm tired, I'm tired. When I don’t feel good, I don't feel good. When I'm upset, I'm upset.

I can't block out reality anymore, at least, not to the same extent. And there are times when I honestly miss that. I have so many expectations of myself that I'm unable to meet. There are so many things that I would like to do that I just can't do, and that's hard for me to face.

This was one of the insidious things about drinking for me. I could drink and get a rush and feel better. I could keep going for a while on that, and then it'd fall apart when I got really drunk, but by then I didn't care. And then the next day I'd be hungover and brain dead, which meant that I was either lying around not doing much of anything, or I was just running on adrenaline and too brain dead to really got caught up in much self-appraisal or self-criticism.

It sorta worked for me. I mean, I was *waaay* less functional than I convinced myself that I was, functional alcoholism was a self-delusional joke on me. My life was falling apart and passing me by and I kept telling myself that everything was fine. But I cared less, and I thought less, and I didn't have to feel as many things. That's still slightly attractive at times, I'm not gonna lie. Sometimes I wish I was a robot. It's hard to have the limitations of a body. I hate having feelings.

I dunno, I'm just tired. I'm bumping up against my own limitations a lot lately, and that's something that alcohol helped me to avoid. And now I just have to live in reality. I am not a person who felt particularly physically better after getting sober, and that has plagued me from the beginning. I have some underlying health issues that getting sober didn't fix, because they weren't related to drinking. I've relapsed over that before, and it wasn't worth it. But it's still sorta shit. It's still a part of sobriety that I struggle to accept. I have to feel how I feel. I can't escape it. I'm sure that just accepting it would help, but I dunno, I still feel like fighting it. 

Anyway, I'm going to bed, I probably just need to rest. Goodnight sobernauts. Thanks for listening to me rant.

I do not want another Day One again in my near future. Day One SUCKS. I've had some Day Ones better than others, but usually I just want to go to bed so I can wake up on Day Two. That's my one motivation for making it through Day One. You can't get to any other days without Day Two.

I was unproductive today. Super so. I surfed the internet mindlessly all day today (and before you say, ""Well, it's better than drinking!"" Surfing the web has taken even more from my life and has been an addiction since long before my first sip. I've wasted most of my adolescence and twenties so far to it. It's like a cigarette to me.) Wore pajamas. Ate junk. My chores remain neglected. My bathroom is a nightmare. My bed's not even made. I still procrastinate. I don't work on my hobbies or exercise. It felt like Day One.

But you know what? It's not Day One. IT'S DAY EIGHT, MOTHERFUCKER. Which means while I was unproductive and my focus is shot from surfing, Day Eight has some benefits...my face is white instead of red and dehydrated, I got to play with my kitties for a few minutes, my conscience is clear, and NO. SHAME. FROM. DRINKING.

Tomorrow I can do a yoga video or something instead of waking up on SHITTY Day One (you know, if I decide not to surf, which again, is considerably worse for me....not giving up my no drink streak, though.) No red and puffy face. No regrets about drinking Mom's shitty Woodbridge Cabernet that doesn't even taste good. Instead of starting on Day One, I can start on Day Nine!  

I'm trying to sear my hatred of Day One into my brain. Let's see how far I go this time.

The 10 years or so of my active alcoholism(Say 20-29)I avoided going to the doctor because I was so incredibly scared to get bad news having to do with the toll my drinking had on me. Hell, for years before I got sober, I actively avoided looking at myself In the mirror! I was severely overweight and bloated, my kidneys would hurt after binge drinking from Friday night till Sunday night, it would fuck with my face(you know what I'm talking about.. Bloated and red, as if I had spent the weekend at the beach), gout, back pain, heart palpatations and the list goes on. On my one year anniversary, I called the doctor to take a physical, called my dentist for a deep clean, got my eye prescription done after years of using the same prescription. Without a doubt, alcohol has left a negative impact on my health, but fortunately it's stuff I can take care of by seeing my doctor and eating healthy and exercising.

&#x200B;

Not many people know how bad it was or how deep down the rabbit hole I had gone, but what's important is that I had people that cared about me and supported me during a time when I had little to no regard for myself. I'm lucky to be alive, let alone 1 year sober.

&#x200B;

Every day is day 1 for me, regardless of how long it's been since I've drank. Addiction loves us all equally. I can recall the feelings of guilt, shame, and defeat like they were yesterday. I drank to battle those feelings and the drink caused more of them, then those feelings starting snowballing out of control. And so did I. Alcohol started calling the shots and alcohol didn't care about me. It will never care about you either. It is trying to destroy you.

If you're reading this and struggling, I hope you know I care. Even if you don't, I do. I care about you and I want you to be well. You're more than worth it.

2020-04-29 18:51:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gajp2b/four_months_just_some_thoughts_from_my_longest/,Four Months! Just Some Thoughts from My Longest Run at Sobriety,"Today is my four month anniversary! I always found it helpful to hear other people’s recovery timelines, so here are some takeaways from mine. Everything is far from perfect, but it’s a hell of a lot better than it was 123 days ago!

- My anxiety levels are WAY down. A lot of my drinking stemmed from social anxiety, which turned into hangxiety, which turned into I-Need-A-Drink-Before-I-Get Anxiety. I was always very affected by seasonal depression, and typically March-April was when I had my most severe and highest number of panic attacks. I’m very happy to say I haven’t had a SINGLE panic attack since I quit drinking four months ago. After the initial couple weeks, my anxiety has been much more manageable. It’s still there, but drinking definitely made it worse, not better.

- My social life is not perfect. Quarantine has not helped this. I feel very alone a lot of the time, and I’ve realized a lot of what I thought were strong friendships were based mostly around getting together to drink. People who I thought would still talk or keep in touch during quarantine haven’t said a word to me, or if they have, it’s only been in the context of big drunk Zoom calls. 

- I can’t firmly call friendships a positive or negative. I’ve had to sit with a lot of negative feelings about people I thought were friends that were really just drinking buddies. It’s sort of likely mourning the loss of something you thought you had, but never did. I’m happy to see what friendships have persisted, and quarantine has made them crystal clear. I’m happy to have that clarity, even if I’m still a little bitter about it. I have a lot of rebuilding to do in terms of my social network, and some of it is hard to do when I’m physically not able to spend time with people. I take a lot of comfort in knowing the world will get back to some semblance of normal though, and that I have had time to make myself a healthier, better person and friend when that opportunity does come around.

- I haven’t lost any weight. I certainly would like to, and thought I would, but despite not going on some kind of sugar craze or really changing my other eating habits I’m pretty much even to where I started. It sucks and I’m not happy about it. I was getting on the yoga bandwagon when lockdowns started, but I have a hard time practicing at home no matter what video series I try to watch. I’m committing to a round of Whole 30 next month, and I’m hoping that will help!

- My skin is meh. I love seeing progress pics of others but my skin still looks like a teenage boy in puberty. It’s better than it was in January, but I think that’s largely due to being on prescription medication from my dermatologist, and it’s still not where I want it to be. Some things aren’t just alcohol; sometimes genetics plays a role and I’ve just gotta accept my face demons.

- Acne aside, I can see a difference in pictures. I saw a picture a couple weeks ago from Thanksgiving, where I was hungover as hell and throwing up every 30 minutes in between stirring things to help my parents with dinner. I had no light in my eyes, my face looked swollen... I’d like to see a lot more progress, but theres enough of a noticeable difference when I see pictures of myself now!

- Little things that would normally throw off my whole day seem trivial now. I misspoke on a conference call this morning (“otherwhere” is not a word. “Else where” is the phrase you were looking for) and normally I’d be worried that everyone caught on that I was hungover. Sorry bud, I’m not hungover, I’m just dumb sometimes and that’s okay!

- My husband still drinks and probably always will. I’m happier when he doesn’t, but I can’t make that decision for him. I’m hopeful that leading by example will curb his habits, and it has to some degree, but I also can’t control his decisions. We’ve had some good talks since my last post about not wanting to participate in big Zoom drink-fests, and he’s supportive of that. We’re still finding a balance, but I’m a lot further along in accepting that that will take some time.

- I’ve come up with some ideas for the first solid writing project I’ve not turned around and hated a few days later for the first time in a long time. Naturally I want to parallel some themes of what I’m experiencing in this whole journey, and I’m excited to see what writing looks like sober. I’m very used to having alcohol as part of my creative process, so it’s scary to think of doing it without it, but it will inevitably be much more productive time than writing a few whiskey fueled sentences and then switching to Netflix.

I wish I could say I was running marathons, had lost 30 pounds, and my whole life was perfect. It’s not, but it’s not realistic to hold an expectation that “just” not drinking will do that. I still have a long path ahead, and there’s a lot more self reflection to be done. But everything in my life in one way or another is better. I’d rather see false friendships than think a blurry mass of people are true friends. I’d rather know I’m not losing weight because I’m lazy than blame it on the wine. And I would much rather be scared of endeavors I’ve always wanted to pursue than numb the emotions that put power behind my work.

Thanks everyone for your support; I wouldn’t be here without this community and I’m grateful to each and every one of you!",30
2020-04-29 18:32:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gajcmj/the_cravings_are_strong_today/,The cravings are strong today....,"     I no longer want to be the man I used to be. I drank everyday for 16 years, I'm 32 now. That's half of my life. Due to this, I hardly know what it's like to be a sober adult. It's been extremely hard, it took me having to goto detox/rehab. I ""tried"" time and again to quit on my own but always ended up back at the corner store before the night ended. I've been sober for 36 days now and feel like there's a newer, different me trying to emerge. Unfortunately old habits are hard to break, especially ones that are so ingrained into my daily routine. A fifth of spiced rum before 5 o'clock, a few glasses of wine while at work, a beer or two while cleaning up the kitchen at the end of the night, and then a six pack of 12% alcohol (Double Dog) beers when I got home.
     For the majority of the time while I was drinking, I convinced myself that the reason I drank was because I wanted to be buried six feet deep. When my first daughter was born, I made the choice to ""try"" and quit drinking. I had a reason to be alive. Let's just say that even the birth of my first child couldn't pull me out of the frame of mind I had developed. I maybe lasted one day after we had gotten home from the hospital. As usual, I was back at the ABC store picking up my Capitan, ignoring what was important. 
     I lasted a while longer with my second daughter only because I was stuck in the hospital due to hurricane Florence. We spent three days locked up, no access outside, even to go smoke a cigarette. You best believe the moment I saw the gas station across the street was open, I walked on over and grabbed myself a six pack of the strongest beer they had and a pack of American Spirit Blacks. I selfishly spent my time drinking and being outside smoking rather than being with the newest member of my family or even the woman who just spent 22 hours pushing that new addition out of her body. 
     I've been a selfish asshole for too long. The things that led me to wanting to no longer be here on this planet are no longer a part of my daily life. Sure the thoughts of my past may resurface from time to time, but there isn't anything I can do about them at this point in my life other than learn from the mistakes I've made. I don't want to repeat the past 16 years. No more thinking everything is okay because I've numbed myself at the end of the day. The sad part is I never believed everything was okay, but I could fool myself into thinking it after a few drinks. Though it only lasted through the night, otherwise in the morning, I would wake up with thoughts of self loathing over how I handled the night before. Why drink to forget when the problem isn't going anywhere untill I face it head on. Ahh... The delusions I used to retain on a day to day basis. 
      The most important thing I need to remember is that all I can do is move forward with a new, positive attitude. Realizing that I put catching a buzz before my own children wasn't something I noticed until my wife broke the news that we were about to have a third child. I took the time to reflect over how we could possibly afford another son or daughter when we were barely passing by in our current situation. After some searching inwards and viewing my financial situation, I came to the conclusion that the instability in my financial (and personal) life was my own doing. I drank away every extra dime I had. It was a vicious cycle I found myself in. I would feel extremely down due to my financial predicament. In order make myself ""feel better"" or, more realistically, forget/drown the sorrows, I would go and buy more alcohol. The only outcome to that was more stress about my income and potentially forgetting why it was I was distraught that night. Ultimately when I awoke in the morning (if I was capable of functioning) all that would run through my mind is how I fucked up, how I needed to do better. Not just for my wife and children, but for me.  
     I've never really thought about my own well being in a positive manner. As long as I can remember, I've always thought negatively towards myself. Turning those thoughts around has been the biggest issue in my recovery. I always feel as if I fail at everything I try to accomplish. Rather I should say failed. As my mind becomes less clouded with thoughts of self-doubt, thoughts of how to make a positive change in my life seem to surface. Now I just need to get the hell out of my own way and apply this positivity to my day to day life.

I didn't give myself a time limit. Just see how far I could take it. I went 37 days. After the first couple weeks I felt really good. So good that I convinced myself I would be able to drink socially. Nope. It started slow, but eventually became a daily habit again. Especially after quarantine. 

I successfully made it three days this week, but last night I drank what felt like every alcohol under the sun. I got so hammered, I became the drunk jealous girlfriend in front of my boyfriends family. I made a damn fool of myself. Luckily they love me and I don't think I did unreperable damage. My boyfriend was pretty understanding this morning when I apologized and told him how embarrassed I am. 

Now I'm dealing with feelings of shame and guilt, but I'm going to use it to my advantage. I need to stop before I ruin my life.

Weird fatigue or anxiety that otherwise wouldn't be there? Craving sweets? Candida die-off could be saying hello to us sober folk, and it's something that should be looked into. NOT a serious condition!","Hi,

If you're like me, and not a doctor, you could be wondering what the hell's going on if you're experiencing weird symptoms.  I started experiencing symptoms shortly after I quit drinking and started exercising again.  Personally, I'm in good shape, blood panels came back really good, and otherwise very healthy.

To the meat and potatoes.

&#x200B;

Per [Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/candida-die-off) and basically other medical websites:

&#x200B;

>*Candida* die-off may cause symptoms of a yeast infection to  temporarily worsen, or it may even cause new symptoms, such as a fever  or stomach pain.  
>  
>Treatment of viruses, bacteria, and fungi such as candida can cause temporary inflammation in the body. Doctors call this the [Jarisch-Herxheimer phenomenon](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thao_Duy_Huynh/publication/305905364_Case_Report_of_Herxheimer_Reaction_after_Autologous_Peripheral_Blood_Stem_Cells_Infusion/links/57d38b9008ae5f03b48ce058/Case-Report-of-Herxheimer-Reaction-after-Autologous-Peripheral-Blood-Stem-Cells-Infusion.pdf), or a Herx reaction. *Candida* die-off is a type of Herx reaction.  
>  
>People who think they may have *Candida* die-off syndrome should be aware that other infections can mimic a yeast infection. What appears to be *Candida* die-off may actually be a different infection getting worse

&#x200B;

The gut and our inner biome is a strange thing.  Candida can plague our bodies.  It's not just on the outside, but the inside too.

It can cause these things:

* yeast infection symptoms, such as itching, burning, or pain, that temporarily get worse
* headaches
* skin reactions, such as flushing or a rash
* muscle pain
* anxiety
* hyperventilation
* low energy
* a sore throat

&#x200B;

To fasten the die-off, try these:

&#x200B;

* Drink more water
* Exercise
* Avoid ALL sugar until you know you're through it, even substitutes
* Avoid breads
* Avoid starchy veggies
* Take PROBIOTICS
* Avoid dairy
* And some other you can find by research :)
* Supplements like oregano oil, cinnamon bark, and some others

&#x200B;

Candida feeds on sugar and starches.  Our bodies are going through a lot when we quit drinking, and if you're like me and liked the sours, a lot of what you drank could've had living yeasts and bacterias in them that could've jumptstarted the candida, and the subsequent stopping drinking will probably cause the die-off, which may explain aaalll these symptoms.

So far, I've had unexplained anxiety that I've never experienced before, some headaches, seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp (I also shave my head), weird flushing on my scalp that may or not be sunburn, some weird muscle pain in my abs (not my liver!), and had a tinge of a sore throat as soon as my symptoms started.  I haven't went to the doctor yet because I otherwise FEEL great - but the cramps and the scalp crap definitely flare up anxiety which I DO NOT LIKE.  I've experienced these symptoms off and on, and I've noticed patterns over the last few weeks that make me wonder if I've been feeding the thing and am remaining stagnant.

Anyhow, I thought I'd share.  I hope this helps anyone with the same issues.",8

I fucking hate that panicked, anxious feeling of a craving. It feels like the split second when  you're driving and you see a massive truck about to hit you. 

I often give in to this craving, but I just realized that this feeling isn't just a craving, it's cognitive dissonance. It's the feeling of my subconscious wanting a drink and me consciously not wanting to drink. That realization made me feel so much better! For the past 2 years I've been thinking that feeling meant I must want to drink and if I want to drink then what's the point of trying not to? But no. I don't want to drink. My subconscious and brain want it because that's what they were trained to do.

 I imagine alcohol has dug a deep grave in my brain causing my brain to go on autopilot when  it sees it. Every time I get an urge to drink and don't, some brain dirt gets shoveled into that grave and one day it will be full. 

And yes, ""brain dirt"" is the best way I could explain this.",6

I was aware that i would have some sort of irritability from quitting cigarettes because it’s my 5th attempt quitting. No one told me anything about mood swings from quitting alcohol and drugs. 

For the first 30-50 days, my mood swings were worse than what they were when I was drinking. At least when I was drinking I could get some control over it. Drinking would always lead me to a rollercoaster of high ups and low low downs. I’ve never been the “angry drinker” type but I definitely caught myself in some manic weeks or deep depressions from my alcoholism.

At about day 90-100, during a pretty low day I was having, I had a realization about my emotions. My realization was that *this* is what sober emotions are. I had no chemicals influence making me sad. I wasn’t hung over or having withdrawals leading me to this sadness. This was pure-100%-fresh-from-the-brain-farm sadness and even when I was in a low spot that day, I found a silver lining. Sobriety has been helping me have emotions the way I should have always been having emotions. 

Even on a low sober day, it’s still better than my best drunk day.",6

2020-04-29 16:18:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gagt1j/rock_bottom/,Rock Bottom,"I know everyone's bottom is different. I'm pretty fuckin sure I hit mine last night. A pity party drinking and using cocaine lasted a couple days over an unceremonious breakup over a text, ending a somewhat brief dysfunctional relationship. And because I'm codependent this of course means my life is over. So my neighbor brings by a oxy to help me sleep off the coke comedown, I see he has a bag of clear. Me, drunk for days, feeling like an absolute husk decided today is the perfect day for me to relapse on crystal, and try free basing for the first time. Well, around 1am feeling sad and lonely and worthless, I decide to call a hooker. I dont even want sex, I just wanted someone to pay attention to me, cuddle me, hold me, just physical affection. I said as much to the nice lady when she showed up at my house at 5 am. 

This isnt even prostitution at this point and there should be a legitimate service you can call, I believe it is wholesome and necessary, but some people have to ruin it for the rest of us.

Anyway, I paid her 300us for an hour of her time, which is way too much, even for the girl in the photo. Which she was not. We talked, which was mostly her staring at her phone for 10 minutes, and then she tells me her jealous boyfriend is at my front door and I'm about to have a problem. No, I'm not. I will actually not share some of this, but long story short, she left with my donation, I did not get even get a hug.

As I layed sobbing on my bathroom floor, something clicked. This is the lowest I've ever been in my life. I have never felt so worthless, unlovable, like such a piece of shit. I'm disgusted with myself. And I know this road keeps fucking going. It's not going to get better, it's going to get worse, always worse, we're just in the first circle. Or, I can change, and this is my bottom. 

Idk what exactly happened in my brain, but the guys at AA said you'll know your bottom when you meet it, and people almost never successfully kick before they hit bottom. 

I've gone back to aa as a newcomer many times, for many reasons. And usually in my sobriety I held this view of this is a punishment, or an affliction, I'm cursed with the disease and sobriety is my shackle. I have to be sober or I'll die, or I'm scared to drink again... etc.

Today I feel different. I realized that my drug and alcohol abuse and codependent relationships come from a profound sense of inadequacy and self loathing. That unless I stop treating myself with contempt I'll never be happy, doomed to circle the drain until my inevitable suicide. And maybe, the first step towards learning how to love myself might just be NOT treating myself like I'm worthless. I wouldnt treat ANYONE else this way, nobody. But I'm perfectly fine with it because I legitimately hate myself more than anyone.

Nah fuck that, dude. I'm actually pretty cool, deserve happiness and love, other people think so, but I need to start acting like it. And deriving all of my happiness from a relationship with someone else is always going to leave me wrecked when that person leaves, which I almost always push them to do with my toxic behavior.

Tadaaaa!

I'm excited to go to the meeting tonight. I miss those guys. I know theyll be happy to see me! Im excited to build relationships with these people. When I was sobbing and close to the brink, these people I reached out to were there for me, with love and understanding and patience and support. Lots of it!

I reached out to several of my cokehead drinkin buddies. Literally told them, I hit rock bottom last night, I've never been so low in my life. I've got a serious problem with drugs and alcohol. And if I dont stop I'm gonna fuckin die. They were all 100% supportive, good for me. Eh if they actually feel that way or not fuck it. I finally feel like standing up for myself, and because of the support network I was able to build and reach out to, I dont think I'll have an issue cutting people the fuck out of my life like I should have done a long time ago.

Today I really thought about getting a drink because I’m working hard on a project but The universe works in mysterious ways because after I seen that I instantly googled online recovery and this came up.

Oh, no big deal about that rough day at work. I get to drink woo! Great time today. Woo! Drink & party. It was all a blur of positivity followed by frequent hangovers.

These days I am much more objective in how I interpret life events. If something is wrong I face it head on or decide it isn't worth thinking about as I cannot do anything about it. If something is right I truly enjoy it. And of course there is nuance and degrees of good and bad. I can experience a bad event and see the positive learning experience in it for example.

Life isn't boring like life with alcohol is boring. Killing my liver while doing my hobbies? Then I don't remember what I learn as well from said hobbies. How lame is that? How do I get to be a better human through that experience? No thanks.

As I shared on another post a few minutes ago, I started drinking to cope with social anxiety, then later general anxiety. I am at a point where I feel so much worse after I drink, there is truly no relief in drinking beyond the first 15-20 minutes after my first drink and in my sober periods I've found other ways to find relief for longer stretches.  I love to garden, run, cook, and spend time with my family and after I stop drinking there's time for all of those things in my life and I feel good.  Anxious at times, yes, but I can handle it.  

I relapsed recently, in part due to not knowing how to handle my anxiety around the pandemic and the changes in my day to day.  In fact, the day school closures and social distancing were first announced in my area was the first day I drank, a Saturday and my day 80.   Now at nearly 7 weeks later, I have been able to go a  few days to a week here and there but struggling to stay on track.  

I am recommitting to day 1 today, though, and I will do this, one day at a time.

I'm curious if anyone here would be interested in joining an AA Zoom meeting of SD'ers. I could set it up and get it started, I think that it might be kinda neat to connect with each other in a different recovery setting. I was thinking 8pm tonight CDT (Central time. Midwest is best.) 

No AA experience necessary. I can find someone to share their story, and then we'll go around the group and anyone who wants to comment on what the speaker shared, their own experiences with drinking and sobriety, or just where they're at today is welcome to share. (We don't comment on other people's comments in AA, but when people speak at a meeting, it's totally fine to comment on what the speaker said.) Anyone who just wants to listen is free to say that they'd just like to listen, that's always a valid option. And as with all AA meetings, there's no need to share your last name or any identifying information, and no one keeps track of who attends or anything, it's anonymous.

Any takers?

**Edited to add that the meeting has been scheduled and we have a speaker. I will send the Zoom login information to anyone who expresses an interest.",16

2020-04-29 09:27:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ga9ff3/one_year/,One year!!!,"Yesterday I celebrated one year sober. One year ago I made the choice to stop drinking and start addressing all the things I’d been drowning. 

Looking back, I realize the decision to do that came from a deep place of self-love, which was weird to me at the time, because I’d been so conditioned to beating myself up for so long. 

I beat myself up about not being able to have a baby and going through a brutal time with IVF and surgeries to do that. I drowned my feelings about past relationships and a marriage that looked great from the outside, but was fatally flawed in ways I didn’t even know about yet. I hyper-analyzed everything I’d “failed” at and created this internal narrative that I wasn’t *anything* enough yet. Wasn’t happy enough, successful enough, accessible enough, good enough, or worthy of anything that a voice inside me in rare moments of clarity kept shouting at me that I was. 

I stopped drinking and started to feel what I needed to. I examined some deep stuff I’d been avoiding *forever* and finally began to release it. I exercised, gardened, cried, cooked, read, listened to a million podcasts, went to therapy, cried some more, and started to settle into this new life I was building. And something began to shift.

I had really resigned myself to believing that I would never truly love myself, or be deserving of that love either. I played every negative thing people had ever said to me and I’d said to myself on an endless loop, and I was just done with it. Quitting drinking made me start to see the truth of things, and let go of destructive narratives I’d created.

Here are some things I’ve learned over the past year:

- You are not your worst thoughts. 
- You know what to do more than you think you do. Stop over-analyzing and listen to your gut. Don’t ignore the warning signs and the flare-ups you feel when you’re doing something that feels “off.”
- Your brain is a plastic organ. It can heal. 
- New patterns are uncomfortable because they’re unfamiliar. Keep working at it.
- Vulnerability is tough but necessary. So is honesty. Find the people you can be both those things with. 
- Control is an illusion. It’s a lack of trust.
- Progress, not perfection. 
- Power comes from acceptance.
- Everything begins with self-love. 
- It doesn’t matter how things look on the outside. What matters is the truth that you sit with in stillness, and whether or not you’re happy with what resonates. If you’re not, you can change it. I promise you can. 
- Just do the next right thing. 

Today, I am the healthiest, happiest and most complete that I’ve ever been. I’m present and grateful for so much. I’m kinder, softer, and more positive in general than I ever thought was possible. Quitting drinking is better than anything I’ve ever done. And I’m prouder of it too. It’s amazing what starts to happen once you get out of your own way. 

All this said, no one can do it alone. I am forever grateful to the many, many people in my life who love me and root for me every single day, including this incredible community, “the friendliest corner of the Internet.”

For anyone reading this and thinking “I could never do that,” believe me, you can.

It started after some weeks being sober with dreaming about getting bullied in school or other negative things I experienced in my life. In my dreams I often tried to change those experiences or tried to react differently to them. It felt like I got punished and had to experience those things again.

After some weeks those dreams disappeared and then it occured to me that my mind finally had a chance to cope with those events and come to terms with it. Since then I'm getting random nostalgic memory recalls or associations about the past before I started drinking. For example, I'm remembering exactly how it felt to play games on my super nintendo or simple things like asking my mother to read a book to me. It's such a bittersweet feeling and I'm very grateful that I'm feeling this way. I wish I had never touched a drop of alcohol. But maybe I wouldn't be as grateful for my life as I am today.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I finally found the strength to commit to sobriety at 24 years old and I’m happy to say that I am sober 14 and a half months! I never thought I would get this far and I look at myself every day in the mirror and I just can’t believe how far I’ve come! Not to say that I don’t have days where I struggle, but this has been the best decision I have made in my life, by far. 

My only hang up is that now that I’m comfortable disclosing my sobriety to people, I feel like I make myself the butt of the joke before anyone can beat me to it. I’m afraid someone will try to pressure me to drink, even though I know the people I surround myself with are so supportive and would never pressure me to do what I’m not comfortable with. I don’t want to miss out on weekend parties or get together a and I feel confident going completely sober, but at the end of the night, I sometimes regret my decision to go in the first place. 

My friends get drunk and tell me how bad they feel and that they’re embarrassed that they got so drunk, which, I’ve been there! We all have! It’s okay! I feel like I have reassure them that they’re fine, that at least they’re not as bad as I was. I don’t want to dismiss their emotions if they truly think they have a problem, I’m not one to judge, and I wish one day I can help someone the way I needed help years ago. I feel like that’s hardly the case for my friends as it’s pretty common for my friends to go out to bars or parties every weekend, but sometimes it just gets to be too much for me being the only sober friend.

I’m the type of person that wants to make other people feel comfortable and safe when they’re around me, so I believe that’s why I over share when my friends beating themselves up. After sharing stories of worse things I did when I drank as much or more than them, I feel like I have to spend time comforting myself after, reminding myself I am no longer that person. I don’t disclose super specific details, but I feel like I’m reliving them again and watching someone else act the way I did when I was drunk is sometimes hard for me to watch because it reminds me of how easy it is to lose control. 

I don’t want them to feel judged nor do I want to belittle their problems, but sometimes I get upset when they call themselves alcoholics when they drink too much at a bar or party. Not to be a gatekeeper of who qualifies to be an alcoholic, but I feel torn between telling them how bad it can really get, at the expense of disclosing personal details and reliving memories I’m ashamed of, or listening to them beat themselves up over one night or a couple of drunk texts. I wish I could help and be a supportive friend, but I’m not sure what is best for my sobriety or what is best for my friendships. 

TLDR; I, as a recovering alcoholic, don’t know how to comfort someone who has drank too much without reliving my past or belittling their feelings",2

This may be long. Also disordered, out of sequence and illogical.

I'm not having sweats, or nightmares, or major trouble sleeping. Really, minimal physical outcomes. That said, I'm also not feeling much better in the mornings yet.  At least I *knew* I could drive my child to where they needed to be. 

Now that's something I'm not proud of.

So why am I here, why am I doing this? I believe I drink too much. While I don't drink ""during the day"" it's not uncommon to start at 5pm. Pretty much every night baseline is 9+ standard drinks. Often spirits on the rocks.
Maybe following an entire bottle of red. Maybe starting out that way. I don't seem to be able to have just one.

I tried for a while having the alcohol stored in the hall closet and not the kitchen. The theory being if I have to go get it, it's an impedence. Except then I could take a sneaky mouthful. Or three. 

One of my fears is that I'm ruining my life and that of my family. Particularly in terms of relationship with my partner. Who definitely thinks o drink too much and too often. They never say anything to me any more about it though.

The thing is, I think my family is actually my biggest stressor. I have 2 elementary school age kids both with their very own additional needs, both needing entirely different styles and methods of parenting and coping. The 3rd child is too young for official diagnoses yet.

I always thought I'd be a good parent and it wouldn't be like this. Right now, and for the past several years, it's actually been a massive regret.


That's not to say my partner has it easy or is any less stressed or anxious or upset. My partner, in fairness, carries much of the load in terms of learning and developing how we handle our children, ways to help them. Also is just much better at implementing those things than I am.

I cop a lot of grief from my partner about my drinking and all of the above. I want to remove one of those things. Maybe it will help with the other things. I have not spoken with my partner about this yet. I'll have that conversation on Friday. 


I used to drink, sure, but not as often, not as much and maybe not just to numb myself. The early years where, imo, easier, even with late night feeds and all that. I probably drank less.

I'm most scared of the idea that this could be a coping mechanism to handle a scenario I otherwise would not be willing to handle.
Maybe it's just that I'm not a very good person rather than my drinking causing that.",0

Well, I resisted reaching for a bottle and wrote my first ever sober paper of my college career. I got an A!

I tried posting here, did a stint in AA (hated it), and continued to drink like crazy to cover my anxiety and hide from abuses that happened to me. 

This morning, I had too close of a call with suicidal thoughts (after about a 4 day bender) and went to hospital. I was terrified of the stigma and judgment and there was NONE. The people in the ER were fantastic, they listened to my story, and for the first time in my life, I didn’t lie about my drinking habits or history. My BP was 158/114. I was a mess and had to be in there alone because of COVID visiting restrictions. It gave me time to think as they were pumping me full of fluids and anti-anxiety meds. 

By some miracle, my liver enzymes are fine but I left there hydrated, supported, not judged, and a feeling of freedom. No more hiding. No more empties. 

I’ll be taking gabapentin for withdrawals, naltrexone, and I have a follow up outpatient appointments for mental health and addiction.

If anyone’s on the fence about getting help, I wanted to encourage you. It was probably one of the hardest things I’ve done to crawl into that ER, feeling like a shameful piece of crap. But the staff were wonderful and I feel like the experience was a game changer.

I'm so grateful I was given this past year to gain coping skills and better inner monologue.  My work has gone through massive lay offs in the passed months and this was before covid.  I  was scared for my job and really got put to the test!  Everything I wanted and hoped for from teenager to drunken father of three has been given to me.  I've earned it, I've fought for it, I loved for it, I waited for it, I created it, I received it.  It can all be taken away in a moment, but that's ok.  I'm new, confident and willing to conquer the next challenge.  My relationships are healing.  My wife and I are closer than ever.  I was able to be present for very large family events.  Not hungover, not drunk.... there, present and happy to be there.  I've witnessed some cringey moments from friends that had too much, seen someone lose their job for coping the wrong way...  I got to hear the unfiltered 'truth' from someone, just like I have done.   To anyone out there on the fence, take the leap to join us!  My results so far have blown my mind!

I wanted to post about a potential challenge and get some ideas for getting through it.

My husband is a non-drinker (strangely!) but he has a business making craft items that are often sold in circles of high-society type drinkers. He makes (out of wood - wood turning and he also makes furniture but that's a side note)

1) wine bottle stoppers

2) wine goblets out of wood

3) wooden whiskey glasses

4) cutting boards (for the cheese that obv goes with wine)

5) cutting tools, cheese knife, etc.

We are setting up a lot of content on his website and so today we came home with some materials for the photoshoot that is happening tomorrow including some bottles of wine.

So I asked him to really help me NOT drink the wine and of course he understands, but I'm asking for support from here too. 

One idea was just to pour it out after the photoshoot (in the morning) -  I was never a morning drinker so I wouldn't be tempted to drink it in the morning. 

Another idea - give it away to neighbors etc, as a gift (but it does require we open the bottles to put the bottle stoppers in for the photos.

Any other ideas what to do with the wine or motivation to NOT drink it? I think I'm good to say I don't really want to drink it. I don't want to be in the place I was in 6 weeks ago.",2

I’ve been dealing with a lot of health and withdrawal issues, so I haven’t been feeling good at all. Yet every single day, all he has done is nag, complain and make digs about the lack of sex/affection. He tries to pick a fight about it any chance he gets. 

I have tried numerous times to express how I’m feeling and I’ve asked him to please let me focus on healing my body, without being made to feel like absolute crap everyday. He keeps saying “ok I’ll stop, I’m sorry.” Yet he continues to do it everyday.

A very old and dear friend of mine is one year sober today. It means so much to me that he got sober. He sent me a photo of him holding a one year coin and I actually got teary-eyed. Some people cry at weddings, I cry at soberversaries.

He reached out to me last year when he was ready to get sober again. We'd both been off and on with sobriety for years, trying to quit periodically, and not being able to maintain long-term sobriety. He knew that I was sober, and he asked me for some tips.

Because I was sober and was working on my own sobriety I was able to tell him what I was doing, and how it was working for me. I'm so grateful that I was able to be there for him. He's been an important part of my life, and we've both struggle with our drinking. I'm so happy that he isn't suffering in the pain of active addiction anymore.

Anyway, I just wanted to share that with my SD community, since you've all been an important part of my journey too. What's been surprising to me about getting sober this time around is how much joy I get from seeing other people recover. It's really a blessing to be able to share this journey with others. 

I was so isolated in my drinking. Even when I was with other people I usually felt alone. In recovery I've found connection. And because I know the isolation, monotony, and hopelessness of being stuck in active addiction, I know what it means to step out into the light and heal and find recovery. I love seeing it. I love being a part of it. It's a miracle every time that someone gets sober, and miracles happen every day.

I'm glad that you're all here with me. Recovery is possible. There's no such thing as being too far gone, and there's no such thing as stopping too early. Sending you all hugs.

my hobby that I use to fill the time/ energy  that used to go to drinking is just playing with the stock market. not trying to brag, that has gone very well this week.

Was scary in the sense that it would be that easy to fail. The smallest lapse of attention, I'd just have to forget for a minute that I don't drink and it's in my nature, it's natural for me to be drinking.  My default mode was drinking.

I’ve been doing the best I have ever been in terms of sobriety. In the past month I had a small lose, but am very proud of myself that I recognized I didn’t really enjoy it and I didn’t spiral back into drinking. I had three beers one day, then one the next day or two. One doesn’t affect me much, but I now recognize I can’t stay at just one for long. Journaling a lot has been helping me remember how good I feel sober.

However this weekend was so tough. Again, I am very proud that I stayed strong and didn’t drink. But it is soooo hard sometimes. I have ADHD, anxiety, and depression, along with a chronic pain issue. This weekend I was quite depressed. I am on meds, doing pretty well with sobriety, in counseling, using healthy coping skills. But when I am doing all of these things and STILL feel like crap, it’s hard not to think, “If I feel like shit, why not drink?”

My logic brain knows that things would be worse if I start drinking again. But it’s so hard because while drinking didn’t make me feel good, it made me feel different and did allow an escape from myself.

Today is different and feels different. I can hear the temptation starting to crawl back. Today may not be easy. But, if I can make it through today that's a business week under my belt.

I’ve been struggling with my drinking habits and my relationship with alcohol for a while now. So basically, I’ve done periods of time with no alcohol and periods of times when I start drinking again.

The problem is, I use alcohol to cope. Even when I’m not *totally* overdoing it, I’m still have problematic behavior.

Like, about two weeks ago I had my first cocktail of the day at 10:32 am.

Today, I am 10 days sober. I am having a really, really hard time today. 

My therapist says on days like this when I use alcohol to cope, I have been training my brain for 10 years to think that’s that’s the only way to cope.

I’m trying urge surfing, but I’m being forced to come into the office half the time (my job prior to COVID was majority remote so I think they’re wanting to parent me to make sure I’m actually working, which is extremely frustrating)

Idk where I’m going with this. I am working through and ACA program right now and I know one of my triggers to drinking is when I’m feeling like I don’t have a choice if what to do (like being forced to come into the office)

I’m trying super hard to stay strong through this COVID thing and understand that this is all temporary.

As hard as it is to not drink, I know starting back will only be worse and I won’t be able to control it because I’m feeling stressed all the time.

I even say that as someone who has 6 months of sobriety under their belt. Life is scary and who wouldn't want to escape it? But the way you ""escape"" is not sustainable. You drink every single day. You drink in bed in the morning. Most of the time you drink by yourself so people don't see how bad it's gotten.  It's starting to take a toll on your body. You've also tried moderation, but that doesn't work for you either.  In November 2019, you will stop drinking entirely. 

Here are some beautiful things you will gain in sobriety:

1) You get an AMAZING night's sleep. Seriously. You sleep through the night and wake up feeling like you can take on the day. You don't go into work trying to hide your hangover. 

2) Turns out, you're actually pleasant to be around when you're sober! When you're socializing, you have this confidence because all your faculties aren't dulled by the fog of Drunk Brain. 

3) You have healthy skin! Don't get me wrong, you still have breakouts and acne, but you're not as dehydrated any more. Your liver is starting to forgive you. 

4) Sober You believes in Themselves. You did this on your own terms and for that, I am so endlessly proud of you. Keep up the good work and splurge on a mocktail.

1. Withdrawal and first week, how you lived it?
2. Boredom, this is probably my biggest challenge. It is easy to cook with wine and enjoy it while I am all the time around the house.

I was a party animal, plug and play.

I was also a disorganized, fat, lazy, addict; barely holding together a normal seeming life until that next drinking event. I was a happy drunk, endless laughs, jokes, and stories. I was a miserable humanbeing otherwise, a mean, irresponsible, irrational, selfish, slug.

And I didnt even know it.

In my view the alcohol machine is one of the real marvels of human history over the past hundred years.
The power of slick marketing, by an industry that literally sells addictive poison, for human intake. What a success story. 

But all of a sudden, my life couldn't continue as it was, panic attacks were becoming commonplace, relationships with wife and kids basically nonexistent. The only people who are happy to see me now are my bar furniture 'friends'. Even lifelong drinking buddies were looking at me now as the guy who was going to lead them down the wrong path. There was no one left to look at and say, ""well at least I'm not that guy"" . I was that guy.

Stop drinking, age 43. Apr 28, 2019.

Struggling day to day, but trying to see if there was any benefit to be had by abstinence, I doubt it, but let's see. I've tried slowing down, moderating, taking breaks, and everything else. 

Days then weeks, a month passes, this isnt how I want to live but its not so bad I guess, certainly the mornings were improving.

Somewhere between a month and 3 months pass, and this 'pink cloud' era arrives, this is the best I've ever felt! I look to pat myself on the back, I want to know how my body is healing and how while I hate not being party guy me, I must be doing myself some good by not drinking right!? I start reading everything I can find, I read about about the paths of others and seek confirmation that I'm so smart, and search for people to share with. I soon find reddit and usergroup 'stopdrinking' I'm fascinated to read all the stories and how so many people struggle with a heavy drinking lifestyle and how they achieve happiness without the booze, I still have my doubts as to whether this is any way to live. But any question I can ask is answered here, it's my new best friend.

Somewhere about 3 months into my sober year, someone mentions 'This Naked Mind' as a must read. Now my world is changed forever. Not only did my understanding of what was happening in these early moments increase and validate, but I gained tools to help set this new lifestyle in stone. I can't explain the impact reading this book had on my life. I allowed it to reprogram my thoughts about alcohol, what it is, and what it does. 

About 9 months in now and shaking my head at how many things I used to spend time on in order to manifest the next drinking event, daily seeking of a reason a call a congregation together so that I could get a dozen tall cans in, and it would be justified.

I had probably 8 or 12 avenues to groups or people that I would bounce between, making certain that I wouldn't miss a party, and I could categorize that as being super social. And if it ever happened that there were 2 or 3 parties on one Saturday, all the better. 

I didnt even realize that I had set this world up, and I had done a really good job of it, each group thought of me as their party guy, I believed they did anyway, never bothered to think about it, who has time for that, let's solve the worlds problems together over a few drinks.

Weekly now, at almost a year of sober, I'm still discovering new memories that illustrate to me just how deep I was into the tank. I said and did countless stupid things, with little regard for anyone else.

It seems a very introspective journey because it is, but the beauty of it, is that while all this internal renovation is happening; the outside forces, some of whom had may left you for dead, start to see the real you again, and they're pulling for you, they're ready see you ralley. I wrote here at about 6mos about how nice it felt to be relied on again, or that feeling of when a person is genuinely happy to see you, that feeling was almost foreign and when it returned... I well up thinking about it.

I find it so interesting how many outcomes and feelings are affected and changed positively by eliminating the alcohol.

My not drinking has a positive impact on me and my family, my friends, my work, my colleagues, and I assume it goes beyond that, the ego remains lol.

I am saddened by my blindness to how stuck I was in that revolving door, and reconciling it all is frustrating, but it's also like building a 5000 peice puzzle, at the start the only important thing is that you started, and you build and build, and the picture starts to come together.

I feel like that's about where I am, and there's no going back, thanks to this group and to Annie Grace, the back half of my life will be more positive, more real, and more enjoyable in more ways than I can even know. IWNDWYT",119

I'm stuck in my head and have this feeling that something is not right all the time since I quit drinking 3 months ago (!) . On some days I snap very easily or kind of feel crippled by anxiety. I'm looking for an escape from this feeling but it won't go away, sometimes not even when I'm asleep. 

I can't snap out of it. Sometimes I also get intrusive thoughts about drowning this feeling by drinking myself unconscious and this makes me feel concerned. I can't place this feeling and can't tell if it could be a persistent craving. Maybe my body misses the numbness that alcohol gave me or something.

Im looking for anyone who can relate to this. I'm so sick of it and afraid that it won't ever go away.",3

- Developed a habit of almost daily drinking (4 to 5 beers or a bottle of wine, something like that) almost every evening for the last 20 years (from some point in my 20s to my 40s currently)
and
- been dealing with depression I guess since my early childhood, ranging from moderate to absolutely brutal phases.

Now I'm at a point where I think I need to control/reduce my drinking, so I started taking days off for a while now (sometimes 1, sometimes 2) and I'm usually fine in the evening, but the next day it sends me into a brutal wave of depression, beyond my control, almost like a physical reaction. Then I usually have pizza and beer in the evening and the next day I'm, well, not fine, but much better.

So, I guess, my question is: Is this normal, is this withdrawal and what can I do about it?",3

Anyone else?,"I've been sober since the 1st of the year.  It hasn't been easy, and the tendency of most people around me to drink more during quarantine has been a trigger.  Several other triggers have also come up, and I've been learning what works for me.  But I had an interesting observation yesterday that made me wonder if things will get more difficult whenever we start returning to ""normal"".  My wife mentioned that one of her cousins has scheduled their wedding for August and we should definitely try to go.  This will be out of town and their family events are huge parties.  My instant reaction was massive anxiety that I honestly hadn't felt since prior to the shut down.  

As a big time introvert, I've always been a drinker in social situations to ease my anxiety.  The mere thought of being at an event, which I haven't had to realistically consider for many weeks, really hit me hard.  I've gotten pretty good at controlling my environment and planning for the triggers that come up.  While it's not easy, it has gotten easier over time.  It feels a lot more overwhelming to think of what it will be like as things open up.  

By the way, I have many doubts that there will be a large wedding in August.  So I'm not even particularly worried about that single event.  It was more about the instant reaction I had to the mere thought of it.  

I read so much about how much people are struggling with sobriety in the quarantine, and I definitely understand that.  I wonder if others have similar thoughts to mine, where it's maybe even more stressful to think about what's on the other side of it.",6

After a day of binging on Saturday, I am feeling much better today.  Woke up with no anxiety.  In the last five months, I have said this is going to be the last time so many times.  This month, I usually cave in after a week which is an improvement.  9 months ago, I delivered my son too early.  He lived a few days and then passed.  I tried the best I could to handle the grief, family issues and going back to work, but unfortunately turned to alcohol to cope.  I am furloughed now and have been really trying to stop.  I went to a few AA meetings, one in November, one in December and one in March.  It just isn't for me.  I dealt with a lot of guilt for my son's death, which I have been repeatedly assured is not my fault.  I even had a prenatal consult and it probably won't happen again.  I also started smoking cigarettes about four months ago.  Something I quit seven years ago.  I did a dumb thing and made a preconception fertility appointment for Mid-May thinking it would give me the motivation to quit drinking and smoking.  But I think the pressure was too much, the self-doubts crept in and I caved last Saturday.  I should probably cancel the appointment.  And use this gift of time to heal my body.  I am so glad I discovered this reddit group yesterday.  I am also going to read the Naked Mind and daily journal.  Life is so much better sober.

After I finished it I read, on recommendation from Julia Sweeney on Twitter, Geraldine Brooks's *Year of Wonders*, which is historical fiction about a plague-ravaged village in restoration era England. The villagers have decided, under leadership of their priest, to quarantine themselves because neighboring villages do not have the plague so they agree to do their part not to spread it. It was a pretty good read. Certainly relevant. Made me count my blessings at how much better medical practices are now than they were then and how much easier we have it in general here in modern times.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

If you're worried about hearing techniques you wish hadn't occurred to you, don't read this.\]

I get the sense that a lot of people who fail at staying sober end up giving in to their cravings at times of weakness. Maybe big stuff like a job loss, or maybe small stuff like a slightly-more-stressful-than-usual day at work.

I don't think that's been the case for me though. In my case it's just a plain habit — like, I hit the right set of circumstances and realize that I can get away with drinking. Not even that I wanted to in the first place, but just the fact that I *can* is a trigger. Like, I'm passing up some kind of opportunity if I don't. I'm not really having any major upsets, and even when I do, I'm not finding that as an excuse to go drink.

So it's not a coping mechanism for me, really — just a pure habit. Of course, once I've got the urge, the compulsion is pretty strong. Removing triggers is probably more effective than fighting the urges, but I can't really remove all the triggers.

So, I'll be having a perfectly fine day, but then my wife will step out of the house for like a 15-minute errand and suddenly that's my tiny sliver of time to go sneakily get hammered and try to hide it. Or, she goes to bed early and I can sneak out to stock up. Or, lately it's every single time I go shopping I can't seem to get out of there without picking up a bunch of booze, to then park and chug on the way home — and stuff the empties in the trunk, then rush home before the alcohol hits my bloodstream. My wife has commented that she thinks I go shopping too much… if only she knew.

Man, seeing that in print is pretty embarrassing.

I'm still trying to figure out what my plan of action is. For one thing, I should probably start doing my shopping in the mornings. But then there's those random moments of ""opportunity"" (that is, chances for me to incrementally kill myself over a period of years) that come up. Having zero alcohol on hand is a help there, but it only goes so far.

I'm still doggedly refusing to talk to my wife about drinking, to seek professional help, or to commit to just quitting entirely (more about why [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g58rbg/just_starting_out/)). I figure if I have alcohol once a week, and not more than one bottle of wine (or equivalent), that's fine — not that I can actually limit myself to that. Once the quarantine is lifted, and once our baby is born, routines are totally going to change and I'm not ready to even begin planning ahead for that. So for now I'm ""one day at a time""ing it for my pre-declared ""off"" days, and I'm not attempting to hide from my wife on my ""on"" days so that should be less of a temptation to go overboard. Part of me realizes that moderation like that is never going to actually cut it, and I'm eventually going to need to either get down to zero… but I think that's going to take more try-and-fail before I accept it.",3

I’m a beer guy and I went through the whole song and dance - man, wouldn’t it be so nice to have just a few beers. Really, only need one or two. I could stop after that. I could be normal. I deserve to be able to relax with a few drinks. It’s so great having a drink or two at dinner with friends. Mmmm, one Bloody Mary on a weekend morning. Beer at a baseball game! A few drinks during celebrations! Holy shit I’m missing out right now! I’m boring and life is boring and I am withholding the one thing that will make it enjoyable again...

As this is running on repeat in my head I’m remembering the headaches, horrible stomach, exhaustion, dehydration, regret, shame, and helplessness I experienced when drinking. And then I’m thinking, well that all happened because you drank too much. It would be fine if you just had one or two...

And that’s the thing. Of course it wouldn’t be one or two. It might be at first...but let’s get real - it will devolve. And if it didn’t...would I really enjoy having those one or two drinks? Or would I be constantly battling myself because fuck I want 6 or 8 or 10! 

Went so far as pursuing the local breweries websites to see what mix packs they have out right now. But I stayed put and ate some dinner and just...didn’t drink. 

I’m in bed and sober. Which is good. And I know I will be so thankful when I wake up tomorrow morning. But what an insidious thing it is. Almost two years sober and it really reared it’s ugly head today. I’m fighting in a way I haven’t had to in a while.",13

I hope the title makes sense. I don’t like to lose control or black out and never get hungover or embarrass myself. When I drink, I pour exactly 2 or 3 measured shots and stop at that point, when the warm and fuzzy feeling settles in

However my issue is on the days when I try to abstain drinking at all. Not having those few drinks starts driving me insane. I begin obsessing over it minute by minute as soon as 5 pm starts. 

Before the quarantine I had no problem abstaining a few nights a week, because I’d be busy with the gym, or visiting my mom, or eating out, or shopping, etc. Obviously all those activities are off the table for now. So, after a long day of working from home while simultaneously caring for my child and also exercising, having 2 drinks seems like the perfect entertainment/reward. 

I realize others in here recovered and broke their habit after being way further into the cycle than I am, but I am still worried. I shouldn’t feel this panicked and obsessive about skipping a few nights a week.  All I know is I don’t want to turn into my father who died before 50 from drug and alcohol addiction and spent most of his adult life jobless and in and out of prison. I don’t think I’d ever get to that point, but I need help learning to limit myself and be proud of myself for it, not feeling a sense of dread because I can’t drink on a particular night. Tonight was rough, I ALMOST caved multiple times, but I made it

Any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated",13

My sense of him is that he’s probably a little burned out. He does most of the talking and whilst he does give me helpful practical steps he doesn’t seem to listen to me. I was talking for a while about how I’m struggling and at the end I said “Im just worried about the cravings you know. Like tonight if I get cravings, what am I supposed to do?” He replied “Ok, so what’s the plan for for the next few days?” And I just thought wow, you really didn’t listen to what I just said. It was sort’ve invalidating. I’m also paying him for this, and it’s not cheap. It just kinda bothered me. 

I dunno why I’m posting here I guess I just wanted to talk about it if anyone has similar experiences or advice maybe?

Of course that never lasted, and I went back to hurting my best friend and the person that I planned to spend the rest of my life with. I repeatedly put my need for alcohol above her and her feelings. 

She is unsure if she will ever be able to trust me again, and I don't blame her. I have told her that I am committed to stop drinking. I will not break that commitment. I'm done being a liar.

 I just want her to experience the sober me who is no longer controlled by alcohol, and will always put her feeling first and treat her the way she deserves. It is painful to think that I may never get that chance. But even if she does not give me one more chance,as miserable as I do and will feel, I won't let alcohol take back control. I will not drink.",15

Today those feelings of “one day” were really strong. I’ve been dieting too and I’m down 16 lbs , and I was just so frustrated. The no drinking. The no eating what I wanted. I felt so wound up, so frustrated, hating myself, full of self pitty. So I said fuck it. 

I ate 4 slices of pizza, some goat curry, and a small bowl of tortilla chips. I AM SO FULL, and I cheated so bad on my diet... but I’m sober, and a lot of those frustrated feelings are gone. 

Usually I would wallow up in self pitty and white knuckle it.. but today, allowing myself to be kind to myself, not hating myself, and just working through the emotions and feeling what was going on with my mind and body has helped.

This is my half a dozenth or so day one. As I started typing this this morning, I was lying in my recliner with my fat cat on top of me because I can't really do much else. I had 16 shots of whiskey yesterday afternoon and evening. I woke up still drunk at some point in the night, later woke up to my alarm and immediately called in to work. I've been working from home since this pandemic started so it felt like a really weird thing to do but there is no way I could sit in front of a computer for 8 plus hours today. I haven't had a hangover like this in a long time. I forced myself to shower and eat at least some of the breakfast my husband made me. I had to think way too hard about swallowing each bite. I've got myself hydrated but was still blah and useless by 2.

I've been telling myself for a long time now that I need to and can just cut back on drinking. The longest I think I've gone without a drink for probably a year now is 4 days. Four. Days. And every other time was usually just one day. I'm 29 and at least once a week I'm like, ""I should at least stop drinking until my birthday (first week of July)"" but I can't even get through more than one day without something. I've had at least a bottle of wine every weekday and minimum 6-8 drinks on Fridays and Saturdays for months now. I maybe went one day per week without a drink.

From when I was 13-17, I'd go to my sister's house and get black out drunk every weekend. Usually both Friday and Saturday. Everyone including my mom knew it was happening but never said a word. After I turned 21, I did drink more but I always just had a few on the weekends. I never really saw drinking as an every day thing. Just a ""yay the week is over, let's have a couple!"" Now though, so much of my social life over the last 5 years or so involves drinking.

My husband drinks but is able to have a couple or a few then be good. If he's around while I'm drinking, he at least gets some water in me in between drinks. When I'm alone, which is most of the time, I usually forget water is an option after the first couple of drinks. I will have some random ""good days"" where I have say 3 or 4 doubles but drink equal amounts of water.

I really think my only option is to quit completely. I've tried to cut back many times. I've been somewhat successful here and there but that just means I only had most of a bottle of wine instead of the last glass.

I know that it isn't really the same but I was able to quit smoking fairly quickly after having smoked from ages 11 to I don't even know how old I was when I quit. 23 or 24? I quit cold turkey, had one maybe a handful of times over the next month or so then was done. I don't know if half a pack, maybe a couple more is considered that much. But I did it and I quit it. 

I want to say I can do this. Quit this. I'm ready to. I'm scared to. I guess I just need some accountability and support.

Today as I finish typing this, (I've been off and on),  I'm also finishing up day one. I know I'm going to deal with some anxiety, maybe cravings, sleeplessness, and who knows what else. I'm scared but I'm really ready this time. It's time.",8

I'm pooping solid again though, which is nice. Overall, I'm feeling better.

I originally wanted to make a post at my 2 year celebration, but life caught up quick and I wasn't able to get around to it. 
Most of us seem to have more time lately, so I'll take a few minutes to refect on the past 2+ years of my sobriety now. 

First off, like most of us, this was far from easy. I turned 31 this month,  been on this sub for quite some time, and I've tried for years to quit. My story doesn't change much from a lot of us, 30 days here, 2 weeks here, week days off weekends game on in and out of AA etc. 

My problem was while drinking, lead to other drugs of choice, it was a downward spiral. No matter what I tried, I could never seem to keep my choices in check once I started. 

Something clicked in me, this time I REALLY REALLY wanted the change. I wanted it more than I ever had. I think i realized that, the path I was living at the time, was going to end and quicker than I anticipated. That's not to say this has been easy, especially the beginning. 

The first month on after work on fridays, I'd drive up to my moms house, turn my phone off and just shut myself off for the weekend. I'd stay there until I had work monday morning, and leave early for work. This for me was a big change I had never done before, as when I was at my house I would constantly get phone calls or texts from people wanting to go out and drink or party whatever. After that month, spending weekends with my mom I started to feel more confident in myself, so I'd start to stay home on the weekends and keep myself busy. 

For me, my urges started to go away fairly quickly. I started putting work into myself, like reading self-help books and light forms of working out. This went on for the first 3-5 months. 

Around the 6-7 month mark, I think is when I hit a massive pit of depression. Things that have bothered me about myself for years and years, personal things, family things 20+ years of trying to hide certain things, I started realizing were never going to go away, drinking and partying was just my answer to mask these things for years. I ended up leaving my job, I turned my phone off, would hardly talk to anyone (including my family). My closest friends didn't hear from me for months. This went on for 3-4 months. 

Through this time period, I never picked up a drink, I can't say I ever really even had an urge, I think I was over it. Eventually, like something clicked inside of me before to stop drinking, something clicked inside of me again, to get up and move on, to continue working on myself and being a better person. 

Since this time, i've enrolled back in school, I've regained my social life, I really do feel better than I ever have. 

I guess my point to this is, for my recover journey, there was an important battle in the beginning, and then another imporant battle some months in that forced me to deal with issues that were causing me to drink in the first place. I know that life will continue throwing curve balls at us, but I feel like I've made it through a couple imporant steps that I never allowed myself to before. 

Anyways, if you're reading this I hope it helps, this is my first post here. I owe a lot of lurking to stories I've read here, so figured I'd take a little time and write something up to hopefully help encourage others to stick with this. 

Have a great day everyone.",21

Anyway hate. I don’t know if I drink because I hate myself or if I hate myself for drinking. Maybe both? I’m scared the self loathing and shame will never ever go away even if I stop drinking.

Thank you for all of the support you had given me on my initial post. I don’t think I would be here if it weren’t for that. The silver lining of how intense the withdrawal symptoms were is the fact that I am now scared silly. I NEVER want to withdrawal like that again.

It's been a minute since I last posted here. Going on 4 years sober, and last night, I found a new little discovery of myself. This discovery covers some personal characteristics of mine, and might not be completely relatable. However, I know my AA group from way-back-when would enjoy this.

&#x200B;

We had a celebration last night. With the whole quarantine thing going on here in the States, planning celebrations is more challenging. It was my wife's birthday, and I turned to buying her a small bottle of champagne. My motives were to make sure she had fun, knew this was a celebration, and it's the one time of the year she might drink.

She had fun! She downed a couple of glasses and was feeling warm and bubbly. And here I am, the drunkard, who is thinking **""If she can feel that great from one night, wouldn't it be more fun to do that again?!""** This whole post is in regard to that single question. 

I am left wondering many questions. What is the solace present in the meek celebration: Alcohol or my dedication to making the best of the day?  Am I a buffer in this time where alcohol sales are skyrocketing for my household? Are my decisions around drinking negatively effecting others like they have not before, **like a magnifying glass focusing the suns ray on a single ant instead of the sky shining on the whole field**. 

I believe that we are progressing through this quarantine successfully. And I do believe that promoting turning to alcohol for means of comfort and ""fun"" always lead to a negative outcome. So, here I sit, after a long solitude of being in the comfort zone, questioning my drinking habits, execution of words, and general life-choices. 

&#x200B;

I am going to continue not drinking, hoping my choices might help others through their own drinking habits. But I might begin to select my words with a little more thought.

Thanks for reading, and IWNDWYT.",4

2020-04-27 15:27:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g97ilx/day_7/,day 7,"Still... almost no one believes that I went through withdrawals from alcohol lol. I’m pretty sure most people think I’m lying to cover up a worse habit, which is ironic because I’m being as honest as I can possibly be. And revealing a part of myself I don’t want to. I could have just said, “I had the flu” and left it there. Like? what a weird lie that would be to concoct - sorry couldn’t make it I was having severe withdrawals from alcohol... gimme some credit, I could have come up with something that would have reflected better than that on me lmao. 

Honesty is not enough when people don’t wanna be confronted by the truth. 

And yeah, idc who you know or what has has happened you do NOT have to drink ALL DAY EVERY DAY for absolute YEARS to experience withdrawal. What it took for me was about a four day long bender and a week of drinking excessively at night, preempted by a year of drinking almost every day. 

So take me as a forewarning - I ticked off every. single. withdrawal symptom, including hallucinations. My brain sizzled like a frying pan. I was awake for 24 hours (and for the umpteenth time, no I did not do any cocaine, I don’t even like that shit) and got very little sleep over about four nights. I couldn’t eat for a couple days. I’m still getting night sweats. My pee was so yellow I thought it would never go back to normal, no matter how much water I drank. My body hurt to the touch, just soreness, everywhere. My hands shook. 

I was lucky I didn’t have a seizure (that was actually the only symptom i didn’t have). I needed a hospital (I’m in the USA and really couldn’t afford one, plus with COVID-19 going on I was worried about getting more sick).

Alcohol withdrawal is the scariest shit I’ve ever been through drug-related. And just FYI - alcohol abuse doesn’t look the same on everyone. Just remember that you never know what is actually going on with someone. No one ever suspected it would happen to me, including me; I’m 27, petite, bubbly, sharp and decent looking by most accounts. I can wear a hell of a mask. 

I have a lot of support. In fact, the owner of the golf club I worked at that kicked off my downward spiral last weekend just called me to check in. My coworker just texted me from the agency and asked if I left because of “that bitch Carol Baskin”. I talked to my best friend in NYC today. She’s been such a pillar for me since I was five years old. 

I feel very loved.

My husband and I drink together every single night. About 9 shots worth each. Two years ago his liver enzyme numbers were worrisome and he’s tried to make it all about food/diet. I wanted it be food too, bc I didn’t want to quit drinking. We’ve been drinking like this for about 10 years, aside from my pregnancies. It’s weird, my therapist asked me about not drinking while I was pregnant and how I did it then and I don’t really know. I guess I loved my babies more than drinking, so now I’m trying to learn to love myself more than alcohol. My husband thinks that life is just too boring and shitty and it’s depriving not to drink and make it a little more entertaining. Our life is actually close to perfect.

I've failed many times. I'm an alcoholic. I have done things drunk that I am not proud of. Quarentine has been tough because I know I can spend the next day at home and not at work. So why not get drunk? I drink when I'm bored. I'm bored a lot. I wont have to go in to work tomorrow with a hangover. But so far this is what is working for me and I hope I can give some ideas to help even one person get even just a day or two sober. 

1. Reading- takes up a lot of time. I look forward to it. Makes me a better person. I highly recommend Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. It's a fun fantasy book and took my mind off drinking. I just started reading the Stand by Stephen King.

2. Working out running- this is obvious. Keeps me busy and gives me a goal to work toward.

3. Meditating- I've been meditating 30 min a day. I listen to music on the calm app and turn off my brain. It's a beautiful peaceful escape. I hope to train my brain and get control over my thoughts. 

4. Quitzilla app- this has been huge! Seeing the counter has a serious mental impact for me. When I got the urge to drink a couple days ago I looked at my timer. I didnt want to reset it to zero and I beat my cravings.

5. Think about tomorrow- every morning o wake up I cant explain how happy I am that I didnt drink. I feel great! As I have heard on here ""you never regret not drinking"". This is so true and I think about this in the morning. I have also heard ""drinking today is just stealing happiness from tomorrow"". These quotes have helped me tremendously.

Again, I am no pro. I'm in no place to even give advice. I might even fail and drink later today (I hope not!). I'm trying hard and these things have helped me get to day 4. It's better than day 1. I hope this can help someone even get to day 2 and it will be worth it. Keep on fighting.",12

I had the world at my fingertips as a younger man. Perfect ACT score, top 1% of my class, wittiest and most likely to succeed superlatives from my HS peers, got into a great college.  Then I started drinking and smoking pot in college.  And because I was taking care of all of my outside stuff, I didn't see it as a problem. Even as all my peers seemingly phased out that portion of their lives rather quickly.  Kind of started to realize that all people are not created the same in terms of their propensity for chemical addiction.

I always had an ""all or nothing"" personality, and didn't have the foresight to realize that could be applied to negative parts of my life as well.  I fell into a deeply nihilistic depression when I graduated after not being able to get the job I thought ""I deserved"".  I think it had a lot to do with not really ever having failed at much, so when that first big one came, the next years were kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy of self-sabotage.  

And then it was a rapid cyclical downward spiral of depression>drink and smoke more to avoid that feeling>more depressed>drink and smoke into oblivion>eventual detox and ""getting my shit together"", only to fall down the rabbit hole again at the slightest inconvenience in my life.  

I tried to start a tech company a couple years ago on the crest of ""recovery"" after getting a little bit of seed funding through a competition.  For a couple years, I moderated my drinking and other habits to 1-2x a month and devoted everything to it. And after I put myself into a ton of debt because I couldn't let it go (and some things just don't work out), the all-or-nothing mentality started to only apply itself to the negative parts of my life.

For the last 18 months, I went from somebody who ate almost no sugar and lifted weights religiously 6 days a week, to a sad, depressive shadow of my former self who ate about 5 meals a week and took in more calories from beer (6-8 microbrews a night) on a given day.  And a lack of confidence in myself slowly morphed into a seething self-hatred where I thought I deserved every bad thing that happened to me.  The 'most likely to succeed' turned 26 year-old minimum wage bartender loser. 

On the 6th of April I saw an anniversary post of an old gym pic from 2 years ago and it gave me a panic attack about how rapidly I'm deteriorating my body and mind.  Basic Chad to Christian Bale in The Machinist in 24 short months.  And when the body and mind start to go, the spirit/soul follows. 

https://imgur.com/a/9JygRAG (maybe nsfw, boxers in one) 

That took only two years of treating my body like shit.

3 weeks ago after a legendary bender of drinking 15 IPAs a day and smoking a gram of oil a day for a week, and seeing that picture pop up, I decided to quit everything, and fucked it up a few days in because the physical withdrawal symptoms were too much.  I tried to stop nicotine/weed/90-120 drinks a week cold turkey and was miserable.  Sweats, chills, delirium tremens, vomiting, anxiety attacks, emotional breakdown at the drop of a hat, etc.  But where typically I would have used that as a reason to slowly get back to where I was, the self-hatred was so high it superseded the misery of detox.  

Now a few weeks off smoking pot, tapered down to 4 beers a day for a week, then 2 for a few days, to no drinking for the last 5.  I feel like shit still.  And the depression and anxiety are really bad.  But I kind of welcome the feeling now.  Feels like I'm kind of paying a penance for my shitty decision-making, which I think is going to help me.  Because I understand it is probably going to take quite a while for my brain to recover and to start producing it's own feel-good chemicals again.  And that's probably an important part of the conditioning process for me, because I know I never want to feel this way again, ever. After many failures, I think I finally understand I am not one of those people who can slowly re-integrate a joint with the lads every now and then, or a couple brews at the pub, because it always inevitably spirals out of control for me--I have to be teetotal from now on if this is going to work.

This community, and ones like it like r/leaves have helped a lot.  IWNDWYT and hopefully, ever again, because I can't handle the freedom of occasionally imbibing.

I now do yoga when I wake up, spend 5 minutes writing in a gratitude journal, take a shower, and get ready for the work day.

I’m on day 4 but this is not my first try. I stopped drinking for about 7 months last year, then slowly started up again. I’m not someone who drinks every day, but simply can’t stop once I start.

I live in NYC and my fiancé is an essential worker who has to leave the house every day. I’m able to work from home, for which I am grateful, though the future of my job is looking uncertain. I’ve had family members hospitalized due to covid. Like many people, I’ve been dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety.

Since the quarantine started, drinking was all I could think about and the only thing that made me feel “better.” I’ve been using the weekends as an excuse to get as drunk as possible, both out of boredom and to quiet the constant anxious chatter in my head. I woke up the other day, the morning after my 30th birthday, feeling like am absolute train wreck and knowing I need to reclaim my sobriety. 

While I know I feel better both physically and mentally when I’m not drinking, part of me has felt like I “deserved” to drink during this weird time. I get FOMO when I see someone on Instagram or on TV drinking. Everyone else is doing it, so why can’t I? My depression and anxiety already make me feel like a weirdo a lot of the time, and not drinking makes me feel like even more of an outsider. (I do realize that it’s the culture around drinking that *should* be considered abnormal, but unfortunately society has some catching up to do there.)

I’m getting back into my sober lit, podcasts, etc to help shift my mindset, but it’s something I struggle with. I just know that I don’t ever again want to wake up feeling suicidal after a night of drinking.

Thank you for listening. I won’t drink with you today.",10

I’d say my biggest challenges right now are 1) Staying in the moment and 2) Squashing all the fantasies around drinking. I have to tell myself all the time to just focus on getting through today and not worry how I’ll handle a potential future situation. (I keep finding myself fixating on “missing out” on the Christmas season of all things, which makes me realize my brain can’t exactly be trusted as the voice of reason right now.) 

For me, making it through these early days is taking a leap of faith that I can change and experience something new. I’ve seen all the shittiness drunk me is capable of. It’s boring and only ever gets worse. I have to believe there’s an alternate sober reality filled with non-shitty, maybe-even-kind-of-cool things I don’t even know I’m capable of yet. 

Anyway, thanks to everyone here fighting the good fight! (And to my brain, kindly fuck off with the Christmas shit. Last year you started drinking at 7AM and spent the day distracted and exhausted.)

Felt proud because I could have just two and stop but deep down I felt like a cheat. Went another couple of days then then weekend. Again- warm sunny weather house clean did my mega grocery shopping Friday night (sober so I felt like fuck yeah) got up early Saturday and did the rest (feeling super accomplished). House clean grocery’s put away had a seltzer in hand and then a family member came to work on my car. Brought me my favorite vodka. It sat for a hour or so while I finished making dinner and letting the night carry on. I kept wanting to put it up out of sight. Idk why I didn’t. Husband says you want a drink? I say yeah I’ll make one in a little...holding on to the little will power I have left. I knew I shouldn’t. But maybe just one...or two? Surely if I mix it I can drink it slower. First drink was a shot to “kick off” the night and a seltzer with a shot in it. Did that a couple more times annndddd a half a fifth later I woke up with no recollection of how I got to bed or what I had done prior to getting there. Last thing I remember was sitting by the bonfire. Work phone rang and I was 99.99% sure I was off but what if I wasn’t? What if I was scheduled and fucked up and was supposed to work today?

Out to the living room for coffee and trying to piece the night together without admitting to blacking out. That gig didn’t last but 5 minutes. Apparently my teenagers had gone to bed annoyed. My younger two though it was funny. I didn’t say or do anything terrible they just tried to put me to bed like 5x and I kept getting up and getting more water in different cups. I admitted that “maybe I had had a little too much”. 
The morning goes on as does the guilt trip. Wasn’t physically hung over but emotionally for sure. Embarrassed. This isn’t something new or scary for my family it “just happens” sometimes. 
It shouldn’t though :/ 
The day was actually pretty decent. We all lounged around and ate whatever we wanted and binged on Netflix. No one had to do chores or check if any lists.  My teens didn’t throw shade or ask questions. I was up before they got up and had made breakfast. I was ok. Back to normal. Look at me back to baseline mom kids- nothing to worry about I’ve got this. All swept under the rug. Way to handle those feelings 🤦🏽‍♀️

At this point it just feels similar to having a chest cold. Body aches are the same. I can hold food down now, and Im hydrated. My mind isn't racing as bad, and I slept pretty well last night. No night terrors. Still a bit of sweat, but no waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. Bloating is nearly gone. I feel good, I feel happy, and I feel proud of myself. I could probably have one drunk night and be fine. Just one and then be done for a couple more days... 

But no lol. I've done that, said that, tried that, and failed that too many times to believe it at this point. The thought is laughable to me really. Do I really think I can just go into that life for one night, and come out still motivated to get sober? Absolutely not. Plus why would I want to in the first place? I've come this far and I'm happy with it to be honest. The past couple days have been great! The days are longer, my weekend felt longer, and I honestly had more fun and got more accomplished. Today I'm not drinking, and I don't think I ever will again. I don't see the point in it anymore.",7
2020-04-27 09:58:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g916g3/one_year_under_my_belt/,One Year Under My Belt,"This lockdown situation hasn't been easy for me. Two weeks ago, [I posted here](https://redd.it/g0n4mk) because after a month, the monotonicity of the lockdown situation started to challenge my sobriety. Luckily, instead of victimizing myself, [I took responsibility for my situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g3g9ig/weekend_writing_coming_out_of_the_cocoon_my/fnvja0x/) and put some real effort into fixing what was bothering me.

Here are some of the things I've learned in the last year:

- I am ok as a person, just the way I am and shouldn't pretend to be different.
- Express what you want, like or dislike.
- Everybody has their own flaws and insecurities, and they're also ok the way
  they are.
- If someone does not like who you are, that's ok, move on.
- It's ok to quit your job if it makes you horribly miserable, even if you're
  3½ years into a 4 year PhD position.
- Put time and effort in your friendships.
- You can't change the past, so the best thing to do choose your actions in the present to maximally improve your current
  and future situations.

Most realizations came with the thought ""I could/should have figured this out a long time ago!"", but the last point kind of nullifies the negativity of that thought.
Two years ago, say, I looked at such statements as hollow platitudes[1], and not actually ways to live your life that will make it much more meaningful and happier.

Looking back, a year ago, it's like I was still in puberty, emotionally speaking (and I also felt that way back then). But this one year I've been making leaps of progress in maturing towards what's appropriate to as my physical age, late twenties.
My friendships have improved both in quality and quantity, and while I still have zero experience with romantic relationships, I did start to think that's something which could actually happen. When the lockdown is over, of course.

A year ago, I was too busy drinking heavily to avoid thinking about how shitty I thought my life was.
Only when the drinking got so out of hand that I decided to really quit, did I have no other choice than to feel my emotions and listen to what they told me.
In one year, I've learned to recognize when to put on my introspection cap and therefore, two weeks ago, I took action to stop a downwards spiral from emerging.
There's actually one more thing from which I tend to learn the biggest lessons:
> If you face your negative emotions and dig into them, instead of avoiding them. The fact that you're having them means that there is something to improve.

This sub definitely was a deciding factor for me to become and stay sober: Back when I quit, I had too much shame inside, and not enough courage to ask anyone for help. My first day I read a lot of stories here, which encouraged me to see that that long-term sobriety is a viable lifestyle. And later, writing comments and posts really helped me clarify many of my own thoughts and perspectives.

So thanks everybody, and let's go for another sober year together.

[1] The problem I still have with selling statements like that as ""advice"" is that if you already know what it means, you don't have to hear it. If you don't know what it means that single one sentence is too short to teach anything, I really had to reason through it.",7

After hell week and for the next 2 months give or take, I found myself with almost unlimited energy and drive to “do all the things” but in the last few weeks I’m finding it harder to get out of bed and sometimes hard to motivate myself to get things done. It feels like below average energy levels. Sleep is restless and my mood is ok, I just can’t seem to get my but in gear like at the beginning. It could be the bed I’m sleeping on and I plan to do something about that today.

I used to drink once or twice a week, but now, it is almost everyday. The problem is I can't stop after one or two drinks. I don't stop until the half bottle is empty or until I drink the all six pack or until I black out. I tried to tell my SO (who don't drink at all) a few months ago, but she didn't believe that I have a problem.

I do a lot of sport, and I know I'm ruining my progress with alcohol and increasing the injury risks. 

With the lock-down, I drink a lot more. That scares me. I tried to tell again to my SO yesterday when she asked me why I was refilling my glass... When I answered that I am probably an alcoholic, she asked me to tell her I was joking. Obviously I was not, and now I feel alone, because she don't understand.

I have posted a few times on here about not having my lease renewed by my old landlord right as the COVID pandemic hit. After many, MANY weeks of work and putting up with low key power abuse my Finacee and I are FINALLY done with the old place. We had our move out inspection yesterday and should be receiving our damage deposit this week.

I got sober pretty soon after getting the non-renewal notice and apart from one beer three weeks ago I have been dry (I had to know if I could have just one so I bought a single tallboy three weeks ago and brought it home. I had a sip and instantly wanted a second beer. I knew then I was one of the 'One is too many, two is not enough' people).

I have noticed a drastic change in my energy levels and my ability to cope with stress. I used to wake up with a feeling of despair about the day. I couldn't get myself out of bed in time, and I would be driving to work dreading the day and often plan my lie to take a sick day on the way there. I lied to my friends and family, I stole booze frequently from my Fiancee to feed my habit and was constantly a numb, exhausted shell.

But now I wake up and feel aware and engaged. I can handle those little moments of stress throughout the day and week with good grace and I have become a better partner for my Fiancee. I am starting to like myself again and that is a wonderful feeling.

I know I have a long, LONG way to go and lots to learn about myself but hey, I am a risk-taker! I always have been so why not take this risk and find out who I am sober? I might find out it's someone I like :)

I want to do everything and be good at it at the same time because I know I have this potential but I don't have the time to ever be as good as I want it at anything.

I remember why I started drinking so young now. I wanted to dumb down all this nonsense in my head and try to be a ""normal guy"". Well it worked. For a while. Then I was not normal anymore and juste ""the alcoholic dude"". 

But you know what ? Nobody's the ""normal guy/girls"". Everybody is unique and have its own challenges in life. I found mine. I will try to make peace with myself and accept the nonsensical mess for what it is : a creativity factory.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Sorry my bad english. I am 21 years old and I have been drinking routinely since I was 17. My father drinks and my grandmother also (she was a bar owner).  The two are not alcoholics.  But alcoholism manifested itself in me.  I can't drink socially or stop drinking if I take the first dose.  The normal is 6 to 7 cans of beer, and for a few days now, I have been alternating beers with doses of vodka or others.  I am imposing before alcohol.  Yesterday I left on a motorcycle, I was tremendously drunk and from taking so much risk increasing my speed and forcing my way between cars, I fell.  Material damage and also several injuries by the body. 

At my age it is difficult to stop.  All friends drink.  College parties are mostly “open bar”.  Girls drink and sex and conversations are more enjoyable (theoretically).  I like barbecue and watching football, so it's hard not to drink.

But I have no choice.  If I drink the first dose, I won't answer for me anymore.  The way will be to change my life.  I like to play sports and read.  

I've screamed in the street, had sex without any protection.  I already fell and smashed my face on the floor.  I've fought and cursed others.  I worried my family.  I already took other drugs while I was drunk (lucky I didn't addicted to cocaine).  I've spent money I didn't have and used other people's money to drink. 

Today my countdown begins.  24 hours is the goal (again, after failing so many others).  My record is 8 days. But I believe in higher power.  I believe in myself.  I wish everyone strength. Just for today.",8

At midnight it will be my 100th day.

I really didn’t think I’d ever get here in the beginning, then it got easier, and then I didn’t even think about it, and now I’ve been wanting to drink pretty often with the unknowns all around. I’m not going to sit here and celebrate with a bunch of exclamation marks and say how great I feel and how my life is so much better and everything I’ve accomplished. Do I feel better ?? Absolutely. In soooooo many ways. But now I’m beginning to learn that without blaming all of my problems on drinking, I am left with intense boredom, depression, and the most painful loneliness. I am learning that instead of drinking those feelings away, I can do other things. Literally that’s it. I also remind myself what else I am left with, which is clarity, peace, excitement, and the most hope i have had in a long time.
Nothing is all good or all bad. It just is, just like sobriety. I am choosing this path no matter how I feel.

However the physical issues the first five days were pretty brutal and unlike any other time I’ve gone without booze. My body and brain were extremely pissed at me. In hindsight I probably should have sought out medical guidance, but I didn’t, so all I can say is I never want to cause myself to feel that way again. It’s completely up to me, and I choose to do better for myself. I spend a lot of time here and I’m grateful for this community. I hope you will join me in not drinking today!",7
2020-04-26 22:38:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g8s0z3/acts_of_kindness_aok_monday_keeping_my_side_of/,"Acts of Kindness (AoK) Monday: Keeping my side of the street clean, literally.","Hi everyone!

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK we’ve experienced over the past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

My AoK this week is something that a mature, reasonable adult would’ve done without even thinking, but it was something that took a little bit of thought and effort from me, so I think it counts.

I recently bought a house that’s a fixer-upper. The house was unoccupied for about a year, and when the snow melted it revealed piles and piles of dead leaves from two neighboring oak trees. Under the bushes, between plants, all over the yard, jammed in awkward places next to fences, just piles of dead wet leaves, everywhere. 

I’ve been raking them up slowly, but the weather hasn’t been cooperating, I’ve got other things to work on with the house that are bigger priorities, and it’s just slow, boring work. There were three child sized rakes left in the garage by the previous owners, and I soon found out why they were there, because there’s a lot of awkward spaces for leaves to get stuck in. But I’ve been raking up a couple of large black garbage bags of them at a time, and I’m getting there.

Today I was out in my yard doing something else and one of my neighbors said “hi” from across the alley and pointedly asked me if I was going to rake up the leaves along the edge of my yard, next to the alley. My first impulse was to get defensive and take offense. But I told him that I was working on it and that I would take care of it.

Now, the old me would have stewed about this guy - *”The nerve! Doesn’t he see how much I’ve got to do? Doesn’t he know that there’s a plague on? I’m not the one who didn’t rake last fall, I can’t help it if the previous owners left it like this.”* And I would have passive aggressively left the leaves there for quite a while, because he can’t tell me what to do.

In sobriety, I’m learning that I can choose to take into account how my actions affect other people. I looked at his yard, which he and his wife immaculately maintain, and I realized that these are my leaves now, and they are no doubt blowing into his yard. So, when I was done with what I was working on, instead of moving on to the next project that I wanted to do, I raked up four big black garbage bags of leaves from that side of the house. 

When I was finishing up, he and his wife came out into the yard to talk to me, and they were delighted to see that I had cleaned up all of the leaves. It made me really glad that I had taken into account how things that were under my control were affecting them, instead of feeling intruded upon and ordered around. I took care of what I needed to take care of because it was affecting them, and now I have a better relationship with my neighbors, and they don’t have to deal with raking up my dead leaves when they blow into their yard. It was the reasonable and grown-up thing to do, but it took me a moment to get there.

Anyway, that’s me for this week, sobernauts. How’s everyone else doing, any AoK that you’d like to share?",35

2020-04-26 22:14:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g8ro72/my_ex_passed_away_last_night/,My Ex Passed Away Last Night,"I found out earlier today that an ex boyfriend of mine passed away last night. Apparently he had been sick for a week or so before it finally happened. From what I’ve been told, his liver had enough and shut down after years of abuse. I can’t say it’s a surprise, but it was still unexpected.

During the brief period of time we were together, we did little else apart from drink and party. Between shots of schnapps, cocktails, and cheap beer, there was hardly any time when we weren’t lit. When he was sober, he could be a kind, funny, and sensitive man. But when he drank, he drank with a fury and it brought out the demon in him. He sought out drama with a passion and if he couldn’t find any he would make it. Fights with drag queens, soccer moms, and bartenders were not uncommon and so many parties ended with him screaming at people for any perceived slight. It was after one such outburst that I finally walked away from the relationship.

He moved to Colorado years ago and we lost touch for nearly a decade. He had just kind of disappeared into the mountains in a haze alcohol and weed. We reconnected a few years ago through Facebook and exchanged the usual pleasantries. It was nice to hear from him but it also pained me to see he hadn’t changed. I finally had to block him when he began sending angry, drunk messages to my current boyfriend. That was the last I had heard about him until today.

Honestly, I’m not really sure how to feel about this situation. On the one hand, I feel sad about his passing. He had his demons, but at least he’s at peace now. But it also feels like a part of my history died with him. He was a part of a very dark period of time for me filled with binge drinking, endless drunken drama, and a general downward spiral in still working my way out of years later. I guess I feel conflicted because I tried to turn my life around, leave the alcohol behind, and begin to build a brighter future with my current boyfriend while he continued down the same path of partying from when we were together all those years ago and it cost him everything. I just wished there was something I could have done to help him, but I know there isn’t. He probably would have just pulled down his sunglasses and called me a silly cunt.

I hope all of you let those close to you know how much they mean to you. And to you my old friend, I’ll have a seltzer in your memory. I hope you found some peace at last.

I have tentatively tried to stop drinking at least a hundred times. This sub is very helpful. When I start trying to convince myself to drink, I can come here and read about other people’s experiences and know I’m not alone. I have my badge punched in so it holds me accountable, I want to be one of the people with a long ass number. With 200k followers it is a very real reminder that so many people know what I’m going through, and no matter what time it is or where I am, I can pull out my phone and someone will be there. To offer advice or encouragement, or just to listen. Knowing I can write out what I’m feeling if I feel overwhelmed or out of control, and be heard by other human beings who want to live better lives and help each other provides a strength and comfort I wish I had given myself access to through my many previous attempts to get clean.

I have dealt with my urges much more quickly and efficiently by actively participating in this community, but I’m still afraid sometimes. I work hard labor for long hours, and despite being young, strong, and otherwise healthy, I suffer from chronic pain. I’ll spare you the gruesome details but it is less the severity and more the distressing nature, and the inability of doctors to diagnose it that causes me turmoil. Turning to the bottle at the end of a long day used to be the only thing that can ease the pain, and take my mind off this shit. In my opinion that is the biggest risk to my sobriety at this point. It can be really disheartening to work an 8+ hour day and come home knowing I have over an hour of painful stretches, PT, icing, and healthy food preparation ahead of me. It sometimes leaves me bitter, feeling that I have no time for myself. On the harder days it feels as if I don’t even know who I am, that my life is nothing but work and obligation. The effortless escape of mental anesthesia can seem like a beautiful reprieve, even if only for a couple hours.

BUT, I know it solves nothing, and in all likelihood is only making all of these problems I want relief from worse. I know that my life is more enjoyable, my mind more free, and my soul more joyous when I am sober. I have experienced that truth, and in spite of my brain’s best effort to trick me into taking that quick fix, I will not drink with you today. I apologize for the paragraph of whining but it’s been on my mind and figured I’d best get it out rather than let it fester.

I’ve been practicing mindfulness and passive meditation for about a year now. It has helped me work through my depressive tendencies and negative thought patterns in a truly astounding way. I have been applying what I’ve learned more than ever in the last week. It can be a little exhausting at times, but I fully believe that every moment you have to consciously choose a positive attitude and be unflinching/indifferent to the despondent and intrusive thoughts and emotions. I hope maintaining this practice gets easier and with any luck it will become automatic . These disciplines along with the support and accountability this group provides, I am very hopeful for an alcohol free future. I am grateful to have made it one week, for all of you, to have a job, a few good friends, family. I am grateful to be reliable and trustworthy, someone you can count on. And I cannot be that person and be drunk. Apologies for the word vomit and the long, meandering, aimless post. Have a good night everyone, I look forward to being sober with you tomorrow.",13

After I cleaned the house and cooked dinner, but before eating, I had a few. 

I ate dinner, cleaned up everything from dinner, and got into bed a little bit later. Instead of leaving everything a mess because of how much I drank I actually cleaned. The kitchen looks awesome. Dinner tasted good and I didn't stuff myself like normal. 

The big thing here for me is that when I got into bed I felt pretty sober. I remember laying there worried about it. I've been so worried about not being able to fall asleep sober. Last night I did it drinking substantially less than normal and not really feeling anything when I laid down. 

This is huge for me. I was so concerned about not being able to fall asleep. Like I NEEDED alcohol to fall asleep. Last night I didnt want to have anything to drink.

There's a reason that's not necessarily my willpower, but I'll take it! I genuinely do not want to drink. Had no desire to today, and don't want to ever again.  

Friday was my first day, and it ended with cold sweats, no sleep, and some fairly intense chest pains and anxiety (possibly related). And one point that day I sat at my desk as my heart raced, and so did my mind. It was terrible, terrifying, and unforgettable. So much that I made an over the phone appointment with my doctor. I'm following up with him tomorrow. 

Good news is, I feel way better tonight. No cold sweats last night, chest still slightly hurting. But right now, no pain at all. Or at least none I'm perceiving. I think sitting at my desk that day scared me sober, or at least I hope so. 

I even got the motivation to do ten minutes of excercise today. I know it's small, but it felt fun. I'll probably be sore tomorrow but that's just how out of shape I am lol.

I feel like I've wasted a majority of my 20's boozing and wasting time. Were there good times? Sure. But there was also some of the most embarrassing, unhealthy, dark, anxious times of my life as well. What I've noticed with alcohol is that if I give it a inch, it takes a mile. If I tell myself I'm just going to have 2 or 3 beers every couple of days, next thing I know I'm drinking between 6 or 7 every other night. I used to drink much, much, more.

Have been drinking to excess since I started college; it used to be blacking out at parties, then progressed throughout my twenties to getting hammered at home alone the days I wasn't out, to the point that I had to stop keeping alcohol in the house by 30. 

Now I'm in my early 30s, had to quit my job last summer due to depression, just got back into things with a new opportunity and now I'm laid off due to covid. The only setting I can control my drinking in is at dinner at a restaurant, I seem to be able to have a drink or two and settle for that; other than that, once I start, I'm going until I black out. I have to buy pint bottles of vodka or tequila when I drink at home to try to control myself volume-wise. I remember maybe eight years ago I was apartment-hunting and the broker showed me a place that had just hit the market and there was a trash can still in it, filled with empty pint liquor bottles...I remember being an asshole and texting a friend, ""...and it was full of those sadness-sized booze bottles. Grow up and buy a handle, please."" And now I'm that person. I love the buzz but my hangovers are getting darker and darker. Two or three days of thinking I'd be better off dead etc. I went to Whole Foods on Friday for a big grocery re-stock and bought beer, trying to slow myself down by avoiding liquor--I drank the whole six-pack and went out, drunk, to buy more booze. I know I had my mask, but did I remember gloves? Who knows! Sent like ten of my friends mortifying shitfaced texts. I've actually been pretty good in quarantine, had one three-week sober stretch, then a one-week, then the next two weeks until today, and have lost 10+ pounds, but worried I'm going to lose all my progress (aside from the booze itself, I \*always\* binge eat while drunk).

This is day two of my journey into sobriety and I wanted to post here for accountability and to make connections with other folks in the same boat. 

I'm tired of drinking ruining my relationships, friendships, and body. I'm tired of the mental fog and the apathy. I'm tired of always trying to figure out when I can drink next, how much I can drink without drawing attention to myself, and not being able to keep alcohol in the house because I will drink all of it. 

Drinking has led me to become a habitual cocaine user, to the point where I had to sneak off to the bathroom during work (I bartend...more on that later) to get through a shift. I started smoking cigarettes because I liked the social camaraderie and then eventually, just the habit of smoking. I was in an an emotionally abusive relationship that turned physically abusive. None of these situations are ones that I EVER pictured myself being in, and alcohol is at the root of all of it. 

Blacking out and making a fool of myself is a thing of the past. Sometimes the guilt and shame of blacking out keeps me up at night because I wonder what I said or did and I always assume it was the worst possible thing. I want a life full of rich memories, not a patchy collection of messy moments. 

I've made questionable and dangerous decisions while drunk. My low self-esteem and compromised state has lead me to sexual situations that sadden me in retrospect. I want good, sober, memorable sex! Also, I'm tired of sleeping with all of my male friends just because they're available to me when I'm drunk, thus tarnishing the relationship. 

Physically, I'm sick of the bloating and weight gain. I don't work out when I'm hungover or when I'm drinking, I'm a bump on a log who eats terribly. I've had hangovers that lasted two days, which is appalling and terrifying. I'm 23 and I know I've done lasting damage to my body, and I hope I can rebuild my relationship with it. 

I'm out of work because I bartend in fine dining and our restaurant has been closed for over a month now. This will really help me during the first few weeks, as there is no temptation to go to bars after work, take shots at work, or justify drinking by saying that I am sampling the new beer and wine options. Alcoholism and mental health are two BIG issues in the bartending realm and hospitality industry overall. I want to solidify my sobriety before returning to work, if I return to work there at all (I love my restaurant, they're like a family, I just don't want to bartend forever and have concerns about the culture).

I want to enrich myself and actually have hobbies.  I used to read a lot. I want to start making my own backpacking gear, and getting back into writing. Booze was such a time sink.

I'm going to take all of the money I would be spending on booze, cigarettes, and drugs and buy a beautiful, top of the line piece of gear for backpacking. I stare at the price tag and think that it is SO expensive ($400), but in reality, I easily spend that much in a few weeks on everything I listed, and those things actively KILL me while the quilt will help me do one of my favorite things in the world.

Anyways, sorry about the wall of text. Writing all of this down has really affirmed that I am making a good choice.",9

Hey everyone, I’m a 26 year old female and have been trying to quit drinking for quite a bit but it’s just become such a part of my routine. Picked up the habit in college, way worse back then as I used to have 3-4 shots of rum a night without giving it a second thought mixed in with bouts of day drinking...Then I started taking a good look at my nutrition and started to exercise and cut it down. As I started working a job, nothing made me feel better than a can of seltzer and a shot of rum at the end of the day. 
Of course it grew to more than a shot, so I cut back again to only a can of seltzer. Mmm not buzzed enough, so maybe just half a shot. Hah only buzzed for half an hour, MORE SELTZER! 
As quarantine took effect, my anxiety has been worse. One evening as I was having another panic attack, my husband innocently mentioned “maybe you need a shot” as he handed me one, and I immediately felt better. I hated it, but I loved to not be so anxious.
So here I am again, knowing I need to cut back but just can’t because it has helped me in this situation. I don’t day drink EVER, eat extremely healthy, workout but yes I drink to feel better, and I hate feeling that I am dependent on it. 
Anyone have experiences with feeling this dependence? And how did you break it off?",2

My first one, I actually went with a friend who was visiting me and had been sober for about a month. He has done crazy things and been arrested/almost died while drinking, so I really supported him going and joined with him. I am a big drinker. However, I don’t do things that would cause me to lose family/friends or get in trouble at work or with the law.

The reason I stopped drinking during the quarantine was part due to the inconvenience of going out to get alcohol and part because I want to be healthier in case I get the virus. I’m only in my late-twenties, but I am overweight, always have been. My second meeting was a zoom meeting yesterday my friend invited me to. I only caught the end so I joined another meeting today. I joined a full meeting and I heard the stories. 

But I don’t identify so much with the need for drinking. I don’t know if it’s because I have a short memory or what, but I feel like I could easily start drinking next time I see friends and do it in moderation. Is it normal to feel this way?",5

Day one.,"I know that my drinking has been getting worse lately. Quarantine is such an easy excuse - I work from home, but I set my own schedule, so of course I can sleep in and wake up hungover every damn morning. And I always wait until 5:00 to start, so it can't be that bad, right?

I didn't realize just how bad it was until last night. My fiance is an essential worker and goes to bed very early, so I stay up and keep drinking. But yesterday I did something new - when I bought my daily booze, I hid some of it so that he wouldn't know how much I had consumed. I tucked a small bottle away behind some stuff on top of the fridge, and pulled it out later after he'd gone to bed.

I'm absolutely horrified by this. Even as I did it, I remember having this thought of shock - what was I doing? This wasn't me. I'm not the sort of person who hides things from my fiance - I love him dearly and am always honest with him. But now I'm hiding my booze from him so I can, what, stay up late drunkenly staring at the television, eating garbage and feeling like shit the next morning? What is the point? Why am I like this? How did I get to this point, this low?

I woke up this morning (hungover, of course), berated myself for a while. My fiance messaged me that he thinks we should stop drinking so much together - he didn't know about the hidden booze, but his consumption has increased too because of all of the stress from work. I'm so relieved. We're going to try and help each other.

So I made a new reddit account, logged on to here, and posted this. It's my day one, and IWNDWYT.  I've got a fridge full of seltzer water thanks to some other posts I've read on here. If anyone has any advice or suggestions for the early days of quitting, I'd love to hear them.",94

2020-04-26 14:53:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g8k0xu/article_on_cocktail_hour_to_relieve_covid19_stress/,Article on cocktail hour to relieve Covid-19 stress,"Read the NYT article “Why Cocktail Hour is Back” today since it appeared in my weekend briefing newsletter and it made me uneasy. 

The author ends saying “perhaps some during this period will develop bad habits that require their own cures. I hope that is not the case” which comes across as a bit disingenuous given (1) the whole article before it, and (2) that I’m sure all of us can tell scrolling through Facebook that is it *certainly* the case. 

The article as a whole isn’t as bad as the subtitle (“We need the ritual. We have the time. And during lockdown, it’s 5 o’clock everywhere.”) so maybe I started predisposed to disprove of the rest of it. 

The author also says liquor stores have been deemed essential just to keep available a way to unwind for people, but doesn’t mention that multiple governors have said it’s at least in part to make sure people don’t start getting withdraw symptoms and filling hospitals. 

It just on the whole seemed a bit irresponsible, like the author could have also said that other things besides booze can be used as a ritual to unwind or mark the end of the day and beginning of the evening. 

The times also ran an opinion piece, maybe 2 years ago, about how drinking in the US has drastically increased over the last few decades. 

Didn’t want to make a nytimes account just to rant in the comments so I decided to write this here instead. Maybe get some feedback on if I’m being overly sensitive to this kind of stuff now.

Edit: I also want to add that while the article isn’t encouraging drinking to get drunk, it’s more worrying to me that it’s setting up “one drink a day” as a ritual specifically to deal with stress and/or to foster bonding with other humans. Even if people do cocktail hour responsibly and stick to one drink a day, it seems like a bad association to implant in your brain.

One of the comments on the actual article, which I thought made a good point, said something along the lines of people associate bonding with cocktail hour when really they’re associating feeling good with dopamine. It would be nice if the article had taken the tack of “having a dedicated time to connect with your family and transition from day to evening” rather than making it all about booze. Like making fancy appetizers could easily take the place of making fancy drinks and you still have your ritual and your bonding, but you know it’s real bonding and not dopamine, and you don’t come out accidentally having an alcohol dependency.",13

Wanted to fill the empty space with something, instead of nothing—to feel anything intensely. (not a new pattern for me)

Using/doing will feel intensely euphoric for a short time, and it will ALWAYS be an option. Pleasure is pleasure, it can't be intellectualized away. 

I felt hopeless, I could not see an alternate path. The only way to make the intense cravings disappear the other day was to give in to them. Which *sort of* worked. 

Now I'm struggling with the fact that the *clock has merely been reset*. The desire quelled, but it is just winding back up until life get's intolerably \[insert negative emotion here\] again.

It’s the feeling where you remember yesterday or the day before and feel ashamed for having done something that wouldn’t/shouldn’t elicit feelings of guilt and shame. I have my own list of things like this: Taking selfies, posting on social media, commenting on a sub, letting loose creatively, reading tarot cards not doing the dishes right after cooking, etc. it seems to hit me most with the creative stuff, I believe this is due to the fact that all of my creating in the past was done with alcohol involved. Like a sense memory of being drunk. It makes me feel sad to learn that I hadn’t really given myself the sobriety and clarity in a creative space, I had never taught myself to express myself outside of drinking. 

What are your experiences with this? I find that I have to actively hunt down the root of the shameful feeling, identify whether it was something that I should be ashamed of, then remind myself that nothing I’ve done is shameful and only then does my anxiety assuage itself.

It didn't matter, I worked with contractors that would start drinking at 7 am. And I have always enjoyed drinking so I joined. 

As it continued on my ex at the time liked to invited me over just the two of us with a bottle and board games. That almost became the daily norm. Wake up, drink all day at work, maybe throw some Kahlua in the coffee. Come home, and drink all night. 

I stopped working out, was showing up to college classes drunk, and stopped caring about everything. Not surprisingly, the ex broke it off with me. Blessing in disguise looking through 20/20 hindsight, but I began drinking even more out of the emotional response. Buy a fifth on my way home, drink three quarters of it, top it off in the morning on my way to work and grab a new one on the way home. This blew up. Drinking more often, and more liquor. 

Cut to about two years later. I have a new girlfriend. She called me on my bullshit. I was not following through with promises, sleeping through dates. And that was when I finally realized and admitted to myself this wasn't just self-medication or fun. This is real. I had a night where I couldn't switch it off. I came home at 4 am after ending up being dropped off at a house I haven't lived in for 15 years. 

Anyways. Two days ago we had a big fight. I've been going over to talk to her, but every time there is a big glass of wine with a near empty bottle next to her.

Friday I was having some pretty bad chest pains. Not the normal ""oh man I probably need to burp"" or the ""I shouldn't have eaten so much pizza"" pains. And not the relatively normal random pains either. It was a constant, dull, 5ish pain in the center of my chest. Anyways, it had me concerned, so I called the doc, talked to him over the phone, and he prescribed me some sort of gas medicine I think. I dunno, my nerves were shot and I was mostly just spewing symptoms and told me to go to Kroger and pick up what he prescribed me. He had also told me to take a break from drinking, just for the weekend, and if needed help to contact him. 

That night was terrible. I laid down for bed around 2am, and didn't actually fall asleep untill around 5 or so I think. The pain was unbearable. Eventually though I think the pain exhausted me enough that I could sleep. And sleep I did until 2pm. I woke up the next day and the pain had died down a bit but i immediately knew it was still there. 

Sometime Saturday I decided to post here about my worries and what I had been feeling. A very kind user talked with me, explaining of course he is not a doctor, but that he feels the same thing after a couple months of excessive drinking, then not drinking for a day or two. He said it was due to the anxiety he had covered with drinking. When he would drink, the pain would eventually leave because he was numbing his mind. When he wouldn't drink, his anxiety would skyrocket, to the point that his chest would start hurting. This made sense to me, although I'm still following up with my doctor Monday just in case. 

Anyways eventually I started feeling better yesterday and decided to go out and get myself some good food to eat. Ended up mostly buying healthy snacks. Baby carrots, almonds, pistachios, you name it. I came home, tried to get my mind off everything, and played some games with friends. 

Last night was so much better already than Friday night. I did some meditation and prayer before bed, and tried to just run through my head what I had done that day, and what I wanted to do the next. Essentially trying to stay away from dwelling on my chest. Waddya know, the pain went down to a two, and at moments virtually gone. 

I'm hoping tonight I can get a true night's rest. If not drinking will make my anxiety level out, thus making my chest stop hurting than so be it. If I do have an actual heart problem, and the alcohol is making it worse, than so be it. Either way I'm going forward with my doctor, and I'm not drinking today. It's as simple as that.

This is my first post here but I've lurked for years - gotta say I love this place and it's made me want to stop drinking myself.

The last few years I've spent drinking lots of beers of an evening. Not every evening. But most. I never black out or do anything stupid. But I've put on a lot of weight (I'm actually very fat now), I suffer with depression and the beer (obviously) makes it worse.

My wife is supportive and said she'd support me getting sober. She isn't a drinker and says I'm always a nicer, friendlier person when I'm having time away from the alcohol. But it never lasts more than a month or two. This time, I want it to be a long term thing.

However, I'm afraid of the boredom. Last year I managed to go just over two months without alcohol and one sunny evening in August happened - before I know it I'm drunk and drinking most evenings again.

I never drink in the day time. Never. Ever. And because of this people think I'm fine and don't have a problem. But I do drink alone, in the evenings. And I drink a lot of beer, sometimes wine as well or even rum - and I'll eat a lot of junk food afterwards. It's got to stop. I'm obsessed with sober nights (hence my username!) and I want to enjoy doing 'normal' stuff again.

But the boredom. It scares me. Thanks for reading, sorry for the long post.",15

I will confess I have some little voices saying hey you did it, why not press pause and drink for a bit.  But the question really is- why?  Why would I start that obsessive, depleting, expensive, exhausting cycle again?  And why would I start the cravings by injecting the very cause of them?  I am gonna sit tight and hang onto my resolve to stick with this.  IWNDWYT friends.  Thank you for this sub and love and support to you all.",16

Yes, I might have had good times whilst drinking, but those were more due to what I was doing, and who I was with, than what I had in my glass. And those good times would always come with brain fog or a hangover attached (and would cost me money, to boot!). There has never been a drink without some kind of price tag associated with it.

Being sober, on the other hand, enables me to have good times and NOT have to pay for them! I can relax deeply, laugh loudly, and think clearly, and I don't have to deal with terrible sleeps or dizzying hangovers. I get today AND tomorrow, because tomorrow I won't be hungover. It's like I get twice the amount of time to enjoy my life!

This is the first time I’ve ever had real withdrawal, and I was able to white knuckle it and am feeling a lot better. My goal 4 months ago was to go to an outpatient rehab, but quarantine happened and I just couldn’t stand it anymore so I did it at home. 

Here’s my request for help: I, like a lot of you, know I am an alcoholic and know in my heart I will most likely die one way or another if I keep drinking, but I have a lot of people in my life (including my husband who isn’t an alcoholic, rarely drinks) that I don’t have a problem. That alcohol is a symptom of my anxiety, depression, etc. So, I am going to list out how much I drank and for how long, and I’m looking for community confirmation that I have indeed been drinking at toxic levels, because I have no clue why anyone would say it’s ok, and then part of me is like, is this what normal people do? 

I’m a mid 30’s female, 145lbs (160 right now, booze-ass). 7 days a week I would drink at LEAST a 6 pack of 7% IPA AND one or two canned wines (13% so basically 1/2 to 1 bottle of wine.) On weekends it would be 10-12 of those IPA’s, and maybe some mixed drinks or a bottle of wine. For six years. That’s BIG PROBLEM, RIGHT?!!! 

I have been mostly functional, have a family, job, don’t look terrible yet, mostly just a horrible attitude and rage issues while drunk, but I avoid that by hiding away and drinking alone. My husband’s only complaint is I’m “hiding from life,” and he supports me getting sober but thinks I’ll be able to drink again at some point.

But, please, my friends, confirm that I have NOT been drinking normally?!!! Love you all, iwndwyt",3

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

2020-04-26 02:01:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g898t9/23_days_no_alcohol/,23 days no alcohol :),"Hello everybody!  Today marks 23 days since my last alcoholic binge.

I'll cut right to the chase.  I'm a binge drinker.  It started off when I was young.  I didn't really like the taste of alcohol, but I enjoyed being drunk.  That was the only reason why I drank.

My family on both maternal and paternal sides have histories of alcoholism.  My parents and extended family members drank at every family function, from birthdays to Christmas, St Patrick's Day (yeah yeah yeah, I know) to July 4.  I have 2 biological siblings and one adopted.  All of us have gotten DWI's, with exception to the adopted sibling because I actually do not know, but she is in rehab for alcoholism right now.

My ex husband (separated a year ago, no kids) was never what you would call a drinker, but he sure loved weed!  He reminded me often about my alcoholism which kept me in check.  

My current boyfriend likes to drink, which brought me back to the habit.  He does not show the same behavioral problems that I do while drinking.  He paces himself, and even when he is drunk, hes in control and does not have negative outbursts like I do.  

I was just sick of acting like an asshole in front of people and being rude.  Alcohol is like a mind eraser for me.  When my sister went to rehab (she is married with 2 children living out west), I was inspired to quit, so I did 2 days after she entered treatment.  I told her she was not alone.  She's doing great and returning home next Friday after a month of inpatient.

I hope I am not stealing the spotlight from her by quitting and making it about myself.  I do not spend any time talking about my accomplishments to her with regards to quitting, unless she says ""hows your journey going?"" and I will respond something like ""grape!  Its been 23 days!"" etc.  I would never want her to feel like I'm doing way better than her and I didn't need rehab, I just had/have a different alcoholic style with a past history of negative reinforcement my the ex, I guess.

On the 89th day I came home from work and found my wife dead on the bathroom floor. She was 31. Had a heart condition she didn't know about.

I stopped drinking because I was sick of missing work, feeling like shit, and to improve our relationship. We spent her last 89 days on Earth sober and I'm so thankful for that.

I didn't drink the night she died because both of our families showed up and were telling me how proud they were of me. They both.knew about the problem and ongoing sobriety.

The next day's tho, I was fucked up. All my friends flew in and I don't remember a few of those days. I had to go to the ER after her celebration of life because I was detoxing so bad. I think I stayed sober 3 days after that.

Well the problem has slowly getting worse. Since the quarentine started I've been ordering a 1.75 a day. Yesterday, I decided I had enough, finished what I had and went and laid down. By 1 AM I was WDing pretty bad. I took an Uber to my parents house, told them what was going on and I needed help.

I did have some booze after they went back to bed mainly to get some sleep. Also chugged two IPAs today when I woke up but immediately threw them up so I havent drank anything else today.

I can't keep anything down and don't know if I'll sleep tonight. Literally puked after sips of water.

I plan on staying at my folks house for a few days and I'm going to use them for accountability.

I also plan on doing as many Smart meetings as possible. Anybody have onsite on Smart?

2020-04-25 23:21:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g875lq/i_need_help/,I need help.,"I read the rules of the forum. I waited 'till I was sober to post.

I don't know if my journey will end with me being completely without alcohol, or learning how to live with it more responsibly, but right now I need to fix myself. I simply drink too much. Ultimately what I want is to find a place where I drink because I want it, not because I NEED it, or  I neither want it nor need it. Either way, I no longer want to need it. Right now I need it. And I want some advice on how to get out of this rut.

I'm a smart person. I am a software developer and do a lot of work that involves my brain. I'm also a highly anxious person. I stress myself out and worry a lot. My day job uses my head a lot, and then I get home (or, because of this virus, never leave home) and am met by the stress of raising two kids ages 3 and 5 (not alone, I'm married), so....I drink to shut the brain down for a while. I won't beat around the bush or lie, I'm now addicted to it. What started off as simply a way of feeling less anxiety and stress has now become a problem. Usually my BAC is below the legal limit  (I have a tester), but tonight has been a blur starting around 4 PM. I'm terrified to think what BAC was tonight. It had to be dangerous. But, whatever it was, bottom line: I think I'm just leaning way too heavily on this toxin to help me out. I want a different solution.

But here's the problem, all the solutions seem -- and I'm sorry, but I'm speaking from my gut right now -- all the other solutions seem lame. The problem is that I'm telling myself that without alcohol, or without that blissful buzz, life will just be boring as hell or stressful as hell. I'm telling myself that things like meditation or yoga or whatnot is BS when compared to the immediate battle axe that alcohol is to my stress and anxiety. Internally I joke about how nutritionists would tell me to ""not eat that piece of chocolate cake, but eat some dried kale instead"" like it's an actual substitute, and then I compare that to the substitutes I read online to drinking. ""Take a walk"" or ""read a book"". Is that seriously going to take the place of a 12-year old Scotch? I look at so many of the other things I'm being told to do to relax as a joke compared to the efficacy of just drinking 6 oz and going into a warm buzz.

I realize this is the addiction talking. I realize there IS a different path out there because I've lived it. I haven't always been like this. But that was before kids, and before multiple jobs, and before covid. This rambling, though, isn't meant to get into an argument with people and defend my defensiveness about drinking. I don't WANT to drink. But I hope someone out there will digitally slap me and show me there are ways to live that don't involve that needing a drink.

This is what I want. When my Mom and my Dad got divorced, my Dad and I would spend time together watching M\*A\*S\*H. There's an episode called ""Bottle Fatigue"" where Hawkeye decides to quit alcohol for a week. At the end of the episode, after 24-hours of surgery, all the main cast find themselves in the officers club less than a week later, and Hawkeye sits down to grab a drink. Everyone looks at him and express their sadness that he couldn't make it a full week. He says, ""Look, I need this okay?"" He scotch gets laid in front of him, and he looks at it and gets up and before walking away says, ""I'll be back when I want it, not when I need it."" If I'm going to drink, I want to want to, I want to not need to. Right now I need to. And I need help.

Thanks for listening to me ramble.",2

This was the best choice and I can't imagine quarantine while still drinking.,"I quit drink over a year ago. At the time I was living with a significant other who eventually (after I proved my commitment to the not drinking) forgave me, I rarely paid my share of the rent, spent the little money I had drinking, was an utter emotional hurricane, couldn't hold down a job for long, lost MANY friends, and was severely mentally unstable.

Now, I live in a generally peaceful house, I've never been late on a rent payment and I kept a job. I have figured out who are my life long friends and who were drinking buddies or just fickle.

I discovered a love of knitting. I'm learning about hair and makeup to feel better about my appearance. I lost forty pound and my skin looks better.

I'm in a healthy loving relationship and I'm working up the courage to finally get my driver's license (I'm 30...) And apply for jobs in the nonprofit sector.

While I do sometimes miss the adventures and life style, I don't miss the fights, hangovers, depression, and instability. My life is so far from what it once was and so much closer to what I want.

I've had to do my share of apologizing and there's more to come (it's okay to not be ready to apologize to everyone immediately. I had to get myself okay first). 

But, I think about quarantine. I'm away from my girlfriend and unsure about the future. I'm bored and anxious. The temptations to drink are there, particularly with the quarantine booze memes and ads for delivery beer. Alcohol would make everything worse. Physical health, mental health, financial well-being, and relationships. I've stayed up a few times lately debating it all in my head.

Ultimately, not drinking always wins.

My best friend and I have a closer relationship than in many years and I'm able to support my girlfriend during her transition. I have a rescue cat and dog I love deeply. I couldn't be there for these lives were I drinking. So, even if not for myself in the lowest moments, I do it for them.

I baked chocolate chip cookies and knitted today. I walked the dog and felt well all day. This would not have happened were I still drinking. I'm proud of who I've become and where I am going, even if that cheat is always there.

I think of recovery as an empty landscape. The people are and things you loved may not be there at the beginning, but you have this beautiful area to build on. The only catch is that you have an addiction rope tied around your middle that can pull on you at any time, and if you push too hard, it grows taunt.

 I spent the first part of recovery building essentials: home, work, healthcare. I invited safe people onto my land and accepted some refusals. I eventually built a craft store and animal care. It's all basic as of yet, but it's my place to build and create. I worked hard to get here and will always have to accept the rope around my middle and having to rebuild when other's lands may seem more full.

Recovery is a gift. It's a sad gift. You have to leave the land you were on and some of the people and things you had there. Some stressers will creep over with you, but it's a gift of a fresh start and green grass.

I'm glad I spent a Saturday night baking cookies with my dog instead of drinking a bar closed or drunkenly running to a gas station minutes before close. I oddly miss those moments once in a while, but I gave myself the gift of clear land.",31

I’ve been looking back on my past self with so much sadness; so much time I wasted hellbent on destroying myself. 
 
It’s been a painful journey but I’m so grateful to have made it through these six months, I am working hard to become a better person and I’m starting the see the light. 

Here’s to a beautiful fresh start and becoming the person I’m meant to be. Alcohol has no place in my life anymore.

I would've looked outside an hour ago and thought how nice a night it would be to go and sit outside and read, but being hammered it would have been extremely uncomfortable to sit there and try to read. So instead I'd be inside watching anime, or random stuff on YouTube, continuing to drink, and having a completely wasted night, after a completely wasted day of self-hate and recovery from the night before. 

Today couldn't have been any further from that! I woke up this morning and made myself a great breakfast of eggs, bell pepper, spinach, toast, yogurt with fruit and granola, and a cup of tea, went for a run after all the food had settled (cut it short and walked because of shin splints), cleaned up around the house, played some video games, cooked and ate dinner and just got back in from sitting on the porch and finishing the ""A Knife in the Dark"" chapter of LOTR:FOTR, and it was a glorious hour of reading.

 I'm so much more present now in all of the moments of my days, and as a result there's so much more joy that goes into each one. Breakfast has gone from being something that I \*might\* have, to being such an important part of the day for me that the act of making it has actually become a sort of ritual, with steps that I do in a particular order each day. I'll wrap it up here before this gets away from me, but man, am I glad to be on this train with all of you. IWNDWYT!",72

Felt great. My fellow sober buddy at work gave me high fives and hugs. She just hit 7 months last week. Think is at this precise moment as I’m typing this I’m going through my first real psychological struggle and had to come on here to just do something other than what I want to do. 

Last night I was cleaning the fridge. In the very back. Really hidden I found 2 small bottles of white wine. Single serving size. They were not mine. I left them alone. However I thought about them till I slept. Than I dreamed about them. At work today they were on my mind all day and now I’m at home. They are not mine. Must be my mother in laws who lives with us cause my wife and I are sober. Soon as I got home I texted my wife that there is 1 tiny bottle of wine not 2 in the back of the fridge that’s bothering me and I’d appreciate her mom either drinking it or throwing it away. Her mom said oh that bottle is just martenellis apple cider which means SHE DOESNT KNOW THEY ARE THERE! I am wrecking myself right now mentally justifying drinking one and leaving the other cause I told my wife about. No one will be home for two hours... the thoughts “no one would know” or “It doesn’t mean it breaks my streak” or “just 1 is ok” are raging in my head. Can’t dump em cause they aren’t mine. Can’t hind them from myself. Don’t even want to touch them. 

Hoping someone has some wise words pretty quickly here to help get these thoughts out of my head.

Edit: crisis averted. MIL came home and did whatever with the bottles. Head has shut up. This has really shown me I am nowhere near ready to be around ANY alcohol at this point in my rehab. Haven’t really been tested like this. Just been isolating in my house with no triggers around. 
Still feeling pretty proud of 60 days though.",3

I’m about to turn 30 and I finally feel good. 

What did I do to stop? Easier said than done but I put down the bottle on 10/14/19 at 2am after a three day bender and said no more. Stopped hanging out with friends who were bad influences on me. That part was difficult but I’m pretty happy being solo for now. The first two weeks were a living hell for me. I was drinking heavily on weekends and it would ruin my week.

This week is shaping up to be one binge after another. I’m so upset with myself. I didn’t get out of bed for an entire day after a heavy binge then barely dragged myself out of bed midday yesterday, and hit the bottle heavy again last night. Repeat me barely dragging myself out of bed today and just sitting here thinking, what’s the point? 

I had all but moved on from my ex wife and then she came back into the picture, slightly, and I just lost it. I knew I was going to drink. I knew it was going to be bad. I knew I wasn’t going to be able to write the paper I need to write today. But I still fucking did it. 

The time before that? I don’t even know why I got so fucked up. I just did. I started and couldn’t stop. As per usual. It’s getting worse lately it seems. I’ll drink almost two six packs and not even blink. 

My weight is off the charts. My mental health is complete shit. I’m stressed about not having work and waiting on unemployment. The whole pandemic thing is fucking with my head. I had been doing so well. Exercising. Cooking. Eating. Not drinking. And then I dropped it all. And now I don’t know how to pick back up and do well again. Just seem doomed to failure. So again, what’s the point?

* I am in my mid-30s and at my heaviest weight ever. My belly sticks out farther than my boobs.  Amazingly, only a couple of those pounds have come on during the time of quarantine and smoking cessation. 
* I am struggling with motivation in general. 
* I am wanting to use this quarantine time for self-improvement.  I have spent enough time wallowing, and I forgive myself.  It’s okay to struggle during a global crisis and isolation. But it’s also necessary to get back up. And important to realize that the things that are hard to get started on (exercise, work) are the things that actually make me feel happy and normal. 


Methods 

* 30 day reset to start. Have done this before, was helpful and easy.  Of course, in those times, I had my old “friends” the cigarettes which made abstaining from alcohol easy peasy. 

I’m not saying I have a great relationship with alcohol,  but any problems I have with it are FAR outweighed by my addiction to cigs. 

So this might be more challenging this time around. But the rewards will likely be greater.  

Hopes: 

* more energy 
* able to shed some weight 
* be more productive and feel better

Ct scan and another ultrasound. Just pancreatitis. I feel much better about this. Liver is clear. They tell me that a room had just opened up in the ICU and they would just keep me there. 

Well here I am in ICU, turns out that there was a good chance I wasn't going to make it last night. They seem to think I'm out of the woods for now and the pain is still pretty constant.

...My son is everything and deserves my full emotional support 

...I despised the mental and physical addiction of alcohol and the effort it took to sustain it

...Not drinking doesn’t mean I have to love everyone or embrace a positive attitude in all aspects of life. That’s too much for me and the thought of doing so makes me want to drink.

I keep checking the days because I think to myself ""no way can that be right"". Sure enough...it is. Two years since I quit drinking cold turkey after many years of progressive abuse. 

First, I don't miss alcohol...like, at all. Sure, I catch myself sometimes romanticizing the idea of a drink in certain situations, but it's always the *idea* of a drink. It's this weird disconnection where I long for an ideal situation that would never be, because the reality of alcohol use is pretty ugly. I am reminded of that and easily pulled back down to earth anytime I see anyone drinking.

Anytime cravings do come up, they're easy to dismiss. At this point I realize that cravings are a longing for *something*, not for alcohol. They always go away and in 730 days I have not once woke up and thought ""man, I wish I would have drank yesterday!""

I am a different person now. I mean, I am the same, but I'm not. I struggled with this for a long time after quitting. Relationships with friends changed. I started therapy and have been working on myself in various ways. I can't say that life has necessarily gotten easier, or changed dramatically, but I have a new appreciation for life that certainly wasn't there before. I've grown so much more comfortable in my own skin and am very confident in the person that I am today.

If I'm being very honest, life is sort of....boring now, but I'm okay with it! It beats the alternative of being stuck in this shitty version of Groundhog Day where I just chase another drink endlessly. I have picked up hobbies (guitar, jiu jitsu, more working out, reading a lot). However, I still sometimes have to fight to feel comfortable with *just being*. You know, in those moments where you otherwise would have been drinking or using...

I know that I still have a lot of work to do. I know the current version of myself is one that is still learning to just *be* without alcohol. At this point though, while I won't let my guard down, I feel as if I have climbed the mountain and now I get to start the descent down to the beautiful valley below. I can see it waiting for me, but there is still some more work to be done :)

Finally, thank you /r/stopdrinking. Without every one of you, this would have been an impossibility. Before I ever quit, I lurked here so that I could gain perspective. You gave me the courage to quit. You were the first people I told my story to. I have shared more with you regarding my sobriety than anyone else in my life. 

Sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, thank you all. I hope everyone is having a great day and hanging in there in this time of extreme uncertainty.

2020-04-25 15:16:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g7zg71/1096_days/,"1,096 days","I’m three years sober today. It’s honestly unbelievable to me.

I grew up in a large, Irish-Catholic family that LOVED to drink. However, they were successful and they weren’t violent or mean, so it was never a problem. You see, success and kindness covers all manner of sins, so it was the elephant in the room that was never addressed. I could go toe-to-toe with them, a young girl, pounding beers and bourbon and gin and tonics and nice bottles of Cab with the best of them.

And it wasn’t a problem for me either, until my mid-twenties, when it was. Maybe it was one or another traumatic event that I faced, maybe it was the deep insecurity I dealt with from such a young age, maybe it was my severe abandonment issues despite having what was a really good childhood. Either way, being a weekend warrior became drinking on Thursday’s and Friday’s, and then Wednesday’s. And sometimes Tuesday’s. I had a ton of promise, and my work started wondering why I’d call out, and my projects were half-assed, and they didn’t trust me. And my friends, who drank like fish and dabbled in coke, and managed to keep it together, started keeping their distance from me because I was a guaranteed mess. Forget a relationship. The kind of man I wanted thought I was fun but never wife or even girlfriend material. I was an attractive woman, despite hating myself, but was starting to look bloated and aged and really fucking tired. My brother wanted nothing to do with me. My parents hesitated to even give me $30 for gas and lunch. I tried every trick in the book - except stopping - to get it under control. But I’d always find myself drinking boxed wine at home, hating myself for who I was and what I’d inevitably do. I was all about appearances, and I was so ANGRY at my peers, and my siblings for having it all - the career, the significant other, the things, the joy - that I didn’t have. I was unlucky, I thought.

I decided to give sobriety and treatment a shot for 6 months to see what improved, mainly because my twenties were now in the rear view mirror and I was so so tired. My family and friends were done. I was so close to being fired. My big secret was out. I had a problem. I had “tried” maybe three weeks of sobriety before, but I thought non-drinkers were a cult and I didn’t want to never have fun again. I was embarrassed into it, honestly, but I’m competitive and when I set my mind to do something, I do it. So six months went by. And I humbled myself. I shared a run-down house with two girls. I had no extra spending money. I worked a job like I had in high school. I had no defenses left. I was stripped bare. I worked a real AA program. My dog died. My granddad died. I hopped into a relationship. He struggled. My roommate relapsed and left me nearly homeless. She nearly burned down our house. It was a nightmare. But, I stayed sober. And at about the year mark, the nightmare ended.

I am thriving. My boyfriend is thriving. He’s gorgeous, but kind and smart and loves me, those things that I did not have before. My parents are the greatest parents in the world, and I’m their emergency contact when they travel. My nephew, who never knew me as a drinker, FaceTimes me four times a week. My friends can call me at 3am and know I will be there as fast as I can to help. I have a job. A great fucking job, one I would’ve dreamed about four years ago. A job where the VP of my division called me one of the best hires they could’ve made. When stuck at home over the last six weeks, I’ve shown up (online) sober and clear eyed every day to work. I’m on a four week furlough, and while money is not everything, I have enough of a financial cushion to know I’m okay, instead of pissing it all away on booze. I bought myself a Peloton, and go to Orangetheory four times a week. I take care of myself. I have a dog who I care for the way she deserves to be cared for. I have a beautiful apartment, one I painstakingly furnished and pay for each month without begging my parents for help with. It smells like candles and the flowers my boyfriend bought me this morning, not bourbon. I love to cook. We do have fun - my boyfriend and I go to the Caribbean, and travel to see our sports teams, and golf, and visit amusement parks. I help girls in AA (I don’t actively attend meetings anymore, but keep in touch with my sponsees). I hang out with sober people and non-sober people. I think about others before myself.

It’s hard sometimes - I look at my (non-alcoholic) friends and compare myself to where I think I should be. But I’m kind to myself, and I am proud of myself.

One day, I was just going along with my routine, getting home from work, sneaking alcohol into my room, drinking glass after glass until I couldn’t think straight...and then I was just sick of it. I thought, fuck this. I hate this life, I hate the lying and sneaking and shame and anxiety and self-disgust. Why don’t I just stop? 

Same with smoking. I was walking with my family at a sunny farmers market in a cute little town and all I could think was “when can I dip away for a smoke?” And I had a moment of realization: that’s all I’m thinking, all the time, whether it’s in the back or front of my mind. And FUCK am I sick of it. So I set a quit date and stuck to it and that was that. 

And neither of those quits were easy. I got the shakes, I got depressed, I got frustrated, I got embarrassed explaining I don’t drink anymore, and I still get a lot of those things. But it certainly wasn’t impossible like I thought it was. And life is so much better now.

The post just got me thinking, quitting DOES seem like a pipe dream. Like something you’ll do one day, maybe, if you’re lucky. But it’s not a pipe dream, it’s more like a leap of faith. 

Anyways, that’s the end of my philosophizing, just wanted to share that borrowed thought. I’ll try and link the original post below if I can find it again.",18

I heard the same persuasive tone sneak into my voice on why his roommates need to drink—and call myself out on it—but yes, indeed, they would love a margarita. 

I’m just the person that will wander off into a stranger’s kitchen to whip up drinks to keep the party going.

And yesterday I was seven months sober. 

So I thought, I’ll just make mine virgin. 

I wonder if I would’ve made fun of someone for doing that, in the past. 

Scrounging through the freezer, fridge, cabinets, drawers, I manage to find frozen pineapple, oranges, margarita mix, limes, and a blender. 

And looking at that margarita mix, I thought to myself: “there’s no way this tastes good without alcohol.”

So I made myself a pineapple/orange smoothie instead. :)

But here I am and life is good, I'm more focused and actually feel like I have the power and control to live my life the way I want to, accomplish my dreams and be the good honest successful person I always knew existed.

The downfall is that my relationship is falling apart, mostly by my own doing. My partner has been supportive through the last few months, but now that I'm no longer numb I'm coming to realize there are parts of the relationship that are deal breakers for me. Sexual incompatibility, lack of important communication, and zero ambition on his part.  I have tried to express this but it's fallen on deaf ears.

It sucks and I'm hurt.  There is a small part of me that remembers how I'd drink myself into a sobbing oblivion to ""make myself feel better"". But I know better, that will make me feel infinitely worse, I'll say and do a bunch of things I regret and be ashamed of myself.

I am strong and I'll console myself with productive tasks like organizing my mess of a living space that is still recovering from many years of being ignored.

I am in charge of my future and being sober has given me so much clarity.

I wasn't dealing well with being isolated, so I was polishing about a fifth of vodka everyday. Didn't matter what time it was; if I was awake, I was drunk. All I did was drink and sleep (and eat MAYBE once a day.) It was a fucking brutal, awful existence. I was never happy. 

But a week ago today, something happened in my brain: I realized how utterly useless my alcoholic coping mechanism really was. It wasn't making life more tolerable. It wasn't soothing my anxiety. It wasn't making me fun to be around. It certainly wasn't helping me excel in my college courses.. Alcohol did the opposite of all of that. 

So I haven't had an alcoholic beverage in 7 days. A full week. 

But here is the small victory:

My boyfriend bought 2 six packs of beer last night, and I did not drink with him. :) I didn't even want to, which is pretty astounding. 

Might not seem like much; but that, my friends, IS a big deal for me. :)",17

I have had countless day ones and it has taken 6 months of those day ones and relapses to get me to one month. Healing is not linear. 

I have fucked up my life in countless ways because of alcohol. I accepted a young death because of alcohol. I hated myself because of alcohol.  The shame and guilt are so heavy but I know how much heavier that burden would be now if I was drinking. Drinking kept me in such a dark place, a place with thoughts and actions I can't believe I used to entertain. I feel like I am thinking clearly for the first time in my adult life.

It was my 21st Birthday and I was going to spend that Summer in Munich Germany,  It was going to be the trip of a lifetime. It was the land of beer and sausage, which I happily partook in for the entirety of that trip.  I feel like I rolled off the plane 15 pounds heavier, with a new love for German beer and food.  And that is how my drinking story began.  

Fast forward 5 years and you would find me living in the East Village downtown San Diego, roaming from nightclub to nightclub Thursday-Saturday, Sundays were for The Kebab Shop and sleeping. This was the life I always dreamed of, it was like living in the real life Sex and the City and I was Carrie Bradshaw. I had a great job, for the most part single and made a bunch of new friends while living down there. I could do this forever I thought, I was at my peak. 

As I got older, the hangovers got longer and the music in the nightclubs got louder. I could feel myself slowing down, physically and mentally. I sure didn’t feel like that 21 year old anymore and I could feel like my happiness was depleting.  Maybe this is what 28 feels like,  this is what I’m supposed to feel like? During my 26th year, I lost three important people in my life within months of each other as well as my childhood home burning to the ground. If that isn't an excuse for someone to use alcohol as a bandage, I don’t know what is.  

Two years ago I took a good look at my life and realized there was something holding me back from reaching some important goals in my life.  It was like being on the loading screen and stuck at 99%, why wouldn't you just load already! Why couldn’t I finish school, when will this 15 pounds just come off, I am working my ass off at the gym!  These things take time I guess as I meander over to happy hour for the 3rd time this week.  

After quitting alcohol, I feel like I lost an entire social group of friends. What on EARTH would I do on Friday night If I wasn't going out?  I couldn't fathom this idea, it was such a weird feeling.  This transition wasn’t easy, there was a lot of sacrifice but damn, now when I look back it was so worth it.  

I quit alcohol because I knew I wasn’t the best and complete version of myself.  It was like sculpting a statue and ending the project without adding the final details, I was incomplete.  I made the decision to quit alcohol because I didn’t want to be a “wine mom”. I knew if I continued my alcohol journey, I would be the mom pre-partying before the soccer games and not mentally present for my kids. Lastly, I quit alcohol because I wanted my body to be strong and in the shape I always wanted to be in.  Like a miracle, within weeks my body dropped weight, my thinking became more clear and my overall happiness increased. Surprisingly, over time the relationships I still had became stronger and had more value. Now you can’t buy that off the top shelf for any price.

We are born into this world with our own separate journeys.  Every decision we make will have a result, whether it’s small or large.  At the end of the day, we are in control of this journey, we decide how the story goes.  Now that’s magic.",2

I'm been dealing with extreme tiredness recently, which is so frustrating, makes the most mundane tasks like tiding condo difficult. I don't know if its physical or mental due to depression/stress. However if I was self medicating with booze, I'm have even less energy and wouldn't even notice things needs tidying. At least I've freed myself from the hangovers and disappointment in myself from over indulging. 

This is highlighting my need to stay on the sober path, hopefully I will get back to full energy. I know with booze, that would be an even more remote possibility.",5

2020-04-25 10:01:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g7tzfc/five_years_sober_a_reflection/,Five Years Sober - A Reflection,"On April 25, 2015, I took my last sip of alcohol. I did not know at the time that it would be my last sip, but it was. When I woke up the next morning, on April 26, 2015, I had an epiphany (and a massive hangover) - why was I letting a substance define my life? What I do, where I go, who I hang out with, my goals, dreams, aspirations, all revolved around a poisonous drug. The media tricked me into believing that consuming alcohol was normal. What was I doing with my life - my one chance to do whatever I wanted? I was wasting away into a sad morsel of disaster. ""Oh God it's Monday, thank God it's Friday"" was no way to go through life. I was a mess. Externally, you would have believed me to be the most confident, energetic, exuberant person. Inside, however, I was crying out for help - an outer shell of fraud was masking an internal depression and pathetic flesh. Shouldn't I be in control of what I put in my body and what I do with my life? It was clear that alcohol had taken a hold of me, sunk its devilish teeth into me, and sapped me of every essence of my core being. I was tired of the lies, the pains, the battles, the deceit. On April 26, 2015, I was severing my relationship, permanently, with all forms of mind-altering substances - including alcohol - without even knowing it.

&#x200B;

Fast forward five years to today, April 25, 2020. It is incredible that I actually remember the past five years and have made every single decision over the past five years because I truly wanted to. I was conscious of what I was thinking and doing. I experience mental clarity like I have never experienced before.  I am physically fit, emotionally under control, financially stable, and choose to be around people who add value to my life. In fact, every decision I make is now a logical equation, a question of: ""does this add value to my life, or does this add pain to my life?""

&#x200B;

This forum, at the inception of my ""StopDrinking"" journey, was the one place I could go to vent, congregate, appreciate, and help me get through those difficult first few months. I know it is anecdotal, but, from my experience, the momentum you achieve in distancing yourself from alcohol brings a level of satisfaction and mental acuity to help you finally defeat the demon. If you are running from something that is stationary, the farther away you are from it, the less likely you are to want it. Now, after five years, I can say with 100% confidence, I will never, ever drink again. That is a powerful statement, and one I am confident in.

&#x200B;

I did it. I conquered alcohol. Thank you, everyone. You can do it, too. One day at a time.",10

I did start drinking again in Dec 2018 ... but pretty lightly. I'm not saying there was never a time I over-indulged, but I managed to average \~4 drinks per week for over a year. One strategy was that I never drank at home, only out. Moderation is unusual In this community, I know. My ""success"" in this may be because I was not such a hugely heavy drinker even before I quit, so perhaps I never (yet) crossed that point of no return.

I mostly stopped participating here because I felt sharing my true experience wouldn't be helpful, since most members of this community are very committed to pursuing or maintaining zero alcohol consumption. I totally respect that. And I didn't want to be dishonest about the fact that I was drinking a little bit. But I never stopped reading, almost every day. 

Then came 2020. With the pandemic/lockdown, I let myself start drinking at home, and within a few weeks was drinking 2-4 glasses of wine per night, which made me feel horrible. 

So I grabbed a badge and started reading here more often, and participating in the daily pledge. After one false start, I have completed a week alcohol-free. 

I miss you guys, could really use a supportive online community right now, and would love to participate here. But I am not sure how committed I am to never drinking again. My goal is to feel better and maybe re-introduce light consumption once I can go out again. 

Does anyone have any thoughts for me?",15

I just wanted a glass of wine or two. And it would have just been that. But I knew it would make me feel like shit. Even a small amount these days gets me down. Sometimes I have fun having drinks and sometimes I have too many. And sometimes The depressing effects happen while I’m still
drinking or even before I decide to drink and only with a few drinks. 
I didn’t buy any wine. I went on this sub and read a post about a guy riding his bike to work. In the wine aisle. And I didn’t buy the wine. But I said to myself its Friday. And if I still want wine tomorrow I’ll go get some. Or even later tonight. I went to Lowe’s and I was getting stuff for weekend yard projects. The wine idea popped up again but only for a second. I didn’t go back for wine. I went home and unloaded groceries and pavers and actually forgot about the wine. I ate dinner and drank a kombucha which made me happy and I didn’t give wine another thought. Im not counting days. I can’t say I’ll never drink again. What I can say is that after going back and forth for 30 years and agonizing over drinking or not drinking or beating myself up if drink too much and all the mental gymnastics that come with it. I know that most of the time when I drink it makes me feel bad. Puffy. Self hating. Ugh. And some weekends I binge drink all in the name of having fun and by Monday I actually hate myself. 
So I know now and have known for years  that alcohol makes me very unhappy and sometimes makes me actually hate myself and my own reflection. My goal
Is to not hate myself. My goal is to not continue this cycle. 
I started writing in a calendar on a scale of 0-10 how happy I feel that morning. Also an anxiety score. And then how many drinks I consumed the day before. Guess what. The numbers of drinks I had yesterday entirely dictates my levels of anxiety or happiness. Calmness. Whatever you associate “feeling good” with. 
It’s a simple thing. Write down the numbers. You probably already know this. But looking at the numbers is interesting.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I drank for confidence and became doubtful. I drank to make conversation easier and slurred my speech. I drank to feel heavenly and ended up feeling like hell.”*

ETA Ended up long. tldr had a seizure, went to hospital for 2 weeks, doing good now.

I used to drink. A lot. Started out being a cool kid in high school, led to beers after work, then more beers after work, then a bottle. That was just solo, never mind the parties, bbq's other misc. ""reasons"". I was drinking for close to 30 years regularly, heavily about the last 6 to 8. The last couple years I averaged a handle every 2 days or so. I don't know how I was functioning or how my wife didn't know the extent of my problem. Probably because I have always worked nights. Kept good jobs the whole time and I'm sure I had the odor at the start of a shift many times. I have known for a while that I needed to stop. Tried a couple times and couldn't get any sleep. I just kind of figured I would end up dead or in the hospital where I would be forced to make a change.

Involuntarily went with the latter.

I told myself on the 21st of Feb. I needed to chill out and just stop. Of course I was drunk at the time and thought You can do this! Passed out, woke up the next day, and didn't do the usual take a couple shots before getting out of bed thing that I had been doing for a while. Day went fine, kinda jittery and shaky. Late evening I told my wife I was going to go watch netflix. That was the last thing I remembered from that day.

From what I hear, I fell down the stairs and had a seizure. Wife heard me fall, saw me at the bottom of the stairs really twitchy and shaky, called 911. I was admitted to a hospital that night. The next morning she came to see me and I was in the ICU intubated. They  told her I had influenza A. I was like that for 7 days. I would say those were the worst days of my life but I don't remember any of that. What I do remember are the hallucinations. Vividly. You know when you fall asleep and you have a dream that you think was 6 hours long and you wake up only to find out you slept 15 minutes? I didn't do the math, but I must have seen shit that wasn't there for about 2 months.

Got the tube out which I also don't remember and lied in bed for a while. Started getting some life back and recognizing what had happened. It was bad. I called my wife, told her I fucked up and was in the hospital getting help for drinking and she said ""I know. I checked you in and was there this morning. You've been there since the 22nd"". Still couldn't really sleep. Had between 3 to 6 bags of stuff going in my arm, BP cuff going on every half hour, lights, nurses constantly, pooping and peeing in bags. Not fun. I wrote poop. It really wasn't, just darker pee.

The nurses there were/are saints. I was a bad patient. There were times I thought I was at home and screamed for people to get the fuck out of my house, called every nurse that looked familiar to me from another time by the wrong name. Freaked out once because I thought I saw my kids friend get hit by a car. Didn't know what city I was in.

Finally had a good day, wife came to see me. She said I was talking crazy still but I was lucid. The next day she brought the kids and lasted about 2 minutes before she got them out of there. I don't remember that part.

So I got out of the ICU and got a regular room. Couldn't eat real food or drink water because the tube messed my throat up and I couldn't swallow right. Needed a special diet. Couldn't walk by myself right for a couple days. 

Finally got out 2 weeks after I went in. Doing well now, last PT  appt was today, back to work Mon. after 9 weeks. Glad I still have a job. I don't know how I ended up with such a bad ass wife. If this had happened in the morning after she went to work I would've probably died. I am not craving a drink right now or since. I think this wake up call (and pooping in a bag) has caused a shift in my thinking. I am actually eating now. I can remember how I got to the spot i woke up in. The few people I have seen since this has happened tell me I look healthy. Must have really looked like shit for people to say that. I haven't done any meetings, sought help, craved alcohol. I want to say I'm lucky.  I've lurked here for a few years and read a lot of struggle going on. Keep on keeping on, don't be afraid to ask for help. I should have a long time ago. I don't recommend doing what I did. If you made it this far in my rambling, know that it is possible to stay up all night and not have a drink. That new car feeling I have is probably not permanent and when it wears off, I will seek help because i know now it is possible.

Any questions AMA. Didn't think it would be this long and I left out a lot.",5

I’m new here.  I have been drinking for years and am recognising this has become an addiction.  My ex was the addict, I saw myself as being able to control it.  And I do as far as functioning goes.  Drink at night when kids are in bed- sleep-up early for work and all the bits.. but it’s the same pattern and I’m drinking every night.  In lockdown, it’s sneaking in to afternoons.

I’ve had a tough couple of years going through a divorce and now live with my two daughters.  I recognize my codependent behaviour in my last relationship and I’m working hard to look after myself and set my own goals and support us financially as my ex doesn’t pay any child support.  So drinking in the evening is a way to relax, block out the worry, blocks out the loneliness and eases anxiety.

I have started a new relationship with a non- drinker (Muslim) and while he’s not putting any pressure on me, it’s really been like someone holding up a mirror- I’m noticing this is me.. not comfy to settle in evening without a drink.

Even now I sitting thinking we’ll, if I’m gonna give up I should at least finish the wine I have in the cupboard.  

Does anyone have tips for the first days— I’m thinking I need non alcoholic drinks, tea and some sort of plan.  I like plans , gives me sense of control I think.  

I’m an open person so I’m just going to be completely honest in this group.  I am on antidepressants for anxiety and have been for years, since this really came to a head after having my first baby.   I know my anxiety factors in to all this.  I used to have half a seroquel at night which helped me sleep, but I stopped that over a year ago.. and find I’ve upped my alcohol intake.

Thanks for read what’s turned into an essay.  Any advice about gearing up to quit would be awesome.  Thanks",2

I’m up in the middle of the night with heartburn from drinking and eating crap food.  And maybe for the first time in my 50 yrs I can say out loud...

I have a drinking problem.  The biggest part of the problem is that after 2 drinks I start to get angry.  Angry at nothing and angry at everything.  It’s worse with whisky and rum(my drinks of choice), but probably exists with all drinking.  I like drinking and I’m terrified how acknowledging this will change my life. 

This is not new, it’s plagued me since I started drinking in my teens.  It’s damaged my relationships forever, caused hundreds of drunk angry fights.  I can’t think of a vacation ever without a drunken anger filled argument with someone.  Now with kids I can see it causing explosive rage over things that might justify a raised voice but nowhere near the level of anger I feel.  

I don’t drink to the point of being fall down drunk or hung over.  I don’t drink during the day or feel a physical dependence but that “taking the edge off” is the line at which point the anger sets in. There is this strong pull to have a few more drinks, even just 2 or 3 more but this is where the anger manifests itself and grows out of control. 

My wife(been together 13 yrs)is aware of the issue.  She has told me she fears my anger and avoids me when I’m drinking.  She’s asked me not to get drunk, and limit my drinking to 2 drinks.  I typically don’t stop at 2 and she turns a blind eye to it likely afraid to poke the bear.  Our relationship has been shit for years, likely partial from my drinking, but more likely fueling my drinking from a few days per week to every day.  A month ago I found out she has been having a 6 month affair.  I think it’s the lowest point in her life and definitely mine. It’s sent me spiraling out of control.  We are working on things in therapy and we are making progress at repairing things but I think it’s unlikely our relationship is salvageable and I have a big divorce coming in my future that will create financial, social and emotional chaos.  It will change my life and my kids lives in the most significant ways forever.  The pain is unimaginable.  How does cutting back on my drinking happen in this environment?

The second part of the problem is that I drink more than 2 drinks too often, in fact every day at this point.  Mostly while sitting on my couch.  It’s my wind down mechanism.  But outside the house in social settings alcohol plays a major role with my friends.

I can’t imagine how I would fit in without it.  It is the core of all of these relationships, elevates my personality and is “the fun” we enjoy together. I simple don’t have any friends that don’t drink heavily, not one.  While it’s easy to say you should change your friends I’m talking about several groups of friends that have been friends for 10, 20 plus years.  They work with me, we own vacation property and our families vacation together, I play sports with them 2x per week, followed by beers which are the happiest days of my week.  I can’t imagine how limiting to 2 drinks is possible in this world?  How do I toss out this core of my social and emotional world?  They are my life?  All I have left at this point.

I completely ignore the health implications of drinking.  I actually tolerate alcohol pretty well for whatever reason.  I’m fortunate that the calories have not caught up with me but who knows what the impact is on my internal organs. 

Lastly, I don’t think that I can do this alone and I don’t have anyone here to support me.  I’m not sure I can trust talking to my wife about this.   It not just because of the pending divorce but even if we stay together, formalizing a line in the sand with her is likely to cause further strain on us.  As she reminds me of the 2 drink line, watches me cross it un-approvingly, then highlight the anger and actions that result. I think it’s likely to exacerbate the problem and potentially increase the anger and fighting.

I don’t expect guidance here that’s likely going to solve my problem, I don’t think there is a good solution or even a possible solution?  I just felt the need to write it down.  As I write I can already hear my mind thinking, you can’t admit this to anyone!  But it’s a start I guess?",24

I wanted to compile a list of movies/tv shows or documentaries that people have seen which my have focused on alcoholism, or as a bonus, recovery also.
I am a big movie fan and when I see a film portraying what I am going through or something to relate to it helps alot.
Might be a cool way for us to all help each other out?

TV SHOW

I had stopped drinking wine because it made me so sleepy. I switched to beer for a couple months, but I drank a lot more of it since the alcohol content is lower. This left me feeling uncomfortably bloated to the point where I thought my stomach was going to burst open. I gained 20lbs in 2 months. Even my PJs are tight. About 3 weeks ago I switched to vodka. Ive been going through 1.75L every 2 days. 

After waking up yesterday morning (or maybe it was 2 mornings ago?) with an empty bottle of salad dressing that I vaguely remember shoplifting and guzzling straight from the bottle, I decided it’s time to detox again. I finished up the remaining half of the vodka (starting at 5am and done with it by noon). I spent the remaining half of the day debating myself on whether or not to go buy another bottle. 

I didn’t get the vodka, but I did go to the bodega by my building to buy a pack of cigarettes. The guy there knows I struggle with drinking and quitting the disgusting habit of smoking. He rations cigarettes for me. Only 2 cigarettes per day or else I’d chainsmoke the pack in 2-3 days. Anyway, this guy can’t be older than 25 years. He scolded me. He told me to get ahold of myself. He said I needed to take control of my actions. Having this kid reprimand me was embarrassing and made me feel more ashamed than I already am. His scolding was the reason I didn’t go to the liquor store to buy another bottle. I went back home instead. I appreciate his words. It was probably as uncomfortable for him as it was for me. 

I spent most of yesterday gagging and feeling like I needed to throw up. Tonight I can’t sleep. My heart is racing. However, I can’t help but wonder if the last two symptoms are psychosomatic because I was so traumatized by the last detox and am anxious about going thru it again. 

As I write this, I think I’m going into day 3 (it’s 1:20am where I’m at). I’m not 100% sure. I don’t want to count the days right now. For the moment, I am counting the hours; I simply want to get through one day at a time. 

I’m worried about the next 24-48 hours. The detox will be tough. I’ve never gone on a bender with liquor, so I suspect this is going to be a challenging day or two. 

Wish me luck. More importantly, wish me strength, fortitude, mental health, and physical health.",4

* Moving at a more natural rhythm. I'm wondering how I'll maintain this one as the world starts to speed up again.  This has been like a big global out-breath and that's been fabulous.
* Real connection and conversation with people I care about.  I've been even less interested in BS than usual.
* Real food -- discovered partially through my eating of less-than-good food during some of this time.  I'm lucky that I've only gained a few pounds through less activity and comfort foods like potato chips and bread, but even so...
* Music -- that's been a big one.  I'm grateful for Apple music, for my favorite playlists, and I've missed meeting with my two friends for our ""girls and guitars"" night (we finally did it last night anyway just because we really needed to)
* Walks outside. I'm grateful to live somewhere I can get out fairly easily, at least to open range and some coulees. Now that spring is really here, I'm looking forward to getting out even more.

Got old memories, only a few fond..........shit, maybe none.

I might still be dealing with the fallout this addiction has left , but I'm finally letting my body and mind heal. I said I was done drinking so many times in the last year but I honestly cant recall going an entire week without getting completely fucked up in 2019 , and the first 3 months of this year.

 I am proud to say that for the first time in 3 years I have been sober for a whole month. I'm afraid to pat myself on the back too much because I've seen how deep that hole goes and how easily I fell in it. Avoiding picking it back up hasn't been easy , after the first week I already started trying to make up reasons why one 6 pack or a couple mini bottles wouldn't hurt. This is my first post but I am thankful for everyone here , knowing I'm not alone on this is encouraging.

Waking up not having to worry about what I might have done while blacked out is a huge weight lifted. I honestly believed I had become immune to hangovers but my dumbass has come to realize ... I was just hungover all the fucking time and I got used to it. I didn't notice how bad I was feeling physically because it became normal to me. My body feels 1000% better , the past year I began to notice in the mornings my hands would be very shaky , I assumed it was from the extreme amounts of caffeine I had daily. But surprise surprise ! I still drink a pot of coffee everyday and no shaky hands! I knew I drank a lot but I hoped it wasn't bad enough to be giving me physical withdrawals.

It's been a good while since I've so much as lurked here but I'm hoping to spend some more time here going forward. I haven't drank in over three years at this point and if I could enumerate all of the ways my life has gotten better since then, this would be a very long post. Needless to say, it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. So if you're thinking about it or working on it, it's totally worth it. 

That said, while I've not had a drink in this long, I have had other habits sneak up on me in the meantime. I think I subscribed to the mindset that alcohol was my only problem, the one really taking a toll on my everyday life, and therefore I wouldn't be susceptible to habits outside of it. I probably didn't actually believe this, but naively that was the mindset I adopted. The fact that these habits weren't nearly as unhealthy and destructive as alcohol also fueled the fire. Anyway, I'm ready to shed these meaningless compulsions from my life to live 100% sober. It'll take time, and I've already tried many times (as I'd done with alcohol), but it takes every quit until you finally quit. To all of those out there, please stay vigilant--even if it's specifically alcohol and only alcohol you struggle with, it's incredibly easy to swap it out with something new. I'm happy to be back and hanging out with all of you wonderful people. Best of luck everyone, and stay safe! <3",3

Getting close to getting my 90 day chip and scared I might not get it.,"Want to start off with a little background. Was a blackout drinker almost nightly. Quit when they wife was all fed up with all my lies, selfishness, deceiving ways and other things. She was ready to leave and take the kids with her. I have been going to AA, which has been one of, if not the best things that has ever happened to me. Because without my sobriety I would have nothing. Having faith has made me such a happier person and I have a new way to look at life. 

I have not been working for almost a month now because of COVID-19 and honestly have been enjoying it. I have been doing the stay at home dad thing because my wife is an essential employee. While sometimes my girls (6 year old, 2 and half year old and 14 months) can really get on my nerves, they never get me to where I want to drink. On the other hand my job makes me want to drink for all kinds of reasons. I am a salesman at a small used car lot. That’s being said I’m sure you all can think of the normal stereotypes of a used car salesmen and most of them do fit at the car lot I’m working at. There is always a case of beer in the fridge and whiskey on someone’s desk.  Some of the guys start drinking before we even close. The peer pressure to join them is terrible. Even the owner will join in occasionally. Others like to do coke and other drugs through out the day at their desks. I have been there for a year now and use to think this was great but it was actually terrible for me because it really ramped my drinking up. Other then the drinking I am starting to feel like we really do take advantage of some people. Selling car that we know will come back with problems and fudging things on people’s credit, proof of income or insurance. Normal things when you think of a used car salesmen, I guess. Also living on commission has been really tough for me. Brings on a lot of worries and anxiety if I’m having a bad month. 

This is not who I want to be. I will steer people away from the junk cars and try to get my financial manger to do all my deals by the book. Now that I’m in AA and finally opened my self up to my Higher Power, I feel more strongly that this is not for me and that I should be doing something to help others or a least something where there is not constant temptations around and a steady pay. I am really thinking about going back to school to become an EMT and eventually a paramedic. I have been meditating and praying about it. 

I am scheduled to go back to work on Monday but am pretty nervous about going back to all that. I have been blessed that my wife has always been more of the bread winner and not paying for child care this month has made up for me not working anyways. This got a bit longer then I expected it would have so leave it at that and really would appreciate any advise.

Was sober 22 months. Slipped last October. One week sober today....But I don't care this time. I know drinking does not help me. That's how I'm off it a week. And I'm grateful for the fact I am trying despite my challenges, despite knowing I am going to face pain and loss this year....
But there's no enthusiasm this time.
I slipped because I could not face life.
When I got sober in 2018 life was amazing, rode the pink cloud for 9 months and when it ended as it does, I didn't push harder as adviced.
And now I'm here and I don't care as much. I'm not hopeful. I'm open to drinking again when lockdown ends but I'm an alcoholic. I can't drink..I thought I'd be the exception going back. I'm not different.
I'm at a crossroads and I don't feel enthused about getting sober again.
I did meetings. They got me sober. But I don't want to go back to them either. I can't willingly let go this time.
But I am still trying at everything. I know you call this doing it alone.
Anyone felt this way after going back and it all went to shit?",7

I’ve lurked here before, during periods when I’ve been tempted to quit drinking... but now I’ve done it. Background: I’m more of a binge drinker - I mostly drink in moderation, but then would have a horrible dangerous drinking episode about once a month. I started to notice my ~moderate~ drinking was becoming less and less moderate, and more and more frequent, and I was drinking alone. On top of that, my binge episodes were flat out dangerous - I realized that one of my binging episodes could put me in a hospital or jail or worse. 

So after a particularly bad episode, my therapist encouraged me to try to stop drinking. I figured I would try it out short term and see how it goes. The longer I’ve been sober, the more I’m realizing how dependent I was on binge drinking cycles and even just a couple of drinks in the evening to cope. I think long term sobriety seems to be the answer, but I’m absolutely terrified and overwhelmed now that I’m in it. Being sober feels hard, and painful, and lots of emotions/traumas/depression are coming up and I don’t have my usual crutch. I know I should keep going, and that it’s definitely the right road, but there are still parts inside of me that are screaming to quit this and drink. I’m having cravings, and feelings of “well, I was miserable before and I’m miserable now, so what’s the difference...” and feel like I’m in WAY over my head and unsure of what I’m signing up for. I’m venting and I don’t even know if this is the right space for this, so thanks for letting me yell into the internet void.... is this normal? I feel very lost and and confused and new to this process.",7

Everybody's happy in the second scenario and then as my wife is putting the kids to bed I'm chugging vodka from the bottle. Then we either hang out with friends where I will undoubtedly drink too much, or just my wife and I hang out together and I will drink too much, staying up too late in both cases. Then I will wake up very early, which I can't control and causes a major sleep shortage. Next I open a beer to make me feel better. The drinking will continue all day but the family usually has a lot of fun as it makes me happy and playful again. Bed time secret vodka chug, then drink too much with wife and/or friends.

""In my judgement, such of us as have never fallen victims, have been spared more from the abstinence of appetitie, than from any mental or moral superiority over those who have. Indeed, I believe, if we take habitual drunkards as a class, their heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with those of any other class. There seems ever to have been a proneness in the brilliant, and warm-blooded, to fall into this vice. The demon of intemperence ever seems to have delighted in sucking the blood of genius and generosity. What one of us but can call to mind some dear relative, more promising in youth than all his (her) fellows, who has fallen a sacrifice to his (her) rapacity? He (the rapacity) ever seems to have gone forth, like the Egyptian angel of death, commissioned to slay if not the first, the fairest born of every family."" 

\- Abraham Lincoln, address to the Washingtonian Temperance Society in Springfield, IL, 1842 (parenthesis are mine)

Basically Honest Abe is saying that people who have alcohol abuse problems are no worse than anyone else, and that this problem can and does happen to the best of us. He was telling us to see the person, not the problem. So chin up everyone, you are not less-than or worthless. You are you and that is brilliant.

2020-04-24 16:51:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g7gd2e/you_are_here/,You Are Here 📍,"Hi everyone!

My mind is current being blown by where I am in my AA program, and I thought that I'd share it with you all in case it might be helpful or interesting for somebody, and in case anyone has any feedback to give. I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm all ears.

I'm currently working on my fourth step. The fourth step is ""Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves."" It is the step that kept me out of AA for a long time. I was not interested in making a list of crappy things that I had done, and there was no *way* that I was going to share something like that with another person. It smacked of the religion of my childhood to me, and I was not interested in finding out what a terrible and flawed person I am. Tell me something I don't know.

What I am finding out in sobriety is that I create a lot of anxiety and fear for myself by assuming that I know what the future is going to be like. I assume that I know things that I don't know, and I couldn't possibly know, and I waste a *ton* of time and mental and emotional energy on working through various scenarios for scenario that I can't control or predict, which never happen. 

I never accurately predict anything. I can't think of one time where I thought that something was going to happen, and it played out pretty much how I thought it was going to. And yet I still go on working myself up by forecasting, planning for, and trying to control problems which don't even exist.

Case in point: my fourth step. By the time I actually got here, I understood that having a list of crappy things that I've done doesn't make me a bad person, it makes me a person. It's pretty much a part of being a human who's alive in the world. And through hearing other people talk about how they've addressed their own bad decisions and poor behavior, I've come to understand that there is a way for me to let go of my shame and get free from my past. I don't have to let past behavior rule my life, and I don't have to run away from it or try to hide it.

Which is not to say that my fourth step has been easy. It hasn't. It's a totally mind blowing and consciousness expanding experience, and not in a fun *""I can see through time and all time is now, I'm connected to everything,""* sort of way. This is the real deal. 

It's been slow going. And I'm not just talking about my avoidance and procrastination, although that definitely is a factor. (Just call me Ginger ""Avoidance"" Sprout. But I'll deal with that later, that's for later in the steps.) There's also just a lot to wrap my head around and digest, and I'm a big represser. There's a lot of stuff that I've just straight up repressed and not acknowledged, not even to myself. Doesn't mean it isn't there, it just means that it is taking me a bit of work to tease it out.

In the big book of Alcoholics Anonymous there's a little chart of a sample fourth step, and it's got stuff like, *""Who am I resentful at? Mr. Brown. The cause? He's flirting with my wife, he told my wife that I'm having an affair, and he might get my job at the office.""* (As a side note, my [new favorite t-shirt](https://www.woodenurecover.com/Mr-Brown-Needs-His-Ass-Kicked_p_119454.html) says ""Mr. Brown needs his ass kicked!"" across the chest in comic sans. I've shown it off to some AA friends in Zoom meetings and nobody else seems to think it's as funny as I do, but it amuses me to no end.)

My resentments are not as clear cut as that, and I honestly couldn't think of anyone who wasn't a blood relative or someone who I'd been romantically involved with who I had a resentment against when I started it. I talked through my process with my sponsor and where I was getting stuck and ended out writing quite a bit on each resentment before I started to see what was going on.

And holy crap. Holy crap. I'm wrong about everything. I'm not better or worse than I thought that I was before, although I am more human. I've just been... *wrong*. I haven't seen before now the way that I choose the situations that cause me pain and stress. My life didn't happen to me. I wasn't abducted by aliens and dropped into it. Every single aspect of my life is the direct result of choices that I made. It's... it's a lot to take in.

I haven't understood my role in my relationships. I'm a pretty self-reflective person, and I've done a lot of posting on here, a lot of journaling, and a lot of time in therapy. I'm seeing things that I've never seen before about myself and my life. It's uncomfortable. It's also just not at all what I expected. I thought that I already knew what I would be writing down before I wrote it down, but I was wrong. Completely wrong. 

But even though it's a lot to take in, it's not bad. I'm not a bad person. There's just things that were going on with me and motivations that I didn't really understand, and I have had absolutely no awareness of how my behavior affects others. I now understand why the literature of AA talks about this step in terms of a business taking a stock inventory. It's neither good nor bad, it's just reality as it is. And those who do not learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. I'm ready for something new.

I've heard an AA speaker talk about this step in terms of calling someone up, telling them that you're lost, and asking for directions. In order for them to give you directions you have to tell them where you are. I had no idea where I was. And I'm slowly figuring it out.

Anyway, that's it for me today, sobernauts. Thank you for being on this journey with me. I hope that you all are well.

I messed up yesterday. I’ve been quarantined with some toxic family members who have almost daily screaming matches in front of their two kids(8 & 13). I was so sick of being caught up in their drama I went to the liquor store to get myself a six pack and a bottle of whiskey. Not a good coping method, I know. I finished the beers way too quickly, and only had 1/5th of the bottle. The sister in law joined in with the whiskey, then her niece and nieces bf come over with a 30 rack. The night went on and we all kept drinking. It inevitably ended up with everyone yelling at each other over stupid shit. Today I have that same aura feeling and have been slowly drinking a couple beers so my body doesn’t go cold turkey.

That less so is still crucial, and I can’t deny what an impact quitting drink has had on my life. But don’t feel like a bad person if things still aren’t great for you, life is complicated and so are humans. You took a huge step by quitting drinking (or taking a break, or even just thinking about quitting), that alone shows what you’re capable of.

I just figured I could will myself through sobriety permanently. After all I had done for 2 years before.

Slowly as I began reading this subreddit and actually writing here, I did a complete 180. That doesn't happen to me very often. I'm usually pretty stubborn - just ask my wife. I can tell you assuredly, if that would not have happened, I would not be sitting at 82 days right now. There have been enough shitty little things that have happened in the past 45 that could have destroyed me.

I have a commonplace book where I store quotes from books, movies, songs, articles, etc - anything that I think can help me grow - and I actually label these things into categories. I just came across this quote while I was searching for something else.

""Focusing exclusively on what is in our power magnifies and enhances our power. But every ounce of energy directed at things we can’t actually influence is wasted - self-indulgent and self-destructive. So much power - ours, and other people’s - is frittered away in this manner."" -Ryan Holiday from Obstacle is the Way

I have never been able to live One Day at a Time in my life, until recently. I spent a lot of that time hungover and wondering why I did what I did the night before or said what I said. The only thing that is in our power is today. Not tomorrow. Certainly not yesterday. This moment right now is all you can control. And this moment I choose not to drink. I choose to live. I choose forgiveness for myself. I choose acceptance. And I choose love for myself.

Thank you SD for everything you do. For waking up with me every day and trying to live one day at a time as best you can. Sometimes we fall, but as Ess posted in the daily check in yesterday, it only matters that we get back up.

I’m technically essential so I’m working a bunch. I can’t go see family because of the obvious. I’m just going crazy. Everyone I work with drinks. I keep binge eating. I’m stressed and sad. And also a very large part of me thinks if my marriage fails I’m just going to start drinking again. And I HATE myself that there is almost a want for that and there would almost be a relief that I don’t have to try to be this sober happy person anymore for my husband. But I know I need to keep doing this for myself. The last time I drank was BAD. I drunk dialed the world. Drank so much and embarrassed myself. And I woke up and realized if I kept going, I would eventually drink myself to death. But somehow here I am wanting to drink. My girlfriends are planning a girls trip (obviously for a few months). And I don’t know if I’ll be able to go. Right now I think I would break and drink. But even if I’m in a healthier spot by then, they are big drinkers. When I was a drinker, would I have wanted a sober person just tagging along? 

Idk I’m stressed but won’t drink. I’m just mad and sad and miss my husband but at the same time am very scared about losing him. I know that was a lot of rambling. If you read that, thank you. I think I just could use some words of encouragement.

I was able to stop at 1, because I no longer like the way I feel while drinking.

I felt sleepy and dizzy, and this morning I’m having gastrointestinal tummy issues and acid reflux. My body is not used to the poison anymore, and feeling this bad after just a single drink shows me just how poisonous this stuff really is. 

I am in NO WAY advocating going back out and doing more “research.” For me, it helped me solidify my decision to remain sober and alcohol free. Life is just so much more pleasant that way!

I was a serial resetter for a while, and eventually after enough resets I had settled into thinking the best I could do was quitting drinking for a week or so at a time.  

My son was born 2 years and 1 month ago, and I remember on the day he turned 1 month I got absolutely hammered and blacked out.   I'm not sure why (there's never a good reason) I got so drunk, but I did and at that point I felt I was going down the same road my father had gone.  It was then that I decided to get the help I needed to quit, and it was the best decision I've ever made. 

I regret those cloudy memories from the first month of my son's life, but I'm ever thankful for having crisp, clear memories of every day for the last two years.   I did it for my family, but most importantly I did it for myself.  

So here I am two years later looking in disbelief at the little ""730 days"" next to my flair.

We recalled a story towards the end of my drinking from a night where I was clearly shitfaced, but lying about how much I'd drank.  She'd had enough, and she took our infant child into our bedroom, locked the door, and told me to fuck off.  She had to study for a test the next day, but didn't want anything to do with me.  I remember that night in fits and starts.  I remember laying on the couch trying to will myself back down from my drunkenness in hopes that I could be a functional member of my family for the evening.  I remember wanting to be mad at her, but just feeling defeated and pathetic.

That memory brought me right back to feeling the weight that addiction had put on myself and my family.  We were all living under the heavy, suffocating fog that my addiction had created.  My addiction didn't just infect me, it permeated through my relationships and household and every facet of mundane, everyday life.

Fast forward to today - in sobriety, I've started bicycle commuting to work.  I'm in an essential industry, so COVID hasn't slowed that down.  I used to dread the exercise that came with cycling, but now I cherish the peace.  You take in life so much differently from a bike than you do a car.  You notice the wildlife and the people and the weather and landscape and everything so much more.  After finishing my rides, I get a bump of endorphins from the exercise, but more than anything, having my 30-40 minute rides to slow down and notice the world around me fills me with peace.  It's incredible connecting with nature and my environment in the middle of a city.  I love not having the radio blasting shitty news in my ears to start my day.  It's my time, where I'm not forced to function as a husband or father or colleague first - I get some time to be alone in my own head.  It is peace and calm and quiet.

As I was riding home yesterday, I was loving the simple joy of motion.  I was flying down a hill, and ironically, I rode directly past my old liquor store (sometimes I even go through its parking lot if traffic is bad).  I ride, twice a day, past our old rental home, where so much of my addiction spiraled and affected my family.  The contrast hit me like a ton of bricks.

There, I lived under a suffocating weight.  I thought I was going to get swallowed up and die from all of that weight.  Today, I ride past with a soul and a conscience and a body that are much lighter.  Much healthier.  Free.

At the start of sobriety, I quit because I had to preserve my life, marriage, and job.  I wasn't choosing sobriety, as much as I was choosing to quit drinking.  Today, I choose sobriety, because it provides me so much more than drinking ever could.  Alcohol has lost its grip on me, and I am free.  I do not miss drinking.  I like this better.",193

(Sorry for any mistake, english is not my first langage)

I have been struggling with alcoholism for a few years now, and even though I am only 27, it did ruin my life. A year and a half ago, I had no family talking to me, I was in sick leave because my boss found me totally drunk at work, and I thought nothing could get better.

It was hard, I am not going to lie. It took me a year, between the first time admitted I was an alcoholic, and successfully quitting.  

I have a new job now, started really low, but working my way towards a real cool position. I have total access to alcohol, but I don't feel ""like"" drinking. 

Emotions are still hard. But now, I know that sometimes, it's better to suffer through it than numb the pain.

Things are not perfect, but if you had told me a year ago where I could be now... Let's just say I would not have believe it.

It's still a one day at a time, but I am quite happy.

The thing is : I was waiting for a sign. Any sign. And one day, I found out that there would not be any. I had to be the change. I chose to be my own sign, and since then, I have been sober. 

It's only my story, but, hey, I know that founding out that younger people could be alcoholic too made me feel less weird, and guilty. This illness does not have an age, and once you are hooked, you are hooked.

So I try to be happy, and proud of myself. Just as much as I can be impressed by other people on /stopdrinking. Peace to all of you.",16

My husband is a daily drinker so, while he’d be supportive of me, he’s also very quick to say “just relax, one isn’t going to kill you.”  Probably because when I don’t drink, it shines a light on how much he’s drinking and it makes him uncomfortable.  Also, I don’t want just one, I want 4 glasses of wine and would always drink more if I allowed myself to buy more.  I would always just buy one bottle at a time because if there was more, I’d drink it.  I’m so sick of feeling “off” every morning.  I’d also be lying if I said it wasn’t for vanity reasons too since it’s making me fat!  So I made it through day 1 and today is day 2...it almost makes it easier having made that commitment to my son because it takes the choice off the table.  It’s like the decision has already been made so I don’t have to go through the mental acrobatics every day around 4:00 pm about “if” I’ll drink or how much, etc.",132

I've been trying to quit for the best part of a year, so far very unsuccessfully. I have finally reached the point (in both my personal, and professional life) that if I don't quit now, things will start to deteriorate VERY quickly... 

I'm completely unproductive, sick & hungover constantly, and as I'm currently staying with my parents,  my family have started to notice my drinking. If they knew the true extent, this would cause MAJOR problems.  I'd give it a week before (if I carry on this way) I'll lose my job, lose my place on my collage course (due to start next year but I have final entrance exams coming up, and I'm on track to fail HARD) and do serious damage to my family relationships. 

I am well aware of the cliche that in order to change, you must first reach rock bottom, but tbh, that's something I'd like to avoid, and it's coming.

I think I'm finally ready to quit. Last night, I drank all of the alcohol I had left in the house - it sounds messed up, but I kind of wanted to say goodbye. Well, it sucked, and I'm done with it.

Thank you everyone who reads this, and thank you to everyone who posts here.

Where is the goalpost?","I lost track of when exactly I quit drinking, but it's been about two years. It was rough. I leaned hard on weed, and nearly fell into taking up smoking. ""Sobriety"" has taught me there's no real difference. I still struggle to stick to being half as productive as my peers, while beating myself up for just wanting to get buzzed and jerk off. I'm still me, and in the way of being someone better.

I struggled with being a dry drunk even before I found alcohol. There's mental health disorders in the family, I didn't qualify for medication, but my sibling did (Ritalin, etc). We all self medicated, and while I feel like I won't go back to alcohol, I won't deny that it did what I needed it to do.

I'm trying to cut down on weed now as well. I have this ideal self that is an accomplished something. Anything. Art, hobbies, career accomplishments, etc. But in the end I feel like I'm hard wired to exist for the drink... or anything else that's good in the right here and now. I've been having a lot of existential dread since genetic testing flagged a lot of uncommon genetics for dopamine problems. Apparently I have a ""Reduced Dopamine Receptor Density"" and have a ""Blunted pleasure response"" to all stimulus, and it's been tied to everything from accomplishing little in life to chronic drug use.

I've been meditating a lot of the ""why"" since I quit drinking. Why am I bothering to get sober. Why am I bothering to stay sober. At the start, I had it in my head that I get sober which makes me become a different person and the credits just roll off into the sunset.

I guess I'm wondering if I was wrong to expect greener grass? Where is the goalpost beyond simply quitting drinking? ",4

This Naked Mind has been very helpful in allowing me to see alcohol the way I view tobacco: as a highly addictive substance that is glorified in our culture.  
I like rebelling against the dominant paradigm, so rejecting booze makes a lot of sense.  
My spouse is still in a pretty steady daily cycle of drinking.  That has not been an issue as of yet (in terms of dealing with psychological yearning).

I was in the basement today trying to sort things out and I completely forgot the cases and cases of wine we have. My wife used to be the general manager at a local winery, and we would get really good wine by the truck load. There must be over 100 bottles in my basement. I also noticed the box that has  the leftover grain alcohol in it from when we made limoncello (traditional Italian recipe) for friends and family last Christmas. Also ran into my old cocktail shaker that I used to use to make awesome drinks for friends at get-togethers at our house. Hadn't seen any of that stuff since I've been sober.

Was I tempted today? No, not at all. 

Did it bring a bit of sadness to know that I can never enjoy those experiences again? Indeed.

With that realization, a bunch of  other realizations came washing over me. I'm not going to be able to have a glass of wine at family gatherings with my Italian relatives... one of my wife and I's  favorite pastimes (wine tasting) is a thing of the past... special wine will be served at our babies' baptism and I won't be able to cheers... not going to be able to toast with my brother when he gets married... my buddies who have microbreweries with delicious new IPA's that I won't be able to sample...on and on and on. It's depressing.

Not to mention... I don't know if I'm the minority here, but I actually LOVE the taste of alcohol. I hear all the time people saying ""man, I'm so glad I don't drink anymore, that stuff tasted awful!"" Maybe the folks that think it's gross are so far down the road they're drinking the cheap shit, but a glass of a big Cab, a complex microbrew IPA, a scotch with a nice peaty bite... I am genuinely going to miss the taste of all of it. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy I'm not drinking. I feel great, I'm happier and more productive, blah blah blah... all the great things that come with it. Obviously the pros outweigh the cons by a huge margin, but there are still lots of things I am going to miss about my past life. The worst part is, I did it to myself. Nobody forced all that booze down my throat... that was me. I've forgiven myself, but I know it's still nobody's fault but my own that all of these things I used to enjoy are off the table for me now... and that hurts. 

I'm not going to start drinking again, but seeing all that and having all those memories come back was bittersweet. I always had fun drinking and socializing with friends and family... but I fucked that all up by drinking by myself.",7

I struggle with alcoholism, I can now admit that. I don't need to drink all the time, but once I start I often cannot quit. I have other addictions, but alcohol is definitely right up there. I have some trauma from youth that probably played a role in all of this (I am sure it is not uncommon.) My problem was, I got lost in my trauma, I lost my sense of self. Alcohol, and others, I think became an escape.

Lately I have been getting some clarity in my life, I am seeing who I was, connecting with myself. That is a good thing. In fact, this coronavirus situation, given what it entails and that it sort of disrupts our personal situations, has even opened up more insight. I have been getting a lot of clarity in regards to what happened, how everything unfolded.

What is really hurting me right now, and this is the pity party, is the realization of how much of my life I spent lost from myself. I wasted many years waiting for things to just change. To be honest, there are a lot of ways in which I did not engage. So anyway, I am hyper aware right now that I have kind of just let my life happen, and now I am waking up to it all and it is very scary. I just wanted to express where things are at for me (vs. internalizing it all.)

I am at home, not the best situation, but it could be worse. I will not drink tonight, in fact I am going to get out for a quick (and safe) bike ride to let some steam off.

So my mom is a the typical 63yo mid/upperclass  woman: athletic, fit, very social and well functioning in her work. However since about 15 years her alcohol habit is getting worse. From drinking 5 glasses of wine each day when I was still living with my parents 9 years ago It has increased to 6-10 glasses. She often drinks secretly after diner and makes up excuses why it’s an occasion to drink a glass extra. My dad also drinks 3 glasses every day but he never has more and he has had days that he had non. I’m positive my mom has not had a alcohol free day in 10 years. She starts around 17:30 when shes making dinner. Never earlier. 
We’ve had fights about it for over 10 years and she admits she has a problem. However, it is still getting worse and she does nothing about it. Today I told her that I don’t think she can cut down on it and should quit completely. She doesn’t want to hear it. Also my dad wants to enjoy a glass a couple times a week. What can I do? I see my parents about 2 days every month. I have two brothers who strongly agree with me.",5

Well, I have thought about posting a lot the last couple of weeks and haven't. I look at the posts in here a million times a day (especially now not working), and I post here and there. Even at 113 days sober, I've been having a super hard time not drinking, especially lately with the pandemic, but also due to some new noisy neighbors. Anyway, long story short because I literally always write novels on here, but I had a dream last night that I was being held hostage and at gunpoint along with a room full of other people. The guy holding us all hostage came directly up to me and put a gun to my face, asked me something about where paper is made (???) and then walked away. But the thing is, everyone in the room started pulling out cases of beers (my favorite beer!) and I wouldn't drink them. I was the only one approached with the gun directly, and I still wouldn't drink. So, I know that that is that stubborn side of me coming through. Lol. No matter how many times a day I want to drink, I haven't. IWNDWYT P.S. I think the hostage thing might be about the neighbors lol I actually said to my Husband through tears last weekend that I feel like I'm being held hostage in our apartment with all the noise these people make, but it's gotten a little better, and our plan has been to move soon anyway and buy our first house, so it's kinda been the push we needed to buckle down and work on making that a reality sooner rather than later.",3

One of the biggest things I feel missing from my life since I started drinking regularly is being excited and interested in things. When I was younger I would stay up all night playing with some new software, practicing one of my hobbies... All fuelled by nothing more than some diet Coke and Pringles...

These days, nothing seems to interest me. I have tonnes of hobby projects I want to start but when I think about it, it just feels more effort than pleasure.

The other big issue is that I need to learn some new skills and find a new career, but sitting down and trying to learn something new is virtually impossible. I'll read a paragraph and realize nothing has gone in...

Anyway, obviously lying is never helpful, but if people can honestly tell me that they know where I'm coming from and that their own excitement and attention came back when they stopped drinking, that'd be a great motivator for me to stop.

Again, best wishes to everyone out there. Stay strong.",10

I am a 24 year old male at the tail end of the early 20s party faze and I have some questions and second thoughts about whether I am an alcoholic or not. I'll try to make it as short yet detailed as possible to give some backround on my situation. I aquired a fake ID at the age of 18 and from that point up until now I spent most weekends and some weekdays partying at bars and clubs with friends. I was lucky to land a pretty good job with great income and never really let my partying affect my work until recently, so I always had the funds to live a pretty crazy lifestyle. I should also add that I always had issues with anxiety but I never felt like my drinking and party made it any worse until now. For years I partied all the time and had no issues untily recently. Now every time I drink, I am plauged with this terrible anxiety and impending doom for the next few days. That has led to me using more alcohol the next day to combat the anxiety caused by the last drink. That worried me because I didn't seem like I was drinking for fun anymore. I recently decided to take a break from alcohol and I am seeing a doctor for the anxiety and I am on two new meds for anxiety. So I guess my question is..once I get the anxiety under control should I drink again? Can I drink again? I love going to the bar and having a few drinks with my friends but recently I feel like maybe I've been self medicating for my anxiety disorder? And lately ""a few"" drinks has been a lot more than just a few. Has anyone else ever experienced that anxiety the days after drinking? Any insight, experience and help is appreciated!",5

Didn't drink the night after - sunday night binged until  a few days ago. Got sober again. Didn't drink. I skip my naltroxone sometimes cause the side effects make me feel so dizzy and weird.

I take .5 ativan if I plan to not drink sometimes as it helps the anxiety and I know that I cannot drink on it (bad things or dangerous to sleep mixing them)

It's hard, I know how good I feel, physically and mentally when i don't drink but then I make excuses and feel - alone without it. I mainly started drinking heavily at 25 to help insomnia from ptsd.

Let’s rewind. Before quarantine. I successfully gave up drinking by reading “this naked mind” creating a sober ig. And podcasts lots of podcasts. I went to the gym I lost 20lbs I was KILLIN IT. 

I felt great. Everyone could see. My DH and DD were proud! Me and my DD went on a trip and seeing all my friends and family I caved I had one drink. I felt fine. I felt like I successfully defeated my monster. Little did I know my personal monster is just as smart as me and cunning. He was playing dead. Looking back on it. And instead of shooting him one more time...because we all know the villain doesn’t die on the first try... I went on with an inflated ego like yah I did it!!! And you know I didn’t drink the rest of that trip. Got back home feb 5th..still no drinking...still just looking in checking in on my “dead” demon. Yup still dead yay!!! 

All goes well...until the ping of no wait... wave of terror of the virus comes. I keep checking in on my demon...I start seeing shallow breaths.... this can’t be happening...slowly but surely his eyes open. He sees me. Smirks. I’m frozen in fear. My mind screaming run RUN!!! But I can’t... he gets up stretches...what a nap! He laughs. 

It’s not going to be like last time...I promise...

I’m still frozen.

Fuck. Why did I keep the body?!? Why didn’t t I just bury him. Fuckkk. Because I needed a trophy of success?? Damnit. 

My monster laughs again. To try to ease my racing thoughts. Dude. “Life is crazy did you see the news? Doesn’t your mom live on the east coast. Oh shitttt everyone you love does!! Ok hear me out I want you to feel better. You can do this. You will be fine. Look now I’m just like kitten...I too...have battled my own...I’m ok now. You have to believe me” 

I start warming up to the idea. I mean if anything I can kill him. But he looks alright. Maybe he’s changed? I dunno but he’s right just one drink. I’ll feel better. I’m ok. Now. 

One month later-*

Heavy drinking. Shots in the morning. I keep telling myself I’m ok because I haven’t been “wasted” I’m still keeping up on my chores. Taking care of my family. 

Until the other night. Oh the other night. I had a drink in the afternoon nothing crazy went about my day. My DH said have the night off I got DD. 

Fun fact of DH he’s a normie. He’s not like me. He’s different. Maybe because he’s an Aquarius he just... is easy going and very responsible. He didn’t exactly enable me I think he saw this thru the quarantine lens. He just wants me to be ok. 

Anyway. So back to it. I’m kid free. Im in the living room dranking. DD asleep. DH in his music room chilling like a human. Me and monster decide to go check on him. It’s dark now and he says look. I look out the window my cranky old neighbor is in our lawn looking for fruit. I saw “go home” and laugh and my DH starts telling me to shut up. Oh gosh. Not good. I go off a little bit about how I don’t like our neighbor...haven’t for years he’s old white and takes takes takes. Ugh. I know he heard me because the window was still open. My DH calms me down . We have sex. I’m probably loud because I’m drunk. The window is OPEN. We live on a quiet street. I fall asleep wake up at 3am. I’m shaking. The shame shudders comes. My nerves are fried. I’m shaking in embarrassment. 

I have not behaved like that in a VERY long time. I can’t even think about anything. I’m spinning from anxiety. I’m so embarrassed. What now?? How do I apologize to my neighbors??? How??? 

I get on Reddit. I’m still sore. In that moment I turned to my monster. He laughs like he does. And I pushed him in his cage. He’s pacing he’s mad. But this time. I’m going to make sure he stays where he needs to be. I’m so done. I have to be done.

Anyways I spent yesterday in bed. Online. Being completely loved by family. I just keep repeating “I am worthy. I am worthy of forgiveness. I am worthy of love. “ truly taking this day by day.

2020-04-23 13:49:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g6r9fp/im_new_in_town_hi/,"I'm new in town, hi","Hello everyone! I'm new to Reddit and found this... group(?)... thread(?)(I haven't picked up on all the lingo yet) this morning while browsing/procrastinating on school work. 

I was very excited to find a community like this here, so I wanted to say hi and explain my personal journey a little bit! According to the app on my phone, I'm 37 days and 13 hours sober- I'm not sure if it shows my count the same way the badge bot does because I haven't posted anything to see what that counter says yet, but either way it's now the second longest I've been willingly sober in probably 8.5 years.

Since the first time I drank more than a sip of some very awful peppermint schnapps in high school I've pretty much had a problem with alcohol. I come from a long line of alcoholics on both sides of my family, am pretty much 50/50 Mohawk and Irish, with a history of mental health struggles (MDD and BPD chief among them), so I was basically born for it.

I went too hard too fast as long as I could remember, and even once I started to learn my limits, I constantly ignored them. Most of the time I was a happy drunk, or self destructive at worse, but I grew up in a household with a violent and mean alcoholic, and I wasn't like that, so it took me a long time to accept I'm too. 

The longest I've been sober, ever, since I was legally allowed to drink was when I was going through initial entry training for the Army- our lives were heavily controlled and monitor, so there really just wasn't an opportunity for drinking. That was about five months of sobriety, but I don't count it in my previous attempts because it wasn't really a personally choice. 

The longest time besides that was around the time I was getting ready to leave the Army and for a little while after. Although I'm not sure exactly how long that stint with sobriety lasted, I've been telling myself it was about four and a half months.

I've tried getting sober, with varying degrees of seriousness, too many times for me to count. There were times in my life, for months, and on several different occasions, that I was drunk more days than I was sober. I would drink with friends at night, wake up still drunk the next day, take another shot- or three, because what would just one really even do?- to get me through the morning, then again on lunch, and as soon as I was off of work again, rinse and repeat.

Most people in my life aren't aware of the extent to which I've struggled, so they're also not away how far I've come. I would like to share my excitement with my irl friends, but I don't know how to tell them about it, and have them understand, without opening up about the bad stuff too. 

This was all very long winded, so I'll stop after I add I'm just really grateful this place exists on Reddit and that I'm able to be apart of it to witness everyone's journeys together.",45

Since my divorce I have been drinking a lot. A lot. Recently I discovered bourbon. Not good. I just finished my third bottle and I just know it has to be the time. When I blew through a big Jim Beam so fast I knew shit was getting real. On lockdown the temptation to start earlier and earlier is getting worse. 

I wont go into my story, we all have stories. I have a few Ativan and Ambien so if push comes to shove there's that. I honestly don't know if I will feel withdrawal, it has been that long. Sigh. 

I recently met someone. A great woman who has fallen head over heels for me. I never thought anyone would love me like this and I don't want this getting in the way. Especially when, at this point, I hate it so much. 

Lately I have been wondering why I am so down even though I am happy about the girl. I think it is because I hate feeling like booze has me by the balls.

Anyway, just wanted to post this and tell the internet I am here, I am going to seriously try to quit and start living my life....for real

My mattress has had a dent in the middle of it for the longest fucking time. I mostly never cared or noticed because I’d go to bed drunk. Well, now that I’m sober when I go to sleep, it really bothered me.

Ordered a new mattress, and it came yesterday. Gotta say: I have had some great sleep since giving up the bottle, but last night, I slept like a ROCK. I was OUT within a matter of seconds when I closed my eyes and woke up so refreshed. 

I’m still stuck in quarantine here in PA until AT LEAST May 8. I’ve been doing shit around the house and trying not to go crazy. The boredom isn’t fun at times, but I’m learning how to deal with boredom rather than turn to booze. So, in a way, quarantine has taught me a lesson.

I took some real steps to turn things around and I’m happy with all the positive changes but it cost me a lot to get to this point. Lost the only home I ever wanted and the love of my life, 18 years of struggles and sacrifices flushed down the drain. I accept responsibility for being where I am today.

    Where I’m living is what is causing me issues. When I hit bottom I had no place to go so I begged to set up in the holiday trailer in our yard. (Small acreage) that was ok and gave me the alone time to reflect and plan steps to get better. A cold snap hit and it was costing quite a bit to heat the trailer. During this time I was talking with and spending small bits of time with my wife. So when it got cold she offered for me to come back to the house and set up a bed and I’ve been in here ever since. Its a unique arrangement in the way that we play house and everything feels normal but for the no physical contact and separate beds. We spend the days in isolation just the 3 of us and act like life is normal. (Minus my drinking) if you saw us interact you would never think that we were not a family. Got the chickens and geese for the year delivered for the summer and are pre planting for the start of the garden next month. 


    I don’t want to sound ungrateful because I really had no place to go and being here for my daughter is good for everyone. By that mean the lockdown, school cancelation, and utter destruction of my industry from all this gives me the days to help her with school and I’m even doing the kitchen reno that I had wanted to do for a very long time. 

    I do these things to keep busy, contribute and it feels good to use my hands and remember the skills that I set aside to drown my life in booze. I’m attentive and engaged in all the things I should have done for all those years. I know that regret, shame and self hate are not productive and I keep them in check. 


      Spring is here and it’s warm out, snow is mostly gone go walks in the yard are regular. Makes me sad to think of what I could have accomplished. I don’t know what’s going to happen with me and my wife. I walked thought the yard looking at the work that could be done and how bad I want to do it now, all I can think is “I’m going to miss this place” and I cry. There is no time line for me leaving or if it’s ever even going to happen but it’s the not knowing. I know I did this to myself and I’m not that man anymore and that makes it harder as I see clearly again. 

    A standard breakup would include me leaving, splitting bills and arrangements for seeing my daughter. But this virus isolation and shut down of businesses has me in kinda a weird purgatory where I feel and act like normal during the day but I can’t kiss my wife’s neck when she is doing dishes and we go to our respective beds at the end of the day. I don’t want to go, but I not knowing if we will reconcile, 0 job prospects, and wondering if I should just get on with my life is causing me unease. I also worry that if I just pretend everything is fine that I will be crushed when it’s time for me to leave if that’s the outcome here. But I like doing the jobs around here and feeling normal. I think I would feel awkward if I was treated different in my own house. It’s not a bad situation all things considered but I don’t know if I’m just not letting go and subjecting myself to this make believe to remind myself of what I lost..... 

Im probably overthinking it. Enough to drive a man to drink.... jk IWNDWYT",1

Background:  I was a fairly heavy drinker, medically speaking, in that I probably averaged 15-20+ drinks per week (I'm a 120 lb. woman).   I was more of a binge drinker, so most of the drinking was on the weekend, but my non-drinking days were getting fewer and fewer and I usually had a shot or two (or three) of whiskey most evenings.  Anyway, I had always noticed that the later I stayed up and the more I drank, the earlier I tended to wake up the next morning.  In fact, it was a running joke that while everyone else was still sleeping it off, I'd be up and sort of vibrating with nervous energy at 6 or 7 AM.  As time went on, I noticed I started waking up earlier and earlier and being more and more ... wired, for lack of a better word;  I mean, I'd be physically and mentally exhausted and hungover, but totally unable to sleep.

By last winter, I had started waking up at 4, 3, or even 2 AM and be almost in a panic attack state -- sweating, heart racing, anxious, et., and totally unable to go back to sleep.  I also had a blackout which terrified me. After a boozy pub crawl in December, I decided that my drinking was maybe getting out of hand, and that I should take a few weeks off to ""re-set"".  After reading ""This Naked Mind"" and ""Alcohol Explained,"" I decided to stop drinking for good.  

During the first two weeks, I had hot flashes, night sweats, daily headaches, sugar cravings, and complete exhaustion.  After about two weeks, I felt really good physically but mentally, I was a rather depressed and moody, which lasted another two weeks or so.  After a month or so, I felt really, REALLY good physically and mentally.  

Four months later, the pandemic quarantine started getting to me and I had 2-1/2 beers on Easter.  I wasn't drunk, just pretty buzzed, and I made sure to drink a lot of water, eat something and sober up before going to bed.  But, I still woke up at 1:30 AM, sweating buckets, my heart racing, and was totally unable to go back to sleep for the rest of the night.  I had night sweats for the following 2 nights, and then insomnia and anxiety for almost two weeks.  

Needless to say, this reinforced my decision not to ever drink alcohol again.  But, my physical/mental reaction seemed all out of proportion to the amount of alcohol I drank.  My husband (who likes to drink and misses his drinking buddy, although he has been reasonably supportive) insists that this is psychosomatic and that I've just convinced myself that I have bad reactions to alcohol.  I told him no way, I would \*love\* to be able to just have a beer or two on occasion like a normal person -- but apparently I'm not a normal person.  

Anyway, sorry for the long post. Has anyone else experienced a reaction like this to moderate amounts of alcohol?",1

I’ve been drinking everyday for months and months. I’ve had a drinking problem for about five years now. One week ago today I was experiencing the worst physical and mental withdrawal symptoms I’ve ever had after a 5 day bender. I can’t believe how much has changed in 7 days!

This is the longest I’ve gone without taking a sip since the fall of 2017 after I was hospitalized because of withdrawal symptoms. I stayed sober for 11 days then, but only because I stayed with my parents for those days & was closely monitored. The second I got back to my apartment, I was drinking again.

I know not everyday will be easy. I know a lot of days are really gonna be hell. But I’m not thinking about those days. I’m taking it one day at a time & today, I’m taking this win & it feels fucking good!

I've been in low places before - embarrassing myself at family events, too many nights I don't remember, trips to the ER - the list goes on. I think I've hit a new low. This morning, as my husband left for work, he told me that if he finds out I drank today (he is still going into the office to work, I am WFH) he isn't going to sleep at home tonight. We've been married 5 months today. It's absolutely soul-crushing, but also exactly what he should be doing. I've struggled with treatment resistant depression for about 6 years now, and alcohol has always been what I leaned on. Self-medicating has been my thing. I got sober for almost a year, then I was 'moderating', which turned into getting blacked out, which is now at the point that I am WFH and getting booze delivered so I can be drinking while working... My own words don't even sound rational to me. 

Last night was the first time I said out loud that I don't have control. I just don't. I've been lying about that to everyone, including myself, for far too long. I've been ashamed and afraid to see friends I drank too much in front of for far too long. I'm quitting for good this time. Not 'cutting back for awhile' - I just need to be done. Booze has helped me have a lot of good times, but it is literally the only thing in my life that causes the bad times. There is no question I need to give it up.

So, as a true alcoholic would, I kissed my husband goodbye and told him I would not drink today. Then, once I knew he was gone, I grabbed a canned margarita from my stash of 4, poured it into a glass with ice, and drank it, before 8am, as what I hope to be my last alcoholic beverage. Now I'm here, basically brain-dumping on all of you. So, to anyone who took the time to read, thank you. I have a feeling, and I'm hopeful that, I will be here a lot more in the coming days. I can do this.",4

I'm not sure why I think I can moderate.  A few weeks ago I was the one waking up clear headed, feeling great, and doing things right.  Since then I've used this virus, the good weather, and Frank Sinatra albums as reasons to enjoy relaxing with a nice glass or 10 of wine, I don't know why I even use a glass at all to be honest.  Well, I'm done.  Each night I frantically tried to create the perfect environment to drink in, but there was nothing but anxiety and a strong sense of regret.  I feel pickled this morning as I try to work.  That sick, poisoned feeling is swimming in my head, and all my joints hurt.  My teeth even hurt, probably because I always forget to brush and floss at night when I drink.  
It's not worth it guys, there's nothing good about this.  When you get the sensation that you need to celebrate a little and give yourself a little pat on the back for staying sober, don't celebrate by thinking you can moderate.  I used to have nightmares about ending up here again, and here I really am again.  I wasn't even able to pretend to have a good time even for one minute.

Yesterday was awful for me. I’m a binge drinker anyway, and usually space myself out at least two days between binges, sometimes up to four. But I don’t remember the last time that I went more than four days without a binge, except for when I was pregnant.


The last two days have been especially full of triggers. The control board on my stove went out. My wife dumped an entire quart of oil in the lawnmower, flooding it and necessitating a clean out and a tuneup. At work yesterday my supervisor and one of my staff got into it on a conference call, placing me in the middle of the yelling match between them. 


The conference call was mid morning, and sent me into a grumpy mood for the rest of the day. My wife got home with the things needed for the tuneup and I realized I couldn’t find my spark plug socket and couldn’t finish it, so the yard didn’t get finished and looks like crap. I got the new control board in for the oven and went to replace it. After replacing the board it wouldn’t power on. I disassembled the back panel on the oven and tested all the power supplies, and the new board which was fairly expensive was the problem. All I could think about was having a drink. I didn’t want a drink, I wanted lots of drinks, so I could forget the crappy day that had occurred. 


On top of all of this I’m dealing with a mini crisis with my wife’s mental health and that road is for sure bumpy right now.


But I didn’t drink. I had some water, went to bed early, and kept repeating to myself that drinking wasn’t worth the cost. I knew that I was already in a bad mood and that drinking could potentially make me quick to pick a fight with my wife due to all of the stressors of the day. I didn’t drink because I made a pledge in the sub yesterday that I would not drink with you all.


This morning I woke up without a hangover! I got up, got a cup of coffee, and felt great. 


I was able to call the appliance place and get the replacement board on the way before my work day started. I’ve got a plan to finish the lawnmower repair. And I feel good enough to brave leaving the house to get the parts needed. 


I didn’t have a fight with my wife.  :) 


I’m ready to face my day, sober.

Slip on the bathroom floor and fake a sore back?  And then, around the 8-9 second mark — I realize (not unlike a bad dream) that I didn’t drank the night before and that it’s going to be okay.

Good Morning,

My wife is pregnant, 17th week, yesterday we knew we have a healthy girl. I had to wait outside the clinic and when I got the news there were no smiles or happy celebrations. We have been having a rough few weeks were we barely speak. She is sad, or angry, or sleepy or all at the same time. The quarantine is not helping either. There isn\`t much I can do about that, I try not to make things worse. 

In the car when coming back home I asked again what was wrong and if she is happy ""I\`m happy she is healthy, the rest I\`m not"" and enumerated an number of things she is mad about, all related to what I do or don\`t do, or care or don\`t care about. There are things I can do better, and things I wont. I take feedback, process it and make changes. 

I am a very independent person. I say what I think un-apologetically, I do what I have to do, I don\`t ask for permission. I\`m working from home and doing everything I can to mitigate the risks of this pandemic. 

This whole situation has taken a toll on me, I need dopamine. My insidious alcoholic brain has been ""suggesting"" the idea of ""have a bottle of whiskey, 3 years sober, you got this shit under control"".

So yesterday in the car I thought If we cant celebrate we will have a healthy daughter, ""what\`s the fucking point?"" so I got myself a bottle of whiskey, a good one, for old time sake. 

Got home, we had an argument about it, I was determined. I got the bottle I was gonna drink it. I dont\`t do things not do them. 

She saw the bottle and we had another argument. Now I was ""the perfect house-band, all the effort and values I had build over the last 3 years down the toilet, bla bla bla"" I didn\`t give a shit, 30 mins ago I was the worst now I\`m the perfect guy. Again I was determined to drink it. I told her I wasn\`t happy with the whole situation and and that moment tears started coming out. They are again while writing this. I feel very distressed. 

Long story short, I ended up pouring the whole bottle down the kitchen drain crying stating I didn't want to be hungover today, or right now. 

That was a really close call. Damn this is hard.",72

I mean, that is kind of the reason we are all here on this SubReddit, but what am I REALLY addicted to?  It is not just the substance, it is what I WANT the substance to bring me.  I am addicted to the feeling of being confident, of hoping things are okay without having to try, of having peace of mind.  Of things not just FEELING okay, but actually BEING okay.  I am addicted to a sensation of accomplishment, and fulfillment, of knowing I did the right thing.  Of wanting the World to be okay and of the sensation of being safe.  I am addicted to the idea of laughing my head off watching a show, and of writing creatively, and composing personally meaningful music.  I am addicted to a lack of worry about my loved ones and I am addicted to the sense of certainty that all is going to be okay for everyone, everywhere in the end forever.  Frankly, if I had thought 18 years ago that rubbing myself with blue sandpaper four times a day would bring me the same sensation as all of that, I would have done it.  It is not just BECAUSE it is alcohol, but because it is what I WANT alcohol to bring me (which of course it never actually does because a substance does not actually make ANY of those things happen, even the sensation in my head while intoxicated does not fully make me feel that way, even internally).  Separating out that those other things are what I actually want helps me separate what I feel I need to do to feel that way.  Alcohol does not bring me that?  Oh.  Well, I guess I better try working out, and  eating well, and drinking water, and focusing on others, and staying connected with friends, and pursuing my hobbies, and staying focused at work...THOSE things bring about all the stuff that I am actually addicted to.  Once that realization kicked-in, it was at least a little easier to lay-off the drinking because it really is not drinking that I am after.  Thank You.",137

The one year mark has always been to me the ultimate milestone. At some point in the past year I became positive I would make it here, and then I’ll just count my years sober. That’s how strong I felt. If I could go to multiple weddings, advertising agency parties, vacations, and even an all inclusive resort, surely I could do anything sober. 

The last month or two put me a little more in check. At the end of February I found out I was pregnant with baby #2, yay! I found it very easy to stay sober when I was pregnant with #1, in fact alcohol repulsed me then. It’s crazy how even being pregnant, this pandemic has brought out those little voices telling me I want to drink. Of course I haven’t, and I know I won’t, but it drives me crazy that I keep thinking about it. It’s all over Instagram, I feel like several people I know are drinking everyday, and I’m not judging - they might not actually have problems, might actually just be posting a drink here and there and it seems like more. And also it doesn’t help being at home and feeling like crap... this morning sickness reminds me of a hangover, and I was always a fan of a little hair of the dog.

Anyway, all that to say that I learned my lesson. I can feel great in my sobriety most of the time, but still gotta recognize that anything can bring back those temptations.

I had gotten fired from a job and immediately bought a 6 pack of a HIGH abv beer and drank them all that night, and never stopped. 


On Sunday, I drank an entire 6 pack of the same beer to myself after meaning to buy it and make it last a couple days, cause, ya know, pandemic. I had been accidentally doing that the past few days, “stocking up” on beer and drinking way more than I meant to. 


Anyway, I woke up Monday with an awful hangover (which I usually don’t get, so clearly I drank a bit too much) went to work and powered through. On my way home, there’s a fork in the road. One lane turns to town, (aka where the beer is) and one lane turns to my house. For some reason, I chose to just go home. And I didn’t drink. 


Normally, if I saved beers I’d be like “oh, well I have two left, but I’m gonna want to have a third and maybe a fourth so I should buy another six pack,” and the chain would continue like so. Previous days beers left, have to get more or it’s not a good night of drinking. 

I’ve quit twice now and started back up, but now I’m realizing nothing good has ever happened because of alcohol. Maybe because of the people I’ve been around and because I wasn’t TOO inebriated, but never BECAUSE of alcohol directly. In fact, most of the worst stuff that’s happened to me has been directly because of alcohol being a factor. I’m realizing I will never achieve my goals or dreams if I continue to drink. I’m realizing I will only feel good for the first sip, and as soon as the buzz hits I will feel guilty and finish the beer to suppress those feelings of guilt. And then I’ll have another and another until I’ve had the whole six pack, and I still feel empty and I still want more. It’s like trying to fill a strainer with liquid, it’s just gonna pass through the holes, when what I really need is to fill my strainer with gold nuggets, with a full, sober, happy life and lots of love and healing. 

I truly want it this time, because it’s for me. Because I finally regret things and don’t think it’s fun anymore. Because I finally want better for myself and think I deserve it. Because I think I am a smart, capable woman beyond the fog of alcohol. I don’t have any illusions that this will be easy, but being an alcoholic wasn’t easy either. I’d rather do the hard thing that will bring me true joy instead of a false sense of happiness that ends as soon as I’m out of booze. 

I’m worried about getting sober during a pandemic, but I thought, what better time to self reflect and work on myself than in a moment where I have so much free time. I hope nothing happens to me amidst this chaos of the pandemic, but if it does, I’d rather be sober and know I was trying to be a better person than drunk and always hoping for more.

That’s the “Johnny Appleseed Hymn,” which I first learned in a very secular context. Johnny Appleseed was an interesting character. He was not only a nurseryman spreading apples and other plants across the American frontier, but also an itinerant preacher who chose poverty. “He submitted to every privation with cheerfulness and content” read one of his obituaries. Interestingly, the apples he planted may have been useful only for cider. Instead of spreading food, he brought alcohol. A strange twist to a now-mythical figure.

It does seem a fitting hymn to mark Earth Day, itself a very secular concept. I got to spend time outside today in the silence of my self; something I need and am extremely thankful for. Sun and rain, today, and the earth was good to me.

Then I realized how many times I've done that before.  

If I go back to drinking I know it will probably end up just like it always does.  I'll moderate for a week or two. Maybe even a month, but it always escalates.

I think back about my past behavior.  How I used to drink at work just to ease the withdrawals.  How I missed a week of work because I went on such a bad bender and how I literally thought I might die from the following withdrawals.

There was fun times sure.  I will miss going out with friends.  But I won't miss having to sneak off to the bar for a quick shot while out to eat with my family.  Or taking airplane bottles or my flask with me when visiting relatives just in case there wasn't booze around.

These weren't the habits of someone that can moderate.

I know I'll probably be tempted again.  I just hope I can remember this.  My hope is writing this out will help.

Anyways, IWNDWYT.",79

Today, my girlfriend of over 2 years told me that she wants tiime apart to decide if it is possible for our relationship to continue because of my drinking and the lies and hurt I've caused because of my addiction. We live together, and we used to talk about the long term of getting married, buying a house together and having kids. She once was crazy in love with me.

I was a big and frequent drinker before the relationship both in a social setting, and just by myself. I am not a daily drinker, but it is definitely an addiction. I have frequently hidden my drinking from her in all sorts of despicable ways. For the past year, it has been a cycle of her telling me she is worried I drink too much and that she knows I've hidden it from her. I then apologize, get sober for a couple weeks, decide to start drinking ""moderately"" again, only to fall completely back into old habits.

 I have been too selfish and dumb to truly understand how much hiding my addiction hurt her.  I have broken all trust she had in me, and she is not sure if she can trust me again. It's killing me inside to know that I hurt her so much, and that I may never be able to regain her trust or love no matter what I do.

I know now that I need to completely stop drinking to have a chance, but the thought of this is terrifying. It has been my crutch for so many social gatherings, and for curing my boredom and stress. I definitely will need some support. I wish I would have posted here sooner. IWNDWYT!",3

2020-04-22 22:35:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g6eq3b/1365/,1/365,"Hi, today is my day 1. I would like to share some of my backstory, both so you all can get to know me and I can put some of what I'm feeling out into the internet world.

Today is the 20 year anniversary of my dad's passing. He was 21 when he got my mom (17) pregnant, and they split sometime when I was a toddler. I saw him a few times a year, which stopped when I was about 8 as he was in prison for 1 year due to an accumulation of DUIs. When he was released from prison in early 2000, he seemed to have a new outlook on life and wanted to be more present in my life. I remember seeing him on my birthday in early April and again on Good Friday, which seemed like a good change compared to seeing him 3-4x a year. I found out on Easter morning he had passed away in a off-roading accident while under the influence. He was only 31 years old. I was 10.

I started drinking when I was 15 and save for a few months of intentional sobriety here and there, I've never stopped for longer than a month at a time. I've always told myself if I can stop for a month here or there, I didn't really have a drinking problem. I would like to say I have things ""under control"", but honestly it ebbs and flows and I definitely fall under the binge drinking category. Recently, I've been noticing myself becoming more and more defensive and irritable when I drink; something I want to stop before it begins driving away the people in my life. 

As a way for me to both reassess my relationship with alcohol, and to honor my dad, I am committing to 1 year of sobriety starting today. I don't anticipate wanting to stay sober after that, but who knows. The idea of ultimatums and things being permanently ""off limits"" seems unrealistic and daunting to me, but maybe that will change as I adapt to sober living. All I know is I want to take a meaningful break... so, here we go.",15

Plus I have studying to do. This past 4 days I’ve made myself extensive To do lists. Nothing complicated, make breakfast, walk dog, wake kids etc. I felt hugely accomplished to finish them. I’ve focused my mind on things I couldn’t do when I started hitting the wine at 5 pm on the dot (which eventually became 1 pm with the quarantine). Read, exercise, meditate. 


Is wine out of my mind entirely? No. I’ve been reading Annie Graces this naked mind and although she says alcohol doesn’t taste good, I liked the taste of red wines. However, I also like tea, juice and candy. Also, fizzy water. I’m not addicted to any of the other things mentioned there. I can go a year without candy or even tea. It’s a lie to say I only drank red for the taste, it was the buzz which then became my downfall. My own personal Hell. No thanks. I’m good here.

I loved my dad dearly. We were very much alike but also so very different. In recent years we had drifted a bit apart, mainly my own doing. Why? I wish I knew. And like so many regrets in my life, I'll have to reconcile to the fact I could have called him just one more time. Or a thousand times.

My dad was a recovering alcoholic. He hadn't had a drink in years. He saw me follow in his footsteps and I know it hurt him deeply.

I’m not going to go to the doctor though; if I have damaged my liver, then she’ll tell me to quit drinking, and if I haven’t then I know my addicted self will convince me that I can keep drinking a little longer, that I don’t have to quit drinking quit yet. 

I had a five-day binge, which ended Monday night with me drinking 6 tall cans of beer and two double vodka sodas. On a Monday night. I haven’t drank on a Monday night in close to a year. I’m starting to break my own rules. 

Staring at my reflection in the bathroom mirror at work yesterday, Tuesday, I noticed that my face and cheeks looked rather sallow, rather yellow. 

I suspect that’s not good. 

Lately there have been those really glaring signs that the universe is speaking to me and telling me to quit drinking. Random drinker stories that eerily  mirror my life; not just situations and choices, but family and close relative names and relationship dynamics, even a random call out on a sober podcast that literally used my first name and said, “You can do this, girl.” In 46 years on this planet, I’ve never heard my first name used for a general “call out.” If you’re Canadian and old enough to remember Romper Room, I never even heard my name in the Magic Mirror.

I’m not going to go see my doctor about this. I’m just going to quit drinking. 

If I have damaged my liver, then doctors orders will no doubt be to quit drinking.

If I haven’t damaged my liver, then I KNOW my addict self will somehow convince me that it means I don’t have to quit drinking yet. Just one more night. I can quit tomorrow. Or tomorrow. But then it’s practically the weekend, and I can’t quit on a weekend. That’s crazy talk.

Trouble is, I’m taking tomorrow for granted, and it isn’t promised. When it comes to me actually sticking with sobriety, tomorrow never comes.  (Another glaring universal warning: My pre-teen daughter threw this riddle at me last year and I haven’t been able to shake it: “Hey mom, what’s always coming but never arrives?” The answer is tomorrow.)

So even though I haven’t had a drink since Monday night, this is my official day 1 of sober todays. I’m resetting my sobriety tracker and putting myself and my sobriety first.",11

I'm glad I found this SD with positive minded people who believe in themselves and others who are facing their own battles. For the last six years I was not able to abstain from alcohol for more than 12 days straight. There have been months of continuous drinking and 12 days was my longest streak. This quarantine has been a great moment to reconnect with myself. I took it as an opportunity to rescue the essence that made me feel alive many years ago. I'm young but if I kept going this way I was not going to make it so far. This is it, this is the sign from the universe to not look outside but within myself. Started creating again instead of destroying. Started learning about the Zen and Buddha way of life and it has being incredibly helpful. I just let alcohol be, exist, without putting any resistance... because that would feed its force (in my mind).  I just ignore it, if it screams I let it roll on the floor and cry. But I'm not picking up. I have placed my attention and energy in discovering things that satisfy me in a REAL way like when I was in high school. (art, videos, sports). Every day the mind feels more clear and the soul is healing as well. I don't find myself annoyed at everything, anxious, anti-social, or lost in my thoughts. This is the beginning of a lifetime journey that I'm excited to keep exploring. Can't look back at this point. Every day in the morning when I see myself in the mirror I feel like the old me is vanishing a little more and the new version is taking over. All I have to do is love myself so profusely and from my heart of hearts that I only think of becoming the best version of me - for myself, my family, and my future. Life is once and happens so fast that I don't want to waste any more time doing something that has taken away great people and opportunities from me.",4

She talked to me yesterday and said whatever I think she should do to feel better, she’ll do. So I’m looking for something that can put her on the path to recovery. 

Are there any Youtubers or hobbies or something that has really helped you in recovery?

I’m gonna have her start taking B vitamins, stop drinking coffee, and take a green smoothie in the mornings to get some nutrition into her. 

I wish I could get her to exercise a bit (she’s 60 btw), meditate, completely quit drinking. But she doesn’t listen to me. She doesn’t think it will help her feel better. 


She realistically needs hobbies, a better diet, to quit drinking, start light exercises and stretches, and just be a healthier person. I don’t know how to guide her into this. It seems like she’s given up hope to change and that she’s stuck feeling like this forever.

She also has a lot of pain from messed up discs in her back, she’s disabled, but I think light exercises and not siting all day would help greatly. 


Any advice?",5

He did have a rough childhood. There aren't many resources out there. I believe there is a 12 step program. There is a social stigma for joining these things.

In the beginning when i was younger, I beat him couple of times. That didn't help. We all put a lot of pressure on him so he would stop. But that doesn't look like its helping either. 

I talked to him recently when he was sober. He told me he feels like he failed in life and no-one wants him and respects him anymore. He is also retired and doesn't have many friends. He feels like he just feels unwanted and neglected. This conversation made me really sad.  I love my dad just like everyone and want to help him get better. So i decided to change my strategy from pressure and yelling to love.This is what I am planning to doI will call him everyday when he is sober and tell him I love him and ask these questions.

This time feels more solid and certainly more solid than my various Sober Octobers or Dry Januarys ever did. Those were like field trips where I knew I'd return to the vino playground once the month was over.  So, I thought I'd share a bit in the hopes of helping someone: 

1. I am immensely grateful that I'm sober during quarantine. My kids need me and I'm able to step up, help with homework, and just be fully present without the ever-present nagging drain of a hangover. 
2. Those first 10 days are the hardest. Seriously. If you're starting right now, come to the sub every single day. Several times a day. And toot your own horn about making it to days 2, 6, 10 -- whatever -- of sobriety because DAMN those are some pretty high hurdles. Granted, I'm only on day 18 (again) but, at least for me, it's almost like auto-pilot begins to kick in once I hit 2 weeks. 
3. Except it doesn't. I mean, I'm still working on it everyday. I've committed myself this time to listening to sober podcasts and finally making my way through This Naked Mind. I shied away from these tools before because it felt like I was truly admitting that I had to stop drinking if I dabbled in sobriety literature, etc. 
4. I lost two pounds in the last week alone. #vanity
5. My skin looks AMAZING. #morevanity
6. Sober sleep is almost better than sex. Almost. 
7. I can meditate better now that my mind is clearing up. And meditating better means more inner peace. And more inner peace means less chaos in my life. I could go on and on... 
8. I love this sub and it's become an integral part of my daily life. It's like my safe haven from the shit storm ""out there"" and in me.

2020-04-22 14:15:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g669mm/three_year_check_in/,Three Year Check In!,"Hey Everyone! Yesterday was my three year anniversary - wow. I like to post here on significant milestones in the hopes that it helps someone who is where I was at back at the beginning of my journey. I know this forum and the stories from others helped me so, so much when I was first starting out. This forum was, at times, my only support and the thing that got me through a day or a night or an hour or a minute. So, thank you to each and every one of you who was there for me - whether you know it or not.

For all of you just starting out, I could write a book about all the ways sobriety has changed my life for the better. I've never regretted the choice, not for one second. And, at the time I quit, I had no idea all of the thousand brilliant ways that quitting would change my life for the better; I only knew it was a step in the right direction, the one thing I could do, to get me out of the dark hole I was in. And here I am, out of the darkness and in the sunlight and absolutely worth the struggle.

I won't write a book, but I will share with you the one most important life changing thing that quitting did for me  - it allowed me to reclaim my dignity. That first night, three years ago, of not drinking was a tremendous success for me. And the success I felt the next morning helped me to stand a little taller and to feel a little better about myself. And the next day, when I didn't drink either, felt like a massive victory. And I was a little bit proud of myself and I felt a little bit powerful. And each day that I stayed sober, I also grew a bit more confident and my self esteem grew and my dignity returned. 
And when you believe in yourself, and when you feel like you're worth something and your life is worth something, amazing things start to happen. One small thing can create huge change. You might not be able to see the end of the road, or how you'll get from where you are to where you want to be (you might not even know where you want to be!) but it doesn't matter. You can do one small thing, take one small step and see what happens. 

Thanks to everyone for your courage and vulnerability and generosity and kindness xooxox

2020-04-22 12:22:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g645rt/quarantine_sobriety_question/,Quarantine sobriety question,"Longtime lurker here! I (28f) have been drinking off and on my entire adult life, and sometimes drinking felt fun, and sometimes I hated it. The awesome nights out with friends that were obliterated from my memory almost as soon as they happened; the sickening hangovers that made me question my own mortality; the scary decisions I made then barely remembered the next day.

I decided to take advantage of the fact that bars are closed during the quarantine to explore new aspects of mental health and to be sober. (The last time I was sober for more than a week was last year, and I felt great, but then fell back into old habits.) I've also been using the extra free time to examine the causes behind my drinking.

I think a lot of my drinking was due to habit, a general feeling of not being comfortable in my own skin, and boredom with my own mental state. Those are terrible reasons to do anything. And this last week, I've felt so incredibly content and stable and relaxed--exactly the opposite of the highs and lows I experienced while drinking regularly.

I'm enjoying sobriety so much. Taking this time to sit with my triggers has been empowering, and I feel more clued in to who I am as a person.

One of my concerns, however, is that in a moment of boredom, I may find myself craving alcohol. Normally I could hang out with friends or get out of my house and do something, but obviously that's not possible with quarantine life.

When I actually thought this through, I realized I wouldn't want just one glass, I would want to get drunk...bc I like to get drunk. Secondly (and this is the corner,) I don't want alcohol in my body ever again. I'm now convinced that it is poison, and I'm done hurting myself.

This is my second attempt reaching out to this subreddit, but it is definitely not my second time trying to quit drinking. Over the last year I have progressively gotten worse and each attempt to quit has only led to relapse.

Day 3 is always the hardest hurdle. It’s when every withdrawal symptom is at an all time high.

I am 22F, somewhere in the 120-130 lb range, and I have been drinking around a 12 pack of 5% alcohol a day for about a month now due to covid. I am on a two month paid leave at the moment that ends in early May. So, due to not really having anything to keep me accountable, I have been drinking nonstop.

At this point, I can’t really deny anymore that I am an alcoholic. The proof is how I feel whenever I try to quit. The withdrawal symptoms are absolutely terrifying.

I am naturally a VERY anxious person in general (and possibly on the spectrum) so that is the main reason why I started drinking in general. It helps with my anxiety and with my social skills.

Whenever I try to quit, the anxiety becomes SO bad and I do not know what to do to stop it. I am on gabapentin and CBD gummies, none doing. The anxiety becomes so bad, it honestly verges on complete delusion.

I haven’t slept more than eight hours in the past three days. Both nights I convinced myself we had bed bugs despite having no proof or evidence whatsoever. But I convinced myself, so I was up all night, itching and paranoid.

Been shaky, uncomfortable. Sweating nonstop, going from hot flashes to absolutely freezing.
Feel horrid.

When day 3 comes, I convince myself that if I buy some alcohol now, I’ll drink a bit of it each day and eventually I’m tamper it off. When I do that, I finish it all in one day and go buy more, which results in a binge for however many days. I don’t really eat either. Groceries go bad. It’s a waste of money and it’s taxing on my soul.

Had such a bad nightmare last night that I actually physically lashed out, knocked over my water bottle which ended up leaking everywhere. Apparently I’ve been talking in my sleep too, which isn’t very normal for me. Nothing bad, but it just seems like when I do sleep it’s not even very restful.

I don’t know who to talk to about this. I’ve tried to quit so many times in the last year, and every time I’ve told people that I’m quitting. They’ve seen me go back to drinking though, so my promises have no credit to them and I don’t even believe my own promises anymore. I don’t know what to do.

I just want these symptoms to STOP. I’m feeling physically unwell and there’s nothing I want to do to take my mind off them. I have no interest in anything.

If anyone else has relapsed because of their withdrawal symptoms being so bad, what did you do to keep going?",7

Once again my drinking problem is medium, but i notice increase of bad parts of drinking regularly and yes i miss a lot of good things in life cause did drink much.

English not my first language, and i ask this in good faith no bad intentions at all :)",3

My life was a wreck and I was dating an abusive person who encouraged the heavy drinking. I drank 8-20 drinks a night and I only went to work and the bar. When left my ex I was 215 lbs, jobless, and hopeless. But I knew that I wanted to be sober. I tried for 30 days, with 17 relapses in January. The last relapse, I lost my wallet and had my last $200 stolen from my credit card. After that, I decided I was going to set a 90 day goal, I needed to make a payment to the funeral home soon or they would release the burial plot next to my son to someone else. I needed to take responsibility for my life and the people I let into it. In these 96 days I have lost 40 lbs, caught up on bills, got a great job (before the pandemic), become involved in my community again, started to sew and paint again, and most importantly...I am not living in a constant hellfire of negativity and drunken solemnity.

Hope you are safe out there in the world. 

I am close to 2 months sober and today I got the dream job and promotion of my dreams, I almost can’t believe it.
My spouse immediately said “this calls for a celebration! I am opening the champagne tonight”. I know this reaction is very normal for many people (i.e. celebrating and alcohol). Now I can feel the urge to do it and drink creeping in. I cannot go back and risk a full-blown addiction which would also mean I would probably not perform in the new job and possibly get fired. 

Has anyone experienced the above? Like you are fine in your sobriety and thought it would be a defeat or something horrible that would trigger you to drink (at least it’s always been like that for me) but that something so good can become a trigger? 
I don’t know what to do! I feel like my thoughts are going against me 😕",5

That being said, I am grateful to have been through the experience, I’ve learned a lot. Addiction is a beast that is hard to beat, but after just a few short victories in the life long war, it has changed my perspective on life.",13

I don't touch alcohol during work hours or when I have plans that would be diminished but drinking but the second I am free from those obligations I make a plethora of excuses as to why I should drink today, as to why I should make dinner later on and crack open a beer and play video games as soon as possible.

I have quit many times in the 10 years, one period I quit for 6 months and even stopped smoking for the last 2. I remember most of the period, how much I played instruments, how attuned to my friends and family I was bad how healthy and physically fit I became. I played squash, climbed and ran.

This was the first time in my life that I entered the United States, and my parents were pretty proud of me.  


However at this point in my life my drinking had already spiraled out of control. Was drinking all the time during my master studies back in my home country and to be honest it still baffles me how I even managed to get this opportunity to do this extension on my studies.   


As a side note, I ones met a person from my studies back home that greeted me and we started talking, and I had no recollection of him or any of things that he talked about. All lost in the ether.  


I fly from my country to the states. Drink all the way, because of course I have anxiety and a fear of flying, because of my drinking. Have to stop over night in Colorado. Drink at the airport the whole time.   
Finally arrive to Santa Barbara. And I am still drunk.  


This beginning of my stay there pretty much set the stage for my stay in the state. During my six month stay there: I got banned at couple of bars. Got arrested for drunk and disorderly. Got sexually assaulted. Got robbed. The drunk list goes on.  


And in the middle of this I am somehow doing my studies, and it is by pure luck that I was able to deliver a study with findings that my instructors were able to build further studies on. This was a fucking lightning in a bottle.  


After my time there at the university, I get invited to a banquet, and receive an award certificate and big sum of grant money.  


I managed to drink all the grant money away before I fly back home.  


Come back home. And see that my mom has the picture my award certificate as her desktop background.  


I am still to this day, so very ashamed and angry at my self for how I acted, and kind of wish that I had hit rock bottom before this time. It was years after this even that I finally got the kick to quit this horrible habit.  


But as they say, the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The next best time is now.  


Thank you for being there for me and listening to my ramble. I hope all of you are staying safe and well during this hard times.  


Thank you, my friends in my pocket.",27

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

H.A.L.T. is an acronym for hungry, angry, lonely, tired. I hadn't even heard of it until I found this sub. Any one of these feelings can be triggers that can possibly cause a person to relapse. 

I've learned that when I'm not doing okay to stop and check if I'm actually feeling hungry, angry, lonely, or tired. This has proved to be a pretty useful tool in my sobriety. 

With quarantines, social distancing, and lock-downs, I'm wondering if loneliness is a top trigger right now? 

Have a great day. IWNDWYT ❤️

Had some major health problems and spent months home bound, then as soon as I was able to leave the house and do things the lockdown hit😭 so I didn’t really have to deal with the social temptations/have the ability to go on a binge even if I wanted to.

But I must say I’m glad I was able to work through health problems WITHOUT the added issue of my previous binge drinking. It’s a very crisp and clear way to view the world. Even when I wasn’t sober, I knew my binges came from an angry, destructive place, not the fun place that non-alcoholics talk about. It’s a continual process to uncover and work through that part of my brain that finds self destruction so enticing, but I owe it to myself and others to treat myself with care, not anger. And I’m looking forward every day to the person I’m becoming- someone who is at peace with my mind and reality. There’s something beautiful about the gift of a sober mindset and lens.

I wanted to leave you all with my favorite poem that I think about a lot- “Good Bones” by Maggie Smith:


“Life is short, though I keep this from my children.

Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine

in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,

a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways

I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least

fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative

estimate, though I keep this from my children.

For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.

For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,

sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world

is at least half terrible, and for every kind

stranger, there is one who would break you,

though I keep this from my children. I am trying

to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,

walking you through a real shithole, chirps on

about good bones: This place could be beautiful,

right? You could make this place beautiful.”



I’ve shortened my life in a thousand deliciously ill advised ways, but now I’m looking forward to tranquility and that still joy that comes from acceptance, from trying my best to make this place beautiful.

I wish you all peace and a calm mind. IWNDWYT🌱",5

Over the past two years though I’ve started drinking and slowly ramped up. Now I’m to the point where I’ve been drinking so much that I wake up in the middle of the night from anxiety and need another drink to fall asleep again. I’ve been closet drinking cause me and my girlfriend have had arguments about my usage but I just can’t stand the anxiety I feel when I’m sober. I take a shot when I first wake up to make me feel “normal”. When I work I take a shot every 3 hours to make me feel “normal”. At night I drink to blackout just to fall asleep. I don’t want to address this with my girlfriend cause I already told her I cut back... but I haven’t. I’ve been trying to go as long as I can each day without drinking but I always give in because of the withdrawals. I feel them, and I remember how bad my Xanax withdrawals were when I had to stop cold turkey because my dealer got locked up. I had seizures for about 4 days straight and I’m terrified of withdrawals. I hate having anxiety. I live a good life, I have two pets and an awesome girlfriend. I bought a house 3 months ago to help secure my future and I’m only 25. I have a stable job. But right now I feel like I can’t function without alcohol and my addiction is getting the better of me.

My little ones would be looking to me for stability and calm, while I would be irritated by their constant need and brush off their concerns because it was inconvenient when I was drunk or hungover. As it is they have a fully present, capable, calm mom that they can turn to when they’re anxious, having trouble sleeping, or just need a cuddle. I owe that to sobriety.

My “good” this week is that I did eventually get them arranged again. [Here’s how the collage turned out](https://i.imgur.com/I69czdA.png).

**The Bad:** My sleep has been terrible. It’s the worst it’s been since I quit drinking, and I’m exhausted all the time. (I have the feeling the rest of the planet is exhausted, too.)

**The Funny:** [This photograph](https://i.imgur.com/mOc4IHt.jpg) gave me the laugh that I needed.",21

Things were going great approaching 300 days no alcohol, less than 10 days from a year from doing drugs. However, I'm holding on to my progress, I'm not going to slide any further I know where that leads. Therapy, reading, and learning humility have made inroads so I'll be trying to lean on those. Feeling down today, but I had a craving and stayed on top of it with mindfulness techniques and playing it forward. Just have to have the confidence that this time I can stay sober for life and making the behaviors required happen. Hope everyone out there is doing what they can to be content with themselves, remember we're worth it. Just a reminder for everyone on the brink to just call someone and talk to them, I wish I would have, I know it would have changed everything for me, instead of having to overcome the mental barrier of ""resetting"" to zero.

I look at this sometimes when I'm having an argument with myself about whether to start drinking on an occasion. I find it very hard to refute these points, even when I very much want to.

There's a lot of self-criticism in here. You may read this and find that the same criticism applies to you. If so, please don't feel condemnation — I feel your pain and I understand. (But if you're feeling like you've had enough criticism for today already, maybe it would be better to just skip this post.)

Parts are *definitely* not applicable to most people, but I thought I'd post it in its current form in case any of it is helpful to someone. To those who don't share my viewpoint, I mean no offense, and I respect you even where we differ.

&#x200B;

1. Few things can compare with the simple joy of enjoying a sunrise in the cool morning air during my morning walk. But not when I’m hung over.
2. A night of drinking can easily rack up 1,000 calories, often much more. That’s a lot!
3. Drinking at night completely eliminates my will to go for a run in the morning. And my weight gain is now at critical levels. I remember when I could maintain a weight, and now I just can’t.
4. The anxiety. Someday I want to ramp down from these antidepressants, and so far my attempts have laughably failed. That doesn’t even take into account the awesome job, at the pinnacle of my career, that I lost because I was too cranky to work with.
5. I miss being able to sleep unmedicated. In fact, I miss medicated sleep too. I just want some sleep.
6. In my morning meetings, it’s nice to not be so hung over that I babble like an idiot when it’s my turn to weigh in on discussion. And that’s not even considering the times I showed up to meetings still drunk from the night before.
7. My daughter is now at the age where she’s forming permanent memories, and my son is nearly there too. I don’t want a drunk dad to be part of those memories.
8. I don’t want my kids to grow up with the expectation that having alcohol routinely with meals, or at restaurants, or around the house, is just something that people do. Because they’ll naturally live according to the same pattern.
9. Beautiful moments with the kids show up without any advance notice — like when they want to play a board game, or go look at the stars, or when they accomplish some major new intellectual milestone. But those moments are rare, and I want to be present for the few of them that I will ever get to see.
10. My wife follows my lead. I’m leading my wife into a similar path of bad habits, and I see the changes.
11. And then there’s the times when my wife has been interested in physical intimacy, but I’ve been either passed out, trying to hide drunk breath, or just plain unable to do my part because of the effects of alcohol. This is unfair to her, and she makes no attempt to hide how rejected it makes her feel. This is just one way among many that alcohol is destroying our marriage.
12. The time I throw away on drinking is part of the very small amount of time I have to do non-work things. I’m getting seriously behind on things that are important to me. My task list, inbox, and sometimes financial obligations are piling up to levels that are concerning.
13. Although my faith doesn’t have a blanket restriction on alcohol, it’s crystal clear that drunkenness is totally unacceptable. There’s no way I can rationalize saying that this doesn’t apply to me, or that I’m not frequently over that line. I’m sick of my hypocrisy.
14. Teaching my kids about my faith is important to me. When they see my hypocrisy about drinking, that undermines everything I say about what’s important. If anything, it provides a reason to decidedly reject everything I’m saying.
15. The amount of money I’ve spent on alcohol is staggering. It could have been used to partially alleviate the suffering of people who are dying or in desperate need. Instead, it goes to self-centered, self-destructive waste. Clearly I see where my priorities are. (See also hypocrisy.)
16. There are things on the Internet that deep down I truly hate, but which at times I find enticing. Alcohol impedes my ability to say no to them. And after my resolve to say no is defeated, I feel the mind-twisting effects of it for days to weeks afterwards; some of the memories have eaten at me for decades. (See also hypocrisy. Username checks out.)
17. At my current rate, I’m running a real risk of significant liver damage (or a related disease) in mid-life. The risk may not be certain, or even over 50%, who knows… but what percentage risk of painfully heading to an early grave is something I’d consider acceptable?
18. I want to believe that I’m getting better. But by any metric I can dream up, I’m getting worse, and have been for a long time. Wishful thinking isn’t a plan, and I’m out of excuses to say everything is fine.
19. I’ve been hiding it. And that’s how I know that even with my most pro-drinking mindset, it’s plainly obvious to me that any casual observer would say there’s a major problem here.

Separately from this list of reasons to *not drink*, I'm working on a completely separate list of reasons to *stay sober*. The enjoyment of a clear head is something to look forward to, more than the harmful effects of drunkenness are something to avoid. Even though sober goodness isn't quite as significant as drunk badness, it's something that lately I've been finding much more motivating for some reason.",64

My last drink was last night(monday night) around 9pm. Tonight will be my first night without alcohol in over a year. 

I started daily drinking a couple years ago, turned into a 4 beer a night habit, which in the last year became a 6 beer a night habit. 

I spoke with a doctor who said she expected my detox to be ""mild to moderate"", but wouldnt elaborate what that meant. She then prescribed me a benzo(cant remember which one), and said take them if your having symptoms, dont take them if you arent. If she expected my detox to be mild to moderate isnt the prescription over kill? Or is it standard? 

Anyone here have a similar drinking amount history? What was your experience like? Detox etc...?

None the less, I am completely terrified. What if I do get sick? Have I been drinking long enough to have more severe side effects? Why was my doctor so vague? 

I wasnt able to pick up my script because the pharmacy closed before I got off work. So im going tomorrow, Im wondering if I even need it. 

Any information or encouragement is greatly appreciated, like I said, this is my first detox, and its freaking me out.

As with many of us this pandemic and subsequent isolation has done a number on me. For a while no work meant all play and a ramp up in my drinking. Which was already quite a lot. Then I opened my eyes and realized that wasn’t a very valid plan of action, for the long or short term, and got really active and sober. And pretty happy about it, not much struggling. But this last week I just fell off the wagon again, hard. Im not proud of the things I did or the days I wasted, in fact I’m still beating myself up. 

I’m trying to scrape the pieces back together but this week it’s seemingly like a near impossible task. My anxiety is through the roof! And the siren call of numbing it all out with booze is loud. My depression state isn’t much better, and I isolate when I get this way. Human interaction is already scarce and I’m shying away from it even more. Regardless of the fact it would probably help. 

I can’t fall asleep. I’m pacing around my house. I have things to do. I know getting outside would help. But I just can’t bring myself to do anything. Not even trashy TV is helping. I know that alcohol is only going to make it a thousand times worse but I just don’t want to be in my body or mind right now. 

Ugh. I’m ranting. Thanks if you read this far. If you have any advice I’m all ears. It’s going to be tough but IWNDWYT.",4

I had heard some some stats (which may or may not be accurate) on how few people make it two years, and I immediately wanted to defy those odds.  One day at a time works for a lot of people, but I like the long view.  Too many of my drinking choices were centered on immediate gratification without a second thought for tomorrow or next week or next year.  

But there are a lot of ways to approach this thing.  That is the second biggest lesson I have learned over these years.  I ignore anyone who says you MUST do it this way, because I have seen people do it all kinds of ways.  

The biggest lesson I learned was to work on this thing like it was my second job.  It worked for me and it seems to be the common thread of the successful ones no matter which approach they use.  It wasn't a matter of waiting 30 days for some magic to happen.  It was about building a new life.  If I was bored I got to work.  If I had a craving I didn't feed it sugar or hide from it, I got to work.  And when I had big events to attend, I got to work planning them out until it became second nature to socialize without drinking.

I don't attend meetings, I do all my work on my own.  But I do share a lot here, and I wouldn't have made it two years without this place.

I drank a few more beers and then had tea and went to bed.  Over the last several days especially I have been feeling detached and fuzzy and tired and totally disconnected and unmotivated.  Partly out of what is going on in the World and partly just from not taking good care of myself.  I stopped exercising regularly and stopped drinking as much water and wanted to support local businesses so I started getting take out A LOT.  That all culminated in last night where, for a day, I actually left this SubReddit.  I un-joined because I thought: ""This is just what I am doing now.  I am drinking again.  When the epidemic all FINALLY blows over I will leave all of this behind and THEN start taking care of myself.""  I was using the virus as an excuse to indulge and not have to try or be present in the moment with what I was doing.......and it wrecked my mind.  I ended-up going through terrible anxiety SOOOOOOOOOO many times.  The World is stressful enough that I do not need something that is not actually changing anything give me temporary relief only to mess with my sleep and dump a terrible amount of anxiety and guilt on me.  There is no relief with alcohol.  I sought it for 18 years.  The peace of mind, the fulfillment, the identity, and satisfaction, the enlightenment, the........everything.  On the way home from work today (I can still go into my work as no one else is there) I realized that how I felt then, in that moment, while driving, was exactly what it was going to feel like on the day that I decided to never drink again.  Whenever that was.  Either tomorrow or 20 years from now.  It was still going to be tough, tempting, different, etc.  I was going to feel uncertain and embarrassed (I have gone through some extended periods of sobriety in the past) and it was only going to take more of a toll on my body as time went on.  If that was how it was going to feel on the day I stopped and that is how I feel now then why not stop now?  The only difference between quitting today or tomorrow is the calendar, not how easy it is going to feel later on.  I was not going to hit a point of fulfillment with alcohol (it is an addictive liquid which passes through your body and whose effects wear off).  I can, however reach a point of fulfillment each day with my mind.  Today I am successfully going to complete Day One for the first time in weeks.  Tomorrow will also be Day One.  Then the next, and the next.  When I go to sleep sober I have not a goal to shoot for comprising a number of days, I have the reward of THAT one day.  One day you can finally get through Day One, and once you do that every day is not something to shoot for, but something to collect as a reward.  Thank You.",12

It followed a botched suicide attempt when I felt I couldn’t hold on any longer. Those were dark days and I didn’t see how I’d survive. 

The advice I have is that you need to pat yourself on the back for taking the first step towards sobriety. Even if it’s contemplating it while still drinking. Failed attempts seemed to strengthen my resolve and motivated me to go further the next time. 

Getting a Hobby and distracting myself was the next best thing. I had to-do lists written everywhere so that I never had a spare second for idle thought. I stopped counting sober days after 9 months (just focussed on months, not days) I had consumed myself with anything sobriety related - books, films, podcasts... it just got too much and so I took a step back. It was at that time that I felt the grip on me loosen a bit. 

It hasn’t been easy. I thought my mental health issues would disappear and life would be fantastic when I was sober but that didn’t happen. It made me realise that I need therapy to sort my inner demons out. 

I heard something in a film or a series and wrote it down because it really struck a chord: 


“What’s your problem?”

“I’m an alcoholic”

“No. That’s how you’ve been treating your problem.”

When I was the next in line, I actually went and put it back, walked out and came back home. I don't why I did that to myself, but now that I' back home, I'm so happy that I'm empty-handed. After seven days, I feel so much better than I have in a really long time: my bloat is going down, my face isn't flush, my eyes aren't red and cracked out looking, no pains anywhere, I've been eating better, sleeping better, waking up feeling good, and exercising. I knew if I came home with that bottle, all that would go to hell. Drinking would turn into eating poorly tonight, which would mean bad sleep, feeling like crap tomorrow, not exercising, and then bc I'd have some left in the bottle, I'd justify doing it all over again just to get rid of it, and there the cycle starts again.

It’s just a matter of having the desire and the will to do it again.  I think what’s changed this time is that I’ve been making serious strides in getting a handle on my mental health issues in general.  I go to therapy, take my meds, journal, and read as much as I can about my illness.  I have a much stronger support system and safety net now that my toxic family are mostly out of the picture. I’m starting to learn how to actually use the coping mechanisms I’ve learned over the years.  I think one major change this time is that I no longer see things as black and white.  I know there will be challenging days.  And I may even slip up.  But that doesn’t mean I have to throw it all away and go on a bender like I have when relapsing in the past.

The best lesson I learned in early sobriety is this: my ""free will"" isn't very free. When I first got sober, if someone put a beer in front of me, there would be like an 80% chance I would cave and drink it. So, the best way to stay sober was simply to avoid having the choice in front of me. 

So I cut off my enabling friends. I stopped spending time in bars, at house parties, and other places that have a strong drinking culture. I set a hard rule for roommates that common areas (including the fridge) must remain alcohol free. I started looking for new friends with lives that didn't revolve around alcohol. 

I also engaged in harm reduction. Instead of getting clean and sober, I just quit drinking. I picked up weed to help fill the void. Now, it's not working for me either so I'm working to /r/leaves.

The biggest thing for me is fomo and learning how to have more of a personality when sober. I am naturally a pretty shy guy and pretty anxious when in social situations. I believe a big reason I drank was to be able to switch over to that other person that was more out going and seems like the funner side of me. Even though I find myself in bad situations a lot of the time drinking part of me is going to miss being that out going guy that people are use to seeing.

I live in the US and all 4 doctors I have talked to have referred me to AA groups. I want real help.,"I live in a small rural town so there really aren't many healthcare providers around. The few that are here are older and have some stale dogma attached to their practice. 

To clarify, I've tried AA, and it doesn't work for me. I do not like to hear other peoples' sob stories every week (the same stories over and over again). I do not like the cultish feel to the 12 steps of requiring you to accept a 'higher power'. I also think the 'big book' is very simplistic in its approach to addiction. We know better now.

 I am aware of the efficacy and implementation of drugs like naltrexone and acamprosate in other countries being used in combination with CBT, and I am confused why the united states has been so slow to pick up this trend. 

Alcoholism takes a huge toll on society. Why isnt it more widely known that more effective therapies exist?  Why is it so hard for me to access these medications?",15

So I drank half a bottle of expensive brandy. I felt sick and the guilt is killing me. I will buy him a bottle back but that is not the point. How am I ever going to stop. I have been trying for a couple of months now and it was going great. But the first chance I got I couldn't resist.

When the rumors started to fly about quarantines and sheltering-in-place, my instinct was to rush to the grocery store, buy 6 boxes of wine and as much craft beer as I could find.  I ran home and hid 2 boxes in the basement - ya know, as a backup stash for when the shit reeeeeally hit the fan.  My husband, who drinks an equal amount to me, and I plowed through the alcohol at rapid speed.  We drank our reserves and even went to far as to have boxes of wine delivered.  We kept at it for 31 days.  I've always known that I have a drinking problem.  But my drinking problem is different that the usual alcoholic's drinking problem.  I can not drink and it's not a problem.  I was sober for 2 pregnancies.  I even chose once to go 100 days without alcohol.  Another time I went 50.  These stints are challenging, but I can do them.  My issue is that there is not stopping point for me.  I can't have a couple glasses of wine and then switch to tea before bed.  It's drink drink drink, pass out, wakeup feeling miserable and forgetting a scary amount of detail.  So after 31 days of heavy drinking each and every night, I decided this is the perfect time for me to make a change.  We're not meeting up with friends, we're not having dinner at a brewery, there is no talk to happy hour.  So this is my chance!  I am on my 8th day and I am feeling great!  My rosacea is clearing up a bit, I am sleeping better, and my knees don't feel like those of an 80 year old when I'm walking down stairs!  I've been drinking an insane amount of water every day and I just feel sooo much healthier.  Sure, it's difficult when my husband is sitting on the couch with a glass of wine in the evenings, but he drinks a lot less when I'm not drinking.  So, if I can stick with it, he will reap some benefits too!  So far, I have spend my evenings with a cup of tea reading through all of these posts.  You are all sooo inspiring.  Thank you all!!!  Thanks for posting about your successes, thank you for posting about your failures, thank you for posting when you're feeling great, and thank you for posting when you're struggling.

My thoughts.,"Hey everyone, I made this post last year. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/bssypq/so_ive_got_a_liver_transplant/)  

And it's one year and one day since the surgery (I celebrate it as my re-birthday from now on).

I am not going to lie, first half a year was really tough. Emotional roller-coaster, relatioship problems, financial problems and basically I was not even happy to be alive. Which is something which is common in transplant patients, because your body needs to adjust to a new DNA, now all the medicine and stuff like that. It's really quite ""something"".

Anyway now I feel better than ever (even my pre-drinking time was worse) having really great life and I am glad I went through all of that, to get a different perspective of life which I would never would have received, if my liver would not shit the bed.

One thought which I have still inside me, is that...I don't think that anyone is heavy drinking by choice. I think that the people who fall into the hole of daily heavy drinking must have big issues, which are unrealted to drinking, would it be emotional issues or physical issues, I don't know.

I lost all of my psychical problems, I have no psychofarmaceutic as of now, no benzos no anti-depressants, no nothing. Also I experiencing zero Anxiety and it's really....great. All of this was happening before my drinking and alcohol was just a relief. Maybe my liver was fucked since my birth? Because if it does not work as it should be, a lot of waste is in your blood and that can't be good. 


I don't want to make excuses for myself, but yeah. I feel fine. Obviously I tried drinking, but the ""issue"" is that it does not work, at all. No good feeling, just something very odd and I really don't like that state. So if something in my life is going to happen, like a bad thing, I would never come back to booze, since it's useless for me.

Anyway stay safe, I hope you all are doing fine and keep the sobriety going!",74

And today he announced that he's finally got his head above the side of the rut - a deep, dark, muddy rut.

I am alone and a tortured soul because I am misunderstood. When I imagine playing the piano it is sitting in a large darkened room with the net curtains blowing in the wind. Something akin to a guns and roses music video. I am alone and playing moonlight sonata by Beethoven because it resonates with the perception that I am a martyr to my illusionary persona. When I imagined drinking I was a whole range of characters, none of which was my true identity. Why? Because I am a fantasist. False levels of desirable achievement have been the bain of my life. Illusionary measuring sticks have resulted in constant disappointment. I looked far and wide for a person to be when the person to be was with me all along. I just overlooked him. 

I was raised by TV and movies. I loved the illusion and fantasy that it painted. The perception that there was the propensity for magic in this life and that it was reachable. Overly romantic endings tarnished my capacity for contentment while looking for a sunset to ride into. Eventually lost love evolved into lonely tears as betrayal set in. There was to be no magic. Disappointment turned to addiction. For, there still resides magic in the form of escapism but it comes at a cost. The fleeting feeling of transcending the mundanity of life comes at a high price. Maybe not initially but eventually. Obviously, not to me though because I was a fantasist. Those characters I imagined when I thought about drinking they were alone, yet brooding archetypes of masculinity. Dark and intriguing. Challenging and sexy. It was utter nonsense. I was scared shitless and a coward. I was lonely and unhappy. 

Why does that matter? Well, when I HAD to stop drinking. I was bereft of confidence, had zero self-esteem and believed I would completely fail at quitting due to the belief that I was too weak to quit. Despite all that, I wanted to stop drinking. I saw my failing liver as the opportunity to escape the life that had brought me to my knees on numerous occasions. I say knees, it was more sitting in dark rooms, lost and crying wondering how the fuck to get out of it. Not the room, the situation. The repetitive cycle of fuck up after fuck up. Guilt on shame. Loss after loss had all become too much. My lowest point will always be my high point because it is then I realised if I didn't quit drinking I would never be free. 

I believe wholeheartedly that if you want to quit you will quit. If you don't you won't. Why would you? I spent years blaming everyone and everything for my problems. I LOVED drinking. It couldn't be the cause of my problems. OH FUCK, it was. Weight, financial, psychological, relationships, the lot. Another fantasy dispelled. Another sense of betrayal. But even through all that self-doubt and disbelief in my own ability to make it to the end of the week without a drink, I did. That was easy I thought a week is nothing. Then a month. That was easy a month is nothing. At the end of the year I looked back and I cried. I cried because I had to accept that I did have the strength I never thought I had. Another fantasy dispelled. Another image of myself broken and chucked aside. Each victory brings my real self closer to the surface. Until, eventually, I dare to be who I was meant to be. 

I was scared shitless when I quit. I was so lost it was frightening. I remember getting lost in a market as a small boy and bursting into tears. It was overwhelming and I was genuinely scared. I eventually found my mum again. I was so happy. As a grown man it wasn't quite as easy as bursting into tears in public and someone finding me a solution but there were people prepared to show me the route to safety. I had to want to walk it and I had to muddle through there was no perfect way.  I had to learn to break down the fantasies of perfection and learn about acceptance and contentment. I had to learn that it is rough and smooth and that's just life. It doesn't owe me a favour nor is against me or for me, it just is. All I can do is my best.

I, like millions of people, have been struggling with the current situation but thankfully the fog is beginning to clear. I put this down to not drinking. I was depressed for years and sat on it. It didn't help. This time I spoke to my friends about my feelings. I had to open up and share for my safety. I cannot live a fantasy anymore it is unsafe. I have to be real and I have to be honest. On the 1st of June, I won't of had a drink for six years. I don't know all the answers but I know if I still drank alcohol I wouldn't have made it this far. Either my body or mind would have failed by now as the signs were showing back then. Six years and I honestly didn't believe I would make it past the first month. I had done dry January for a few years so I knew I could last a month. It was a waste of time because I just drank double in February as a reward for lasting a month.

I was devastated when I realised I had to take responsibility for my sobriety. I'm glad I did because I cherish it. After all, the sobriety I have is the solution to that lost little boy's fears.

1 ) I got married to my partner of 20 years. This would not have happened if I were still drinking.

I am physically and mentally more healthy than I have been in a long time, and I have no desire to go back to drinking as I know the end result will be disastrous.

Fell asleep early last night, woke up at 5:30am, couldn't get back to sleep. Probably due to anxiety 'hangover.'

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

2020-04-21 00:39:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g58rbg/just_starting_out/,Just starting out,"Hi everyone. Been lurking for awhile, and I have *so* much to say to you. But hey, ain't nobody want to read all that, so I'll try to keep it short. :)

Drinking started out moderate, as I think is true for a lot of people. That became a bottle of wine with dinner with my wife a couple nights a week, which was fine. Then it became that *plus* drinking binges (because a shared bottle of wine just isn't enough, even if I'm the only one ""sharing""!), and she was very wisely concerned. Now I've been just drinking daily, usually to the point of drunkenness, but somehow hiding it from her (I think). Absolutely experiencing loads of negative consequences, which I'll save for a separate post.

I'm not going to talk about it with my wife — can't be real about something as embarrassing as this. Also, can't get professional help (even hiding it from my wife), because even though I could make it work with my schedule, I really don't want to trip a system or get a diagnosis code in the wrong place or anything like that. I already had a security clearance delayed for over a year for a similar reason, and I also ended up paying over double for life insurance, for the next two decades, over something similar. Or my doctor finds out, and suddenly I can't get refills of anything anymore. Nope, not gonna go on the record about this. And support groups are something I can't make work with my schedule while still not being open about it all. I don't blame you all for thinking I'm making a terrible decision here and letting minor considerations keep me from major, necessary, life-altering improvements… but there it is.

I've tried a bunch of things to stop the easy way, and of course I can see that's not working. If I run out of options, though, I know I'm going to have to resort to some of the really painful stuff like I mentioned above. And that helps motivate me some. At this point I'm not yet convinced that I really want to stick to total abstinence, but if I can just zero out the secret drinking I think I'll be most of where I want to be — or at least I feel like I'll be ready to fine-tune. A lot of people on here are probably shaking their heads at that, saying ""This guy still has a hard lesson to learn about this mythical 'moderation' thing"" and, well, I guess I can respect that.

The things I've read here have offered me such amazing perspective. I absolutely recognize myself in some of these things here, such as that just having a couple is a lot more difficult than having zero, since it's the screaming pestering of my inner desire for more that makes things really obnoxious. And as some sage commenter mentioned (I wish I could find who now)… Despite the line of bull from the voice of craving in me, I don't actually want two drinks; I want to get drunk. Calling out the lies helps. Still need to read *This Naked Mind*.

I never even knew the drinking anxiety was a thing, but over the past 3 years I've (1) experienced significant anxiety for the first time in my life, (2) got on antidepressents for it, (3) added another antidepressant for it, (4) started having my heart skip beats regularly for no reason at all, sometimes every third or fourth beat, (5) noticed that sometimes I'd be pulling >100bpm for no reason at all while perfectly still, (6) had dissociative episodes, (7) tried three times to ramp down from the antidepressants, unsuccessfully, (8) was managed out of a highly successful job at what's likely the pinnacle of my career, because I became too cranky to work with. Sleep grew from ""waking up at 3:30 AM once or twice a week"" to ""can't make it through the night without 100 mg trazodone, plus occasionally doubling up on zaleplon."" My wife moved out to her own bedroom because I became so restless at night that she couldn't sleep through it anymore. I never made the connection until now!

I've got a big list of reasons not to drink, and I like it so much that I think I'll be posting it by itself later. Sometimes I'll read over it when I'm having an argument with myself, and even though it doesn't really ""win"" the argument emotionally, I also find that when I challenge the pro-boozing side to come up with a valid counterargument in favor of drinking on this occasion, it can't formulate one.

But the thing that's been the biggest help to me lately has been recognizing just how outstandingly positive I feel when I go to sleep sober and wake up clear-headed. Enjoying the quiet splendor of the morning, going for a walk or run in the cool air, and coming back for a rewarding shower, a cup of coffee, and some time to read the paper before anyone else in the house is up. Getting to my morning meetings and not babbling like an idiot when it's time for me to weigh in. And when my young kids are full of energy in the evenings and want to do something with me, I can be there with them, for this terribly short time that I get to enjoy with them at this age.

OK, so my attempt at a short post has been about as successful as my feeble attempts at abstaining from the booze. But over the past week I've been sober more often than not, and I've thrown away my paraphernalia for hidden drinking. At this point I'm *excited* about waking up tomorrow. And I'm intending to stick with abstinence until the next perfectly reasonable occasion for moderate drinks, and at that point keeping it to a moderate amount, which should be made easier by the fact that I'll only have a moderate amount on hand (even though there's still danger in that). So, we'll see how that goes. :\\",3

My brother and I stayed with her every second (trading back and forth) of home hospice. It was a horrible, tough week and a half of watching my mom die. Now, my brother still likes to drink, and we used to always drink together. After she passed, and we had literally watched her take her last breath, he poured himself a glass of some of the finest 16-yo single malt scotch whiskey. I could smell it. It smelled so fucking great. I wanted it so goddamn bad that my brain started concocting rationalizations that it would be ok - after all, the trauma I had been through! The long nights of our vigil. The tears. I knew that if I had just said the word, he would have poured me one, and probably kept secret about it. 

I left the room, and cried some more. I grabbed myself a can of seltzer. Came back and said, brother, I've got some of my old demons rearing their head, whatever I say, don't let me drink. He agreed. I stayed strong. The hardest two weeks of my life, and I truly didn't need alcohol to get through it.

I'm approaching 2000 days. And, silly as it seems, that number keeps me motivated. I do not ever want to reset that number, and just watch it grow.

There's some coping mechanisms we see on here all the time, and it may sound trite to bring up - but they *WORK FOR ME*. One is ""One Day at a Time"", which I kinda broke up there when I said ""approaching 2000 days"" - I shouldn't say that, it is still almost 30 days away. All I know is I *won't drink today*. 

The other one is ""Play the Tape Forward"". This saved me that night like it has many times. Sure, that one whiskey, sipped slowly would have been great. But would I have stopped there? Of course not. And the next day? Well, already reset to 0 so why not have another! and another! and another!

One of my own mechanisms is to stay vigilant, take note of when the addict part of your brain starts rationalizing reasons to drink, it is trying to trick you, and it attacks when you are weakest. 

Stay strong everyone!",5

Hey everyone, recently I commented on a post about anxiety and now I want to share my thoughts on this topic.

Im sober from alcohol for about two years, cocaine a lil bit more than that and benzos for a year now.

I got sober in AA and still attend meetings and do service. I do think AA helped me a ton but I dont think its the only way to get sober. Also I think AA is not enough.

I quit cold turkey, my last binge I drank a liter of cheap whisky and then I locked myself for detox. The anxiety almost killed me. I smoked too much cigarettes, took cold showers and spend some days without eating and other binge eating.

by the end of the week I thought about drinking, after going through all that shit. The physical and mental toll that it is. I mean the puking, the diarrhea, the shivers. If you went through that you know what I mean. I did not drink and instead went to my first AA meeting.

The anxiety itself went decreasing, but the first sober month was crazy. Ups and downs... everything either made me absolutely angry or made me cry. Those were my two emotions, I dont remember feeling any joy. But I did felt relief. AA helped me face my problems, it was important for me to recognize that Im in fact an alcoholic and than this is a disease.

I got a job after 1 month sober and the anxiety was awful. Riding the subway was a burden, thats when I got in to meditation but it wasnt enough. I was smoking, drinking too much coffee and eating a lot of sugar. I realized my anxiety was directly related to my drinking, I got into a bit of neuroscience I realized that my years of drinking fucked up my Gabba receptors and my coke using fucked up my Dopamine. Everything else in my diet wasnt helping either. The sodas, the coffee, the smoking made my anxiety levels raised constantly. No wonder taking the subway was a torture. The stimulus was too much.

So I began doing various things in order to heal my anxiety and my life in general. I changed my diet. I began to eat less carbs and more fiber. Cut the salt and meat. started eating probiotic food and taking probiotics as supplements. I began taking taurine, zinc, magnesium and tryptophan. I made a routine of falling sleep and wake up at the same time most days.

Then I started going to the gym, riding a bike, walking to the subway and walking to anywhere when it was possible. Cut the sugary foods and the soda completely. after this small and gradual changes I could feel less anxious but I still had my bad days, still had the usual panic attacks. Thats when I realized something that was eye opening.

For ten years (I drank from 15 to 25) my emotional response to stress, to anger, to fear. My response to everything was drinking. Alcohol numbed my feelings so now that im sober everything manifest in form of anxiety. So I began to write down every emotion and every trigger I had. I began to recognize when I was happy, sad, when I was enjoying myself. I realized that emotions are a spectrum and a lot of them I wasnt even aware, because I was always so focus on not feel. So I embraced my shit. Embraced the moments I was sad and miserable for being an addict and I embrace the moments I was proud of myself for being sober.

So now I knew when the panic attack was coming and I knew what I could do to cope with it.

Everything was great, my sobriety was nice. Working the steps, meditating in the mornings, eating oatmeal at breakfast. Having my supplements, exercising, losing wait. I move out my moms, got my own place. Till I injured my back doing some woodwork and they gave me Benzos.

I told the doctor about my substance abuse issues. I was sober for a year now and he said to take it if the pain was too much. To be honest the pain was too much. I took the pills for a week... in my country they give you the exact amount til the next appointment. The pills were strong enough to give me stomach ache, awfull diziness and finally this sensation of numbness. I realized then that this numbness was the thing I always reach out for. He gave me another prescription. And I abused them.. I went back to my old habits. I did nothing but being high on the stuff... For the next appointment I had a script prepared for him to give me another prescription. My insurance was paying the pills so everything was set up. Back on the addiction wagon. Till it hit me. I missed the appointment and I had the withdrawals symptoms, way worse than the alcohol ones. I reach out for help, I was in pain for the withdrawal and I was in pain for the injury. Thats when I found yoga.

Yoga helped me to understand my body. Now that I was understanding my emotions that were in my head I could began to understand the sensations and listen to my body. I could now heal my body. I realized that sobriety its an integral way of viewing life. I requires a lot of work and attention. its a lifetime process that is not linear but it is integral. You have to grow in various areas of your life in order to overcome addiction. Finally today I can say I no longer feel how I felt before. My toxic anxiety is gone for good and everyday I wake up feeling grateful to be alive, to be sober and to be in the present.",9

2020-04-20 22:32:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g56v2e/adhd_low_self_esteem_and_alcoholism_story_time/,"ADHD, low self esteem and Alcoholism (Story time, this is a LONG one)","In my sobriety, I've had a lot of time to think about my drinking career. Turns out, the further back I went the easier it was to see how I eventually ended up here. I know it's not good to dwell, but my wife and I have twins on the way and I want to remember the chain of events I went through so I can (hopefully) help prevent it from happening to them. 

I had a tough adolescence, but not in a way that would seem outwardly obvious to anyone (even myself until recently). I was born in Detroit and lived my young childhood there. At that time, most of my family also lived there (Before the crash) and all the adults were somewhere on the alcoholic spectrum. I grew up going to my cousin's house (he was the COOLEST) and his parents were in bad shape. He slept on a mattress on the floor in a FILTHY house in a shady neighborhood. My aunt and uncle were co-dependent alcoholics. There were always empty vodka bottles lining every shelf, window sill, and surface... paper towels in the bathroom instead of TP... rarely any food... you know the drill. Regardless, my parents weren't like that and I lived a comfortable, average suburban life. Lots of friends in the neighborhood, parents provided a good support system... my Dad always drank but rarely to excess. 

We moved from Detroit to the NW as a family when I was 10 or so, and I was put in a school that was VERY clicky. My mother always tells me that if she had things to do over again, she would have taken me out of that school and put me somewhere else. One of her great regrets...

I didn't really make any friends, got teased alot, generally kind of an outcast until I hit junior high. Once in junior high I found some kids I could hang out with, but I was still awkward. About the time I was 13 or so, I made a friend who was friends with some of the ""cool"" kids. I got a chance to hang out with them, and they had 2 18 racks of Milwaulkies Best Ice beer. The stuff was rancid and warm because they had to hide it in the closet, but after choking down 1 or 2 of them I was in LOVE. What is this magical elixir? All of a sudden I'm part of the group! I'm cracking jokes, horsing around... just like one of the guys. I had such a great time that night, definitely puked in the backyard and felt like shit the next morning but whatever... fun kids stuff. 

My parents were hard-liners. Instead of having my first drink with my parents, they insisted I wait until I was 21... like that was going to happen. Going into high school I began to seek out this feeling... my ""Friends"" and I would do grocery store runs where a bunch of us would tear into a grocery store all at once causing chaos while 2 or 3 of us would grab as many 24 packs as we could carry. We would walk the neighborhoods at night looking for garages with open side doors to grab beer (or liquor if we were really lucky) from. We would pay adults to buy booze for us, steal bottles from our parents... whatever we could do to get ahold of it. About this time I also learned that if I was the guy who had the booze, I didn't have to try to make people like me... they would just want to hang out with me because of what I had. I began to be known as the guy who had the booze, which made me feel cool for the first time.

This concept I learned I could expand if I started to have drugs too. I started selling weed as soon as I got a car (16). It was great, everybody was always paging me (this was the 90's), I got invited to EVERY party, everyone happy to see me.... I felt even cooler. 

I didn't get good grades in high school AT ALL... I think I graduated with a 2.6 GPA. I always told my parents that I had trouble focusing when I would study, my mind would wander and the time would just get away from me. This was always chalked up to too much TV, video games... general lack of interest in my studies, which wasn't the case at all. By the time I was 17 I was a very prolific writer and musician, but I just couldn't power through the other stuff. 

Thankfully I scored well on my SAT's so I was able to get into a good state school. My parents ""hoped beyond hope"" that I would change in college, and I was SURE I was going to be able to pull it off. Ha... right. 

When I was 19 my mom scheduled me a psychologist appointment for the first time  to see if I did in fact have ADD. The doctor diagnosed me with ADHD so severe, I was prescribed 3 STRONG doses per day. At the time, there weren't any restrictions on how much could be prescribed... so I ended up with 360 pills all at once. 360 pills, guy with low self esteem in college craving attention... can you guess what I did with them? 

All the while. my drinking was continuing to increase. My sophomore year I joined a fraternity, and it was a party house. I was always the supplier (coke, exctacy, weed... you name it), and I had the Rolodex of girls and guys who like to party to call any night of the week. Any chance I had of graduating college vaporized the 2nd semester of my 2nd year.. but MAN it was fun. 

Cracks in my armor were starting to show though. By the time I was 19 I had 3 minor in possession tickets (MIP) for booze-related incidents. I wrecked my car in a DUI accident (no one was hurt) when I was 20 coming home from a party.... actually had a bag of coke in my pocket when they booked me at the station. I had just gotten my tongue pierced (yes, a tongue ring) and I told the cop it was sea salt to make sure it didn't get infected. I'm sure he knew what it was, but I think he was so impressed with my ability to pull something like that out of my ass with my BAC as high as it was, he just threw it away.  Ruined my family thanksgiving the next day tho. 

I eventually got kicked out of my fraternity because they were getting tired of my shit. Yep, I had gotten so bad even a rowdy fraternity didn't want me anymore. Thankfully I had met a girl and she let me move in with her and her roommates. She had a cocaine problem in high school (she was a rich girl) and I was selling it at the time... codependent match made in hell. That tumultuous relationship lasted way longer than it should have. Eventually I got a job at a cybersecurity startup in LA (lied my way through my interview) with a toxic substance abusing office culture, and I was off to the races again. 

In that company at that time, there were bottles of vodka in the office an nobody looked at you sideways for day drinking. Aside from the drinking, that job helped me build the career I have today, as well as take me to Europe where I met my wife. She was always wary of how much I drank, but she had never met a real alcoholic and wasn't really aware of how to handle it at the time. I put her through some pretty tough times, and during the 2 years we were apart trying to do her visa legally, I fell into a deep depression and the drinking really got out of control. By the time we were finally reunited, she barely even recognized me. I slowed down for awhile, but eventually it crept back up as it always does. With a few breaks, this cycle lasted up until last month when I finally quit. Looking back, I think I finally pushed myself over the edge in mid 2014 while we were apart... but I was destined to get here eventually anyways by the events that preceded it.

So, what have I learned and what will I change with my kids?

1. I was groomed from a young age to see drinking as ""cool"". Everybody I loved and respected were heavy drinkers. This will not be an early memory for my kids, they will not see me with a bottle in my hand. 
2. I was introduced to drinking at a very vulnerable time. I was vulnerable because my family loved the fact that I was ""such a nice boy"", but as a result I never really built any character. I didn't have any opinions or values and as a result I was very malleable. I will make sure to instill strong values in my kids. Booze isn't just ""illegal and dangerous"", it's poison. 
3. I was in a ""no tolerance"" house, so my views on drinking and drugs became part of the drug itself. In my house, my kids will be introduced to wine at a young age so they can build up a rapport with it. My wife is Italian, no one in her family has a drinking problem and they were all introduces to wine by the family when they were very young. 
4. I was always just told to ""study harder"", without ever getting formerly evaluated. My kids will speak to a therapist regardless of whether or not I notice anything. Being able to be open and honest with an impartial 3rd party is SO important for mental health. Sometimes there are things you just don't feel you can tell your parents.",7

2020-04-20 21:46:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g564pp/finally_time_to_stop_lurking/,Finally time to stop lurking,"Hey everybody! I’ve been a fan of this sub for almost a year, and after wasting the last two hours on a mental debate on whether to drink tonight I’ve decided it’s time. Time to emerge from the shadows and make the irrevocable declaration: I am a drunk. Hear me roar.

I’ve known I had a problem since I was 17 or 18. I’m 26 now. It started with the realization that I would almost always drink too much at parties, I didn’t know how to stop and would black out. Sometimes awakening to embarrassing stories, others awakening to hear about some truly awful, downright evil shit. You can forgive yourself and move on, but the stain of some types of shame can never truly be erased. Beside the point.

Next came the realization that my urge to drink was constant. I wasn’t like my young rebellious peers who got wild with the booze a couple nights a week and were content with weed and video games the rest of the time. I wanted to be drunk, every single night, and eventually every single minute. Needless to say, the desire for constant drunkenness coupled with the utter inability to monitor my rate of consumption has resulted in absolute fucking mayhem. Time and time and time again.

The severe, crippling depression. The states of delirium. Hundreds if not thousands of unexplained injuries. Missing vehicles. Wrecked relationships of all kinds. I have been a destructive force, and the carnage left behind is almost unbelievable as my unwillingness to look at the mess I’ve created, take the lessons to heart, and apply them to my life.

My drinking pattern is a little unusual though, it seems. I would binge for a few days and nights, end up feeling so sick that I took a couple days off, and repeat this cycle until some new heinous abominable thing happened as a result of my drinking. At which point I would swear off alcohol for the rest of my life. A  proclamation which usually lasted 1-3 weeks before I picked up again. Starting off easy, I would take it slow, stay in control this time. You know how that story ends. Rinse, wash, repeat until brain dead and existentially numb. As a result though, I’ve never been physically dependent on it.

I should clarify, my drinking pattern changed significantly in the summer of 2018. 21 months ago due to inevitable legal complications I was placed on alcohol monitoring. That’s five random tests a day on a portable breathalyzer. Needless to say that curtailed my binge drinking habit pretty quick. I stayed sober for two months after the arrest. But the siren song played on. I dont remember why I picked a drink back up after all that time. Things were going really well, my mental health was better than it had been in years, i had a kind supportive girlfriend, I loved my new job. But I did.

You get your tests between 7am and 9pm. That leaves a convenient 10 hour window, with some simple addict math you see that you can have four drinks in that amount of time and still blow zeros the next morning. Doesnt seem like much to a former fifth a night drinker, but any port in a storm. So aside for 3-4 nights where I lost control, I have not been *drunk* in almost two years. This has created the illusion that I am now capable of moderation, and produced an unhealthy distance between me and the wreckage of my past, which previously served as a healthy reminder of the chaos and suffering that alcohol has, and will again create in my life.

I know this because even with my 4 drink limit, I always want more. And I know if I could drink as much as I wanted, it’s never enough. Even if I am near unconscious, unable to stand on my own, I will crawl to the bottle for more. Not a fucking metaphor either, this happened, or so I was told, on more than one occasion. I maintain a similar pattern though, indulging a few nights, then taking time off, trying to stay fully clean, for real this time, and then going back. I’m a master of minimizing, and lying to myself. That it’s not that bad because I can’t even drink that much anyway. I remind myself of what a good time I had that one night, playing this game, or watching this show, how I want that feeling again. I fear that I won’t be happy, or have a fun night, or enjoy a movie or listening to an album without that buzz. It’s four little drinks but it still tears me up inside, that longing, the fear of going without. How pathetic.

I’m finally writing on here because I want to do things different. I can’t be honest with anyone in my life, because everyone but a few close friends truly believe I’m sober. I have changed, so much in the last two years for the better. Not being able to consistently drink grotesque amounts has helped me in so many ways. But I still have a long way to go, I don’t want this half ass, bullshit recovery anymore. I’m a free man in 7 months, and I know if I don’t make this change and make it stick then I will end up where I started in no time. I want the healing, mental and physical that can only come from long term abstinence. I want to feel happy and content in my own mind without any anesthesia. I want to be rid of this nagging crave. I really just want to be free. Thank you so much for reading, I’m sorry it was lengthy. And thank you for your own posts, and creating this place where people can feel safe to be honest and supported. I will not drink with you today 🤘🤘🤘",7

FOMO? What am I missing out on? My imagination tells me it will be fun, but it never is. I don’t understand why part of me clings to the notion that it could be an enjoyable experience when I haven’t enjoyed drinking for years.

I stopped drinking in January for 5 weeks. After that I let “just one” turn into 3 a night, so I’m back at square one as of 5 days ago. Drinking is a distraction that I build almost all of my free time around. This is an empowered decision I am making for my health and my life.

This wouldn't bother me if I had an okay relationship with alcohol but it's not it's an incredibly unhealthy relationship. Several years ago I drank every single night going through a handle of vodka every few days and that was leading me down a very dark path. A friend of mine helped me get sober and I went to the gym with him 6 days a week and changed up my lifestyle to get healthy with the only exception being the bag of candy I kept on my computer desk to satisfy the sugar cravings. I spent the next several months sober and then decided to try drinking again in moderation except moderation seems to have meant only drinking on weekends but not limiting the amount I drink. I have had several times the last few years where I'll stop for a bit and then jump back in but I can't just have a beer or two. My brain won't let me just get a buzz and although I don't touch liquor anymore I more than make up for it in beer and wine. Firstly when I buy beer it can't be any lower than 8% in fact what I buy is 12 packs of 9% and usually a box of wine on top of that to get me through a 3 day weekend. In my mind I always need to buy more than I'll actually drink and I recognize this as an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. It's not destroying my life but I hear about other peoples drinking habits and have to significantly downplay the amount I drink over the course of the weekend. Plus drinking all weekend leaves me tired all week and has left me incapable of getting on a decent sleep schedule and on top of that I keep gaining weight when I was drinking every day I had gotten up to 200 lbs (I'm only 5'8"") I had lost 50 pounds the first time i quit drinking and had gotten myself in decent shape and now I'm back up to almost 190 and its slowly going up.",3

I wanted to finally introduce myself, I go by my nick name red, and say that you all have given me courage to tackle whats been on my mind for awhile. 

Alittle bit about my drinking, I started daily drinking a few years ago, wasnt much at the time a couple of beers a night, and then I went through a nasty divorce and that couple of beers turned in to atleast 3 a night. Over time, as more of lifes hardships have come up, i just continued drinking. For the last year or so, my minimum has been 4 beers, and more recently( the last 6-8 months-ish) its been 6 beers a night. 

Depression and boredom hit hard with thebstate lock down and I notice that my intakebisbcreeping toward the 8 beers a night. 

I finally said enough is enough, and made a phone appointment with an addiction specialist. The call went relatively well. I felt at times she was alittle dismissive, or not very direct with her answers to my questions. 

She prescribed me a benzodiazapine to help through my detox which I plan to start tomorrow night as I am taking the time off work to really just focus on staying sober, and not be stressed out by work etc. 

I am feel hopeful yet terrified at the same time. Im not afraid of withdrawal symptoms in general, but Im afraid of it getting really bad. 

I feel guilty, tried, scared, but all at the same time hopeful to get through all of this and feel...normal? Again.

I wanted a drink. I thought about taking a drink. First feeling SHOCK. Not felt like this for a long time. I remember in the early days drinking was all I ever thought about. How quickly times change.

I think what has triggered this is I'm opening up and exploring new avenues in life and they are causing me to feel fear. May sound dumb, but I've taken up running and also committed to a cycle to work scheme. Both of these things are filling me with irrational fear. 

I know if I can overcome these fears then growth will happen. But I am just shocked at how easy negative thoughts can creep back in even when I'm seemingly doing everything right.

I know it'll be okay and I'm working through this but fucking hell this thing is never ever done with you and it's a healthy reminder to never get complacent.

My ex-girlfriend and I have made amends, in the sense that both of us acknowledge that the other is a good person, and we're not actively trying to harm one another, but the time has definitely come to go our separate ways, at least for a long while. She's still an active alcoholic, even though it makes her miserable, and unfortunately, her habit still enables mine. 

Yesterday she brought home a couple of plastic bottles of cheap wine, along with a mutual friend of ours. Hangouts became drinks, and of course, everything went straight to the bottom of the bottle. Again. 

Woke up today exhausted and ashamed. Nothing bad happened - we were all perfectly civil - but I said I was going to make a real run for sobriety and I barely made it a week.

I've been dealing with the death of one of my best friends to fentanyl overdose, a breakup, and then isolation due to COVID-19, all within the last couple of months. My grief is unbelievable and my ability to cope is really dwindling. I feel that the pandemic/quarantine has forced a lot of us to begin facing our traumas and grief because we can no longer do the same activities we used to in order to temper the pain. I feel like I'm constantly stuck trying to blunder through, and not able to do it gracefully when the loss I feel for both my friend and my relationship are so anguishing. I was too weak to handle it, and I relapsed.

My ex and I still talk every day because we've always been so close and are best friends. We've both vocalized that we want to remain close even if it's hard because we don't want to lose each other. We also drank together this past month that I relapsed, and each time, I became too drunk, hyper sensitive and emotional, and started blubbering about all the ways my ex hurt me. I'm harbouring a tonne of hurt about a lot of things that happened between us, but that's something I should be blubbering about with literally anyone but my ex. It's selfish and unfair. I recognize that my feelings are valid but I'm not expressing them constructively. I feel like I'm not recognizing who I am anymore when I'm drinking around my ex, and don't like the state I've been going to emotionally. Of course I've been accountable and have apologized, but I'm disappointed that it's happened 3 times now. An apology isn't good enough for that - actual actions are. I know it's time for me to face the grief without substances, and so this is what I need to do. Today is day 1, all over again. 

I'm trying so hard not to beat myself up about it all, but the self-loathing is so real. The sadness is so real. I'm scared to face it. I'm scared to feel it. But I know I have to do this, one day at a time. I just feel so alone.

Last night while my boyfriend was working I got caught up in a videogame. Usually we text on his breaks, but I didn't notice the time. It wouldn't be the first time I got drunk on a Sunday night while he was gone. After texting me a few times and me not seeing it until over an hour later, he started saying things like 'It's your first day running a new machine. Dont screw yourself.""

He had every right to assume the worst, because I had shown him the worst a hundred times. I knew his anxiety was justified, but something about it still bothered me. It filled _me_ with anxiety even though I was perfectly sober. 

I guess it's just another good reminder of how bad it was. I got flashbacks to all the times I seriously fucked up and how awful it was to be drunk or hungover on important days. Such a nightmare...

I’d been trying to moderate my alcohol consumption for 11 years. I had times when I could cut back or abstain (during pregnancies) but I always wound up back to drinking at least a half a bottle of wine per night, more on weekends. 

Last October my husband carried me out of a wedding that I was only going to have “one or two” glasses of wine at. I ended up puking in the hallway of our hotel and blacking out. The next day, as I vomited 8 times on our drive back home and shook from alcohol withdrawal and shame, I promised my husband I would quit until the end of the year. I joined this subreddit the next day and decided to just keep going. I almost drank again in February, after losing a very wanted pregnancy. But I didn’t. I cried myself to sleep plenty of nights but I didn’t drink. I am newly pregnant again and I truly believe that stopping drinking helped me conceive again quickly (my two other kids took much longer, when I was actively drinking). 

My husband is proud of me. I’m a better wife and a better mother. I don’t rush my kids off to bed so I can start in on my “mommy juice.” I have no desire to be drunk ever again.

I’ve dealt with the challenges of COVID and a minor breakup with less distress than I would have in 2019, when I’m certain my reaction to both would have been to reach for the wine bottle.

I’m learning to make better choices, to actually be NICER to myself when I’m having a bad day (sad that this is a revelation), to think clearly, to pursue hobbies, to spend time with people in my life who I have more in common with than a shared love of drunk shenanigans. I’ve been able to support, in small ways, friends and family who are struggling with the same problem. I’ve received compliments on my skin, my weight is down, I’m sleeping well. I’m starting to gain trust in myself that I can handle challenges. 

None of the ups or downs compare to knowing I’ll never have to feel that visceral, hopeless agony I felt that day (and so many times before that).

Thank you to this group for showing me that I’m not alone in wanting to feel better and be better, because it often seem that way.

I have been happy about every choice I have made today and even thought about how my sides don’t have that strange feeling of extra weight or stress that they usually have.

Yes, I had some rough days just in the two weeks and two days I have been alcohol free, but I did not drink. Even if I had caved and drank it isn’t the end of this journey. The rough days where mentality weakens and strength deteriorates are no longer going to be barriers in my path, but fuel to propel me forward.

Wife continuing to be a heavy drinker is difficult - you really notice how this substance affects your relationship and family (when you are sober).  But I'm committed to quitting and then dealing with that in future.  One step at a time.

Mentally the fog is beginning to lift, still not perfect but it's improving.  For context I was a 4-6 per day drinker every day.  Never less than four maybe I'm underestimating my maximum but it's just a guess.  Could be more with the liberal wrist I have in my pours.

Energy is coming back.  Wow.  That's been missing.  Amazing how drinking saps drive and motivation!

The cravings haven't been horrible and that's a little scary because I know they are coming and I have my tools ready to deal with those triggers.

Since beginning my journey into sobriety, I’ve come here every time I’ve felt like a drink. All your stories help me see the beauty and strength in sobriety! I should mention that French is my first language, so my English isn’t perfect. 

I’ve got to say I love my sober life, even if it gets hard at times! I’ve leaned in to it and can say I’m healthier and happier than I was before. My bipolar disease and weight issues have improved drastically, to mention those only. My friends are very supportive of me. 

However, for the past month, I’ve been experiencing peaks of anxiety. I’m afraid I’ll never find the ability to feel fun and adventurous and to let go to the same degree that I did when I drank and partied. I worry that I’ll never be able to date again because I can’t seem to meet new people. I’m a little shyer at parties and sometimes avoid them when I know there’ll be heavy alcohol consumption. I go through moments of complete dread when I think of the future, seeing as I feel like I can’t socialize and live a normal life at 25. 

I hope no one will perceive this as insulting or patronizing, but I have such a hard time with the word “recovery”. Whenever I hear it, I feel a little “less than” than people who don’t have to deal with alcohol abuse. Like I’ll always be sick and/or convalescent. It makes me feel a little defeated, especially since I have to deal with the whole concept of “recovery” concerning bipolar, which is another condition I’ll always have to live with.

I’m wondering if anyone has gone through similar thoughts and would be willing to share their experience. No one in my social circle or family is sober, and many deal with substance abuse. They are kind and supportive, but I feel like they don’t understand what I’m going through at times. I have tried A.A.-like programs, but they weren’t my cup of tea. Thank you so much!",6

Now being sober my anxiety is fighting me.  I now remember I drank to quiet my mind.  I'm struggling first of all because I naively went into this thinking being sober would fix all my problems.  Now it has fixed some of my problems but more importantly it took away the only way I dealt with stress and anxiety.  I know if I took a drink I could finally have relief.. even though I don't even want it.  I ordered a treadmill and it should arrive soon.  I will not be taken down by the bottle again.  I will find new healthy ways to deal with anxiety. I want to share that although it's not always easy I believe it is worth it.  Nothing in life that comes easy challenges or changes you.

Obviously it’s not withdrawal anxiety because I hadn’t been drinking. This lead me to have a few drinks later that night. Then same.fucking.thing Sunday. Had some wine because I just couldn’t handle the anxiety. It felt like I was going to die. 

So here I am at 9am and feel like shit. I woke up at 2AM and found it nearly impossible to fall back asleep (I did for a little) and I’m literally already thinking of having some white claws this afternoon to ease the dread.

I hit 10 months.  I'm so close to a year! The past while hasn't been too hard for the most part,  with the exception of this past month. Quarantine sucks a little... but my husband got laid off from his job of 15 years. That was a hard blow to take.  Not gonna lie - after the first few sleepless nights when he told me,  I was so tired of being wrapped up in all the worry and depressing thoughts,  not being able to fall asleep or stay asleep,  that I almost caved. I was honest with him that I was considering it,  and he did a good job of reminding me how far I've come and that I don't want to go back to where I was.  Here commented on how well I am handling the layoff emotionally,  and we both agreed I wouldn't be doing so well if I was drinking.  So I'm not.  I'm staying busy,  supporting him through his job search,  cooking cheap meals from scratch,  teaching the kids (we already homeschool) and trying to stay positive.  I'm doing everything a good wife ought to do,  which wouldn't be possible if I was drinking away the stress. I feel a lot more empowered doing all those things than I would if I was downing a bottle of wine each night. 

Ever since the beginning,  when these really tough moments happen - not just cravings,  but that desire to get out of my own head- I remember what someone told me once.  ""You'll never regret not drinking."" And it's true.  I've never once woken up in the morning after not drinking,  and regretted the fact that I've stayed sober.  Not once.  But I know that there's a very good chance that I will regret it if I drink.  So I choose not to.  

Hold tight,  my friends.  We live in a very scary,  uncertain world right now.  The only way we can tackle it and come out on top is if we stay sober and stay in control of ourselves.",25

The longest I've been sober in 5 years.,"I stopped drinking on my 30th birthday. I always said I wasnt going to be in my thirties still an active alcoholic. I spent years 21 up to 30 drinking a fifth more days than I didnt. Times when i couldnt get hard liquor i was drinking a gallon of wine. I deployed for six months in 2015, and that's the only reason i got to around 60 or 70 days back then. You could still get up to 3 drinks per day out there tho, and guess who was there almost every night after I gave up. What a waste.

I've said I'd stop so many times. In the last year I've gotten to 5 days several times, then the weekend hit. 9 days, then I had a bad day at work. 12 days, then I lost my best friend in a stupid fight. There was always a reason to drink again.

Today, I hit 20 days and I haven't had a drink since I turned 30. It feels like a switch flipped and now I'm not sleeping well and I'm sore in random places when I wake up, can't even go for a 5 mile walk without being crippled the next day, which was fine just last fall. But at least I'm waking up early and going for the walk. I don't have to deal with being hungover and nauseous instead. I'm actually washing my face at night and don't dread brushing my teeth in the morning and I can enjoy coffee without the massive acid reflux. I'm getting A's in class and doing the work instead of avoiding it and just barely scrapping a C. I haven't broken down sobbing in anxiety in a month.

Not looking forward to stopping. Last time I did I had anxiety/panic attacks that nearly made my heart explode and could barely sleep.

I need to stop though. I'm overweight, out of work and massively depressed. The biggest change I'm hoping for is that I'll start being interested in things again. I used to lose track of time learning something new, working on projects, etc... These days most of the time turning on the PlayStation seems more work than pleasure...

-Join two online AA meetings per day, one at 1300 when kids sleep then one at 2100 (when I'm usually already drunk). 

-Commit to 30 mins jogging 4 times a week, kettlebell workout 30 mins the other 3 days.

I quit smoking 10 years ago so I know I can stop drinking.  The way I quit smoking was I read a book called Never Take Another Puff.  I accepted and saw clearly that smoking was going to kill me and I knew if I just went through withdrawal and never let nicotine into my blood stream again then I would be free.  I am free now from nicotine but I know for sure 100% that if I let nicotine in my body that I will be right back to where I started and will be so regretful.  I want to think this same way about alcohol.

Staying up way too late. Having Horrible, mean fights with my husband. Waking up feeling ok but emotionally all over the place throughout the day or incredibly hungover and wasted my day recovering only to continue poisoning myself that night. 
I've gained so much weight and had the bloated belly, low energy, and body to prove it. I was experiencing terrible IBS symptoms that led to an anal fissure but I kept drinking. I was so ashamed of myself and no one but my husband knew.
I heard that voice of freedom and reason every day but I wouldn't listen to her. Finally, I tried again and here I am. Reading posts in this forum has helped me so much. I check it every day. Thank you all for sharing. 
On day 10 I felt very tempted by my husband (he is still struggling). I even told him to buy me some when we were in the parking lot to pick up. When we got home I made my final decision to abstain and what really helped me was my number on here. I didn't want to change it. I've had rough days since then when I recognize that I would usually drink. I'm working on acknowledging those feelings and letting them pass.
I've been taking an epsom salt bath every night to get away from my usual habits of drinking, watching tv, and late night eating. I've been practicing intermittent fasting every day and a few 24-48hr fasts which have helped me lose my inflammation very fast and I plan to work on that daily as another habit replacement.
So far, I have saved over $200 and nearly 100 hours. To celebrate 2 weeks, I bought myself a ukelele.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK we’ve experienced over the past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

I was away from SD for a little while there, and coming back, I’ve been really struck by how important this community has been to my sobriety, and also to my life. I started my journey with getting sober here. This is where I first started learning that it was okay to open up about the deeply shameful and mostly secret struggle that I was having with alcohol. I barely talked about my drinking with anyone before I got to SD.

I learned a lot from other people here. I learned that I wasn’t the only one trying to hide the contents of my recycling bin because I didn’t want the garbage man or my neighbors to know. I learned that I wasn’t the only person trying to figure out what happened the night before from context clues I could pick up from my environment and conversations with people who were there.

I also learned that it was possible to be sober. I learned that people got sober and were still interesting and actually seemed to have pretty decent lives. I learned that I didn’t have to lose my personality or sense of humor in order to be sober. I learned that it was okay for me to quit when I felt like I needed to quit, that I didn’t have to wait for a drunk driving charge, and I didn’t have to get anyone else to agree with me that my drinking was a problem. It was a problem when I said it was a problem.

I also learned that it was okay to make mistakes, that I didn’t have to be perfect at this. I could relapse and come back and try again, and I would be welcomed back and given support and acceptance. I learned that it didn’t matter how bad my drinking had gotten, or how much of a mess I’d made of my life, I could still recover. I could still get sober. Other people had done it. So could I.

So my AoK this week has been spending more time back on here responding to posts and participating in the community. It’s an AoK to myself as much or more than it is for anyone here. Being a part of the SD community feels good, and it helps me to stay sober. Being a sober person who’s active in my recovery is only one component of my identity, I didn’t stop being a fully rounded person when I got sober. But if I don’t keep my sobriety central in my life, in the long run I don’t stay sober. Without my sobriety I don’t have much of anything, I’m back to full throttle trying to manage my drinking and barely participating in my own life. So I’m grateful to be here, sobernauts. Thank you all for all of the kindness you’ve shown me over the years. I’ve gotten a lot of love from SD.

Anyway, enough of the mushy stuff, that’s me for this week. How’s everyone else doing this week, any AoK that you’d like to share?",21

I guess I feel right now I don't have anyone my life I can talk to about all this. I'm fortunate enough that I've been able to keep myself busy and positive with journaling/reading/podcast and also am so so lucky to have a therapist I talk to twice a month. But part of me wonders if how long I can keep this up by myself.

If I'm honest, deep down I feel like I have the earned the right to go to AA maybe? Like my story isn't serious enough? Just writing that seems silly, but it's how I'm feeling. Also, the thought of going to some kind of organized meeting where I don't know anyone, with the option of publicly speaking,BY MYSELF is horrifying.

Obviously I won't be able to go anytime soon, but just wanted to see some of yalls experience with AA. Maybe a walk through of a typical meeting?

I’ve had many signs or wake up calls that alcohol isn’t a good idea for me given my past, but I didn’t listen.","My first sign came when I was 10. My mom picked me up from daycare and had told me my dad was “going away for 6 months”, which meant he got his 3rd DUI and finally had to pay for it. When I was 13, he went back in jail AGAIN for the same shit, this time for 18 months. He missed out on crucial stuff, such as showing me how to drive, or shave, or whatever. 

My second sign came 12 years after, when I got busted for drinking and driving. I didn’t hurt anyone other than myself and my future ahead, and my parents. I had quit for about a year, then I got let off probation, the dust settled a bit, and I started doing what early 20s people do: socially drink.

My third sign came last month. My uncle, who was like a brother to me, helped raise me, and was one of my best friends, died at 36. He had been struggling for a while, but none of us knew it was this bad. He was basically having one last “hoorah” before going to rehab, but it took a grim turn when his heart stopped and he had to be in a medically induced coma. We exhausted very option, but the doctor couldn’t save him. My family is crushed and given all that’s going on, we haven’t felt like we could properly grieve. We’ve been so distracted with all the bullshit. Reality doesn’t feel real. 

The other day, I turned 27. I had a few beers and woke up feeling like garbage. I sat around all day and thought about all this. Why do I continue doing this, given it’s caused myself and my family nothing but negative emotions, and it makes me feel terrible, mentally and physically? I’m finally acknowledging all these signs. I’ve never been able to have “just one”. I exercise regularly and am a pretty healthy person, which is how I justify the social or weekend drinking. I’m very thankful I found this sub, it helps give me hope and realize I don’t need this drug. I have a long road ahead of me, but I’m happy to call this my day 1. Thank you. ❤️",7

I was drinking a lot, super stressed out from work, and incredibly sad and angry over a guy. Long story short, I tried killing myself. I’ve struggled with generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, pmdd (severe pms), and addiction for a really long time. 10 years ago I began drinking alcohol. I’ve had many forced periods of abstinence during that time. Mostly because I know I have a problem and the guilt is unbearable. The longest period without alcohol lasted 8 months, and it’s been 2 years since I began drinking again after that 8 month period. After my recent suicide attempt, I’ve decided, along with my GP, to try antidepressants again. I’m looking at it as a double blessing. Obviously I want to combat my mental health issues. And I know alcohol exacerbates those issues. Also though, taking this antidepressant means I’m really not allowed to drink if I want it to work. I’m on day 37 without alcohol. I feel OK, though I’m still sad half the time. Sometimes I feel the urge to drink-mostly when I’m feeling down and those awesome cognitive distortions I’ve been told to keep an eye out for start creeping in. I was seeing a therapist, but I’ve stopped because she just wasn’t a right fit for me. Still taking the antidepressant; ended up having the dosage increased because it didn’t help during my last pms cycle. I’m terrified it’s still not going to work. That it’s not going to touch my pmdd symptoms, again. The thought of starting all over again with something different is disheartening. But hey, at least I’m not drinking.",9

I can forget how bad it was, particularly because there’s no one really left in my life from that time and I have lived in a completely different state and city the entire time I’ve been sober, so there’s no real physical reminders of my old life on a daily basis. But make no mistake,  things were an absolute mess—I was black out drunk every night and I had completely alienated almost everyone in my life because nothing mattered to me more than alcohol. I tried stopping several times and had a few stretches of sobriety (longest was 9 months before I randomly got drunk one night, a decision which ultimately ended up costing me my relationship, job, and living situation). And still I didn’t get sober until two more attempts later, just a month shy of my 25th birthday.

My life now is by no means easy but it is stable and almost comically conventional and dull. I’m an attorney and a mom. I have hard days, and when things get hard I do still miss alcohol. What helps me not drink is the hard earned knowledge that drinking only exacerbates problems and honestly, time itself takes the sting out of most every problem. Just the mere passage of time is like the opposite of drinking, really, particularly because at least for me, when I was actively drinking, it’s like time wasn’t moving forward at all—I wasn’t ever learning from my mistakes because I was always too drunk, so I never grew.

Obviously we are now in a pandemic and while I’m not really in serious danger of relapsing, I can’t say that I haven’t been struggling. Mainly I have been very nostalgic about drinking. The addict voice inside of me whispers, “who cares that you’re an alcoholic? The world is ending and nothing will ever be the same. Might as well have relief.” That voice never goes away, by the way; you just have to learn to live with it.

So on a particular bad day I googled something along the lines of “having a hard time miss alcohol” and saw this subreddit.. And just reading through the titles of your posts had me crying because I was instantly transported back to those early days of struggling and wondering if it would be worth it.

So thank you all. Your bravery to take action to stop drinking in the middle of a time of unprecedented uncertainty has reignited this alcoholic’s own commitment to sobriety. And make no mistake about it. You all are really reallly brave and deserve a medal. It really is just one day at a time. And it really is worth it.

Thanks for reading my novel if you got this far.",272

I've starting asking myself new questions. I am way passed, ""was drinking really a problem"" YES, it was. And, now I'm on to, ""what had changed"". So, as I unearth things that my drinking and my fixation with protecting my drinking,  like she was a hidden lover I didn't want anyone to know about. I realize that I had stopped doing things that might cause me to push myself.  

My nature is to do hard things. I climb literal mountains, I run marathons, I learned to scuba dive when I was 12 (back then it was the earliest they would allow). I have never been afraid to do hard things. But, somehow that all slowed way down. I still did some cool stuff, and some hard stuff (much of it with a hangover), but I avoided anything that might make me feel like a failure, or worse yet, look like a failure. 

*WHAT???* That's not me, I'm not afraid to suck at something in front of others. After all, the only way to get better is to work really hard at something, and usually (unless you've got some crazy prodigy gene) you don't start out as a master, you start out in the shallow end of the pool with a floatie. 

Last year, I bought a used mountain bike, because mine was a relic. Today, I pumped up the tires, I dusted off my helmet, I found my gloves, I squeezed into my biking shorts, and I met a friend at a local trailhead. I cautioned her, ""I'm gonna suck"", ""in fact, on the ride over, I had to remember how to shift the gears, and I feel scared about falling"". She said, ""me too, let's just see how this goes and hope we don't go home bleeding"" and we laughed.  It was hard, we didn't go that far, but my legs were shaky and I got scared in some places and hopped off and walked my bike.  It felt good to be doing something that's not easy for me. I'm probably never gonna be a great mountain biker, but dang, it felt to so good to push myself past my ""scared"" past my ""I suck"", past ""weak legs"".  

I rode home with a smile my face and ate a big 'ol cookie (oatmeal chocolate chip).  This little victory is the sign of something that I let alcohol rob me of. I took it back today.  I'm going to keep looking for things I've been avoiding. Hard conversations. Hard home projects. Hard stuff.  I want my life back, damn it. I want myself back.  IWNDWYT",26

No, brain, this time last year I was drinking alone in my room on my birthday. You're lying to me again, brain. Stop it. 

This time last year I was 25 and didn't want to be alive anymore.

I started drinking when I was a teenager and haven't had a substantial break since then. I did some online shopping and bought myself some clothes with the money I would've spent on alcohol.

I know this sounds like such a petty thing, but I can't tell if I'm actually going to be capable of just having the one and calling it a day or if I'm just lying to myself.

Right now I'm at a point where 95% of nights I can't fall asleep unless I've drank enough whiskey or beer to pass out. Pre-COVID, this was the case about 50% of the time now it's pretty much every night.

We all live in an apartment and my stress and anxiety have just been skyrocketing because of coronavirus, losing our childcare arrangements and losing income (my wife took a paycut, my business went into survival mode and lost 60% of our income). I run a small business and, because my wife's work schedule is less flexible than mine and she earns more $$, I'm doing the vast majority of the childcare while she works. I love my son but he's a handful and I'm constantly stopping him from trying to climb up the bookshelf or draw on the TV with crayons. I've gone from working a 50 hour week for my business to maybe 20 hours a week if I'm lucky. My wife watches the kid for 1-2 hours during the day, I get to work when he naps for 45-90 mins each day, and then I squeeze in a few hours of work so I can keep my business afloat by either waking up early or going to bed late.

Any time I try to talk to my wife about what's going on, she just refuses to talk about it and shuts down or brings up people who have it worse (Several family friends have had COVID, we know lots of folks who are unemployed, etc)... I don't have any time right now to talk to friends, the house looks like a mess and my waking hours are almost entirely spent either on childcare or my job. There's no time to do exercise, go on a walk, etc... I've tried and there just isn't that ability to cut it.

How the hell do I cut down on my drinking right now? If I don't drink, even if I'm super tired I just stare at the ceiling and hate my life for hours on end and my brain just doesn't let me fall asleep at all. It sucks.",6

Hi all,

I’ve finally acknowledged that I do not have my drinking under control. After a suicide attempt in September, my therapist and psychiatrist as well as just about everyone caring for my unit in the hospital has “strongly suggested” rehab and AA meetings but I’ve always resisted.
Met with a substance abuse counselor a couple of times and then stopped going because I thought I didn’t need it.
I’ve been drinking way more and more often then I ever have. Last week I went on a binger and don’t remember anything from about 3 days in the week. I very impulsively agreed to take care of some kittens (which I’m trying to mend now in the best way possible. I’m an idiot but I’m not cruel.)

Overall in the last couple of years I did so many things I never thought I would. Just a lot of crossed lines. I’m extremely ashamed and even reaching out to anyone has been unthinkable. But I’ve come to the conclusion that I need help. I tried on my own and it went real sour. No job, really behind in school, a lot of risky sex with people I don’t know well.

I didn’t drink yesterday. I don’t intend to today either. I’m just... trying to find a sober community. No one in my life is sober and it’s time I took initiative and changed that.

I’m glad for this subreddit and looking forward to participating. End intro!",5

Still in the dream, I remembered SD and was trying to figure out if I should lie to you (and myself) and say I didn’t know it had booze or be honest and set my counter back to day 1. I distinctly remember the panic I felt at my tiny college desk with a random bag of plants I was supposed to have planted. I woke up relieved it was only a dream.

I've developed a couple of strategies for getting the nagging monkey off my shoulder. I don't really think of actually drinking most of the time, but thinking about alcohol in general sometimes/often (but seemingly less every week).

Firstly I have really ramped up the exercise, I find doing 30 mins of cardio in the day (running, Wii Fit or Youtube workouts) really sets me up for the day - I feel good through to the evening. There is no longer that reaching or yearning feeling for dopamine/relaxation. I feel naturally calm and that I don't need anything else - even the snacks/treats have cut down. I don't drink non-alcoholic beers any more due to an allergy, Kombucha is great!

I really understand now how some people can say that they eventually feel better than when they were drinking (including the actual drinking). When I sit down and recover from the running it really does feel a bit like having had a couple of drinks, with none of the negative effects. Also the buzz was so diminished/fleeting for me anyway, due to high tolerance - it actually often ended up feeling a bit weird/off. I understand why so many people in recovery turn to running etc, it really can act as a replacement and change your worldview. That feeling of 'I can't see myself living without alcohol' fades.

Secondly I've tried memorising lots of things for when I'm triggered (seeing people drinking, hot weather etc), and for some reason, thinking of alcohol as **a trap** really cuts it off for me. I see alcohol as a trick to make the producers money - a pit of despair, poisoning, ill health, lost time, lost dreams. A quagmire where day-to-day life becomes labored and difficult, with occasional relief provided by drinking more. Then I remind myself that it's over, I'm free and never have to feel like that ever again. It's brighter on the other side.

I had 6 days free from alcohol. Yesterday I chose to buy a pint of vodka. I drank it over the course of 5 hours. I was never too intoxicated, but the phenomenon of craving kicked in around 10:30pm. All of the stores were closed because of covid, and of course I wasn’t happy with myself. I slept for almost 9 hours, but I woke up tired and with a headache.

One of the problems with my drinking is that 8 shots of liquor isn’t enough. It is obviously not sustainable for my health to consume that much liquor every day. Also, the fact that I’m hiding my drinking is a huge red flag. 

What upsets me is that I had the power of choice over my drinking yesterday, and I still made the wrong choice. There was no physical compulsion to take a drink, it was all mental obsession. I didn’t take actions to protect myself, and instead gave in to my addiction.

I can’t believe I’m at day 30. Just like everyone else we are stressed out. My husband was in the midst of a job change when coronavirus took hold. Thankfully it worked out. We are relocating and in the last 30 days we have been in the process of trying to find and purchase a home. We found a home which is a major down grade from our last home but I’m loving the idea of simplifying and living more minimally.  At least that’s what I’m telling myself. Actually with all that’s going on I do feel blessed about that. (Except at around 2 am when I lay and worry about everything)

When I drink I would go to bed and zonk out and then wake up at 2 am thirsty, anxious, worried about what terrible things I had said the night before. I’d check my phone and cringe!  Actually the last night I drank I said something/s terrible to my husband and I still don’t remember what it was. He slept on the couch and the next several days I walked on egg shells and was so pissed at myself because it was repetitive behavior for me. I just always thought I would moderate how much I drank next time. 

The first couple weeks sober I could not fall asleep!  Then I did have a week or so of just lovely sleep. Now I’m up in the middle of the night stewing about moving and hoping we’re not making a mistake with the home we’re purchasing.  But at I’m sober!  If I had been drinking these last 30 days I can pretty much imagine how much MORE stressful this time would’ve been. Oh my! Horrible to think about!  

I’m an introvert so being home 99% of the time has been good for getting sober. I worry about when we again have social events to attend as I used alcohol as a crutch.  Don’t get me wrong, I drank every night if we were going out or staying home regardless. I have hope that having the ability to build up more days in sobriety will make me stronger when it’s time to socialize again. 

I didn’t mean for this to be so long. Thanks for listening to my rambling and thanks for being here with me.  This place is a huge help for me. I’m proud of my 30 days but still very much feel like I’m walking a tightrope.

Mostly because half a year ago, it felt impossible. Stringing more than a few days together was an insurmountable obstacle... until it wasn't.  
  

I'd love to say that's it's been a cake walk and that everything is wonderful.... but that would be a lie. This past month has been the hardest... at least the hardest since the very beginning. That being said, there's a reason I'm still sober, and it's because it's worth it, and because even when it's hard, I'm working at it.
  
So what have I learned along the way?  
  

Well, for starters.... 6 months is a long time, but it also really isn't ha ha. It's just a baby step in the bigger picture.  

Not drinking doesn't instantly make everything else better, but it definitely stops making things worse!!

Addiction doesn't look the same for everyone. The road to recovery is also different for each person.

She suffers from extreme and anxiety and depression. The fact she got out for a walk was great but everything she says is negative. If you try to give her any inspiration it is shot down with a negative response about how she cant. I try to understand her depression but just like understanding addiction it can be hard to understand from the outside. By the end of the walk I'm quite mentally full and bagged. A drink would sure take the edge off as I'm now full of anxiety. I realize its my own mind giving me anxiety and my minds response to dealing with her and wanting her to get better.

I used to have a few glasses of wine maybe 3-4 times a week. Then the pandemic hit. I was working from home at this point, so I knew that meant I could sleep in longer, and thought why not drink? I drank almost a bottle of wine a night. I’m young enough to where I didn’t wake up with a hang over, but I would wake up with a stomach ache that made even food taste bad. I wouldn’t really “wake up” until noon, despite “working” since 8. I gained about 5 pounds in the past three weeks from it. 

I never thought of myself as having an alcohol problem. I didn’t ever HAVE to finish a bottle or feel the need to drink during the day, but I knew the way my body was feeling in the morning that I was definitely having too much. 

I now haven’t drank in a week. I feel my memory getting better. I feel like I’m thinking quicker on my feet. I’m feeling truly awake when I wake up. (Well, an occasional coffee never hurts, but still). 

I’m thinking now to just stop drinking for a month to really get it all out of me, and bring my body and mind to back how it should. I’m thinking the occasional drink for date night wouldn’t hurt, so long as I don’t go crazy like before. Once every other week maybe to have a couple glasses? I’m not sure, but I am proud of the change I’ve noticed and want it to continue on. 💪🏻 figure this group is just what I need for accountability!",14

This subreddit has helped me immensely and really gave me a push to end my obsessive binge drinking. Quarantine seemed like the best time to attack my problem, and... it worked! I went 20 days. Just shy of the three week mark. I was proud. I had also given up smoking at the same time which I was extremely proud of. But, I let my pride blind of me of my aspirations and why I did this in the first place. I didn't choose to drink because I was sad, or lonely, or looking for an escape. It was for fun! Or so I thought... I did have fun for a bit that night. I was with my loved ones, we played cards, we ate a great dinner and did all the things that constitute a great night but it wasn't worth it. It never is anymore. Before this decision I was running everyday, losing weight, reading three hours a day and generally making the most of being forced to be at home. But because I lost sight and strength I slept in the wrong bed, I didn't remember even going to bed, I ordered pizza for us all to sloppily eat for lunch the next day (I generally try and eat very healthy, and we already had a BIG cheat dinner coming), I didn't run, read, or clean. The next day was a repeat. And today I'm finally back on track(ish). I was up early I've read but I tried to go for a run and it was like nearly three weeks of progress was halted immediately. Like my body was laughing at me for even trying after taking three days to do what I did. 

So this time I will remember that. I will be stronger and I will continue to improve myself everyday instead of taking steps back. I will ask myself ""are my actions leading me to the life I want to live and/or the person I want to be"". Because that's important to me and now I wont forget it. Thank you for reading and although I'd probably enjoy it for a bit IWNDWYT.

Lately I've also been struggling with some health issues and have been seeing specialists off an on to track down these issues to a possible autoimmune disease. This along with seeing a therapist for anxiety and depression. Of course this has all been slowed way down thanks to the pandemic, unfortunately. But I'm adding this in because even when I have a moderate amount of alcohol (\~2 drinks) I feel more crappy than the average person, and I ALWAYS know I'll be left feeling this way, yet I do it again and again.

Also, do others find that their anxiety spikes 24-48 hours after having alcohol?

11 years, what has changed? Outlook and perspective.

Past me would have been angry that there's something stopping me from celebrating with friends. Present me is grateful I have you all to share this day with.

Past me was afraid of what people thought of me. Present me is grateful for how I turned out.


Past me was selfish. Present me is grateful I can share my life with others.

Past me was arrogant. Present me is grateful I can learn so much from others.


I'm so grateful for where I am today. It's all of you, and my support network that has made this possible. 

I started drinking and drugs at 13, spiraled down, lost touch with friends and family, dropped out of highschool, was even homeless for a short while. The principal of my highschool said I wouldn't amount to much. I believed him. 

Support is what got me sober. I'm 32 years old, and I'm grateful that support got me sober at 21. 

I struggled a long time with my self worth while getting sober. I felt like I had a chip on my shoulder. I wasn't as good as everyone else because I got my GED instead of graduating highschool, or that I didn't finish university.

I'm now grateful for all those things. It made me who I am today. Life isn't perfect, but it's my life and I appreciate it.

Don’t have anyone to talk to really. Even if I wasn’t self-isolating with my partner and ten week old son, there’s not anyone that I click with. None of my friends really ‘get’ me. Yeah, I’m aware I sound like a whiny teen... but I am so lonely.

I don’t always feel like this. Today is a bad day. I’m realising I’m way more alone than I thought I was when I really think about it. And does anyone actually know me? (Again, whiny teen lol) doesn’t feel like it. I try so hard to be the right thing for everyone in my life but who the fuck am I really.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

 Good morning DCI, I've discovered plenty of perks from not drinking. A surprising one for me is that for years I had this pain - I'm guessing heartburn, that would be so severe it would hurt my chest and go through to my back and believe it or not actually hurt my ears! It wasn't constant, just occasional and I assumed it was due to my coffee consumption. I can't remember exactly how long I had quit drinking when it hit me that it doesn't happen at all anymore. It was from the booze! What's the most surprising perk you've discovered since you quit drinking?

About a month ago, I just said screw it, I'll just try to not feel. All that did was seriously ramp up my drinking, making me feel worse, more guilty, less prepared to parent, and farther away from fixing anything. Got to a fever pitch on Easter. I finally broke down, was honest with my wife (and I guess myself too) about my problems and our problems. Last drink was Monday night. Here I am, 5 sleepless nights later, still with a raging headache (please, when does that stop?????)

The good news is I'm actually feeling better most of the day. More energy, clearer thoughts, and fixing a lot of broken things (both literally and figuratively). I still have little control over my emotions right now. I think I have cried more in the past week than I have my entire life. Started running and that has been hugely helpful. I still just feel so ashamed for so much of what I have done to myself.

I had a lot of drinking dreams where I'd black out... *in the dream* and felt so awful. I shake my head in disbelief that I ever actually did that as a normal and acceptable part of life even though I've had more than enough proof and reminders of that being that case.

I play the tape forward and it doesn't take long to get to the black out. I know that's where it's going to go and based on past relapses, I know it's going to be the worst. I know it's extremely probable that all the fears and close calls I had in 13 years of drinking will finally be actualized. I don't want that. I don't even want to get close to that ever again.

That was the thing for me. This switch flipped and I've found more peace and contentment with the concept of sobriety than I ever have. Remarkably, as this pandemic has progressed, I've gotten *more* sure of sobriety, not just being something I want but something I - and those around me - need. I shudder to think of how things would've played out so far had I not gotten sober.

I don't know if this feeling is permanent. I doubt it is but I don't really need it to be. I just need to not drink for one day as many times as it takes to come back around to it again. I feel a lot better about my ability to do that, especially if I utilize all the support and resources offered to me.

Want to thank you guys very much. IWNDWYT",13

I've  been working out A LOT. Maybe too much. I did so much yesterday that I had no choice but to rest today. Oh and I barely slept last night. I feel guilty for not working out, and anxiety is creeping in.

I know it isn't real or true. I am trying my best to fight it. Goddamn if it doesn't feel like I'm slipping backwards though. Self pity and shitty thinking always lead me back to drinking.

I have been a binge drinker for almost 10 years now. Since having kids 3 years ago I have not drank often. Maybe a couple times a month after my kids were old enough to stay at grandmas.

But even with only drinking couple times a month drinking literally fucks up my life. Since my kids I have been prone to blacking out. Maybe lack of sleep, excited to be with friends or who knows what. But every time I blackout it sends me into a depression for a week. I feel suicidal and shame and just terrible. So for a week after sometimes longer I’m not the best parent I can be. I don’t take care of my self the way I should. I avoid friends and isolate and feel terrible. So even if I drink twice a month those two times usually take a week each so recover from. That’s two weeks I’m not being the best version of my self. I hate missing out on that time. 

Why can some people drink and maintain a life ? I know I can’t drink and I’m ok with that sometimes I just wonder what’s the difference between me and them ? I do have a history of alcoholism in my family. Thanks for reading my rant haha IWNDYT!",9

Like many other people, I would drink to calm the anxiety and intrusive thoughts. 

I have stopped drinking many times just to start back up again. I’ve hit six months one other time as well. Long story, short, I have stopped and started many times. 

I wanted to share something that, I believe, has helped me quit for good. I made a realization that I drink because I have anxiety and I have anxiety because I drink. A lot of people experience that crippling anxiety the day after a binge. You try and get a couple days sober but the anxiety is so horrible that you start drinking again to quiet it. 

Yes, the anxiety is horrible for the first couple days, weeks, even months. But once you get past it, and your head clears and your thoughts are more rational, things get better. Not perfect, but better. 

I drink because I have anxiety, I have anxiety because I drink. I don’t want to have anxiety. So why am I drinking?

I have recently become a homeowner again. I bought a nice little fixer upper shortly before this whole COVID thing exploded. On the one hand, I've been grateful for the diversion it has provided for me during this time. On the other hand, holy crap, this is making it *very* apparent to me that I have a pattern of creating situations in my life where drinking made sense.

I'm realizing that the expectations that I've had of myself about how much work I can do on the house and the time frame that I think I should be able to do it in are *insane*. Other people might have limitations on the amount that they can do, but for reasons I can't articulate because they don't exist, *I* should be able to do as much as a team of trained professionals, in the same time frame, and up to the same standards. 

I want it to do a complete renovation almost entirely by myself in a couple of months, basically. I have some experience with stuff like this, but I'm nothing like a professional at it. I also have some health stuff going on that I didn't have the last time that I tackled a project like this. Still, I'm expecting myself to meet these standards, and beating myself up for not meeting them in the time frame that I think I should. Suffice to say, work has not progressed at the clip I intended, nor is it being done *entirely* up to scratch.

It's insane. I'm being unreasonable and insane. I'm creating chaos and stress in my life, and also setting myself up for failure, which, incidentally, is a pattern that I have. And it creates the *perfect* conditions for drinking. 

So I'm having a moment of clarity, and I'm applying my tools of recovery to the situation. First, I'm accepting that reality is what it is, and I don't have the power to change it. I have a vision of how I think things in the house *should* be, but tough turkey, Ginger Sprout. I have to accept the reality of where the house actually *is*, and I have to accept the reality of how much I can reasonably get done and what the time frame of that is realistically going to be.

Second, I'm realizing that I can actually ask for help. There are people who have offered to help me, and I haven't taken anyone up on it, because I'm a control freak, and I'm also deeply uncomfortable with accepting help. I'm going to reconsider that stance, and I'm going to ask for help. I hate not being perfect, and I hate not being able to do things on my own. I would much rather just invite people over as guests when it's all beautiful and done. But that's not going to happen for quite a while, so in the meantime, I'm going to think about what I can ask for help with.

Third, I'm going to apply some AA slogans to the situation: One Day At A Time, First Things First, and Easy Does It. I value my living environment, and I don't regret taking this on, but I'm realizing that this is going to be quite a bit like getting sober. It's going to take time to get where I want to be, and I'm only going to get there by taking small, consistent, sustainable action. This is about the journey, not about the destination.

I used to try to get sober in a flurry of activity - *Change all of the things!!* I'd quit drinking and throw myself into yoga and be eating super healthy and all sorts of crap, and in a very short period of time I'd be having a drink. I'd disappoint myself and beat myself up about it, and the only way to deal with that, and to deal with chaos and stress, was to drink. Real change takes time. This is no different.

Anyway, I'm still a crazy alcoholic, even though it's been a while since I've had a drink. But, as long as I stay sober, I can deal with whatever life (or my own internal unmanageability machine) throws at me. I love you all. Thank you for being here with me.

Once again I’m waking up 3-4 times a night soaked in sweat, feeling depleted and feverish. Once again I’m dealing with skyrocketing evening anxiety. Once again I’m having the most crazy and disturbing dreams. 

I’m not saying don’t use Benadryl. Honestly, it was a life saver in the first week. I’d white knuckle those cravings and anxiety until 8 or 9 and then say goodnight to that godawful day. But I didn’t need to keep taking it.

It was a tough, bitter pill to swallow, but it was the truth and I’m starting to realize that accepting hard truths, while difficult, can be incredibly freeing. All these years of shame, sadness and packing away the things I couldn’t bear to face have been like the most cumbersome shackles I’ve been carrying and facing these harsh truths feel like I’m slowly unpacking these burdens.

Seems like there is a ton of positive energy here! Anyway, a little background on me: former smoker (cigarettes) and was able to kick that habit 2-3 years ago; was once a all day everyday weed smoker; now only on occasion socially (considering dropping it completely). 

I never had issues with alcohol until about 2ish years ago. Working at a bar and hanging with co-workers downtown after kind of got me started. Then had to help my mom get out of quite a few bad situations and a couple years ago had to take her to the hospital for alcohol related stuff and then to rehab....it was around that time when I really started drinking heavy. Also I was hating my job, so started to drink before seeing clients... I for quite a while was drinking about a pint of fireball a day. Had blackouts before too when it was more. Have done a lot of dumb stuff under the influence. I hate it. My parents are functional alcoholics and it's hard sometimes.

Anyways I want to be sober again. I miss the old me. I also don't want to waste away my life buzzed or irritable. Luckily I'm in good health and just turned 28, so would love to get a handle on things now. No kids yet but wife and I will be starting a family probably this year.

I am looking for some encouragement. I didn’t have a drink in over ten months, but this lockdown situation really pushes my anxiety through the roof and the urge to give in and have a glass or three to calm me down (or better to numb all my senses) is getting stronger every day.
I don’t want to go back to who I was, hung over every morning, knocked-out drunk at least once a month.
I tell myself when I can make it through COVID-19 sober, I can do anything. But it is really, really hard.
How are you holding up?",2

Even though I knew I was drinking too much I was completely in denial that it was as big of a problem as I thought. Public intoxication, DUI, promiscuity - all of it and still I denied the seriousness of it.

I'm at the stage where I'm removing all booze from my house, but also all weed. Giving up the weed is so so so hard. It was never the problem. And all the weed I have was expensive (probably $200 worth of high quality weed, some of it unopened)! I have even been having the thought of ""maybe I'll get better so I should save the weed for later"" and have been having fond memories of getting high and watching a thinker movie.

Until just a few days ago I was certain I need to go completely abstinent. Weed wasn't the problem, but I also tried to use it as a solution to my problems but that didn't work. It mostly led me back to drinking again. 

Just hoping for some rational words of encouragement from the community. This is surprisingly really, really difficult.

Background: I work out 5-6 days a week and used to be an athlete. My workouts are OK but I have been very tired and hard to summon energy to do much working out, or around the house.

First day not drinking I deep cleaned two rooms in our house that I’ve meant to clean for a month. Funny how when you’re not drinking, you suddenly have so much time to do things! 

Second day not drinking, was not tired all day despite taking care of a toddler, working from home, cooking, cleaning, and working out

Third day not drinking, ran an 8 minute mile without breathing too hard. I haven’t run a full mile in ages and usually do a 10 minute mile pace. 

Fourth day not drinking, woke up full of energy and suddenly a much clearer memory and not as much issues recalling things. Read an entire book in one sitting. My ADD that appeared from drinking has started going away 

Fifth day not drinking. Wow. Going to bed at 8 every night and waking up at 6am completely refreshed 

Sixth day not drinking. Suddenly inspired to finish all the projects I’ve started or put off for months.

Down 5 pounds. Eating healthier. No munchies at night. No dumb arguments with my spouse. Actually talking about our days while going to bed at night instead of watching tv or scrolling on the phone.

I challenge everyone to spend the next week not drinking and diary how your body, energy levels, and motivation levels change.

If you slip up and have a drink... make a mental note when you wake up or asking yourself did that drink make you have a better evening? Or just start the circle of self hatred again?

Wishing you all the best",22

It’s always here. Some days I can avoid the siren call but others get me. Yesterday was such a day. 

By the time he was home I was already three beers in. Then I kept going. Managed to embarrass myself in front of family and a friend (remotely), knock things over and spill them, make a mess of the house. Husband slept on the couch. I don’t even remember going to bed. 

I think I had 6 drinks. This morning is the same as a million other mornings. Spouse upset/depressed, he’s disgusted with me, I’m disgusted with me, I ate an insane amount of junk and feel physically awful. 

I feel so hopeless. No matter how hard I try I change I’m the same drunk ass whole who ruins everything. I can be good for a while but no matter what I inevitably end up back here again.

I don’t know why, maybe it’s being in isolation with the covid virus, maybe it’s just me readjusting. I just felt really down yesterday, and it’s traveling into today as well. I just feel extremely annoyed and on edge with my family. I have 3 little ones, and I hate to be that way. I just wonder if anyone else has had this happen where you feel pretty good and then around day 17ish you feel kind of blah. Maybe it’s the pink cloud effect?

I have exercised and it helps me when I do, but, it’s just frustrating feeling all these feelings isn’t it? Maybe a pandemic wasn’t the right time to be sober? Lol, I’m kidding.

It's too much to just toss in the garbage but I dont feel like locking it up is a recipe for success, and I cant take it back to the store. Having a fully stocked supply makes me feel like an idiot but we had both been casually drinking every day so it made sense when I bought it. My brother is coming over today to buy it off of me. I spent about 100 on it and he is coming to buy it for 60 so I at least feel like I didnt just throw all my money away, but he gets a good deal, and also the alcohol will be out of the house.

I'd got to a point where I wasn't often getting an urge to drink and when I did it was relatively easy to knock the urge on the head.

Recently, I've been craving alcohol every day.  I have to really remind myself why it isn't a good idea.  

I don't know why it's suddenly got so bad again.  I know we're all in a weird and stressful situation, but in fact my biggest stressors have been taken away by it.  The worst for me is the journey home from work (I'm now working from home instead) and being out in the evening (which I never do now).  I've always done better with a lot of time at home by myself.

Maybe I could expect to be having a difficult time with cravings right now, given the new worries and pressures there are.

I did wonder if it's usual for cravings to come and go over time like this, regardless of worldwide pandemics?  Have others experienced times of finding sobriety easier, then more difficult again?  Any tips?",1

""Tomorrow I'll stop drinking"".  It never happened.  It just got worse.  Last night is probably one of the biggest low-points in my life regarding drinking.  I drank a lot, but not as much as I have before, but also binge ate at the same time.

For some reason, this time, if felt totally different-this drunk.  I felt like I was going to die and the pain would never end.  Not to mention I have stomach issues, which would probably go away with stopping drinking. It was a neverending nightmare that I just had to ride out.  Perhaps my body has really had enough and is giving me one last chance to stop this insanity.  It's just odd that it felt totally different this time. Like I was outside of my body, but still feeling all of the pain.  I thought it would never end.  This morning, just recently, I put sticky notes all over my house that read something to the effect of, ,""No More! You can do this!

This empty space never filled up, despite all my best attempts to flood it. I would pour liquid into the emptiness, twelve ounces at a time, and it just seemed to make the hole deeper. I wanted to desperately cover up this hole, this gaping wound, this thing that needed attention, to plug it forever. But the emptiness obviously wasn’t in the shape of a beer bottle. 


Is the emptiness the shape of a cube, of a safe and stable home? I finally have one, after all, after spending a chaotic childhood in a dilapidated home that’s since been bulldozed. The shape of my current home doesn’t include crumbling walls, flooding toilets, or empty cabinets. So why is this hole still empty? I guess the cube of my own safe home doesn’t quite fit.


Is the emptiness the shape of a triangle, for the diamond ring that symbolizes romantic love? All the stops and starts of our relationship, the slammed doors and squealed tires of leaving, and yet that’s the person with whom I spent so many hours flooding this vast space. Doesn’t he see that liquid isn’t working? The sparkling triangle, given and accepted with genuine love, wasn’t enough to fill this space.


Is the emptiness the shape of a circle, of a hug that wraps all the way around? I give and receive all-enveloping hugs daily from my children, despite emotional and physical neglect in my own childhood. But I kept drinking long after they were born and halfway to their adulthood, so I guess the circle of little arms didn’t plug this empty space.


So what shape fits this puzzle? What is the piece that plugs the leak, that fills my emptiness, that leads me to stop pouring into myself and instead start flowing love outward?


I suppose it is a heart, but not the kind that kindergarten valentines are made of. The shape that fills my emptiness is not delicate with lace edges. It is a heart, a messy and ugly human vessel, made of numerous invisible breaks and aches but refusing to die despite years of abuse. 


The empty space inside of me has been filling up not with the shape of tangible things, but instead the shape of an unseen but powerful heart. I hope you find yourself healing with heart, with relentless self-love, and not with liquid. 

Have a beautiful Saturday, SD. I Will Not Drink With You Today.",11
2020-04-18 10:30:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g3oe1x/58_days/,58 Days,"I'm 35.  For the better part of my life - from 15 on - I have been the life of the party and the guy buying shots for the whole fucking bar.   I have pissed away my money on booze, women, and for the last couple of years I've brought in cocaine to the mix - because WHY NOT GO FOR BROKE!  

In the beginning I was blessed to have opened a string of successful businesses so I had the means to be a dumbass.  However, as a functional asshole I couldn't handle downturns and my mood swings made everyone leave.  Eventually I lost everything including my home.  My girlfriend of 7 years hung in there because she saw how awesome I could be but she also saw how low I could go if I didn't wake up.  She never insisted, she never pushed - but she told me that for the sake of us and our daughter I had better wake up sooner or later before she finally gave up.  

Last year I managed to close two clients into homes and made enough to get us into a house (she was living with her parents, I was crashing with a friend for almost a year and a half).  For a moment, life was on the up again but I leaned into cocaine even harder and was teetering on collapse.  With her under my roof and me coming home to my family every night it just ate me up being such an idiot to the people that actually loved me.  

I work several jobs and routinely pull in 15 hours a day and I found that with coke I could still drink my face off and stay up, have a social life, and keep everything in check.  Yeah no.  Between picking up more hours so that I could maintain my bills, I couldn't sleep and didn't have time to sleep so...well here goes more cocaine!

New Years Day, I found myself popping in my bathroom to rip lines and then tequila shots to even the buzz.  I was going a million miles per hour into the ground and on February 19 I got to work at 8am off of 2 hours of sleep and cried my ass off in the bathroom.  Hungover like never before I just felt so fucking burnt out.  Years of struggling to keep up the facade, years drinking till I passed out, years wasting my talent, years no longer getting ahead but just skating by.  I was finally done.

I had downloaded an app a while back to help with sobriety but I finally was ready to use it.  I am now on Day 58 and I am so ashamed of myself that I can not ever drink again.   I have never gone more than a few days without drinking in 20 years and 2 years without cocaine.  Just straight cold turkey the motherfucker - because I finally decided I can.  BUT I can't stop dreaming.  Dreams of drinking, dreams of partying, dreams of just raging like an asshole.   I have such intense dreams that I woke up the other night crying that I fell off the wagon and my girl woke up holding me telling me that it was just a dream.  Never woke up so grateful.  I feel like God has thrown me a softball with everything being shut down so there is less of a temptation to go out and hang with the guys and get smashed.  I'm worried about when normal life returns but I've been throwing myself into what I really want to do like finally finish my pilot's license and get back into shape. 

I'm a big movie guy and in this respect I feel like I'm Neo at the end of the Matrix where he stands and says NO and the bullshit stops and falls to the floor.  I realize that the easiest part is finally standing up on 2 feet and saying it.  The hard part is the fight (and subsequent sequels).  So here I am, at work throwing in my 2 cents grateful to be working on Day 58 of my new life.  I have an intense desire at times to let loose and party but I've already done that for so long and it leads nowhere.  I want to see what another day feels like and actually live a good life.  A wise man once said, Enjoy every sandwich.  Being clean and sober, I actually taste my food and I like it.

A ""beverage break"" would probably do me some good. I had a few bad nights in December/January that made me make this decision. That mixed with some antidepressant medication (that I believe makes me react poorly when combined with alcohol) along with the hope that no alcohol will help me feel better mentally. Potential health benefits (like losing a bit of baby weight still left over from my 1 year old) also factored into the decision as well. I had been sober for extended periods of time before, I didnt expect this time to be any different. The only thing was that instead of being pregnant or being on probation, I was choosing to do so on my own. 

Overall I never really drank that much in the first place, so the break was not that hard of a plan to stick to. I mostly kept it to myself and just passed on drinks offered to me. No big deal. I wasnt sure for how long it would last. And to be completely honest I didnt want to be judged for not wanting to drink. 

Our social life is very dependent on alcohol. We have bowling, softball and saturday nights hang outs. Family parties and dinners usually involve beer/wine. When I turn down a drink I always get the response ""Why? Are you pregnant?"" No. I just don't want it. 

Once it became apparent that I was actively not drinking, my husband caught on. I wasn't hiding it from him. He knew I had had some rough nights the past few months. I felt like he would understand. I was wrong. He couldnt understand why I wanted to stop drinking all together. He said that the only reason I had a bad time was because I had too much to drink on those occasions and that if I just drink one or two I'd have been fine. That may have been true, but it didnt change my mind. 

Since before this whole thing started my husband and I have been working on so issues we've been having. Specifically communication issues, among a few others. Typically the arguments/discussions would happen after a few beers. Some of the bigger arguments were even caused by alcohol in some way or another. 

Last night, we played a drinking game with friends via video chat. I was looking forward to seeing my friends and having a good time.These friends dont know about my ""beverage break"" and I don't feel like telling/explaining my situation quite yet. I wasn't planning on participating in the drinking part. However, per my husbands request, I had a beer. I ended up only drinking half, mainly pretending when it was my turn to drink. 

When the video chat ended, I was happy with how it went. I didnt feel drunk. I also didnt feel like it had any affect on my night and that I could have and should have just had a soda. But whatever, it was a fun night. 

Then my husband mentioned how I only drank half. And the argument started. His main issue was that I couldnt explain why I want to stop drinking. I've given him my reasons, he just doesnt think they're ""good enough"" reasons to stop. That was one of his main issues with the situation. He made the ""drinking but not getting drunk"" argument. I told him I made the decision and all I wanted was for him to accept and support it. He pretty much said that me not drinking meant that I dont want to have fun. And that specifically it meant that I don't want to have a good time with him. No matter how many times I told him that wasn't the case, he couldnt 100% accept that. I stressed the fact that I already made the decision and no matter what my reasoning was, he had to accept it. 

The argument ended with him saying that most of our fun times have involved us drinking and that me not wanting to drink amymore meant that I was dismissing all of those parts of our life. As untrue as that is, I can see where he's coming from. He also said that he's mainly unhappy that I didn't tell him right away that I was going to stop drinking. I apologized for not telling him right away. I didnt say anythong because I knew he was going to be upset/judge me/tell me I was wrong. He has said to me in a him drunk/me sober argument that I ""think I'm too good for drinking"" He has also said that my medication reaction argument is all in my head. 

I'm hurt that he can't just take my choice to not drink seriously and support me. Especially now that he knows why I don't want to drink. Personal issues. Not anything to do with him/our life. 

I did not want this to snowball into a big issue. I wanted to better myself mentally and physically. I wanted to get a grasp on myself and gain some focus and clarity.",2

I don't feel emotionally bogged down.  I still have some problems sure...but they feel manageable.  I've been through some very tough things...career loss, defrauded out of serious money by an ex, etc...the things that contributed to me drinking honestly.  But I feel like I have survived those and am not as afraid of problems big or little.  

I've been watching videos and learning about some self improvement and life issues things.  It's helped to clarify a lot of confusion and frustration that also contributed to the drinking.  

Though it started by working some very long days initially, I have started eating basically a dinner and a snack per day.  I have lost 14 pounds since I quit.  Some was water retention from alcohol, the rest is shedding the years of fast food, alcohol, etc.  I've got about 20 more to go before I am where I want to be, and that will take a bit longer I know...maybe by the end of summer...but I've got to lose this gut...plus I see my face finally looking...not fat...which is helpful for the self esteem.  My BP and heart rate are back to normal too...they were damned high at times while I was drinking.  Now I just hope I didn't do too much damage in my two plus years of about 12 drinks a day.  I've got some issue with my throat the past couple months and I'm hoping it goes away soon...if its not I guess I have to go start the process of figuring out what it is.  I really don't want alcohol to be the cause of a medical issue down the road.

I looked back through facebook messages a couple days ago.  People who I have known, worked with in the past, etc.  The remnants of alcohol and emotion filled conversations.  Embarrasing things.  Wondering how and when to address the reality or if I do to them.  I'll figure it out sometime.  

I think the reality is, alcohol was traumatic...how it made me feel, what it made me do.  I don't want that at all anymore.  I'm 39 and feel like I've been given a second half of life to work on now.  I can put the past behind me and live.",1

They have seen my struggle for the past 3 years and are proud of where I am today, as this is my longest stretch of sobriety besides my pregnancy. However, we are all still in our early 20’s and there are times where they want to go to a bar (when we’re not in quarantine), or have cocktail nights. 

During this isolation time, it has been my husband usually mixing himself a drink every night. He tries not to make it obvious (I think to make sure I don’t feel tempted) but last night I was SO CLOSE to snapping at him-and the crazy thing is, I don’t know WHY. I was annoyed at him for hiding the bottle of vodka in the first place. I knew he bought it, but I never saw it out in the open. Why did he feel the need to hide it from me? On top of that, why was he trying to make it obvious that he wasn’t indulging in that vodka soda? Did he think I couldn’t handle it? But I was also angry on the opposite spectrum-why is he so comfortable drinking in front of me when he knows I have a problem? I don’t need to drink-why does he feel the need to? 

I feel like I need help walking through this stage of my acceptance of my alcoholism, as my journey in this began with a lot of humility, sadness, regret, but overall acceptance of my decision to cut alcohol out. Then there was a honeymoon period-I couldn’t believe how happy I was without it-I wasn’t a slave anymore. I felt better, looked better, etc. but now I feel like I’ve hit a wall. Where is this anger from? Does anyone else have experience with this irrational projection onto other people? When I think about it logically, I can’t just sit there and expect people to stop their normal habits of drinking when they are around me, and honestly I don’t REALLY want it-I don’t want people walking on eggshells around me or feeling unsure or awkward when it comes to drinking around me. How do you not judge them for their choices? How do you be a fun loving, SOBER friend, instead of the jealous alcohol police?

Sorry for the lengthy post, just wondering if anyone else hit this stage during their sobriety journey. Thank you for any and all advice!! Over the 50 day mark-I CAN and WILL keep going. IWNDWYT.",4

I've justified my actions in various ways; my boyfriend broke up with me a month ago (you can bet your @rse that this was alcohol related), we're in lockdown so I'm anxious (the book debunks that but alcohol is an insidious b@stard), just one bottle of wine won't hurt (yes. Yes it will).

A bit about my situation

I've been off work since mid March and have been blackout drunk at least 5 times in the last 30 days. 

I live with two dudes who have known me since I was fifteen and have seen me in many fucked up states (mixing alcohol with medication, excessive weed use, mood swings, self harm) These men love and care about me (I am dating one of them) and I love them and do not want to further endanger our  relationships by the strain of being around my during my blackouts. I am constantly consumed with worry about my standings with everyone I know, from family members, friends, co-workers, and especially my neighbors who must hear so much yelling and thumping without any context. 

My housemates drink socially, and I want to encourage them to do so but being around beers cracking all day is triggering for me. I don't yet identify as an alcoholic, and definitely acknowledge that I have strong habits in abusing alcohol; drinking to the point of memory loss and falling down, living my days with frequent hangovers or retreating to my bed  all day and cancelling plans with friends or missing opportunities to help out a co-worker and pick up shifts (I work in the serving industry)

I've tried practicing moderation this week, one to two drinks a day and (beer, wine) and I have been successful all but today- decided to have a third glass of wine, then later poured a fourth drink, diluted moonshine essentially and coke zero, sipped it, hated it, poured it out. Even just breathing the stuff in was foul. I feel very good about my ability to show self respect for my body by abstaining instead of downing the vile cocktail as quickly as I could. I hope I can practice responsible drinking in the future, but I think a full break is necessary at this moment!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's to the point I hallucinate and hear voices and in the brief hours my reddened and dry eyes close i have grotesque nightmares. More grotesque than anything I have ever seen in any horror movie, not like my life is falling apart nightmares but hellraiser type stuff. Loved ones split down the middle, dogs tearing each other apart, the only woman that loves me being raped and beaten to death. And tonight I was researching insomnia and the I don't think the alcohol is helping this but inducing it. So I poured the entire handle out. No amount of drunken giggling is worth this. I have experienced what I believe to be on par with hell, not watched but experienced it, and while I know the subject matter of these dreams from which I can no longer awaken in most cases, is due to a plethora of issues, I pray to make it through withdrawals and just fucking sleep.

Kids are driving me nuts at times, worry about the health of my parents, worry about work, etc. For years I'd come home and have a couple of drinks ""just to take the edge off"", but lately it's spiralling out of control. 

I'm a socially anxious person, and now with this COVID-19 thing it's also physically impossible to meet in a live setting. But I know myself, and I know that meeting in a live setting would be hard anyway. And maybe even counterproductive. What I need, because it has worked before, is a ""virtual"" setting where I can chat it out with someone. Is such a thing in existence? It seems like nowadays it would be.

Over text the other day I promised a buddy of mine I wouldn't have a drink, and surprised myself when that helped. Even after we come out of isolation something like that would be more my style anyway, so I think now would be a great time for me to explore it. I'm not into a lot of fanfare, and a 12-step program isn't seemingly necessary for me. Just making a simple promise or chatting it seems to be what works. But making a promise each day in a Reddit group might be excessive to everyone reading. But is there a forum available online for such a thing?

I don't know if I will stop drinking altogether. When things return to normal, my drinking might normalize too. But right now I don't want to think about forever, just tomorrow. I just want to stop drinking for a day. One day at a time. I just want a support system for the moment, if that makes sense.

The first one was genuinely not terrible. It was still during work hours, only a small group of coworkers, and my work is very aware that I don’t drink. I started there almost 7 months, and in that time I’ve had one drink with a coworker the night before a big meeting, so it wasn’t too bad. The last work trip I went on for part of with my boss; he made a joke about not drinking too much at the rest of the conference, and I laughed it off and told him I don’t drink anyway, so it was very low pressure. I sort of lied my ass off in the beginning of this job about not drinking at all anymore, so there weren’t any expectations. I don’t like forced socializing outside of work, but since it was at least during work hours it wasn’t too bad.

Had another Zoom call with friends tonight and that was a different story. From the beginning it was pretty clear that everyone’s goal was to get drunk; everyone dressed up and started with shots from the beginning. I didn’t really feel like explaining myself over Zoom from the beginning, so I asked my husband not to give me shit for being better at some of the silly games they had planned because I was the only one sober. He pretty much told me straight out that if I hadn’t told him that, he probably would have without thinking about it.

The first hour or so was fine, everyone was drinking but we went around and talked about things we were grateful for, or things that we only have because we’re all quarantined. It was really sweet to hear how people are spinning job losses or time at home into creative projects, so I’m glad I joined, but it pretty quickly went downhill after that.

Everyone in this group talks over each other, which is fine for a lot of them but I’m introverted to begin with so I already feel like I can’t get a word in normally, let alone when you have 14 people trying to talk all at once on a call. Then throw in that about half the group got belligerent (husband included) and started yelling or generally being prickish, so it just stopped being fun all around.

Normally if we were at a party with the same group, I’d hang for the fun parts then politely excuse myself to leave when things start to turn. I’m tired or I have an early morning were easy excuses but now, everyone’s home, everyone knows you have no plans tomorrow, and even if I just walked away and my husband hung out I could still hear everybody screaming in our little apartment from the next room.

On top of that, everyone was going around commenting on what and how much everyone was drinking. When it got around to us I got up to use the bathroom. I’m not really out about my sobriety with anyone in that group, mostly because the few people I’ve tried to talk to about it don’t take it seriously enough for me to feel like going any further in the conversation than surface level. I know I told coworkers I don’t drink mostly out of a desire to craft a professional appearance, but say what you will about the fact that I felt more comfortable telling them than the people I consider close friends. I was working on building new, healthier relationships through church and yoga, but I feel like a door’s been shut on that with COVID. They’re all good people and mean well, but everything feels shallow and not at all the type of deep relationship I’m needing right now.

I ended up just quietly exiting while a drinking card game was going on and my husband let them know we were both going about 15 minutes after I left. I just didn’t want to hear it anymore and basically Irish Goodbyed on everyone but I just couldn’t anymore and didn’t feel like I had a “proper” excuse to leave. 

Husband passed out pretty much immediately after he left the call (after stumbling his way through the kitchen for water). I love him but I’m used to a lot more alone time (I work from home/travel for work, and now he’s home all day with me), and then stuff like this is just not attractive. He was yelling at the tv the whole time, arguing with people or just being rude (in a way I think he perceives as funny, but watching it sober isn’t so cute). He definitely has a drinking problem, albeit not as bad as mine at the height of it, but it leaves me feeling very isolated in sobriety right now. Normally I could just find some alone time in the next few days and I’d feel better, but I know that’s not going to happen right now or any time soon.

Thanks if you made it this far. I don’t know what I’m expecting out of this post, I just needed to anonymously vent my frustration because I don’t feel like I have another outlet right now. I can’t go to yoga, and I can’t get time to myself (I’m like, the one person complaining about not being isolated enough, but it’s a real problem for us introverted only children types). I really enjoyed parts of seeing and interacting with people and I do need that connection still, but I’m really thinking I might need to sit the next one out.",39

A partial hospitalization program and now a remote outpatient group therapy program have been keeping me accountable. Now that I’m sober, my depression and ideation of self harm (I have signed a safety plan not to do it, but think about it constantly) have been worse than ever. Every day I have at least 2 drops into horrible depression, even with the coping skills I have been trying to learn.

I was on Lexapro, but it made me severely suicidal, so now I’m afraid to take any anti-depressant. Is this a part of my brain mending itself after 5 years of nonstop drinking, or is this just the me I was trying to drown with booze? I am unable to do anything I enjoy or even give my supportive partner the positive attention he deserves because I’m so sad. 

Worse is that since my infancy and throughout my life, there has been just one trauma after another, even to the point my therapist thinks it’s remarkable that I’m still alive. I’m ready to move forward, but these episodes of sadness are so intense and debilitating. I truly don’t know if it’s my brain adjusting to not having the crutch of alcohol or just me at my core. Maybe both.

I guess I just want to know if it will ever get easier with time, now that I’ve put the bottle down.

Like a lot of people at the moment, I’m struggling a bit. I’m not struggling with staying sober, but the isolation is getting to me. I am now out of a job, and I’m a little concerned about how I’m going to get another one once this is over, since a lot of people are out of work right now. I’ve had a couple of other hiccups in the road lately which have knocked me off my stride a bit. Just life stuff, and I’ve still got plenty in my life to be grateful for, but I haven’t been feeling as great about myself and where my life is at. My self-critical voice has been kicking in big style.

But I had two experiences today which made me realize how proud I am of being a recovering alcoholic. No matter what else I have going on in my life, I have that to be proud of. It’s genuinely my greatest accomplishment.

One of the experiences was chatting with someone here on SD about their own recovery, and seeing them make a series of excellent choices to support getting sober again. The other experience was logging onto an online Zoom AA meeting, and there was a woman in the meeting who just celebrated six months of sobriety. She mentioned in her comment that she had met me at one of her first AA meetings, and I had given her the information about this meeting and recommended it to her, and she said it was her favorite meeting.

I’m really proud of who I am in my recovery communities. I’m really proud that I’m sober now, and that I’m able to tell other people what I did to get here, and what my experiences have been like. I am not a quick learner. I’ve been at this sobriety thing for a lot longer than my badge suggests. It took me a dozen years to get eighteen months of continuous sobriety. It was difficult for me to get sober, partly because most of the time when I was drinking, I didn’t *want* to get sober. My drinking problem was bad when I started this journey, and it only got worse over time. Sobriety isn’t a lifestyle choice for me, this is the only way that I get to have a life.

So I’m proud that I’m sober today. But even more than that, I’m proud that I make it a part of my life to be supportive of other people who are also getting sober. It is the number one thing in my life that I’m proud of, it’s one of the major things that makes me feel good about myself. I got sober because other people met me where I was when I reached out, and I am now doing the same for other people. I only do it in small ways, it’s not a big chunk of my day. But it means a lot to me, because I know how much it mattered to me when people were friendly and kind with me, and shared their own experiences with what their drinking was like, and how they got sober. 

I still benefit a *ton* from other people in recovery. If I stop connecting with other recovering alcoholics I will eventually relapse. I have already tested that out, and I have evidence that I can’t get *or stay* sober on my own. I’m still learning about my alcoholism and how to actually live a life in sobriety, and I learn that from other people in recovery. They are people who I turn to for support about many things, not just when I’m having an issue related to alcohol. I got sober and I realized that I don’t really have much of a clue about how to be an adult, and an increasingly large chunk of what I know about how to live life comes from other people in recovery.

Nobody else got me sober, and I don’t get anyone else sober. I don’t take credit for anyone else’s recovery, my part is only ever a small one. But I know that it took a lot of people playing small parts in my recovery in order for me to get and stay sober, and I’m really proud of any opportunity I take to play a tiny role in someone else’s recovery.

I couldn’t get sober on my own. Believe me, I tried. If I could’ve done this without you, I would’ve. But I’m glad that I couldn’t. I’m so incredibly proud to be a part of this. Being an alcoholic in recovery enables me to have so many meaningful and powerful connections with other people. It’s part of how I know that I have a life that matters. I’m part of something that’s bigger than myself now. That means a lot to me. And I’m really proud of it.

Anyway, I just wanted to say that I’m grateful to be here, and I’m proud that I'm a part of this. IWNDWYT

I was actually sheltering even before that because the university I teach at sent everyone home.  As an introvert, it's been easier for me than a lot of other people, but even so, I've learned a lot over the past month. I've started thinking about this time as having been in a cocoon, rather than a quarantine. 

I've slowed down immensely. I've done a lot of self-care. I've spent a lot of time outdoors. I've been unproductive without shaming myself. I have found ways to stay connected with people I love. I've deepened my relationship with my SO. I've dropped my self-consciousness and howled with my neighbors. I have not drank. I've colored pictures. I have read books and sang songs and written (bad) poetry (ok, so I do those things anyway, but even so).

There have been many benefits to this cocoon, but even I am ready to come out of it and be a [butterfly](https://imgur.com/roC2QxK). I think, in fact, that I already turned into the butterfly, I just haven't been able to fly out into the world.  With our shelter-in-place order supposedly ending a week from today, maybe I'll do it then.

Although, I cannot go back and reopen certain doors that have closed in my life, I can work towards engaging positively with those open now, or may open going forward. Or I can keep ruining myself and kicking the can down the road. I'm getting too old for this, and I need to make a choice. So I am going to give sober a chance.

For this reason, I asked the first girl that I met to be my sponsor. I had no idea what that meant but I figured she would show me the way.

But as is the case with us alcoholics, I had gotten comfortable. I wasn't being pushed so I could cozy up in my comfort zone...... And make very little progress.  On top of that I was too nervous to say something and risk hurting her feelings.

When the pandemic hit here, I fully retreated into my shell. Luckily, the only other AA contact I have (outside of my home group meetings which are currently suspended) reached out and helped me see that I had to put my sobriety first and get a sponsor who would properly take me through the big book and the steps.

I made the difficult call to my sponsor to let her know how much I appreciated her but that I needed to explore different experiences in the AA fellowship.

I've had issues with alcohol since I've started drinking. It started off with fun kickbacks and then it quickly descended into me drinking on Thursdays, Tuesdays, then Monday mornings before class/work and so forth.

I've quit/lost two internships bc I was too out of my mind to show up on time and eventually gave up on the opportunity entirely.

I lost a good paying job last year bc I was too drunk/depressed to show up to work.

I've gone through periods of extreme drinking and sobriety. Over the last three years the longest I'd manage to stay sober was 3 months. Most of my drinking nowadays has been alone in my room.

Through this lockdown (about a month now), I've had an 18 pack of Lone Star, two 1.5 litres of vodka, a bottle of shitty honey whiskey, a 750 ml bottle of wine, and I bought a 1.5 litre of wine today just on a fucking whim. It's like I was on autopilot when I went into the store, I couldn't help it.

Most of the alcohol I've bought over the lockdown has been consumed in 1-2 days, and I realize that's sad.

I've started exercising again and it feels amazing, but I can't seem to escape the feeling drink gives me.

Am I an alcoholic? And what, if any, advice can you give me to prevent this from becoming even worse? I feel like I know the answer but I'm new to reddit so I'm sorry lol

Since I stopped drinking, I have exercised every day (HIIT workouts, Zumba, running), drank the amount amount of water needed for my body weight, and ate about the same as before I stopped drinking (not overly healthy, but not excessive either). I got on the scale and it turns out that I have GAINED FOUR POUNDS during these two weeks. Anyways, it was very discouraging, but I wanted to see if any of you had a similar experience. 

Thanks!",8

Lots of people report eating more, especially sugar, when they first quit. This is totally fine and natural. But what really gives me an extra boost is having a specific product or activity that can kindof replace the ritual/reward aspect of alcohol. Many of us are used to the daily ritual of coming home, opening our fridge/cabinet and opening/pouring our favorite booze. This is incredibly comforting but as we've realized this is harmful. I've found a lot of success in replacing the case of beer in my fridge with a case of grape soda I like. Hope everyone is doing well. IWNDWYT",12

Goodness gracious my house is a mess, the fridge stinks, and I need to do laundry. Stresses me out but with the lack of sleep, I took it easy today. I just took at shower and took my medications and I hope I can sleep really long and really deep tonight.

I convinced myself it's ok, you've been so good. Maybe you don't have a problem after all?

Well I bought a six pack of my favorite IPA with the intention of splitting it 3-3 with my father. I guzzled one down as soon as I got home, ate dinner while I had the other. Funny, I thought my tolerance would be low after almost two months of not drinking. I was honestly hoping to feel buzzed. But I didn't. All I felt was bloated and full, and thankfully I didn't want to go for a third and make myself feel like crap even more.

Taking it as a valuable lesson. I would have much rather splurged on a regular coke or sweet tea.
Not going to beat myself up as I controlled myself and came out without any serious repercussions. Gonna look at it as a blip in the sober radar and keep on with my life as it has been - alcohol free and healthy.

I’m new to this sub and embarrassed and upset with myself but here goes. Since the quarantine started I have been on a bender like nothing I’ve ever experienced in my life. There have been times I have drank a lot but nothing like this. I’ve been an alcoholic for 10 years and drink almost every day. I have tons of health issues from drinking but I have never cared. For 5 weeks I have been in self isolation and drinking almost non stop. Monday I woke up, with the worst hangover I have ever had. 

I knew I needed to take a little break. The inside of my body hurt, my organs, my brain. Normally after a day of not drinking I feel better- this was not like that. I went full into withdrawal and for real thought I was dying for the next 4 days. Today- on day 5 I finally am feeling better. I’m not sweating, my muscles and insides don’t hurt anymore and my anxiety and panic attacks have subsided as well as finally being able to get some actual sleep last night. 

This was a huge wake up call for me. I didn’t know I ever drank enough to warrant withdrawals. I normally do not drink to get drunk I just have a few drinks to “relax” after work. Like I said tho I have drank non stop for 5 weeks and vodka is my drink of choice. Going thru up to two handles in a week. I’m mad at myself, disappointed in myself for getting this bad and scared that I have done damage I can never undo to my health. 

I will not drink today. And I hope I don’t drink again maybe ever again. While I feel much better after 5 days sober I still don’t feel 100 percent. I haven’t gone 5 days without drinking in a very long time and normally I am itching for a drink by then but this time I do not even want a drink at all. I can’t even imagine taking a sip. I’m sure that will wane soon but I hope I never forget what I just went through and I know one thing- I never ever want to go through it again.",80

Being stuck in quarantine with my husband for 4 weeks now is nice but a week into not drinking and I’m finding myself snappy, irritable, and easily annoyed. With drinking I mellow out. It also sucks because my mental health is going down due to being stuck at home. I feel sluggish, down, and generally feel myself getting weaker. I’ve done jumping jacks here and there but they haven’t really helped. I also stopped drinking to have more energy but I currently feel like it’s honestly been the same likely to being stuck at home. 

I don’t know what to generally do, particularly about my mental health / behavior. I guess I can go to a counselor but it’s such a weird.. like, what would I say? I stopped drinking and want to not be so irritable all the time, what do I do?

When my alcoholism was at its worst, I would wake up having blacked out. I'd have no memory of how I got back. I'd be fully clothed, but noticed that my clothes were drenched. It was like I'd fallen into a river or something. And this kept happening. I was later informed that this was actually alcohol withdrawal that had happened after I passed out. 

It was a really bad time. And I hit rock bottom once I got back home from uni. Panic attacks, strange existential thoughts, despair, etc. It was a full blown existential crisis. I remember the final time I drank... now this might sound like its from a movie, but its 100% real. I went on a night out like it was any other time, trying to drink away the anxiety. And that night I had a very very vivid nightmare. 

I was looking at a gravestone, and it said my name, born June 3rd 1997 and died September 24th 2018. I woke up instantly, trembling with fear. Since that day, I haven't touched a sip of alcohol. It wasn't easy, it was difficult.... many factors come into why I didn't relapse. Therapy and exercise to name two.

But what I believe helped me was gratitude. See, as I got several months into my sobriety, I'd have flashbacks of times when I was drunk. And I didn't like it one bit. These flashbacks caused me great anxiety. 

Until one day, I had a change of perspective.

I'd always heard of gratitude, but what did gratitude *really* mean? I thought it was just that corny new age stuff people write in journals, but it wasn't. I decided to *feel* gratitude.... 

So when those flashbacks came up, I **allowed** my mind to go there, and I said to myself ''I'm grateful and blessed that I am sober, that my life is no longer the hell it was back then...''. And suddenly, I'd actually *feel* this tingly sensation across my body. It was myself internalising the gratitude of how far I'd come. 

And I kept doing that until the flashbacks went away. Even after they went away, I'd *consciously* bring up my worst experiences in a meditation, but after calling them to mind, I'd say ''I'm grateful that I had the **strength** to get through that''. 

Not only did I internalise gratitude for how much things had changed, but I internalised gratitude for the strength I had to get through those times. 

Now, I wouldn't recommend this method to everyone. I would STRONGLY recommend working through your emotions with a therapist, but once you've done that, you can try this method. I really do feel it helped me stay sober.",19

I know this is really long, it's a post more for me or anyone interested.","I wanna post this to feel like I started a journey. I don't post on Reddit. I'm gonna be checking this post as a reminder. See I'm only 21 years old, and I'm headed for a dark path. Sure most kids my age drink a lot too. But do they start at 10 in the morning? Do they have trouble resisting the internal war of whether they should drink or not when there are drinks in their fridge? Do they have anything to apologize for when they wake up in the morning for the only 30 minutes of the day that they're sober? I wouldn't place my chips on it. I think I have a problem.
There were red flags too, when I first started experimenting with alcohol like a normal teenager does. My girlfriend and I at the time would drink together and I would get obscene. Then she'd decide I've had enough and hide the bottle and that would start a big fight. I drank every weekend with my friends in highschool. When I graduated, I moved out to Ontario to be with my parents again. I was only 18. I didn't have any friends, so no reason to drink. It wasn't a problem back then, for me it was social. Then I turned 19 and went to the liquor store just to be able to buy some booze myself legally. And it was fun. I drank that night. Then I didn't the next day. 
Then I started roofing. In July. It gets hot. One day I come home and my uncle passes me a beer, which I f*king hated before but I was so thirsty I chugged it down without taking my lips off it. Then I realized why people love beer. So every day after work I would come home and have 2 or 3 beers a night. Then I went to a different roofing company, and they liked me a lot. So they did stuff in front of me. On both breaks we would go to the liquor store and get beers. At first I thought it was crazy. But it was fun roofing all drunk with my new friends. Then once this was normal to me, on the weekends i heard myself justifying, ""you do it at work what's the difference "". It's been about a year of me spiraling and fast forward to now, I'm on E.I drinking all day every day at home. I kill anywheres from 9-15 pints of beer a day from when I wake up until I inevitably pass out. 
I should have seen this coming. Alcoholism runs in my family. I should have realized I have an addictive personality when I started smoking a pack a day uncontrollably. But this is it for me. I've been sober probably less than 14 days out of the last 365. I can't stop when I start. I literally can not say no to myself. I don't feel normal when I don't have at least 2 beers in me. It doesn't matter how many times I wake up hating myself in the morning, I always attempt to just take it slower the next day, and always fail. 
So this is it. Today is my last binge drinking day. I'm not going to the liquor store tomorrow. Today, im going extra-hard and tomorrow, im quitting cold turkey. I'm done feeling sorry for myself. Thank you for reading. 

TLDR: I guess I have an addictive personality and I'm gonna quit drinking now.",2

Corona is partly the reason because my kids are no longer in school so I don't have the opportunity to pick up new bottles after dropping them off at school - and because we're not really going grocery shopping right now and are depending on the stuff we had saved up in our basement and freezer at the moment.

I was disgusted with myself that I had put her safety at risk.  If her fever had risen, or she had had additional complications, I would have been worthless to take her to the ER (or even notice).

I've learned a lot from the wise folks here at /r/stopdrinking.  I've learned that being sober takes work.  Work *today*.  I had always wanted to be in that state where I had been sober for a long time.  But I could stop drinking tomorrow.  You fine folks have taught me that the only day of sobriety that counts is today.  If we take care of today, everything else takes care of itself.

2020-04-17 07:43:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g30es3/letting_go/,Letting go,"Hi folks,

This is long and meandering and self-indulgent, so be warned.

I once shared what follows with a close friend I knew would understand, but I think the solitude of living alone during this time has made my brain dwell on this particular circumstance now and then.  With alcohol use disorder comes shame, and guilt but when we make progress, pride and hope.  Or at least, that's been my experience.  

I was a heavier drinker (3 drinks / night maybe 4-5x per week) for a while (7 years?) and back in 2016-2017 decided I needed change.  I was then with the person I thought I'd marry.  We were best friends, had been together 8 years. I started working on removing alcohol from my life.  Worked through the emotional dependence, since I was never physically dependent (for which I am truly grateful.) When I started the journey, I discussed with my then-partner. It was incredibly vulnerable for me to say: ""I don't like my habits, I want to change for me and both of us. I am going to work on this and would like your support.""

And this first time we had this conversation he sort of said: ""I don't think you have a problem; we both sometimes drink too much, but okay sure.""  What I needed was validation, not someone telling me I was wrong about my behavior.  I explained multiple times over that last year that it wasn't about what other people thought about my drinking, it was about how *I* felt about my relationship to alcohol. He didn't get in my way but didn't really *support* me. (I see in retrospect he didn't have the tools to do so, but also didn't have the desire. He hated conflict and big emotions. Long story short: I did 90% of the emotional lifting and support in this relationship which was very imbalanced for years. We got engaged, bought a house, things were moving along. He loved me but also, not really. He was more afraid of being alone. I digress.) Anyway, I start really making progress. A few months alcohol-free here and there. Not perfect but doing 1000x better. It showed-- I was happier, healthier, more myself. I engaged with him about how I was doing and got little in return. Maybe he was afraid, maybe just lost, maybe didn't care. I can't say.

We hit a crisis point in our relationship late in 2017 (I'm sober at that time) that has nothing to do with booze-- and we decide to split. It was ultimately me pulling the trigger because of his inertia, even though we both knew it was over and shouldn't get married since he admitted he wasn't sure about getting married and blah, blah. It's gut wrenching. He apologizes for being emotionally absent. I apologize for numbing out too much.  Specifically for misusing alcohol during the hard times in the past, and for not always being the best partner I could have been.  Even at our most raw and devastated, he discredits I had a problem, thereby discrediting my progress.

I am so much better off without this person in my life, so much mentally healthier, as hard as things were to leave behind. 

Here's the crux: As I keep working through some of my shame issues-- which is to say, leaving the shame behind-- I can't help but wish he'd recognized what I'd clearly been saying. Accepted my apology. He didn't feel hurt by my behaviors but deep down I know I wasn't my best. Since we split I have only had a few slips in over 2 years (clearly one very recently).  Amazing how even through the sadness I had no desire to numb out. How sobriety really took hold pretty much the moment we split. Not a coincidence that someone no longer causing me such pain meant I didn't want to use anymore. Anyway, we aren't in any kind of contact anymore. I don't want to be in touch. Turned out he was involved with a much younger coworker (emotionally, if not physically and we all know the former is more devastating than the latter) while we were engaged. 

Why am I dwelling on his lack of acknowledgment of my problems and the work I was doing?  My therapist advised me to let go of this a long time ago-- said I did good by saying my truth and apologizing.  And she's right. I don't know what my hang up is.  I think as I am dealing with some mild depression right now (lost a job I loved due to the virus, some sad family stuff...) my brain is in a weird cycle. 

I don't know that I'm asking for advice. I just wish I could let go of the people and thoughts that do not serve me.  I love being sober.  It's freeing, if hard sometimes. But I have released booze from my life.  Just not the shame I felt with him. This isn't someone I have ever felt I wanted back. I was so sad when we split but the relief that comes with ending a toxic situation negated that sadness in the end.  Maybe I'm stuck here because he's the person who, for nearly 10 years, knew me better than anyone. Saw the best and worst. I've talked about my desire to stay away from alcohol because of misuse with other people close to me and they get it and support-- and I'm so grateful for where I am now. With people who love me for all my flaws. I just don't know why my mind is being screwy. Fixated. 

Thanks so much for listening.  I really appreciate this forum.

ETA: I'd totally be discussing with my therapist but due to underemployment and being underinsured, it's not a financial option.  So again, thanks for listening.",4

I have never posted before but need to get this off my chest. Last year I did 6 months sober, felt great, lost weight and fell in love... while sober (whole new dating experience). Cut to the summer, I start drinking socially and now I’ve been in quarantine and drank every day all the weight I’ve lost is back. I need to quit. I hate to admit it and don’t know how to tell my boyfriend, or anyone for that matter, but it needs to be out of my life.

Check-in","*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Being that the world is down pretty bad there isn’t much to really do but get fucked up. 

However, being hungover all the time is definitely a feeling I don’t miss. I don’t miss the body aches, the bubble guts, headaches, etc. 

I do want to say I am very proud of myself for gaining a lot more self control when it comes to drinking. I do not over exert myself or try to keep up with anyone else. I know my limit, understand my limit and have been standing by my limit.

I have a feeling that I acted like an asshole when I went over to his house for my birthday. I was basically in a blackout ( not an excuse I know) and the next day he messaged to say he was worried about my mental health. 

Anyway, he’s coming over now to discuss “our friendship “. I know it’s going to be horribly shame inducing and I feel so, so bad about it. I owe him so much. He has gone above and beyond what is expected from a friend and never given up on me.

It’s just another person on the long list of good people that I have hurt when I’m drunk. I turn into such a monster sometimes and have done so many things that I am ashamed of. It’s just not who I want to be.

At least I will get a chance to apologise to him face to face. Other people I have lost have just cut my out of their lives and it sucks so badly. 

Anyway, I hope he gives me another chance. I am so lonely at the moment and it’s awful to think I might have hurt one of the last people around me.

Dysthymia is something I've been battling since I was a teenager, and the current sitch is *not* making it easy for me to stay optimistic.

I have finally gotten to the point where I can mentally admit my addiction to myself. For the longest time, I was convinced my ‘lifestyle’ was normal and that alcohol didn’t consume me. But I’ve reached a point where I can finally see it for what it is, alcoholism. There is no ‘one drink’ mode in my mind. It’s all or nothing. I drink until I black out and then play catch up the next morning trying to make sure I didn’t do anything fucking stupid. I got shit faced last night, pissed the bed, binge ate a huge bag of chips, and god knows what else. I’m so tired of it. I’m tired of the fixation once I have a drink. I’m tired of the hang overs and the unclear mind that follows after a binger. I’m just tired of being this way. 

Don’t get me wrong. I’m functional. I have a very demanding and important job. I own a home. I’m working on my masters degree. I don’t drink every day. I went an entire month without drinking. But the second alcohol touches my lips, there is no moderation or control. I drink until I black out. How does one even begin on the road to sobriety? 

I’m not sure why I am even opening up about this in this setting. I haven’t told any one yet so I figured this would be the best place to be real with myself and with a community that understands the unique challenges of this addiction.",17

This kids parents put him outside as punishment because they found his secret phone. They have him isolated and keep all his money from his job. 

I was able to help him because I was sober. Got him warm and safe. The authorities were called. He is safe tonight. Not even sure if they know he left after they kicked him out of the house.

I knew I had a problem when I started going to work drunk. I always woke up buzzed, but I finally started going drunk. I was a fifth of vodka a day kind of person, and in the past year it became more than that. 
      
I eventually started to get withdrawal symptoms when I didn’t go to work drunk, and started to worry people would notice I couldn’t drink out of cups without spilling everywhere due to the shaking.
      
I tried tapering to quit, trying to put myself on a schedule and recording when I actually took the drinks. I actually started calling them “dosages” because they were my medicine that allowed me to act normal. I *had* to have my dosages throughout the day or my heart rate would be 160+, I’d be trembling violently, sweating like I ran a 12k, and feeling a sense of impending doom. But tapering didn’t work. At the end of every day I’d look at my dosage list and go “fuck it”, and drank even more. 
      
Somehow I’ve never had a DUI, never gotten in trouble for being drunk at work, and never been asked by anyone to stop (I was extremely “functional” and no one would have suspected). But I did hit my personal rock bottom. 
      
My rock bottom was when I was at the point that if I did not have multiple shots every hour I would start withdrawing. During this time, I was in a situation where I was about to be required to take an international flight of about 16 hours, on a plane where alcohol would not be served. I realized I could actually die from withdrawals on this flight. 
      
In the past few years I started to assume my health was fucked past the point of no return and I would die of cirrhosis or another alcohol-related condition, but I was not ready to die on a flight. 
      
I reached out and finally went to a hospital and admitted how much I was drinking and how hard withdrawals were hitting me. I spent a full week in a hospital bed during my detox. I was on Ativan and banana bags. Gabapentin when the Ativan was weaned off. 
      
After this I was put into a month-long inpatient substance abuse program at a different hospital (my employer has the ability to do this against my will). I resisted at first, but I believe overall it helped.
      
At this point I am a month and a half sober. I am on some anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medications, but not taking in any other substances. I never thought this would be possible. I know it’s early, and cravings will come and go, but I am proudly and happily sober. This subreddit has helped push me in the right direction and I am thankful for everyone here, and I am excited about our journeys. 

Thanks for reading. 

Oh, and a bonus: my liver is okay. Elevated levels, but I will survive and it will heal as long as I stay sober. All is not lost.",16
2020-04-16 22:42:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g2tfru/im_not_an_alcoholic_yetbut_i_dont_want_to_be/,I’m not an alcoholic yet...but I don’t want to be.,"I know I’m not an alcoholic (yet). The reason I know is because I have lived amongst alcoholism my entire life. My dad was a terrible alcoholic until I was 14. He went into treatment and is now 35 years sober. My parents divorced when I was 19 and my mom started drinking “socially” with my stepdad. “Socially” ramped up as the years went on, and then my stepdad got sick. Fast forward through 7 years of doctors telling us my now alcoholic mother had only months to live, putting her through treatment multiple times, her living with us multiple times... and a terrible death with a lot of agony, anger, resentments and regrets. My youngest brother is also a terrible alcoholic, and we have been trying to help him for almost 5 years now. He had lived with all of us, stolen, lied... he’s a high-functioning alcoholic, however, and landed a good job that supports his habit financially. It’s still hard to watch.
I drank like a crazy woman in my 20’s. Partied for years but it didn’t ever really cause any life problems. I met my husband, got married and left that life behind.
For years I’ve only drank wine at night, and it’s waxed and waned as to how much wine at night, but it’s always been part of my daily routine. I don’t even like the feel of being buzzed anymore. I really enjoy the taste of wine or a good craft beer. I don’t even consider what I drink to “alter” my mood that much or even “relax” me. I don’t drink until I’m drunk, but again, there have been times when my tolerance is higher than others. 
I’ve thought “maybe I should quit” more than once, especially with the amount of alcoholism in my family history...as well as the fact that I am also bipolar. My bipolar is in the best place it’s ever been, and it’s been a lot of hard work to get there. 
So long story short, I know I’m not an alcoholic, so I feel silly blathering on when people are much further in their addiction path than I am. But that’s what I feel I’m on. A path. And I don’t want it to end up in full alcoholism like my parents, but I’m already 50 and it hasn’t.... but I’m thinking about it a lot, and kind of uncomfortable about how much I drink...so part of my brain is saying “stop now, while it’s easier to quit”...and the other part of my brain is telling me that I’m overreacting... I’ve never had any problems because of my drinking....",7

* I feel less anxious & cynical; my future path seems ""clearer"" and less convoluted,
* sleep-quality has improved 10x,
* more money in my bank-account,
* I finally had some success in quitting smoking (currently at 1M and 7d),
* longer focus, motivation to read and workout and FINALLY
* no regrets.

I don't even feel the need to drink at the moment. Abstinence seems less like a ""lack of something"", but more like being free of something. Quitting drinking has been the best decision of the last 2-3y (especially in these anxious times).

I am looking for an anonymous support group so I  am accountable to something. I am not a daily drinker. Because of my work schedule, I am off every other weekend and 3 days during the week every other week. These are the times when I drink. I do not drink on the day before work or on workdays. I have rules which tells me I am developing a problem bc I having to set myself boundaries. I normally drink 3-4 beers and a couple of shots of tequilla. Not enough to get drunk but enough to get a very good buzz. The thing is I do this alone a lot of the time, on my days off when I am home alone. I think some of it is boredom, a lot of times I think ""oh, working in the yard would be more fun if I had a buzz"" or something along those lines.  My husband can take or leave alcohol, he likes a shot of tequila in the evening and maybe a couple on the weekend. My problem is once I get started I don't want to stop. A couple of times here lately I have trouble remembering things I might of said or did the night before. And I think about drinking a lot. I drank yesterday during the day while I was outside during yardwork. Then I came in and fixed supper and did all my normal things, but I woke up with this guilty negative feeling and a slight hangover. anyways I just wanted to put my situation out there. I look forward to using this group as a place for accountability and support on those days when I am struggling",20

Does anyone have advice?","Today I drank. I didn't even want to, I don't know why I did. Drinking made me feel sick, but I kept going, and I got drunk. 

The longest I've managed to stay sober is a few days, and I know it's an embarrassingly short period of time, but even by day three, I felt healthier, and genuinely happy. I want to feel like that forever, but I always go back. 

I don't understand it, - even while I'm open the bottle, I don't want to drink. I know it will make me less happy, less productive, and tbh I don't even want to think about what it's doing to my health, but I do it anyway. I used to enjoy being drunk, but now it just makes me sad. 

I've done so many stupid things while drunk and I've damaged so many relationships. I wish I would go back and fix it, but it hasn't stopped me. Health scares haven't stopped me - I've done serious damage to my stomach lining and used to vomit blood regularly. It scared the hell out of me, but I still drank. 

It seems like it should be so easy - being sober makes me happy, but for some reason I just keep drinking. 

Please, if anyone has been here, I could really use your advice.",7

My roommates know this, and have been vocal in saying they'd be supportive if I ever tried to stop or even pause drinking. One of my roommates, though, has a habit of being ""supportive"" in regards to everything until the actual moment to be supportive comes. I didn't tell them when I began my withdrawal, and the first 24 hours were hellish for me. The next day (yesterday, day 2), he started giving me his usual i-totally-care-for-you-how-are-you-doing-this-to-yourself jabbing(it's become a daily thing, everything from complaining about my plants being in the living room to me using the kitchen counters), and I told him that as a matter of fact I was trying to be sober and his ""intervention"" or whatever he's been doing every other day was really not what I wanted or needed, especially then. He dropped it. He put on his ""I'm happy for you"" face. But of course there's more to it. 

For context, he rarely drinks. Like he'll have a seltzer maybe once a week, usually not even that often. So I was super fucking surprised when yesterday as we're all hanging out in the evening he plops down and cracks open a Bud Lite seltzer. It just felt like the biggest slap in the face. I left and spent the rest of the evening feeling miserable and alone in my room, and I'm still miserable today and I really want to make it to 72 hours because that's what I set out to do but HOLY SHIT it feels like I'm going to be miserable regardless of if I make it there so what's the point? And I know that's flawed thinking, and yes the misery will end at some point. But I guess I just need solidarity. 

I know I never asked for them to avoid alcohol, and I didn't ask for anything from them, but I feel like he purposely decided that was the night to drink. Again, he NEVER drinks on weeknights and rarely on weekends.

Woke up more terrified, anxious, depressed, and stressed than ever in my life.

It hit me again, full panic, shaking and terror. I just want to say fuck it. I didn’t even think about a drink and now want to hide away and numb it. My boss thought it was funny but I’ve lost the respect of everyone and will forever be known as the drunk guy - so why not drink?

This internal (what I call my “cognitive dissonance”) is a major trigger for me to drink. 

Let me explain as briefly as I can: on one side, I am getting better and better at being mindful - you know, being able to focus on the present moment and relax and simply BE content with the present moment, without any other requirements for enjoying the present moment as it is. I need to pat myself on the back - I’ve gotten pretty good at this in my recovery. 

That being said, there’s the other part of me. The “success” driven part of me. This is the part of me that helped me finish my undergrad degree and get good grades. It’s the part of me that makes me feel restless, like I’m wasting my free time if I’m not using it to do something impactful. For example, I’m sitting here with my wife watching Greys Anatomy, and I keep having this strong feeling that I need to apply and get accepted into grad school (even though I have no need to and there’s no direct reason to right now), or to do some other big life thing like being an entrepreneur. Like I need to do something big for me and my family’s future. I have always felt that the anxiety and stress are what fueled me to achieve what I have. 


This feeling is strong enough that I can let myself feel like I’m failing at life and wasting the current free time I have because I’m sitting around and relaxing in the current moment. 

I just wanted to get your thoughts ... anyone else  experience this internal struggle? I handle it pretty well nowadays for the most part, but sometimes I find myself in this conflicted headspace, which is of course a trigger for drinking!",2

I've been struggling with my drinking for the better half of a decade. It's been a lot of liquor from the moment I wake up until I pass out pretty much. I've also been laid off with all of the craziness going on but that has actually led me to a lot of (painful) detoxing and therapy. This has helped me finally make it to day 78 (my longest stretch since I don't even know when).

I'm proud of how far I've come but one thing I haven't been able to break is my addiction (if you can call it that) to sneaking around and breaking some of my (self-imposed) rules. In addition to being alcoholic, I'm also a long-time vegetarian (10+ years) and one of the things that I've found calms my cravings is to sneak some of those cheap little pepperettes at the corner store.  I get a rush of adrenaline from secretly cheating on my diet, which calms my cravings a lot, but I do feel quite guilty afterward and am left with a bit of an ethical dilemma. 

I have other calming exercises/ mindful breathing techniques that I've been using, but cheating on my vegetarianism is the quickest and most effective thing that I've found. I still tell people I'm fully vege, so this has been my new ""dark secret"" that I've been hiding.

I plan to taper today and tomorrow and be alcohol free on Saturday, at least for the remainder of the quarantine, maybe forever.  I’m not sure. 

Alcohol is the only thing I’ve ever found that’s been effective in helping me relax and feel comfortable. My mind is running constantly, and I get really tightly wound and need to just give my brain a break pretty frequently. Alcohol is really effective in doing that. There are other things that help some, namely anxiety meds and exercise, but man....alcohol just REALLY does the trick. I love it....which is the problem. 

I’m not sure exactly what I’m asking for here. I guess I feel like I need help making myself understand that this is the right decision. I can easily see myself going two or three days without drinking, and then thinking “ok I’m all good now, a glass of scotch won’t be a problem,” and then being right back where I am today in a couple of weeks.

This doesn't mean I'm going to casually drink, no, as that's a tunnel right to the rabbit hole. I'm just glad I have the mindset and more willpower now to say no with little difficulty at all, even after having a few. That is a huge step, and it boosted my morale a shit ton. Do I count this as a 'relapse'? I know technically it is, but in all reality, I didn't go back to my old habits of daily drinking, so no, in my view it wasn't a relapse at all.

I hope everybody is staying healthy and sober in these seemingly apocalyptic times.

I finally made an account just for this, so I can stop lurking and engage with this community that has been so helpful to me over the past 8 months :)

I’ve been on the stop drinking train since late last August. My boyfriend and I realized I had a problem and decided I would stop drinking for 2 months (til mid October), then try to drink less than before and see how it goes. As many in this sub will guess, moderation didn’t work too well and by the time the holidays came around I was back to my old ways of sneakily drinking on weeknights and drinking too much when we went out on weekends. So in mid January I re-committed to the no drinking entirely, which 99% of the time is a lot happier, easier, and less stressful than trying to moderate. I’ve had a couple slip ups since then, and my badge is set to the last one. 

Overall I’ve been surprised how easy it has been to just stop, certainty easier than trying to moderate and constantly worrying if I’m drinking an acceptable amount, reviewing the evening in my head before bed and when I wake up to make sure I remember everything, etc. 

I’ve been relatively lucky with the withdraws too. In August and again in January I had some shakiness and some insomnia/sweaty nights but nothing too bad. In my couple slip ups since January (3-5 drinks one night and right back to not drinking) I predictably have one sweaty night a couple days after. 

Anyhow reading all the posts in this community has been amazing for maintaining my resolve, and I’ve always been tempted to contribute but never gone through with it on my main account. No one in my real life even knows about that one, but 🤷🏼‍♀️ now I can contribute all I want worry free. 

I figured I’d do a quick background because I want to get it out of my head and on “paper”. 

I’m 24F. I started dabbling in drinking when I was 14. My parents were pretty European about it and would let me have a drink or two at holiday dinners and stuff like that. At one family friend’s wedding they let me get actually drunk. I got a mild hangover and they used that as teachable moment that hangovers indeed suck. 

Through the rest of high school, including some time living in Europe, I didn’t drink on weeknights and didn’t really drink “just because” even on weekends. But if there was a party or something I would drink a lot (especially relative to being a petite female) and always took pride in showing people how well I could “handle my liquor”. My parents are great parents, but I do think somewhere along the way especially my dad instilled in me that idea that drinking more than everyone else but still seeming smart/cool was a good thing and something I should try to achieve. I had nights from 16-18 years old that I definitely drank too much, but it was nothing I would consider far out of the ordinary even now.

In college my drinking actually slowed down a bit at first. In high school I had easy access to booze through my parents, being in Europe, and an older boyfriend. In college the first two weren’t a factor, and I had a different older boyfriend but it was a LDR so I only really got booze when I was visiting him. So freshman and sophomore year were good. 

I turned 21 the fall of my junior year and also started dating a new boy who had a pretty close relationship with alcohol himself. I was definitely drinking “too much” with him, but he was also so it never felt abnormal. He had the same sort of idea as my dad that being able to drink a lot and maintain some composure was a desirable thing. He also didn’t like me having opinions so much, so I found it made the relationship a lot smoother when I was tipsy/drunk and didn’t care as much about my opinions either. Or instead of bringing up a problem in the relationship, drink to forget about it. These habits were the beginning of the serious downhill. 

Senior year I was single again, and started off cutting back a little by at least not drinking on weekdays. But each weekend I would go through at least a box of wine (4 bottles) by myself. That pattern with some occasional binge nights lasted into starting a new job and finding a new (actually healthy) relationship. 

The healthy relationship helped a lot. I still drank more than him in general, and we would get drunk together on weekends, but it was always for happy/fun reasons, which I guess is better than the previous bad relationship reasons. There’s a handful of times I got too drunk and started crying or otherwise acted stupid that annoyed him a bit, and I’m thankful he put up with that. 

After about 9 months of dating (December 2018), we moved into my parents house for a few months to save up some money with plans to eventually get our own place. I started feeling very confined and not having my own space to get away to. This led to more drinking and sneaky drinking because that would at least temporarily make me care less about that issue. Of course this became a habit and even after we moved into our own place it continued. 

At this point it was less about needing “me” time (I could go to the gym for that) and more about having an excuse to drink. By summer 2019 I was probably having 4 glasses of wine on most school nights and more on most weekends. There were also a couple relationship issues (not hard to solve ones) that I tried to make myself not care about/not address by drinking. I had been trained to be scared to bring up issues in other relationships, but I can’t blame it on that and I objectively knew that wasn’t the case in this relationship. Also boredom played a factor since life was generally pretty chill and easy at this point.

Of course eventually he could actually tell I was drunk when he hadn’t seen me drinking and he found all the little one serving wine bottles in my closet that I hadn’t gotten around to throwing out yet. He was definitely pissed and his trust was cracked, but he also made it clear that he was worried about me and loved me and wanted to help me and “hated seeing my mind go to waste”. He’s great and I am so thankful I never successfully fucked it up with him. We are planning to move to a new city together in the fall and I’m so happy that I’ll be making that move as a much healthier person than I’ve been in a while. 

This was last August when the first 2 months of sobriety started so I guess we have completed the story. I think overall we can both see that mentally and physically I’m getting a lot more healthy, and our relationship which was good (to me relatively great) has gotten even better. 

I was going through old stuff on my phone last night and found screenshots of text conversations I had with my 2 exes, and was reminded just how dysfunctional all that was, partially because of them, partially because of alcohol, and probably partially because of me. But it made me realize how lucky I am that my biggest annoyance with my boyfriend is that I have to throw out all his empty sparkling water cans for him. He’s the only one that knows about the extent of all this. He sometimes will go on a no drinking kick with me, but sometimes will just drink his normal healthy amount (and somehow leave a glass half finished like a “normal” person haha). I’m also really glad he doesn’t seem to feel guilted into not drinking and enjoying himself around me. 

My parents have expressed worry a couple times when they noticed me drinking a lot of their booze or found out I left my phone at a bar. These conversations (with my dad) usually ended with him telling me some tricks he had learned over the years to teach himself to moderate, which is a bit telling. I’ve also noticed my mom’s brother will go through 2-4 bottles of wine or the equivalent in a single night when he visits for the holidays. My mom’s dad used to drive my grandma around on errands with a 6 pack in his car and drink in the parking lot while he waited to take her to the next store. So there’s some patterns, and suffice it to say I’m glad I nipped it in the butt now. I really began to notice how much my family in general drinks the more I hang out with my boyfriend’s family. A lot of them are “one drink a year on New Years” people, and even the ones who drink have 2-3 drinks maybe one or two days a month.

It’s also been nice to know that no amount of novelty popcorn I eat will compare to the calories I was getting from booze and hangover eating, and it won’t make me skip the gym the next day. I never really gained a ton of weight with my drinking (more losing muscle and gaining fat to the extent that my clothes were a bit tighter), which is lucky, but I definitely look better now and am confident in how I look. 

I have been toying with the idea of 99% quitting for good. There’s 2 situations currently where I’m not sure I could get the full experience being completely sober. (That being said I have been thoroughly enjoying going to bars and even strip clubs sober with almost no learning curve, so by time these situations come up I might not want to drink.) The first situation is going out specifically to dance (rather than stand around and talk). This is something I’m very sure I wouldn’t really enjoy sober, and only happens once every two years, if that. The other situation is a date rape roleplay thing that I won’t go too much into, but also would be a one-off thing. I haven’t decided either way, and there’s no need to at the moment. The only reason I’m considering it is the rarity of the events and the fact that it has never been that mentally challenging for me to just stop after a hiccup (it’s the continual moderation that is challenging). 

I know this got *super* long, but it’s everything that has been on my mind the last 8 months, so yeah. Mind has a lot of shelf space now :)",9

The BEST part of sobriety, in my opinion, is not being hungover EVER anymore.  Even though this pandemic has turned my world upside-down, (zero income, financially in trouble, live alone) I get to sit outside in the sun and truly enjoy its warmth and and cheerfulness.  

If you’ve been hungover for a while you may have forgotten that THE SUN FEELS AWESOME.

Compared to my alcoholic neighbor who hides in his dark cavelike apartment with the shades drawn constantly and is paranoid and depressed. Every time I walk past I say a quiet little gratitude because that used to be me.  Now my apartment is cheerful, clean and bright and a joy to be quarantined in.

Trust me, being sober through this is WAAAAY better than battling hangovers on top of everything.  

I struggled for 20 years to get sober. I feel your pain. And I just want to give you some hope that sobriety is WORTH IT.

I, apparently, can't handle this by myself.  So, I think I have to tell her.  I need to just look her in the eyes and say, ""I'm an alcoholic.""

But, holy cow I can eat three squares and still the scale goes down (not much but slightly) - it's just crazy how those calories come at such a cost to not only your weight but your overall well being.

I used to eat barely nothing all day to ""save"" up those precious calories for beer/wine/whatever and then at bedtime in a drunken state would cram crap down my throat on the way to pass out.  Rinse and repeat and here I am.  NO MORE.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to \[[r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent**.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in \[[r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at \[[r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I have a strong desire to quit smoking now. I’m a few days away from 90 days sober and I’ve been getting back into a regular running/workout routine and I feel the drain 10 years of cigarettes has had on me.

I’m curious what y’all think of this time frame. I don’t want to push myself too hard and this be a reason for full-on relapse but it’s just been nagging me. Has anyone had experience quitting smoking this early in sobriety?


The few times I’ve tried quitting cigs before I’ve had pretty strong “rage” symptoms and I can see this being problematic. My sobriety from alcohol is definitely more important to me. I don’t want this to screw it up. However, I can’t shake this extreme need to stop smoking too. I’m starting to think it’s the HP talking to me. Or maybe it’s my alcoholic “all or nothing” attitude about to destroy the little base of self-love I’ve been fighting so hard to build. 

Anyway, I’m just looking for your honest thoughts and experiences. This sub has got me through many a rough night, I appreciate you all!!!

This quarantine has seen me drunk every second of every day. Hiding bottles and boxes from my roommates and not even really caring about what I’m drinking. 

I have a question for all the drunks out there that never met rock bottom. How did you quit? Does something terrible have to happen to make me realize that I can’t keep doing this? Is that the only way quitting works? I’ll go for a few days and then be like it can’t hurt, let’s take some shots. Also, on an annoying personal level, do I need to quit my life’s work if I am sober? I’ve heard of somms who have become sober and I just don’t know if that’s even feasible for me.

Sorry if I'm bothering you asking for help, this might not seem as bad as other cases I've read here but I still don't really know who to talk to, and I figured why not? 
I am 22F, I started drinking at 14 but it became a problem when I was 18, that's when I started getting drunk when I didn't have to, and I started making a lot of bad decisions from then on, by the time I was 21 I was drinking everyday, that led me to use a lot of drugs and I had already dropped out of college :/ 


It's been 2-3 years since I dropped out and I know it's been a long time, but I have tried getting better as fast as I can, it's just that I guess it's a slow process for me


Last year a close person died and I decided to start living right, to stop self pitying and actually making a change

It had been going okay, I still drank occasionally but I didn't lose myself in alcohol every time I drank, I learnt to do it with moderation

The thing is, I haven't had alcohol since the quarantine started, but I've felt the urges plenty of times. 
Its already been a month and a half and I know it's not a lot but it made me realize I drank more often than I thought I did, because it's becoming really hard not to go to the store and buy me liquor, it's just two blocks away and it keeps becoming harder and harder everyday. The only thing keeping me from going is imagining that I get the virus from it (I know it isn't that likely if I take the right precautions but I'm crazy paranoid) and pass it onto my family. I know it hasn't been that long, and I'm sorry if this seems like a dumb problem. I just don't know how to keep myself from getting alcohol and binge drinking for days/weeks. I'm afraid if I give into my cravings I'll probably end up buying more and drinking more, again.

However I’ve been recently reading about how habits form and how the brain learns to automatically associate these cues with behaviours. 

I promised a few of you that I would come back to an earlier comment of mine and repeat over and over “this is a irrational thought, you are having this
thought because you have been conditioned to associate these cues with this thought. It is ok to have irrational thoughts. The likely hood of drinking today is non existent. The rational thought is that alcohol ruins my mental health, physical health, and relationships. Alcohol is something that should not be consumed”

WELL GUESS WHO IS GOING TO SLEEP SOBER!

I may have eaten a little more than I should have, and I might have even eaten a bit unhealthier to distract myself from the alcohol triggers, but I count it as a win!

My “mobile blackouts” are horrifying. I can’t even bear to type some of the things I have been told that I have said and done while under the influence of alcohol. Just passing out would have been better. To be told stories about yourself that you have not the slightest memory of is the most terrifying thing. Jekyll and Hyde.

I’ve been very fortunate that I did not lose my marriage, children, career, life, freedom. My last performance was reported to me by my youngest daughter a few days later. And just like that, it was over. I broke up with alcohol. We had our run. No, no ceremony or farewell drink, my dear. It’s done. 

I wish I knew how to drink responsibly but I am clear that I do not. It doesn’t matter what size the container. It was always a raise to the last drop. I’d sense and feel my sweet stopping spot and drink right past it into oblivion.

It feels good to not be in danger anymore. I was getting close to hell and getting comfortable with the process. I thought I could manage it and not lose it all.

I just turned 24  had a year sober and was prominent in NA up until October of last year. Then I thought I could smoke pot and it's downhill ever since. Back in January I started drinking again with my boyfriend who was also in recovery with me. After I wrecked my car due to a hit and run (it was a car and thankfully not a person. I still felt bad though) and I quit. Didnt drink for 2.5 months. Then my boyfriend of a year broke up with me about a week ago. I was soo upset and my instant reaction was to hit the liquor store. So I did. The next day I had the WORST hangover. I didnt drink a crazy amount either. Ever since I quit drinking heavily, a year and a half ago, my body goes into like the mild  withdrawals  symptoms after I drink..its weird.

You don’t have to read through below; I just needed to share instead of keeping these thoughts all in my head, hopefully with someone who might understand.

My routines have been falling apart this week. I’ve still been eating and drinking (water, some soda), but mostly sleeping and crying. I feel worthless for not having a job, and ashamed for how spotty my work history has been. I’m in my late 20s and haven’t held a job for more than a year and some months. I haven’t held a job since late 2018. “What have you been doing?” I am asked in interview, and I have no idea how to respond.

I have a history of sexual trauma, emotional abuse, and some days like today I feel like I’m doomed to perpetuate a downward cycle until I die. I reported the perpetrator last year after seven years of silence and the officer did not believe me. This was a few months after I quit drinking. That was painful. I did not drink to cope. I’m glad I didn’t.

Recovery is messy, healing is messy, sometimes we make mistakes. My most recent mistake was moving back with a controlling mother right before the stay at home order took place. Some days I feel like I’m losing my mind. I lock myself in my room most days this week. She keeps trying to ask me what the matter is. This is the same woman who called me a “stupid idiot” for being sexually abused in college, told me I was being sinful when she saw the self harm marks on my arm, and that my suicide attempt was a “stupid thing.” A few weeks ago she was yelling and throwing stuff on the ground when she got angry about me, and then told me I was a “lucky girl” that she wasn’t throwing it at me. My jaw dropped and she looked smug at that. I told her that should NOT be the measure for me being a “lucky girl.” I feel like when she asks me what’s wrong, it’s not to share compassion, it’s to gain information she can use as ammo later against me.

I feel like such a loser. I feel like I’m just a toxic vampire. I am hurting inside and though I know it won’t last forever, it feels like it will.

There is no pretty bow to wrap this up, no “and here’s how I pulled myself together!” This is as authentic as I get right now. I know there are people out there who have it tons worse than I do; she reminds me of that when I behave too sensitively for her liking.

I do recognize the way I feel right now, as the way I felt before when I would buy liquor then proceed to drink alone for the rest of the day. I won’t do that. It’s not an option.

I believe it's about time I reached out to this community. I've been an addict since I was around 13. I remember stealing my dad's scotch and painkillers back then so I guess that may be where it started.

I was a fiend for opiates all of my teenage years and was a full-on IV heroin user when I was 19. I used plenty of other drugs but heroin was definitely my DOC

I quit heroin when I was 21 and quickly began drinking every day. Back then I figured I'd rather be an alcoholic than a junkie so fuck it. I probably drank every day until I was 24. At that point I was maybe drinking a pint of vodka a night.

I managed to piss away every meaningful relationship in my life up to that point. I was pretty difficult. I  finally started to turn that around when I met my wife. 

I've calmed down on the drinking since then but I definitely still have a problem. I don't have to drink every day, but if I do I will not stop until I'm either passed out or out of booze.

I'm so stressed I'm nearly in tears. I don't really get stressed like this. There are situations with my work right now that cannot be resolved currently for various reasons. I'm not a wait and let your problems come to you. I pick up the phone and create a reasonable set of expectations.

Can't do that right now. It's really fucking with me. I'm stuck here in this limbo where there's a good chance it will not resolve well on me. Nothing drastic - but I'm not use to anything negative at work. Quite the opposite.

This is where I want to drink. 

I know it won't help.

I know it's still just the second day and my brain hasn't figured out a better way to deal with these stresses again yet.

I know that maybe some of this stress is even because it's the second day. ....but this has been an ongoing set of fucking stupid work situations all season (past 4 months). I'm so over it. I love what I do - but I'm ready for this to be over.

I want to drink just to make myself stop thinking about it. 

Just drink. Play Stardew. Sleep.

.....but then tomorrow I would not be proud of myself.

That's worse than this.

I’m on day 9 of being sober, in the evenings I get these killer head aches and tonight I’m having just terrible mood swings. I hate to be like this and I hate doing this to my girls, they are currently playing with their toys and I told them mommy is not feeling well and I just need some time. I can’t ask for anyone to come over to watch them because of the shelter in place and we kind of are confined to our home because it’s too cold to walk. I’m eating a bowl of ice cream and taking 10 minutes to get myself in the right mindset but I can feel I’ve just been snapping out over the littlest things.

How long does it take for mood swings side effects to subside? This is normal, right? I think my mind is playing tricks on me because part of me is just saying this doesn’t have anything to do with alcohol and if I just had a drink I’d stop being in this mood. 

Also I’ve only ever made it to 10 days sober in the past 2.5 years. I’d really like to give it up completely this time but trying not to overwhelm my self with the crushing feeling of “I’ll never be able to drink again” trying to rewrite that in my head to say “I never have to drink again!!

I do like to drink here and there but with quarantine I have been drinking far too much, like drunk every night drinking for around 6-8 hour spans for about a straight month now. Usually it’s pretty causal just beers with the boys or some wine with my gf and then escalates to me finishing the night chasing the drunk feeling.

Today I finally got to a point where I don’t see a point in it anymore. 

I only see a total of 3 people (my gf and the roommates) and just don’t think I need to be drunk during the week. I’ve also gained some noticeable weight which makes me want to drink more even though I know that won’t help solve anything.

On the weekend I think I’ll cut it back but I think this is a big step in forming a better habit. I’m just proud of myself for stoping or at least trying to stop a bad habit from starting while focusing on getting my health back.",3

Anyways. I am pretty happy. I had my entire world crumble before the world crumbled before me. But look at this! 2 months sober now! And I feel great!

I've lurked this subreddit for a long time now, envious and admiring of the courage and honesty of those who are trying to get better. I feel compelled to share my lowest moment that made me quit drinking. Thank you to everyone for being so empathetic and encouraging to one another, which has given me the support I need throughout this process.

14 days ago, I had my last drink. Hopefully forever. Up to that point, I'd treated this quarantine as a rare opportunity to drink all day with no responsibilities or consequences. I'd felt underpaid and underappreciated at work before I was furloughed, so I felt justified to let loose and turn my brain off for awhile.

Unfortunately my drinking had gotten to the point where on this particular day, I woke up still drunk and immediately took a swig of vodka out of the bottle. I live with my girlfriend, who was still asleep at the time, and this was just the latest instance of me sneaking drinks when she thought I was sober.

By mid-afternoon, I was annihilated. I'd started taking the dog out for a walk earlier and earlier in the day, mainly as an excuse to stop by the corner store for booze I could slam before I got back to the apartment. ""Dog on a walk"" was such a good cover to go out and fortify myself to come back relaxed and happy with a secret buzz while we went about our day at home.

I quit drinking that day because I scared myself so terribly with the situation I put myself in that I never wanted to know anything lower than that moment. Mid-afternoon, in the bright sunny daytime, I found myself on a corner a few blocks from my apartment, absolutely shitfaced. All I remember is that I thought I had my dog with me, but all the sudden I came to and she was gone. I thought she'd run off in the middle of the city. I was horrified and in a drunken panic, thinking I'd lost my dog because I was too damn drunk to notice. I called my girlfriend, who was at home. I started sobbing, surely through awful slurring, that I lost our dog. Then she said, ""What are you talking about? The dog is here at home. You didn't take the dog.""

Jesus Christ. I was relieved, of course, but realized I was so hammered that I could barely walk. And I had do what felt impossible: stumble home 3 blocks like a zombie with broken legs in the middle of the day, without getting arrested for public drunkenness. I think I remember people on the street looking at me with disdain and telling me to get the fuck home. Eventually I did, through what seemed like the longest and scariest walk of my life.

When I got home, I broke down crying and confessed to my girlfriend that I have a drinking problem and that I don't want to drink anymore. It was a moment of clarity I'd never experienced before: I knew this was the last straw and I had to stop. So, I put it out to the world to make it real and hold myself accountable. I called my oldest friend and confessed to her that I had a problem. I texted my friends that I had a problem and that I was going to be radio-silent for awhile. Then I ate a lot of edibles to numb my feelings of dread, embarrassment, shame, and anger.

The next day I vomited in the shower because I was so anxious. I barely slept for four days. Sweaty, panicked insomnia.

I wouldn't say each day is always better than the previous one, but the ball is rolling and the positive momentum that builds with the passing of each sober day is giving me the confidence and self esteem that I've been lacking for so long.

While a far cry from what many of you have experienced, it still was enough to shake me up. While I had been aware that my drinking was a problem for a few years, this ultimately set me up for completely stopping to drink mid-October, 180 days ago this Friday.

Of course, I'm happy that I've stuck with it for so long. Of course I'm happy I don't have to deal with hangovers anymore. Of course I'm happy about all the money I save, and the bit of weight that I've lost since then. Of course, rationally this was the right choice.

And yet, I don't feel better. I still crave alcohol and those cravings never went away. They got a bit better over the first two months, but since then, they've only worsened. I'd hoped that it gets easier over time, but it feels like it just keeps getting harder.

Even before the whole COVID-kerfluffle, I was feeling creeping social isolation. Not that I don't have friends I can hang around sober, I'm blessed with good friends that are not just drinking buddies.

But on birthdays especially, people want to go out to drink and I just cannot tolerate bars or parties sober. While I could get buzzed to deal with these situations before, now I am just completely unable to handle it and I've excused myself early from all bars and parties that have happened since because the sensory overload is just too much for me.

That bums me out.

I've noticed myself already negotiating with myself. ""Well, once you've managed to stay sober for 180 days, maybe you can go back to drinking in moderation"". I know I cannot moderate. Like so many of us, I don't want that first drink. I don't enjoy being slightly drunk. Once I've had that first one, the only objective is to head to oblivion as quickly as possible.

And yet, my dumb alcoholic brain keeps trying to convince me that just a little will be okay and that I deserve a reward for these 180 days.

I am afraid that I will not be strong enough to keep it at bay once that day comes.

Sorry for this rambly mess of a post, I just had to get that off my chest. Here's to hoping. At least for today, IWNDWYT.",7

I've been drinking more than I probably should for maybe 2 years now? I think it really got going when my dog died, I'd had him for 14 years and he died in a really traumatic way, he just up and seized on the living room floor one afternoon and just wouldn't stop even when the vet have him meds.

I became afraid to be home alone because I was terrified something bad would happen and it would just be me all by myself with no way to handle it.

Anyways, I started drinking. A lot more than normal. For awhile I was drinking a bottle of wine a night or several mixed drinks. Now it varies --- some nights I'll have 4 beers, some nights 2 and then a different night (like last night) I'll knock out ten. I never drink in the morning or during the day. Not that that makes it better.

I hate this and I want to stop but I guess the real question is what are the dangers? Back in August I did go about one week without any alcohol kind of in accident because I was having one huge long drawn out panic attack about my teeth (i hadn't gone to the dentist in 7 years and things were in bad shape, I'm almost done with my treatment like 8k later) and I didn't have any scary withdrawals, that's when I was knocking back a bottle or so of wine every night. I'm planning on tapering, I'm just very nervous about fucking it up. Especially during a pandemic when the hospitals are already overloaded.

I did not choose my sobriety date of 04/15/16, but I have done everything that I can possibly do to keep that date since then.  If you do not read the wall of text below, please just know that you are worth it, you deserve it, and find yourself the path that suits you the best.

 I used to love vodka and causing chaos. I ruin lives, and can be a thief, cheater, asshole, liar and manipulator. When I showed up at the hospital for the last time, I blew a .492, had them help me medically detox. I've had seizures and hallucinations.  The shakes bad enough to not be able to hold a shot glass or a bottle and have to use a straw to get some vodka in me. 

I decided to give rehab another try.  I had been through several detox's and a few rehab stints, but I conceded this time.  There was no safety net, no family left, no money, no job and no where to live.

After rehab, I choose to go to sober living and was there for over a year, and for me personally I choose to work an AA program, and still do to this day.

Over the years life has not stopped.  In sobriety, I went through a divorce in my first year, moved across the country, lost both of my parents, one to this disease, reconnected with the family who wouldn't take my calls, remarried and now have a kid.  I've had tough days, but I've had great years.  I can work at a job I love, be honest with people, help those in need, and not be a total piece of shit.  I can take on the daily living in a way that I do not self destruct.

Reflecting back, this has been the easier way. I no longer am tempted or even think about drinking to escape.  I have tools, people to reach out to, and a community that allows me to live on lifes terms.  Alcohol was the solution at the time, but now I cant even comprehend how I lived that way. There are such better solutions out there.",37
2020-04-15 12:15:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g1v1pq/anxietyhead/,Anxietyhead,"I was a bigger drinker once than I have been more recently (on Day 3 again). I've made it months at a time lately - this year, even, but this time I don't want to see how long I can go. This time I want to be done.

For years, starting at 21, I had this thing that I always attributed to simple anxiety. Obviously, when I drank it was better, and when I was hungover it was far worse. You know the spiral. I always just called it 'Anxietyhead.'

Well, it turns out it was 'Intrusive Thoughts,' or an obsessive inclination to mentally dive down a rabbit hole of what I can really best describe as the depths of human deprivation - despite not wanting to. It's like you're a prisoner to your brain taking you there; you're horrified at what you're obsessing over and have no intention to act on it ... but you start to try to 'fix' it, and only lead yourself farther down. Like, honestly convincing myself that I was losing my mind. Truly. It's like quicksand and it's awful. It dramatically affected the course of my life for 10 years; every day on the verge of a breakdown.

Anyway, it got better as I cut down drinking. Crazy, right? It wasn't instant, but gradual. To the point where, five years later, it was completely gone. Then this quarantine happened. I started having a few drinks every night - not much more, and never blackout. And then it happened. Easter Sunday. The sinking feeling in my gut, the thoughts. That I wouldn't dare describe. The rabbit hole that I desperately tried to claw out of and only sank deeper into.

It's a tremendously complicated problem with a stupidly simple solution. I'm done. It's been made obvious to me time and time again. Alcohol does that - the whole 'you obviously shouldn't have drank me' thing. Well, after about 20 years of learning my lesson, I'm graduating alcohol.

The takeaway: If you're suffering from intrusive thoughts, A: You're not going crazy. It's a thing, and it doesn't make you a terrible person.

Did the dishes and am working on laundry now. I even showered 2 days in a row... something I haven’t done in a long time, especially with the stay-at-home order in effect. 

This is the first time I have ever made an actual effort to control my drinking, so I suppose I didn’t know what to expect. I think I expected to just sit on the couch feeling bored and guilty and anxious- which, don’t get me wrong, I’ve done plenty of that, too. But I am pleasantly surprised and a little proud of the productive tasks I’ve accomplished. It’s amazing how daunting a task can be when you’re hung over, but how easy and painless it is sober. This feeling is giving me hope to keep going.

My life had completely gone off the rails. I lost my job, lost a damn good woman, quit playing music with my best friend. I started playing music with a girl who just moved to town and she took note of my obvious lack of purpose and alcoholism. Her family took me in when I was at my lowest of lows. They got me sober. Following the book 7 weeks to sobriety I changed my life. Over the two months I spent with these folks I found an appreciation in life that alcohol had taken from me. I worked on their ranch in exchange for help. Everything from construction to bottle feeding newborn goats. I went seven weeks without a drink and without a craving, quit smoking cigarettes in the process. I wish this story had a happy ending. I came home proud, told my family and all who I've hurt that I was a changed man. I'd finnaly gotten sober and loved every second of it. But, some part of me threw it all away. Some wailing thing deep in my heart, some skinwalking abomination, a selfish son of a bitch, threw it all away. The guilt I feel is incomprehensible. I am once again at ground zero. I've lost my shadow and my mind, but I'll be sober again in these strange times. Dont take that drink my friends, it a goddamned liar. There's no relase only repent and false promises.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to \[[r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent**.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in \[[r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at \[[r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**The Good:** Since going into isolation, I’ve had more time to spend on my art and am now trying a Japanese method of collage called *chigiri-e.*

(As seen on Facebook): “I am no longer calling this a shelter-in-place. I am now an artist-in-residence.”

**The Bad:** I’d hoped that I’d produce several new pieces over the last couple of weeks, but I that hasn’t actually happened. I’ve heard the same thing from other creative people—being able to focus on anything is really difficult right now.

**The Ugly:** Yesterday, I learned an important lesson: If you have carefully arranged pieces of torn, delicate *washi* paper on a collage board, but haven’t glued them down yet—do NOT turn on a ceiling fan.",27

i've written and made art on and off for most of my life. i actually wrote a book the year after my mom died that got published. i've written a very small amount of poetry in the last ten months. mostly i find that my time is dedicated to my serving job and then recovering from re-learning how to be in relationships and community with people. and now covid stuff makes my job ten times more stressful than before social distancing. i think i'm just sort of trying to engage the fear that my brain will never recover from substance abuse to the degree to which i do not require self medicating in order to make art/write, if only to turn off the anxiety and constant internal chatter of my brain. 

can any other writers in here speak to their recovery experience and accessing their creativity/focus/etc.?",1

I got sober for five years, from 2009-2014. I then started drinking, did a lot of damage, and went to outpatient where I was able to get 30 days a few times but not more.  


I've since been drinking everyday for the last 3ish years. I'm falling down and injuring myself, blacking out every night, damaging relationships and not remembering what I did to even apologize, and with quarantine I've been drinking first thing in the morning and through the day. Every day, except yesterday and today.  


My goal is to stop drinking. I've tried too many times to moderate and it just doesn't work for me. I'm either drinking alcoholically or not drinking. I wish there were a middle place for me but I really think there isn't.  


The five years of sobriety started with AA, but I struggled (and still do) with many aspects of the program. However, I know I need community to stay sober. I'm hoping to find that here.",10

Ok so I’m in a new chapter in my life and to continue alcohol cannot be in the picture. I’ve known this for awhile and I procrastinated quitting to very last min. I really can’t go get medical help this time. First off. I been drinking for a while now. I’m 29 years old and I would say the heavy drinking started around 5-6 years ago. I realized it was a problem when I first tried quitting and I tried cold turkey and I experienced DTs. Scared the shit out of me and I had to drink to make them stop. I went to a clinic and they gave me the medicine to stop. The second time I quit by myself. I typically drink a pint of vodka a day. I drink right before bed. So the first day I drank normally. The following day a little less. And so on and so on until I was down to just one shot a night. I did that for three days then I stopped. It worked. But i only lasted three weeks without a drink till I succumbed to the drink. I have good support to help me through this. I just have to be strong and I cannot move forward with my life and my future wife living like this. So I begin tonight. Any advice?,4

Just got in a big fight with wife and kids. Really hate my wife and her personality in so many ways. My kids can be so annoying. Quarantine sucks. I want to change so many things in my life. My wife drinks just as much as me. She is at 48 hours. I really hope she makes a lot of changes. 

We want to change so many things and I know the first step is to not drink. Sometimes I look at everything and just want to give up. It’s a big hill to climb. Feels overwhelming and maybe I should just settle. 

I read a quote from a marathon runner. While running a marathon you can only focus on the mile you are at. If you look at the miles you have ran you will feel too tired and will quit. If you look at all the miles you have to go, then it will seem too far and you will quit. Only look at the mile your currently in. 

I just want to finish today. I hate so many things in the past and I want a lot of things to change in the future. But I’m only going to focus today. Wish me luck.",10

I am tired.  I woke up in the middle night for a few hours and it goofed my whole day, but (even though there is booze in the house) I am going to sleep sober.  This is the first time I have been able to complete Day One in a while now.  Starting to get my healthy habits lined up for the rest of the week: exercise, laundry, cleaning, coming here to post, talking with family, reading, and writing.  Once that groove kicks in, then things fall back into place.  The key is KEEPING them there.  Amidst all of this keeping the good habits is even more important with the Pandemic.  I was afraid of how silly it was to have to be back at Day One lately and the shame and disappointment of it all kept me wanting to knock-back the emotions with booze.  Booze to treat the remorse of booze.  The ol' cycle.  If failure is the greatest teacher I should be a Post-Doctoral Professor at quitting drinking now.  I feel like Mark Twain: quitting smoking is the easiest thing in the world to do, I have done it hundreds of times.  Only I do not smoke.  I used to.  Odd how that does not affect me the way drinking does in how I see myself.  I am not ashamed of having smoked, much, but I do not consider myself a recovering smoke-a-holic.  it is not part of my identity or as big a part of my past.  I am known for being a drinker among friends, so to NOT be one is so weird.  I mean I have done periods of sobriety before but it is just tough to think about forever (which is of course not what you are supposed to do) but I do tell myself that if I think a goal is going to take too long to get there, do I plan on being alive at that point in time?  Yes.  So...the goal will be there to meet me.  So I ate well today.  Am likely going to sleep like a baby tonight.  Spent good time with a loved one.  Had a pretty good work day.  Am working on a personal writing project that otherwise never gets done when I drink.  Is it more boring?  It seems quieter, but not boring.  Boring was sitting on the couch blasted trying to watch a movie and not even be able to pay attention or staring a screen for hours drunk, alone.  THAT was boring, or the parts that were exciting about drinking were waking-up the next day not knowing what I did or said or texted...THAT was exciting.  To see how much over-consuming a bad-tasting, mind-altering, dehydrating, nausea-inducing, addictive, expensive, mood-altering astringent can change how you view yourself in the morning is SUPER exciting.  Wondering if the cops are going to show-up at your door or if your significant other is going to break-up with you.  REAL exciting.  I think I will take reality, though it is rough sometimes, and just alter how I think about it.  That is called imagination and creativity, and puts me in a place where my mind is occupied doing something enjoyable instead of just trying to turn it off because it feels unpleasant.

2020-04-14 20:16:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g1h7x2/ive_made_it_through_day_3_some_observations/,I've made it through day 3. Some observations.,"I know 3 days is hardly something to get worked up about, but it's the longest I've gone in about a decade (illnesses aside, obviously.) Here's a few things I've noticed. 

1. Holy shit I can sleep again. Never had a problem passing out... That was a nightly occurrence, but the last 2 nights I've stayed asleep. Eyes closed and opened when the alarm went off. No more jolting wide awake at 2 in the morning and being up until 4 (Usually with more drinks during this time.) That hasn't been the case in so long. It's fantastic. I've never had a problem with hangovers, but still how I feel overall on the morning is night and day. 

2. I'm drinking a metric fuckton of water. I'm 99% sure it's some sort of oral fixation thing, but it helps and it's healthy, so fuck it. My housemates still drink freely around me (and I'd never ask them not to... My burdens and decisions are my own) so as they're pouring more wine or cracking another beer I just pour water. 

3. Here's a negative. I'm smoking cigarettes again. I've never fully kicked nicotine, but I've been going the smokeless route for years. But those things you slap in your mouth and let em sit for as long as you want. Not exactly a dopamine button. So take away my ""let's pour another shot!"" and I'm left wanting. Naturally went back to something familiar, I suppose. Not good tho. I'm slapping a ""today I will not buy another pack"" onto the checkin tomorrow.

4. Yoooo the money. I'm already seeing how fantasticly 15-30 bucks a day/every other day is gonnah add up. (Obviously... Thats an absurd amount to literally piss away.)

5. I'm doing stuff. Instead of standing at the counter pouring more drinks because I'm bored... I go fuckin find something to do. Bought Civilization VI (that's a drug in and of itself lol,) mucked about on the piano, banged out a fuckton of laundry, cleaned my car, so on and so forth. I've missed productivity.

And lastly, I'm worried. The weekend approaches. Oddly enough, I'm thankful to be in quarantine while I kick this off. It's easier to say no to myself than the boys getting drinks at the bar. But even still. Friday night is for getting fucked up. I hope I can plow through my first weekend. I suppose listing out benefits will help... Hence this post lol.

That's it, yall. Stay strong out there.",10

Lol The next memory - 2 years ago, we splurged and went out to a super fancy dinner, which is rare, went to a pub for drinks...There are pics of me all dressed up and again looking my best, giving myself bunny ears to be funny, pics of me smiling and gesturing towards a big decorative sign in the pub that we went to that says ""Public Drunkenness Prohibited"" and laughing away. I'm 💯 buzzed or drunk in all the pics (both years), but I look really pulled together and was having the time of my life.

I fell off. \*Inexplicably\* right after finishing this beautiful 100 day course I was in called Get In Gear For the Next Tier, a daily exercise in showing up for myself and my acting career, filled with all kinds of knowledge and most importantly, mindset work. Building a muscle for actually believing that I deserve the life I'm headed for, the life I've been heading for for decades, but waylayed by 3 of those decades where I was just drowning in vodka and blow. 2 years and 4 months of growth, and learning, and self love and self compassion I built since I quit drinking on December 27th, 2017. I broke it. But it's still there right? All that learnin' and all that enoughness is still there. I know it is by the way I'm treating myself in these days following my fall. With compassion and love for myself and my very human failings. 

I have those 100 days and this community right here to thank for not completely abandoning myself further. And *of course*, now that I'm a mess, foggy and still hungover, I got 2 auditions (self taped these days) from my agent in 2 days, amidst my foggy mind and body now, after hardly anything. I take it as a pretty firm sign. Universe says, ""Ooooh no you don't Lucy girl. You don't get to go back. You belong right here."" I feel so fucking disappointed in myself. But I needed to be honest, amongst the best and safest people I've come to know, this community. So thanks for being here. I don't know what to do with my badge, because even though I only drank for 3 days, I don't want to be misleading. Frankly I don't care about it much, as I don't subscribe to the AA philosophy of ""go back to zero."" Maybe I'll just get rid of it altogether. It's really the least of my worries right now, tbh. 

I'm getting back up again. I deserve the life I'm headed for. We all do. Much love to all of you and I hope you're finding a way to stay sane and in good health. I just keep writing more words I think so I can prolong the time before I have to click ""post."" sigh.",15

I think this is a cool idea, both from the perspective of them not endorsing something that they don't personally use anymore, but also them understanding that they have sober fans who miss that feeling of having a beer in their hand at a concert.

I was 25-26-27 and progressively would go on benders. Most every other night was a few tall boys of steel reserve. I was running my own business working full days/completing college/at the gym nightly. 

I always knew it wasn't right. I'd say never again after waking up feeling groggy/missing another oppertunity for work/blowing off some plans or a workout. I neglected myself and a lot was due to the relationship displacemnet I was in (a whole nother story)

Since about 9 months ago- That relationship ended. Our dog passed. Family members passed. Car blew up. Moved accross country for my first real corporate job......and I've finally got my own apartment (first time living by myself ever really-had been army/then the ex for 6 years). I'm in the gym daily (my garage hah) and I feel like i'm out of a hole and into the light. Life isn't all roses.....in fact some days it seems harder-but at least I don't have to feel like shit all day. 

Drinking is no where near what it was. I drank last weekend a bit at a  easter gathering at a friends-but I no longer need it. I don't seek it out to fall asleep (although my sleep schedule is rough so sometimes i miss that aspect). I've had one bender in the past 4 months and that headache/texts waking up was a wakeup of the old bs. 

I'm typing this to tell people to hang in there. It's a process. What helped me the most was admitting to myself there was a issue. No one else knows/most people would probably never guess but.....I knew. I knew and I wasn't ok with it and well........here we are. 

I hope everyone stays safe this week-keep your head up. Try something new. Live today :)",31

To narrow down my question, who do I tell that I need help? My dad is 9 years sober from a mutlitude of substances. My dumb question is, should I go to him? I feel alone, ashamed, and clueless.

With this safer at home thing going on, I can't privately go to meetings or seek help w/o my sister or fiancee knowing and flipping out on me.

I'd really appreciate someone's guidance in this. I always thought you had to end up in rehab or a 72 hour hold to get help.",1

I want today to be my first day I want today to end all days of drinking for me. 

Since quarantine I still work luckily but I was training everyday in the morning before work. 

I slipped and I feel sorry for my self like usual and get disappointed in myself like usual when I fail myself. I’m a go hard or go home mindset and it’s like that with drinking too. 

I just want it to end and stop! Longest I went without drinking was 3 months typically I’ll still workout the next day if I drink because I feel I need to punish myself more. 

It’s an endless cycle. My dad is a alcoholic and I don’t want to end up like him I’m 29 and want this soul sucking drink to leave me alone.

I have been building up the courage to post on here because I feel I lost the battle. I have lost myself again and I don’t want to go back to that I want the new me I have been working on..

I would feel guilty for wanting to drink when I'm trying to celebrate exactly the opposite; the guilt would turn into my usual downward spiral of self-loathing. But today something finally changed. I feel accomplished and grateful for the trajectory my life is taking even in this time of chaos and uncertainty.

Here's some positive changes I've noticed in the past 6 months:

* According to the I Am Sober App, I've saved over $2000
* I used some of that money 2 months ago to buy a digital piano to start playing again
* I learned how to cook and bake
* I lost weight/fitness in general is easier to get into when I'm not feeling ill every day
* I haven't had a ""big"" argument with my wife since I stopped drinking (she stopped too out of solidarity, although it appears she only ever drank from association of me drinking as she doesn't struggle/miss it at all)
* I'm much more stable emotionally (although at first I was much less)
* I'm happy
* I really, really like tea

Here are some things I'm hoping will go away in the next 6 months:

* I have ""phantom"" drink taste when I see alcohol commercials, especially whiskey or gin
* I still crave a drink when I'm very anxious/stressed/can't sleep
* Seeing all the quarantine booze posts still makes me feel... slightly jealous or longing?

My deadlines were over 2 weeks ago. I'm able to work from home right now, but I've taken a week off just because I really needed it. I've slowly drank more and more because I was able to let loose... I'm not back to where I was last year before stopping for that time - but I feel it coming. I woke up in a cold sweat and shaky from the half a bottle of bourbon I drank last night on top of I don't even know how much vodka or beer I casually drank during the day. 

I don't want that. These excuses have to end.

2) Im bored. Might as well have some drinks and stay up too late and get really shitty sleep. This leads to lack of motivation to do ANYTHING productive the next day. 
3) Since today doesn’t feel like a workday it must be the weekend right. I can have some drinks and feel like shit tomorrow.

Actually, I already know this first hand, from experience.  News feed this morning had an article about how much Americans are drinking right now during Isolators.  To no surprise, it’s a lot.  What got me about the article wax how much drinking impacts our bodies immune system.  

When I was still drinking, I’d get sick at least two or three times a year, during cold and flu season.  Additionally, my allergies would absolutely HAMMER me, every year.  8 months without beers has changed something inside me.  This year, I have not been sick once.  My allergies were so muted, I’ve been forgetting to take my usual daily allergy meds.  

I have so much that I’m thankful for, since quitting.  Old me would have been super stressed about having my trips to the store limited by the social distancing.  I’d have bought so much beer, and then, probably drank it all in a day or two and have to beg my poor partner to let me run out and get more.  Thankfully, those days are behind us.  

I am so grateful that I can just stay put.  Being healthy and safe, and not put my family’s well being in jeopardy during this mess.  I do feel for all the folks I see posting AM wine selfies.  Been there, done that.  Waking up guilt, anxiety, and hangover free feels so much better than 10am drinking and needing a nap after lunch.  

Fuck this virus, fuck alcohol.   I’ll just stay away from both.

A lot of people are posting memes online about having to do all those chores and projects they've put off for a long time. Now is also a great time to catch up on reading, huh?

I've been reading Karl Ove Knausgaard's *My Struggle* series for over 6 months and really enjoying it. I would read one, then read other things for 2 or 3 weeks, then start the next one. The first 5 books each took me maybe a week or 10 days to read, nbd. Then right as quarantine was getting started about a month ago (here in my neck o' the woods) I decided to get into the 6th and final book. Well this one is much, much longer and much, much heavier than the previous 5. He gets really deep into philosophy in this one and he talks at great length about Hitler. 

I minored in history and am a great lover of history and even took an upper level course called The Nazis and Their Legacy in college toward my minor but I never had much interest in Hitler himself. Kind of like I'm not into true crime podcasts about psycho killers either. Crazy evil people aren't really my thing though I can see how they're interesting to others. But I am determined to finish this series so here I am, spending quarantine thinking about Hitler. Spoiler alert: he sucks. I didn't think it was possible for me to dislike him more than I already did, but now I do actually. I get what Knausgaard is doing here though. I'm on board. I'm about 2/3 through this now and hoping by next Tuesday to have finished. 

I am watching loads more TV than usual too. I've been catching up on Masterpiece Classic shows for one thing, and also just trying out random Netflix or Prime movies that I wouldn't normally watch.

I work in a public service job so helping other people is a professional as well as a personal thing. A people pleaser basically. And that kindof thinking gives me a lot of stress. Mainly because I cannot control other folks and therefore it feels like my stress is out of control and then the drinking gets out of control. But really thinking about other people that way is just me putting myself at the center of things. It is a way of being selfish. If I can give myself peace of mind by focusing on me really me and what I can control I can give other people the best version of me that I can. If I focus on my health on my state of mind on my peace then I will be strong enough to handle the inevitable tough times when they come and really be there for other folks instead of worrying about them because of how I am interacting with them. That is not really empathising with them at all. Self care gives to others just as much as it gives to me. I feel if I can keep sober then the people I care
about will really reap the benefits as well. Thank You for reading.",6

Not finished, probably have a good 5 days left. But the first withdrawal day was terrifying. Took 2 days just to feel ""stable"" but after reading stuff here I looked to see about tapering and developed a plan. Had been difficult to get out of bed, and impossible to sleep for 3 days when I started. Then slowly more sleep. I picked up supplements today and Gatorade. Oh shit has it helped, but I was already feeling a little better. Just riding the line of normalish and shaking and serious discomfort. It's working. I'm feeling a lot better as I continue to taper. 

I think I was at ~20 or so units a day at my worst. Now I'm at 12. Tomorrow will be 10. I'll see if I can hit 6 after that because the supplements and Gatorade are life changing. I'm trying to space out by more time in between during the day, then a couple extra at bedtime. 

Supplements:

-Magnesium (for those racing, electric feelings)
-Melatonin 
-Valerian Root (GABA)
-GABA
-Gatorade (sugar, potassium, sodium, water) 

For anyone trying to taper, keep a fucking notebook of all your time and experiences. And random thoughts about it all. Keeping a record really helps with timing and daily numbers. Especially when you're up for 3 fucking days. 

It takes commitment. I've been through 3 ""boom and bust"" periods of drinking in my 20s. This withdrawal nightmare was the thing that made me say ""I'm fucking done."" So if you are hoping to keep drinking, it will be tougher but not impossible.

EDIT: I forgot to mention, EAT. It can be very difficult with all the discomfort. But the better the meal, the better you feel.",13

So I decided to change my life and jump start learning/studying for a new career certification that will make me a lot more money. 

I took 3 weeks off and hadn’t worked since March 20th. I had my first day back and everything was different. 

I parked and there were no cars around me unlike the 30 people usually getting in at the same time. Apparently now we have to check in a football field away and get our temperature checked every morning. 

They handed me a mask that I had to get used to wearing while sweating all day. Which was uncomfortable and felt like a rash was forming. 

I wake up at 4am after sleeping for less than 3 hours because my sleep schedule was off and I was probably nervous to sleep as I laid in bed for hours. 

Clock in at 5am and see my team. I just say hi. His first words are fuck you. I’m not helping you with anything today. He was angry I used my pto and sick time how I wanted??????? He was stuck doing my job the last 3 weeks a bit under handed. 

So I don’t say anything. Just head to my area expecting a harder day with no help. Prepare for my day. 

None of my supplies are there. I have to scrounge around and ask other co workers for my tools I usually use. I didn’t have the good blades from the other building and had to use the shitty ones that broke on me all day. 

On the old schedule, we get the hardest part once or twice a day and I get help with it 85% of the time. Apparently customer demands have changed and we have a new schedule, giving me the hard part 4 times a day now! 

I don’t even bother asking for the help I usually get so I fall behind all day. Here I make so many mistakes in a row argh!!
1. The machine messes up and I didn’t notice it was messing up Until it was too late (but still completely fine)
2. I don’t call for help (it will take time and I’m behind already and the help wasn’t in the mood for helping today lol)
3. I restart the machine and everything is fine (but I hesitate and don’t fully restart it). 
4. Because I make the machine restart again now it fucks up. And falls over and the plate breaks off and the steel chips on the rest of the machine. 

So now I fucked up huge. I messed up the actual frame and I messed up the machine. The frame won’t be fixed for a few weeks. The machine won’t be fixed for a few weeks. Now we have to use the back up machine which is further away causing me an additional 5 minutes of time for every part that comes out every 30 minutes for the next month or so. Not to mention the cost of repairs and co workers time it will take to fix it. Shit. 

I incorrectly clocked back in for lunch. Had to fill out a form for my boss to sign and send in. And I’ve been doing that a bit too much anyway. 

I was behind all day. I am behind 6 parts. The labor was lazy and not even that good. I had a bad day alright? I was rusty! And tired! Today sucked!

I like to work out everyday. I didn’t work out today and I didn’t get much studying in when I was at work or when I came home. 

As I lay in bed for over 2 hours now unable to sleep again, I reflected for a bit. I forgot how it used to be. And my new bad days are NOTHING compared to how bad the old bad days were. 

I haven’t drank in 4.5 months. It was our off Friday so a 3 day weekend. 

5 months ago I would have drank my face off especially with nothing going on. I would have been hung over yesterday and today and probably tomorrow too. I probably wouldn’t have even made it to work today who am I kidding. Or if I did, I would have crawled into bed as soon as I got home. Maybe had 2 beers or so to try to ease the hangover and pass out at 5pm in pain. I would have spent a shit load of wasted money on food and drinks. I would have fought with my girlfriend. I would have been worried about all the stupid things I texted people or said or did. My room would be a mess. I would be 20lbs heavier and out of shape. My side would still be hurting and I’d be worried about my health. I would barely be getting by. I would be miserable, in pain, hopeless, stuck in the same rut I’ve been in. 

I didn’t work out but I ate right and worked/walked 10k steps so still at a calorie deficit. I didn’t study much but I prepared myself so well for tomorrow! Got a plan and my audio books ready and a path. And I don’t even care that much about how bad I fucked up at work. It’s really nice to not be bothered/worried because I know I am working towards something better. Because this is just a stepping stone. I am looking ahead to my future. Definitely all because I stopped drinking. 

Sorry it took so long to get to the punch line. Today sucked but it wasn’t that bad. This naked mind has changed my life! I spend so little time thinking about drinking these days. I wish I fell asleep a few hours earlier but thanks for listening. Wanted to get it off my chest/out of my mind. This is my first big post here. Thank you all so much! Tomorrow will be better and today wasn’t even that bad :)",27

How did I ever manage to trick myself into thinking that being wasted was a better way to spend my time than actually living my life? Makes me feel silly. 

For everyone just starting their journey, you can do this. I tried to stop drinking multiple times. I always managed to stop for a few months, and then I would back slide. Just keep trying. Eventually, it will stick and you'll feel a lot better down the road. :)

Recently I got drunk at a party of my closest friends, and my mental issues got the better of drunk me. I got crazy and started yelling and attacked my best friend of 12 years and hit my other best friends truck and dented his fender. 

My best friend wouldn’t take to me for days. My other friend said everything was okay with his truck and I told him I would pay for any and all damages. My cousin who was there (to my knowledge) forgave me that night. 

I told them I was going to stop drinking, and see a therapist for my issues. However tonight only 9 days sober they were drinking. Which is fine I want them to if they want because it somewhat makes things back to normal. I myself declined all offers of alcohol. I drank only water all night. However my friends know this is really hard and no one said anything good about me not drinking. Mainly cause no one wants to talk about it which eats me alive. I was hoping you all could maybe give me a pat on the back? This is hard for me for 2-1/2 years I’ve drank nearly every day till I couldn’t stand because my mental issues were to much to bare. 

No longer will I let myself get over taken by my own doubt and fear and let myself drink till I forget. I hope everyone here can say the same. Thank you all for any words of encouragement for a guy who feels down on his luck.",8

Some observations:

- Every week I feel better physically
- I’m more alert
-I have definitely been more available to my boys
-The quarantine is brutal, but I’m so grateful I’m not sluggish and hungover
- I miss beer, but I’m not willing to pay the price beer charges physically and emotionally.
- It’s like I just gave myself extra time
- It is so great going to bed sober and waking up sober
- I love driving now, and I’m no longer afraid of police.
-(before quarantine) I loved taking my boys places instead of my wife and I figuring out who is not drinking and who will drive that day.
-Life is not easy, it’s just better sober

Our Friendship has always been predicated on drinking and hanging out. I’m over 80 days sober after completely changing my life and moving past dependence on alcohol to have fun. I also started on antidepressants and therapy to deal with the depression if felt for a long time. 

I have kept to myself and not spoken to many people since I quit and he doesn’t know yet that I have made the choice to change my life. I don’t think that he wouldn’t be supportive but the chance is there and I’m guessing even though he drinks that my problem had not been apparent to him fo a long time as well. 

My conflict is this. Do I go and hangout and bring him up to speed with where I am in life or keep to myself as I’m not sure if I’m ready for the potential temptation. It would be easy to just have a few and then in a few weeks and months I’ll be back where I was and I won’t do that but the fact that the opportunity will most certainly be there and I will be away from my loved ones I’m not sure the risk and potential distrust at home are worth it at this stage in my recovery. 

I wonder if I’m over thinking it and putting off an inevitable conversation with a person I care a lot about and have known for over 25 years.... I plan on sleeping on it before I make a decision.... 

I won’t drink because I know where that leads and the real life consciences that follow, but it’s the sitting with a buddy shooting the shit, and I would always have the glass in my hand getting tipsy with the rest of the gang.....",5

I have been an alcoholic and stoner at least since I was 18, and I rarely would admit it to myself, and I would drink anyways, thinking ""I can control myself, I just want to get a buzz going"" whenever I would drink, but since now I'm of age to buy it whenever I want to, and from working at a grocery store that sells alcohol, I really do think I'm an alcoholic. The temptation to drink comes and goes throughout the day depending on what all I see and hear going on around me. Using it as a stress relief, pain relief, and overall life relief is my big problem. I tend to over-drink until I blackout and don't know what I'm doing. That's where I'm thinking of trying weed for a little while to see if that helps me stay alcohol sober. 

I have a plan to only use cannabis, and to leave alcohol completely out of my life, and that's why I'm posting here and not in r/alcoholicsanonymous because in AA they preach full sobriety, however I'm an addict so I want to get high/intoxicated on something, and I think weed's the safest and best way to go. Xanax/benzos and opioids are a death sentence, and so is our dark friend named alcohol, but I really want to get high/intoxicated so that's why I'm going towards cannabis. 

Any thoughts or suggestions? I've told myself already that if I have weed, I cannot consume any alcohol with it. I don't plan to smoke forever, or all day or everyday, but I do wish to smoke a little now and then to deal with my addictive, bored, and stoner personality. At least until meetings start again, and maybe then I'll quit smoking, and make some good friends from AA meetings who I can become sober with. I just feel like quitting weed's easier than quitting alcohol, and much safer, and less regretful.

I’m having a hard time making a decision towards drinking for myself...

I’m 30, I’ve been drinking since 14, somewhat regularly every weekend for the past ~16 years.

This eventually enabled both cigarettes and chew. These incredibly enhanced my enjoyment of everything while I was doing it.

I started dating someone 9 years ago. Fell in love. And married her 3 years ago.

I stopped smoking AND chewing 3 years ago. I’m over that, and my life has permanently been deafened. It’s just not as enjoyable.

Knowing, 3 years later, that quitting something like chewing was, indeed, enhancing my life... I’m having a really hard time understanding how my life will improve by not drinking.

There are no guarantees, it seems like an “obvious” choice because it makes me slightly more aggressive, adds a lot of weight, and is pretty expensive... but I compare that to happiness... in which it doesn’t really.

I feel like the selfish, aggressive question I want to ask is “how do I know it’s better on the other side”. I’m which I know no one can answer. And I’m not entitled the answer to.

I blacked out, I drove around and almost crashed my car, and I treated my boyfriend like shit. This was the worst night I’ve ever had. Recalling it is so incredibly painful. My apologies feel weak. 

I have tried to quit drinking in the past but have always convinced myself I don’t have a problem. I’m hoping that the silver lining to all of this is that it’s the biggest wake up call I’ve ever gotten. Alcohol is horrible for me and is destroying my life.",24

(could be water weight, but definitely some of it is the 2k or so less calories i'm having daily from booze). i've been meditating, stretching, listening to sober audible books.. doing it all. tonight my mom looked at me and blurted out ""wow you've really gained weight"". 

i feel defeated. i fucking know i gained weight but i'm working on it and it doesn't go away over night. i'm also going through a break up with someone i thought i was spending my life with. i really really want to have a drink right now which i know would end up several. i'm sad about my ex relationship, i'm sad i'm stuck living at my parents when i was in the middle of house hunting with my ex before this happened, i'm sad to look at my body and see how badly i have let myself go, i'm sad i feel like life is on hold and everyone around me seems to be drinking. 

i'm 30, i want to start a family, i want to find someone. thinking about it makes me want to drink because obviously with isolation i can't just go put myself out there. on top of that i feel like a fat fuck whose drank 30lbs onto a body i worked so hard for.

my mom immediately realized she shouldn't have said that and has been trying to be nice and ask to see my ""inspiring progress photos"". i'm currently locked in my room trying to not go buy booze. 

not even sure where i was going with this post or what i need right now but i just feel sad all around and i needed to express it somewhere. thank you for reading.",8

After thinking about that question, I wrote this. I didn’t give this response to those friends because it is long winded and would make me sound like an ass, but I wrote it here because I’d like to hear what others think about the writing and the topic. I haven’t finished it, it is just my opinion (and I could be wrong), and I know I am far from “crossing the finish line.”

Quitting alcohol was difficult, but it wasn’t the most difficult part. The truly difficult part was living as an alcoholic. Obviously, it’s not difficult to take a drink, but it is difficult to pick yourself up in the morning. It’s not difficult to make a fool or criminal of yourself, but it is difficult to hide, and it is even more difficult to show your face. It’s not difficult to hurt a loved one, but it is difficult to go on living while hating yourself. The alcoholic life is consumed by a daily and seemingly eternal struggle between who you want to be and what alcohol has made you. It is a struggle for possession, and that struggle is what is difficult. Quitting is just ending that struggle. Even if they don’t know it, the difficulty of quitting isn’t the primary obstacle for the alcoholic. They have already been living a life full of difficulty.

It slowly escalated from weekend binges to ~a fifth a day and my life became utterly unmanageable. Withdrawals, panic attacks, mood swings, suicidal ideation, the works.

Truth be told, I was hoping I'd feel amazing at six months, and I don't. I wasn't expecting to be quarantined solo at home in early recovery. I'm stressed with work, trying to make up for lost time. I know that even if there were no quarantine I'm still too emotionally fragile to start dating. I still have bad days with anxiety and depression, and still sometimes skip meals/skip showers/oversleep.

And yet, since I got sober and out of treatment:
I've been a much better son, brother, and friend. They're much less worried they're going to wake up one morning to find out I died from alcohol poisoning or suicide. I talk to them most days and actually talk about how they're doing instead of focusing on my problems all the time.

I've come to believe, not really in God, but in a higher 'something' that gives me hope

I haven't been actively suicidal since I detoxed

I've haven't had an alcohol withdrawal panic attack or any of the other lovely symptoms I get in the days after a bender

I'm grateful to still have the job I was likely very close to being fired from. I haven't called in sick or been 
drunk/hungover at work. Some days I crush it, many days I only manage ""just enough"", but on no days do I get nothing done.

I've lost 27 pounds, via daily moderate exercise, losing the empty alcohol calories, and dropping junk food in favor of veggies.

I'm slowly getting towards my fitness goals, week by week, back to where I was before I fell to pieces.

I completed the 12 steps in AA and am looking to sponsor someone; I feel a strong desire to help other people struggling from addiction

My apartment doesn't look like a war zone

I've read 21 books, mostly on spirituality and mindfulness and other areas I ignored in the past

I'm studying French daily to reconnect with my French-born father, and am now able to read (easy) books in French.

I've faced all the things - job stress, exes getting married and engaged, generic shitty days - that triggered me before, and I faced them without numbing them out

I did at least one thing for my recovery every single day, without fail, no matter how absolutely shitty I felt

I was a raging alcoholic by my estimate for ~3 years, and before that ""just"" a heavy drinker for 9 years, so as much as I'd like everything to be fixed in half a year, I don't think it's realistic. I still have a lot of work to do. Looking back at this list though, there's still a lot I'm proud of for six months. I look forward to what I can do with the next six!",781

I put on some music and go into my external world of good music and scrolling through social media. I ignore boundaries with people I once set (hey, what’s the harm of being just a nice person and carrying on a conversation with them?)   

From now on, good music will be enjoyed. I will go into my external world - on a run. I will stop being lazy and letting even one stupid drink make me turn to greasy takeout. I will not waste another day falling further behind in my fitness goals, because drunk or not, the next day is a write off with all the terrible food choices and even worse sleep.

2020-04-13 16:47:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g0radi/not_going_to_waste_it/,Not Going To Waste It,"I have a drinking problem.  My life is going fine.  Fine is a waste.  I want my life to go great.  


Drinking has a hold on so much of my time.  I have a wife, three young kids, and a good full time job.  I'm lucky that it's a job I can do from home in this quarantine.  On weekdays, I work for 9 hours.  If I sleep for 8 hours, there are 7 hours left -- roughly two hours before work and five after -- for me to do everything else.  I have been a daily drinker, about 3-4 servings a day, every single day.  Typically the first drink starts an hour after work.  One sober hour!  That is all.  But that whole hour, I feel like Sisyphus rolling the stone up the hill, knowing that it is just going to roll back again.  I am not really present for my kids.  

&#x200B;

Soon after I start my first drink, it's the kids bedtime.  My wife is my drinking buddy.  We drink together every night.  She averages about 5 servings a day, every single day, but claims she averages 3.  I see how it impacts her.  I want to help her, but I have not even really helped myself.  So we both drink.  Every night.  We get dumber and duller.  We get lazy.  Chores do not get done.  Nobody feels like cooking a good nutritious meal, so we eat a pizza.  Nobody can drink and exercise, so we don't exercise.  We both carry some extra weight as a direct result.  And we fight -- do we ever!  We've been together about 18 years, but you wouldn't be able to tell by how we talk to eachother and treat eachother after about 9pm.  Instead of inspiring the best from eachother, we entrench eachother's drinking habits through cycles of anxiety and stress leading to that brief window of slightly buzzed after the kids go to sleep where everything seems good for an hour or two.

&#x200B;

I am lucky that I sleep relatively well for a daily drinker.  I don't get the 8 hours I should, but I often get 7.  I know it's not the quality it should be either.  I sleep better whenever I'm sober.  My wife sleeps worse whenever she misses a night.  I know that's due to physical dependence.

&#x200B;

When I wake up, I am hungover every day.  My wife is more hungover than me, so I need to go wake up the kids and get their food and drink and start their day.  Who can do that just as well when hungover as when they're well rested and healthy?  Not me.  I'm letting them down.  Morning is a chance for many people to get some exercise, but again, not me.  


We muddle through.  We are fine.  We spend most of each day pretty content.  But this is garbage.  What good is muddling through compared to thriving?  And what is stopping me from thriving?  If you're here, you know.  


So I need to stop drinking.  I need to replace the two hours I spend hungover and four hours I spend intoxicated each day with six hours well spent.  I need to do it for myself, for my wife, for my kids.  I need to put on my own oxygen mask before I try to help others.  I don't want to waste this life I have.  I've known it for months now, maybe years.  But somehow I keep choosing this poison.  I choose to drink along with my wife, even as it torpedoes our relationship.  I drink instead of exercising and eating well, even as I despair about my weight and mediocre health and fitness.  Everything that stresses me and frustrates me to the point I want to escape with a drink -- the messy house, worries about work, my kids living through this stressful time, my marriage feeling strain -- I know drinking makes it all worse.  I don't need to moderate, I need to stop.  One day at a time, one hour at a time, one moment at a time.  

&#x200B;

I am so worried about taking this on while my wife has no intent to change anything.  Every time I see her with a drink in her hand, that is a cue for me to want one of what she's having.  I'm worried about being sober at night and watching her slip into drunk.  But I know I can only control myself.  So that is just what I will have to do.",8

Alcohol was always something that was fun, edgy, fulfilling: something that enhanced fun.  It is a common story of partying in College to frequent beers during the week in Grad School, to being a routine, a habit, a coping mechanism, a crutch, a pastime, a hobby, a part of self identity...until it became what was actually fueling (and in a lot of cases, creating) my stress.  I have done periods of sobriety before.  I had 48 days up until February.  The last two months have been back in the old habits: working through hangovers, looking forward to the next drink, regret for things undone, remorse for things done.  Promises to myself, let downs to loved ones.  In reality I liked my period of sobriety over my time drinking and this community helps A LOT!  I am sober now.  It is Day One...again.  Some crap.  Same depression from the hangover.  Same cravings to drink.  I want to drink right now!  Ridiculous.  I have attended AA meetings, gone to therapy, taken up cycling and yoga, worked to maintain relationships, and still ended-up right back here.  Right.  Back.  At.  The.  Start.  Again.  And while I am typing this, going over the very reasons I do not want to drink (anxiety, guilt, nausea, self-loathing, performance at work, etc.) I am thinking about drinking.  By thinking about sobriety I am thinking about alcohol.  By thinking about it, I end-up wanting it.  I read *This Naked Mind* and it helped.  I need to reread it.  I am sitting here wanting booze while typing out all the reasons I do not want it.  So odd that these two thoughts are occurring at the same time.  It is so frustrating.  It is so overwhelming.  I look at folks here who have years of sobriety.  I do not even have 24 hours right now.  I have in the past, but not right now, but I am sober.  I am sober right now.  If I am sober now or I am still sober in 10 years I am still sober.  I am sober.  RIGHT.  NOW.  It is soooooooo daunting to think of doing ALL of the early sobriety stuff again: the emotions, the fear, the anxiety, the self-loathing...BLAH!  The thing is, I know that even WHEN I am drinking I am anxious about drinking.  I know I will have too much and that even THEN, in the moment, I am aware that the alcohol is not giving me the feelings that I really want, or that the sensations are only temporary and nothing else is ACTUALLY different.  It is the parts of my life that are within my control that are really what I need to be active with.  Not drinking.  Drinking does not control anything that is in my power.  That small circle of what I can control includes my body and that is what I use when I drink.  I control my hands and my mouth.  So I can stop this.  I know how  good sobriety feels and how proud of myself I am when I do not drink.  I want to feel like even Day One is a big deal.  I want it to be.  I am sober right now.  I plan to go to sleep sober tonight.  I want to drink.  I do, but I want to be happy with my life even more.  I am never proud of myself when I drink.  I usually feel bad about drinking the next day, but I never feel bad about NOT drinking.  Sorry for the long post, and frankly to get through today I might end up post a bunch more times just to make it through.

Every time I quit, I get a week or so in and start hating my body. The inner voice in my head says ""yay now you can start losing that beer gut"" or ""why do you drink when you're so self conscious about your weight?"". Weight loss isn't my main reason to quit but it does play a part of it .

I am trying to work on being body positive. I am body positive with my friends and most of the time with myself (esp when I'm drinking). It's only in the light of sobriety do I start to look at my body in the long mirror and think now is the time to get fit - start running, eating better, researching empty calories and nutritional advice.

In a strange way it makes me feel better to google ""does quitting alcohol help you lose weight"" as some sort of motivation to keep going or remind myself that there's other reasons for sobriety. But when I get over that blip of fitness inspiration, I go right back to thinking there's no point. i'll always hate the way i look.

Do any of you have tips for staying motivated in other ways? Is there a way that weight loss can play a positive roll without creating unhealthy thoughts?

I've been moderating/abstaining from alcohol with a fair amount of success, and, true to form, found that the quality of my life improved. I was facetiming last night, and decided to get a bottle of white wine that me and her used to drink together to celebrate the occasion.  


Well, the medication I'm on and my lack of tolerance (I'm 5'7 and about 125 pounds) made sure I made an absolute fool of myself. You would have thought I had downed a bottle of everclear. I was walking and talking through the neighborhood and was literally unable to stand at some points, lying down in the asphalt, worrying the girl so much on her birthday. There was no disaster, no big fight or horrible words, no police, nothing broken, etc etc., but still it's beyond humiliating to be seen like this and it hurts to know the worry I caused her. I sobered up relatively quickly and was able to return home without incident, and, since the quantity of wine wasn't particularly gargantuan (and the fact that I'm 23), was spared most of the hangover symptoms save guilt and anxiety.

So I quit drinking about two weeks ago (Cold Turkey) going from about 2-4 25oz beers a day to zero. Over the course of 2-3 years

Anyways, so the first day I quit I obviously felt like absolute crap hungover etc. It wasn't until I'd say a day or two later my chest was tight (Has been now since then). It doesn't hurt, but I do feel myself taking in deeper breathes more consciously. I wouldn't say breathless because I can walk up and down the stairs in my house and stuff. Carry out normal day to day stuff. My heart hasn't been racing, or irregular (Minus some anxiety stuff, which I do take meds for)

I thought maybe I had the Corona virus, but I still haven't developed a fever etc and this definitely feels different than any cold/chest cold I've ever had.

\*I do have a ""Virtual"" appointment with my doctor tomorrow, given this whole COVID stuff.

I appreciate any advice if anyone has experienced anything similar at the two week point.Thank you!",4

A few months ago I couldn't imagine thinking this way, but the lack of social activities and monotonic life in general is really starting to weigh on me.

One of my main reasons to drink was to make my boring life seem less boring. When I got sober, I started doing more activities and made my life more interesting, so the temptations to drink decreased. But now that dancing class, gym, band practice are all cancelled, I mainly play video games and browse the internet. I should have been cutting down on those, but my usage has completely exploded.

Another help for me which fell away was that I lived alone and not have any booze in the house. For the lockdown, I moved back in with my parents to avoid being alone for all this time. Since I live in their house, I don't want to ask them to get rid of their booze. (also still seems a little too dramatic at this point). The issue isn't the actual easy access to booze, rather, it's the idea in my head that it would be effortless to get a drink which eats away at me.

My impression is that I still have at least a week from budging, and I definitely want to keep postponing that moment indefinitely. That doesn't take away that I do recognize that my raw willpower is limited. *Expletive* The whole idea of daily or weekly postponing, instead of a simple ""no"", wasn't even on my mind a month ago.

The stupid part is that I consciously know the solution: find new activities which I can do in this situation. I already had trouble doing that, as the ""wake up → computer → sleep""-cycle makes everything else seem boring, but it's even harder now that there are no planned things in my life.",8

My husband and I were chatting with a good buddy of ours over speakerphone whom we haven’t seen since before social distancing was enacted, while they gamed and I reorganized my bookshelf. It was a really pleasant afternoon. I wasn’t craving a beer, and everyone close to me has long since gotten used to me not drinking, so neither of them even suggested I have one even though they were both drinking the same ones (in an effort to make it seem more like normal life where we’d get together and they’d naturally be drinking the same kind).  But suddenly I just felt like why not? I’d been wanting one off and on in a weird way for weeks, but had refrained bc whenever I reminded myself of all the reasons I’d stopped it sounded unappealing. 

But yesterday, perhaps bc of pandemic related stress, or perhaps bc everyday is starting to feel a little more separated from reality I just decided to have one. It ended up being two, bc true to form, I’ve long known that I’m not the type of drinker that can stop at one.

It was enjoyable for maybe 30 minutes. After that I was just kidding myself. My body, detoxed from booze completely after over four sober months, was not happy. I became ultra flushed, sweaty, and diuretic like I can’t remember ever being before. After the second beer I felt bloated, tired, mildly nauseous, and agitated. I took a shower and passed out at 8pm before I could remember to brush my teeth. I slept horribly and then woke at 3am and listened to podcasts until it no longer felt too early to get out of bed. What’s kind of scary is that I know if I hadn’t actually passed out I probably would have had a third for reasons I can’t explain. Now I have brain fog and the thought of indulging once more feels comical.

I don’t regret breaking my sober streak. I’m glad I was able to get through several months first though so that I could really experience how much better total abstinence from alcohol is. If I’d only gone a month or so I don’t know that I’d feel this revelatory or confident in my decision.  

I’ll have my badge reset if others in this community feel I should to adhere to rules, but honestly this feels like it was a necessary step in my sobriety. Like my Rumspringa from sobriety. I’ve seen the light! I see the sober life is the life for me! I’m also curious to hear about other similar experiences.

Here’s a tip that has helped me stay sober in times of temptation.,"Hey guys and gals, just wanted to share a tip that hopefully will help you as much as it has helped me, especially during those times when we are tempted to give in and drink. 

During the early days of sobriety, it’s easy to remember the “why” of the decision not to drink, even if it’s hard not to give in. But after a time, things change. 

It’s all too easy to get complacent after a few days/weeks/ months of not drinking and sort of forget the things that motivated me not to drink, and those moments of complacency are the dangerous ones that often lead to thoughts like “I can have just one, right?” 

In my “quit that” app, there is a section for writing notes. In this section, I have written all the reasons that Inspired me to quit in detail. Everything from the simple reasons like feeling better and not being hungover, to the painful reasons like things that I have said and done while drunk/drinking that horrify me. And everything in between. For the more horrible and painful examples, I wrote the events and feelings out in excruciating, specific detail. I’ll continue to add to this list of reasons and details  as I remember them or think of new ones. 
Whenever I feel tempted to drink again, I just open my app and read my own words to remind myself why I started my sober journey. It helps me remember. 
The more specific and personal the examples, the stronger they help me become in my motivations to stay sober. 
This has literally helped me walk away from the liquor aisles in the store on multiple occasions.

If you have any other tips that have helped you with any aspect of your own journey, especially uncommon ideas, I’d love to hear them!

I will not drink with you today!",7

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week whichhave touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

I have missed my AoK commitment for several weeks, without bothering to get a replacement. I'm fine, I was just indulging in some bad habits of isolating and ignoring responsibilities. Old habits have a way of cropping up, even in sobriety. I apologize to the group for that, and I'm working on adjusting my attitude towards my commitments to other people so I don't continue that behavior in the future. It's not okay for me to take on a commitment like that and not follow through. I will be mindful of how I'm affecting the group in the future.

So, my AoK this week was a little hard to think of. I'm in a location that is currently under ""shelter in place"" orders due to covid-19, and I'm not interacting with people like I normally do. My AoK was dropping off a thermometer for a friend who was sick and leaving it on his front steps as we talked from a good distance away. 

I'm also incredibly grateful for all of the people I know who have reached out to text and call me. I like to isolate and separate myself from the herd under normal circumstances, and I'm so grateful for the people who don't let me do that and pull me back in. My life depends on connecting with people. My alcoholism thrived in my isolation. I need to connect, *especially* when I don't want to.

Thank you all for being here, I can't do this alone.

1. Cravings and celebrations are not the same thing - what this means, is that I think about drinking because of celebrating a milestone, like ""screw it"" and I haven't. It took me a bit to realize it was not a craving. Repeat. It's not a craving. It's a mental milestone that you feel like celebrating. BIG DIFFERENCE> Don't give in
2. No panic attacks. Can't talk about this enough, it's legitimately my favorite thing behind the normal health benefits and losing weight/energy levels going up
3. It gets SO much easier as time goes on but you are not out of the woods. Stay safe from your triggers if it bothers you, cut people out of your life if you have to, find another coping mechanism, seek therapy - Do what you got to do once you made this decision, it's all worth it.

I should start by saying that I didn't have any single incident that prompted me to quit drinking, just got tired of feeling sick and tired. However I have had one of the best years of my life this last year. I went from being a constantly hungover worker who generally just wanted to be left alone to pretty much the same but not hungover! My life revolved around just waiting until 8:00 every evening to start drinking. That was pretty much it. That was about all I looked forward to. I used to love fishing. I hadn't actually gone in years. In the last year I have been numerous times. I went from being single to meeting a fantastic woman whom I am now considering asking to marry me. I am now getting much closer to paying down my credit card debt that was just getting the minimums paid every month because I couldn't sacrifice booze money. 

 I don't really have anyone else to get excited for me because most of the people I used to drink with I don't really have anything in common with anymore and the people I hang around now didn't know me when I was pounding booze.

Since I stopped drinking my life has done a complete 360. I was homeless , drunk every day and basically hanging on by a thread. I hated myself for being drunk all the time so I drank to try and make myself feel better. The guilt, disgust and regret was horrendous, it made me want to die rather than deal with feeling that way.

Now I have a beautiful home, 2 beautiful dogs a great job and a family that respects me and knows they can depend on me. And I took it for granted. I forgot all about how shit life was and I wanted to press that self destruct button that has always been there in the background waiting. There was no real good reason for it but I made the decision on Friday I would have a glass of wine with my SO and his brother, it had been a rough day so that was reason enough. I don't even think my glass was finished before I was at the supermarket buying 2 crates of beer, vodka and wine. You can see where this is headed right? Fast forward to Sunday and we have spent 2 days drinking and taking cocaine. For the first time since Ive had them my dogs haven't been out for a walk, my house stinks of booze and cigarettes, there's shit all over the place. I look and feel like complete trash and straight back to feeling regret and disgust with myself. Its a beautiful day outside but I can't face going out so instead Im in bed feeling so bad that taking a bunch of pills to make it all go away seems like a reasonable idea. I forgot about all of this, I thought it wouldn't be as bad as it was but it is.

If you are struggling and there's even a little part of you thinking that today would be a good time to have a drink, I beg you not to do it. It isn't worth feeling like this. Stay sober and stay proud of yourself, you will never regret doing that I swear.

For the last three weeks, up until two days ago, I've been drinking fairly heavily each night. Prior to that I spent 5 or 6 years never going more than a day or three without drinking. Rarely heavily, but constantly.

I just broke up with my girlfriend a month ago and moved back to my home country from hers. I changed my whole project in life, and ended up in my small home town for this global crisis after spending 4 years abroad. I would really love to be just about anywhere else, doing anything to progress my life towards something meaningful to me. 

For the moment I'm substituting drinking with sleep deprivation and coffee. In a very thick book a very intellectually intense man once said that just about anything can be used in excess as a means of escape. Do you folks agree?

I stopped myself from drinking for a bit at least.

Thus far in my life, it's never been the cutest look, and while I told myself I was doing it to be less awkward in social situations, it almost always turned out that I made it awkward (for everyone else - I was too drunk and numb to notice).

It was the norm in the college fraternity I was in, we all grew up from similar backgrounds and were full of degenerate wealthy kids. Out of everything I did in that life, including promiscuous sex, anabolic steroids, a street drug here and there (although it wasn't very often for me), etc. alcohol was the single most damaging thing I ever got into. I never got to the point of full blown alcoholism where I went through severe withdrawal, but my body and mind are still so out of balance sometimes after a month of laying off of it. It's a horrible cycle. I miss it yet I hated what it turned me into, an absolute asshole bully and dangerous actions. I hate that I used it for boredom when my drinking hit it's peak and I went through a 2 week span of being extremely scared of what I was doing to myself. Still to this day, I have trouble sleeping and I literally woke out of bed in a panic attack an hour ago. 

&#x200B;

Something that was so fun became way too big a part of my life. While many of the actions I took in that time were immature and ridiculous and dangerous, alcohol did the most harm by far and I hate that I can no longer watch people around my age enjoy their drinking with no fear, because I wish I could go back to just enjoying it and finding more balance, having fun with it and not being such an idiot with it. If I even sip on one beer I feel like I'm doing something terrible. Is it going to be possible for me to every enjoy it again? I'm only 24 and I'm a very extroverted person, but the fun has escaped me and it tears me up inside leaving me depressed, anxious, and scared. Are all of these feelings still just early stage sobriety and my body and mind finding balance? I am so lost. Thank you everyone for your responses, I really appreciate it!",12

It's back in my mind all the time when I'm doing or thinking about something since I quit drinking. Some days I'm able to distract myself but on other days it's driving me insane.

Another problem I have is that I'm unable to do simple important things because the slightest stress will trigger some sort of anxiety and mental obsession. Sometimes I'll catch my mind thinking about alcohol to escape this anxiety and weird empty feeling. When this happens I feel the need to hide in my bed or force myself to sleep and I'm sick of it.

I'm starting to wonder if my remaining problems are even alcohol related at all... Can anyone relate to my problems at all and reassure me that it's going go to away? I'm not sure if my problems fit the symptoms of the post acute withdrawal syndrome. Thank you.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to \[[r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent**.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in \[[r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at \[[r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I have never been a daily drinker, just bingeing when I did drink. Last drink was a little over 24 hours ago for reference.

Anyway, I woke up feeling okay but as time went by I started getting weird chilly/hot sensations and that made me panic, which shot my heart rate up and caused me to shake/hyperventilate. I have been eating (not much but it's all stayed down, I have no nausea and can keep water down too, but I'm rapidly peeing it out. My body temp has remained consistent even though I feel like I'm burning up and cold at the same time.

It's 4 in the morning and I want to go to sleep but I feel worse when I lay down and I absolutely do not want to go to the ER right now. I just took some Benadryl to see if it helps. I've read too much on the withdrawal stuff and now I'm terrified I'm going to die or something. I'm thinking about calling my doctor as soon as the office opens as they can usually get me in same day. What should I do?

I have a really bad habit of blacking out and acting a fool, usually nothing too terrible that my friends have disowned me but it's pushed some people away and resulted in financial losses and some unfortunate run-ins with the law and other unideal things. 

After some amateur googling and talking to people, my guess is the blackouts are likely to be the results of a mixture of things from possible genetic predisposition, having a smaller physical frame (5' 10"", 160ish), not eating/drinking water before/during drinking sessions, attempting to keep up with people or drinking in a ""challenge mode"" aka nihilistically, etc. 

While I've held down some 25ish day sober stretches and gotten better about not buying my own booze or hanging with people that drink to drink, I've wondered if you guys consider it to be a broken streak if you literally do take just the fabled one shot and it doesn't go further than that. I did that the other day and am wondering if I should consider my streak broken and think like that going forward.

Hi, I'd really appreciate some insights on my situation, and sorry if my english is subpar.

Last week, my girlfriend told me she was worried about my alcohol use. In the last 3-4 months, I've had a rough time, college decided to kick me out despite proving good grades like they asked last semester, ended up losing my student job and my laptop was accidentally destroyed, which contained a lifetime project. I slowly fell in a pattern of drinking maybe 4-6 days a week to help me calm down my anxiety and sleep easier. Of course, as I felt better in the last weeks, I didn't lose this bad habit as I was used to it.

My girlfriend confronted me about this and I immediately told her I'd stop from now on. So for the last 7 days, I stopped drinking, and suffered through a mild withdrawal, feeling better every day. However, to help me cope with the withdrawal, I chose to chat and game with friends. They all are drinking most nights due to the quarantine, and it's slowly making me crave beer more and more every night. The thing is I use these games and chats to think about anything else than alcohol. I don't want to tell my friends, because I fear they will change how they act around me and how they see me.

So now for my question : More and more I feel like I'm growing more anxious to be exposed to the envy of having a beer, and I'd like to try to drink more casually, but this worries my girlfriend, who fears I might relapse. I don't want to isolate from my friends, since it's the only thing that helps me power through this, but I feel like I just quit drinking coffee, and every day I'm being shoved coffees in my face more and more and it's increasingly difficult. I intend to eventually drink beer casually like I used to and I think I have the willpower, but I thought quarantine was going to be helping me quit alcohol for a while, like a month, and I'm concerned with the fact that my main solution of gaming and chatting is exposing me a lot more to drinking than my social activities. before the quarantine.

Am I crazy to think I should tamper gradually with my withdrawal? I quit alcohol because I couldn't quit on my own bad habits and my girlfriend noticed me of it, so I fear my judgement might be clouded, I'd appreciate some insight.

Thanks",1

She supported me getting sober without judgment, but always told me how proud she was that I was doing it, and that it made a difference. 
And now this Easter, I’m trying to hold it all together still. Through everything, today is the first time it’s been close to losing my control. Just wanted to give up, grab a bottle of Percocet (don’t have any here but I know who to call), a bottle of Jim beam and just stop feeling for a bit. 
I go between being ok, and wanting to shut everything off, and if it’s for good this time, I’m oddly ok with that.

It has been a pretty fast 3 weeks. I haven't been able to check my blood pressure but i'm 100% sure i am off the 145+ scale of the hypertension that the CVS unit kept telling me. I'm alot less flushed in the face. Loss of water weight, and my organs are less swollen. I had a torso like santa and its probably gone down 50% but the beer gut will remain for some time. Cravings for sweets, especially sour gummies are sky high and pop, there is something called jarritos - grapefruit flavor its off the charts!!! try it if you haven't and thank me later.

 I have the memory of a gold fish, and my brain probably looks like swiss cheese because my memory is shot! i can hardly remember little things, which is frightening and gets me upset. I might put that down to my concussions, and possible traumatic brain injury. I'm just not sure of anything at this point.  I have distant memories coming back in waves that flood me with a euphoric, sad, happy. The beauty of my past and everything good and bad, i don't think i would change it for the world. Reminiscent thoughts are beautiful. I had some dreams of family members i haven't thought about it 10+years. 

All in all, i visit here often and read and notice we all have such similar stories, if not identical.

so, i started drinking on and off around 19. i had just dropped out of college after weeks of depression followed by a traumatic incident so my headspace was pretty grim. i used to drink a lot of hard liquor but stopped about a year ago. since then i’ve been in therapy but continued to regularly self-medicate..

i’m now 25 and have been drinking a bottle of wine almost every night. i’m now (soon to be 2 years) married and i know my spouse worries about my health (especially considering i also smoke...working on that).

well since the covid-19 outbreak my job has been stressing me out so much more, recently i went through 6 bottles in just over 3 days. with the money i spend on alcohol being compromised by cut hours at work, combined with wanting to be better for my spouse and just being pretty...disappointed in myself, i’ve decided to take the initiative to try and stop.

this is my second night without any alcohol and i just want to ask...what can i expect from here on? i’m worried i might experience some dangerous withdrawal symptoms that i hear about (not asking for medical advice just wanted to mention the anxiety!! i’m feeling okay right now—a little nervous but i am generally an anxious person) and i’m really not sure what to expect...but mostly i just want some general advice i guess? what do you all do to occupy yourselves? i play video games on the regular but i was thinking i could dabble with other things, like puzzles or something.

I still think about drinking nearly every day but through some resources and techniques, I've been able to stay sober (support group, physical activity, meditation, etc.)

However, during this pandemic, my wife has been getting FaceTime calls from friends who are drinking. I'm an Android guy but the missus is in the Apple ecosystem. When the call drops in, it's on speaker and quite loud. 

The friends are often tipsy from wine, beer, mixed drinks and so on and more than willing to immediately tell her what they're drinking. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised as I've seen since statistics that say alcohol sales are up over 200% since COVID-19. 

BUT I find it unpleasant to listen to and often leave the room or put in my ear buds and play music. It irritates me and also makes me somewhat jealous because I can't do the same to numb out during this difficult time. 

The difference is that these people are not ordinarily problem drinkers like I am so I have to look at it in that context but it just sucks. 

To be clear - I'm not going to drink because of this. I'm just letting out some frustration. Anyone else have a similar experience?

I feel weird sharing this here because at the moment I don't feel at risk of relapsing. Don't get me wrong, I would LOVE to drink right now. But I know if I were to drink I would probably drink myself to death and I definitely don't want that.  At the same time I'm finding it hard to find anything else I do want to do, while also feeling like I have the emotional navigation skills of a fourteen-year-old girl and wishing I knew how to cope better or at all.  Smh.

As this awful virus is spreading in LA county, with at least 20 people dying every day. I've decided that I might need my lungs, just in case. So the thought of quitting smoking has come up in my mind. And just like when I was quitting alcohol, I'm getting the same stupid thoughts: ""Maybe I should wait, until I've quit alcohol for good. One addiction at a time, maybe?"" 

I've ordered a Blu vape cartridges to ween off from going on the balcony or going outside for a ""walk"". But wasn't sure when they'd get mailed to me. So with only 3 cigarettes left in my pack, I immediately thought: ""I should just get another pack, just in case, the vape juice doesn't get here on time."" 

The vape got here yesterday, and I was able to just have that one cigarette before I checked mail. Didn't smoke the rest of the day. But today I woke up, feeling great thanks to no booze. But I immediately thought to myself: ""It's noon, I usually have my cigarette about now"" even though my vape is within reach. And of course after using the eCig, my brain makes up bullshit stories like ""Oh I miss the flavor, the feeling of smoke in my throat"", ""it's something lit in my hand that I like."" Even though after lighting up, I smell like shit and my breath smells of death.

I'm realizing that my addiction to alcohol is borderline identical to my addiction to cigarettes. Just on a shorter, smaller scale. But the pattern is there.

It's amazing how prolonged use of something shapes the way you think. So now I understand why I couldn't quit booze in one day. And using ""one day at a time"" logic is how I am sober for almost two months.",5

I have had a binge drinking problem for at least a decade but quitting felt impossible given my lifestyle so I was just ""doing an extended dry January"" that continued into February and March.

I wasn't even tempted to drink for the first few weeks of quarantine because I have always hated drinking alone and I only had one bottle of wine at home, which would get me kinda tipsy but not enough for it to really be fun. My friends kept saying they couldn't believe I could stand quarantine without drinking but I was honestly perfectly content until yesterday. After 5 weeks alone in my apartment I said ""fuck it"" and drank half the bottle. My tolerance seems to be gone by now so I actually did get fairly drunk. It was fun and silly for about an hour while I was video chatting my family for Passover and then I just felt annoyingly slow, stupid, and drowsy for the rest of the night...until I tried to go to sleep, at which point my heart started pounding and I sat in bed awake until 3am. Woke up restless at 8am and have been awake ever since.

I'm not exactly hungover but I feel like I've been lobotomized - I can't even focus enough to watch tv. My stomach has that familiar unsettled feeling that used to be a daily occurrence but that I'd forgotten about after being sober for so long. I feel vaguely ill and dehydrated in a way that's hard to describe but has only ever happened to me after drinking. I can't believe I used to feel 100x this bad *every* *single* *weekend* *day* and some weekdays at work. I can't believe I used to have to take Xanax for every hangover because without it I was too anxious and nauseated to even drink a cup of coffee.

I'm disappointed that I broke my streak but I'm also glad I drank because I didn't enjoy it at all. It took away that sense of anticipation and excitement I was holding on to for when I'd be able to drink again. Until yesterday I'd told myself that I would celebrate the end of quarantine by going out and getting drunk with my friends (visions of white wine and sunset over the Manhattan skyline at a rooftop bar in June ughhhhhh), but now I realize how much more alive I feel when I'm sober.

I want to be able to go to happy hour with my friends, or drink at celebrations, or just kick back and have a few. But I. Can. Not. And one of the hardest things to get over is how unfair it is. “It’s not fair that *they* don’t have a problem and I do. It’s not fair that *they* can drink whenever they want and I can’t”. And the hardest part of “not fair” is that there’s really no solid answer as to why. Whenever I explain this to someone, all they can tell me is “life’s not fair”. And they’re right, but I’m a logical person who wants a direct way to fix something and that answer doesn’t provide one. I want to be better and I don’t want to drink, but at the same time sometimes I just want my brain to relax. I have yet to find a way to do that, but I’m still trying. And I’m always trying. It’s a daily struggle and sometimes we make mistakes, but all we can really do is accept those mistakes and try to find a way to prevent them in the future.

I've gotten sober before and later relapsed, a couple of times. None of this is any sort of hard and fast set of rules, it's just based on my own experience and what I've observed in others. I'm sure that there are other things that could also be added, and I'd love to hear about them. I am not an expert, and my life depends on continuing to learn about my recovery and continuing to stay active in it and vigilant about the possibility of relapse.

In my experience, relapse doesn't start with thinking about drinking. By the time I'm thinking about drinking, I've been on the road to relapse for a while. Relapse, for me, starts with stopping doing what has so far worked to help me get and stay sober. I become unwilling to do the things that worked. I have been doing that recently, when I stopped posting and commenting on here, and I stopped being as active in my AA activities.

That is part of why I need more than an online support network to stay sober. It's a lot harder to walk away from real life relationships and real life commitments than it is to just not log onto a website. People do, of course, stop participating in AA all the time, nobody's forced to be there, but I have relationships with people who care about me. I go to meetings regularly where I know that I am accepted and loved, and I care about the other people there. People care about me here, too, it's just that this format makes it easier for me to ignore that.

So, no longer doing what works is a big red flag. That's why I'm back, and that's why I'm talking about it, to make it real to myself and to others, so I can't pretend that everything's totally fine and everything that I do is totally great. I sometimes get off the path. I sometimes make mistakes. I need to recognize that and acknowledge it in order to get back on the path, where I am safe.

Isolating is another big red flag. Being alone all of the time with my thoughts and feelings, keeping things to myself, not connecting with others in meaningful ways, feeling isolated from others even when I'm with them, that's all another huge red flag. My drinking thrived in isolation. No one knew quite how much I was drinking, and no one had *any* clue what was going on with me inside. It was that hidden internal state which made drinking so appealing. When I isolate, I create the conditions where drinking makes sense. I get stuck in my own distorted thinking, and I lose forms of support which make life without alcohol possible for me.

Drinking was my solution. It was how I dealt with being alive in the world. If I stop doing what works, sooner or later, it goes back to seeming like a solution again.

In AA we talk about drinking problems having two parts. There's the physical reaction to alcohol. In AA it's conceptualized as an allergy of the body. I respond to alcohol differently than normal drinkers do. When I start drinking, all of my good intentions to drink moderately go out of the window, and I want more. Period. When my brain is primed for alcohol like that, it keeps wanting more, for quite a while, even after the alcohol has left my system. That's why I want to drink more the next day.

The brains of people with AUD (Alcohol Use Disorder) have been permanently altered by drinking. There are neural pathways now permanently wired into my brain which affect the production of neurotransmitters and how sensitive I am to them and how they are transported and used. As part of this, my built-in reward system gets hijacked. 

As soon as I pick up a drink again, *even after an extended period of sobriety*, those pathways are activated and my addiction is back in control. My reward system tells me that alcohol is the only thing that feels good because alcohol once again literally becomes the only thing releasing enough dopamine to make me feel good. My neurotransmitters are now all out of whack again, and the only way to *immediately* get relief from the depression and anxiety caused by my drinking is more alcohol.

But that's the process which keeps me hooked in the relapse once I relapse. My decision to pick up that first drink happens *before* I have that physical reaction which overrides my conscious thoughts and compells me to keep drinking. That's the second part of my drinking problem, my mental obsession. 

I have a persistent mental obsession that drinking is my solution to how I feel, and the problem of being alive in the world in general. I don't sit around and obsess about alcohol in the sense of sitting around thinking about cocktails and various forms of booze all day. My obsession comes in the form of sitting around obsessively thinking about how trapped I am in a terrible life and how bad I feel and how I can't face *any* of this worthless, mundane shit that all of you sheeple are forcing on me, and how seriously *no one* could understand what it's like being me, but I know a way out. I know something that will give me some relief, even if it's only momentary. *That's* what the mental obsession looks like for me.

In order for me to stay sober, I have to be comfortable living in the world, *as it is*, sober. The world does not have to change for me to be sober, I have to get comfortable in the world. That is not my default state. That was not my default state before I first picked up alcohol or any other drugs. After I started drinking, I kept drinking because alcohol *worked*. I'm not dumb, I wouldn't have kept going if it was just hangovers and pain. Alcohol worked to give me relief from how I felt sober, in a way that nothing else did, not antidepressants, not love, not activities I loved, nothing.

So a BIG warning sign of a relapse for me is a sense that I can't live my life, that the world is not a comfortable place for me, and that I am both unable to deal with what life has unjustly thrown at me, and that I need to control circumstances around me in order to feel good. 

I develop a victim mentality and focus on what other people have done to me and how my life is hard. I stop being willing to see solutions, ask for help, try new things, or to see how I have contributed to the situations that I'm in which cause me pain. I build an airtight case for why I'm entitled to a drink, basically, and when I *do* share any of this with others, I'm completely unwilling to accept support, listen to alternate ways of looking at situations, or hear other solutions that people offer me. My solution is alcohol, and I need my problems that can't be fixed in order to justify turning to my solution.

This is the part where I'm just ramping up to drink, basically. I'm creating my justification for drinking. Another way to do this is to become hyper-controlling of other people and situations which are really not in my control. If I have expectations of myself, other people, and my world which are rigid and specific and can't be met, then when I burn myself into the ground and create havoc trying to *make* them happen, I have a justification for giving up on everything and taking a drink. Again, it's a different way of creating a situation where a drink ""makes sense,"" and heaven help anyone who tries to get in the way of it. I don't want *your* solutions, I want *my* solution, and my solution is, of course, taking a drink.

A lot of my recovery work is about dealing with these patterns of thinking and behavior and just being in the world. That's pretty much what AA is about, breaking up these patterns and changing them. On my own I tend to go down various rabbit holes and get stuck. I find it very grounding to listen to other people who know what it's like on the inside of my head, because they've got their own version of that same head. I listen to them, I hear what worked for them, and I try it out. 

Plus it's nice to have people who I can call and be like, ""I feel fucking crazy and I want to murder somebody and I'm not even sure who, plus my life is a total mess,"" and they go, ""Oh I get it."" And you know that that do. Which is also why I love being here, I can hear what works from all of you, and I know that you get it.

Peace and love, sobernauts. Stay safe.

Time has lost all meaning. I worked Thursday 4 am shift and Friday night shift while moving boxes, furniture, equipment and animals from our old rental property to our new rental property. We were told that our lease was up and he wasn't going to renew it because a farmhand who is going to work for him is moving in. After chatting with a few neighbours I found out that this is his MO. He fills the place when he can't get an employee, then as soon as he gets one lined up he kicks the old renters out. Totally legal of course because the Landlord and Tenants act is biased towards the Landlord.

Yesterday we did 5 trips.  While I packed my Fiancee cleaned. She woke up feeling kinda crook this morning so I might end up finishing the moving and cleaning myself. And to cap it all off, our shit heel of a landlord told us yesterday he wants to show the house to the new family moving in. I can't wait to be out of there and moved into our new home. It is a log cabin on a farm with a lovely old lady who lives just down the lane. We have lots of privacy and I will be working with her to help run the place as she needs someone who can lift more than 20lbs haha.

But even among all this chaos and lack of sleep, I feel like I can stand against my urges to drink and smoke. I wake up every morning and am thankful I haven't had a drink to make getting out of bed harder. My mind clears quickly and my anxiety stays mostly in check.

Thank you all for your support over the last few weeks. You have helped me make a really positive change in my life and helped me deal with some serious stress. Love you all.

2020-04-12 10:26:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fzxmhk/i_feel_so_broken/,I feel so broken.,"This is going to be a “puke” post but I just need to put this out there because I am in SO much pain right now and have no one else to talk to. I’ll try to keep this as concise as possible. 
Firstly my badge is wrong. I didn’t drink from July of 2018 to July of 2019. Since then I’ve had several iterations of the same story: successfully return to social drinking for a time (maybe a few weeks) and think I’ve found the “sweet spot.” No cravings, no need to drink, but enjoy having a few from time to time. After some time, I’ll gradually start drinking at home again, and eventually the bewitching hour starts kicking up every afternoon. Sometimes I overcome it, sometimes I don’t. When I don’t, sometimes I control it and have just a few glasses of wine, without much guilt the next day, sometimes I drink more than I intended and feel a little guilty, and ultimately I end up here: waking up after a night when I promised myself I wouldn’t drink the day before but did. Overwhelmed with guilt, pain and hopelessness that I will never break this cycle, and the conflicting fear that I cannot fully embrace a life without alcohol for good.
The pain of breaking a promise to myself, the pain of wondering if I’ll learn a lesson that I thought I’d learned a million times before, the pain of knowing that I won’t be in pain in a few days (or even later today) and that moderation will tempt me again, the pain of knowing that the only thing that can ease my pain today is the very thing that caused it. 
To be clear: the single biggest problem that alcohol has caused me is personal grief and shame. While there have been incidents of alcohol (usually combined with ambien) induced arguments, confrontations, etc., the cumulative effect of the shame that I can’t get a grip on this is the biggest source of damage from my drinking. And because I am the only getting hurt here, I seem to think that makes it ok to keep doing this. 
I don’t know where to go from here. So many parts of me want to just quit for good forever, but just as many parts of my believe that there is a “third door”, a sweet spot or happy medium, and that a life free of alcohol in not the ideal life for me. 
Thank you for listening. I just needed to get this off my chest and my husband has no idea that anything is amiss, and I don’t want to drag him into this, so you’re all I’ve got.
I wish i could close by saying IWNDWYT, but I can’t make any commitments today because I can’t risk the pain that breaking it may cause.",15

When I got sober, I was actually kind of terrified to leave the house. I felt there was some siren song that alcohol sang and the only was to avoid it was to not hear it. I mean alcohol is everywhere! Because I knew I couldnt trust myself, I stayed home. I stayed home as much as possible. I found the problem with staying home is that its probably not healthy to sit around and do nothing, and its gets boring real quick.

After a few months in and I accepted this as my new reality, I got kind of stir crazy. I still didnt want to go out and hang out with friends. Meeting up with friends ment they would be drinking and I would not be. At the time I was very uncomfortable with that dynamic. So I had to figure something else out. I had so so so so much free time.

I started riding my bike in the morning alot. I dabbled in yoga. I learned to bake bread. I became more adventurous in cooking. I taught myself to sew to tailor dress shirts. I started going on walks and hikes. I got some woodworking tools, and learned how to use them. I took up reading at night. I tried almost anything to fill up the day. 

Eventually I became alright with going out with friends and doing things sober. However, now four weeks into this quarentine and I feel like I was so prepared for this. I havent been bored at all. I could argue this has been the most productive ive ever been. I also dont think Ive ever celebarted my choices in early soberity. I was never proud of being selfish and sticking to myself that first year. I didnt do all those things I mentioned because I wanted to, I did it because I felt I had to do something, and anything was better than drinking. Today, I am so glad I did that. I'm glad I have something to do rather than sit there. Because of soberity my normal routine hasnt really changed at all, except even less people. All those things I learned are assets now. Even in quarentine I can still do all of them. Bike rides, making masks, baking bread, reading....
 
I know this is a tough time for almost everyone. I jusg wanted to look on the half full side of the glass, even though its quite obvious that it is half empty at the moment. 

Anyone else have interesting hobbies they picked up that they are utilizing?

My husband has decided to take a break from drinking, which I am very happy about, but he says he will drink again. I am not planning on ever drinking again. I hope I can have a good relationship with them if we are on different paths with drinking. His mom is one of those one glass of wine lasts all night people and then she’s done. His dad is a big vodka drinker. His sister was one of my favorite people to have drinks with. Over the years, It’s changed though, we all have young children, we relocated so we don’t see one another nearly as much. I know they won’t stop their lives for us, and I get that. I just don’t know what to do with this. It sucks. I guess what really gets me down is the fact that I can never just sit on the patio and drink with them like we’ve done before.

Basically it makes me feel like I have a mini hangover each day.

I've always drank more than was good for me, always. Since around the age of 13. I'm 47 now.

Over the years I've done 30 days dry a few times.

I noticed lately that I'm an arse when I drink, and that 1 was never enough. Becoming unhappy with my drinking habits I'd decided to call it quits for a while, but lacked the impetus to start.

I was talking with one of my other drinking buddies, also a heavy drinker, and eventually we decided to give up together, give moral support kind of thing.

So, at first it was easy. Really easy, I was enjoying waking up not worrying about who I was going to have to apologise to, being alert and ready for the day, and just feeling a lot healthier.

But, the last 2 weeks have been really hard. I think it's because I've realised that this is a forever thing, and for the first time in a while I feel like I REALLY NEED a drink.

Any idea how long this one will last for? My plan is that when I'm over this hurdle I'll give quitting smoking a go, but can't go into that while I feel this shit.

BTW, my wonderful supportive wife initially made sure not to drink around me. I have encouraged her to drink what she likes as I don't want to be ""that guy"". I don't think her drinking is getting to me, it's generally when she's not around that it hits hardest.

**EDIT**

Sorry it took so long, I was kind of avoiding replying, not exactly sure why, but there you go.

Thanks for your wonderful replies. It's given me a lot to think about, some very good advice. 

I've decided that the advice on taking it one day at a time is bang on, so that's what I'm doing. I've also thrown myself into a couple of larger than normal projects (tbh, I've decided to get stuff done that I've been putting off). 

I'm delaying the smoking quitting until I'm 6 months in, which seems like a lifetime away tbh, but, one day at a time.

I know. I know its unlikely to be a long term fix. However, im concerned with my current state of anxiety. I havent had much anxiety in the past, but recently i have had intense panic attacks and anxiety. 
I have woken up with a panic attack every morning for the past week followed by intense anxiety throughout the day accompanied with trembling. 
I still drink every night for the fear of going through withdrawals simultaneously (5yrs heavy consistent drinking at night)

I want to consider the option of medication to break the anxious cycle, but i know anti anxiety/depressants and alcohol is a fast track to death if not a guaranteed one.

My question is: Is there anyway i can be given medical supervision while my body detoxes from alcohol to then be able to consider the option of medication for the anxiety? And if so where do i go?

I am from Muslim community, and as you may know alcohol is forbidden for us. Recently it was found out my father drinks.

My mother came to know after her marriage, but was stuck with him because at that time she had my sister and tried working on it. It was usually she finds out, then he would stop ( at least that’s what she thought) time to time.

Well recently after my marriage his drinking habit became way too obvious, and me , my sister and mom confronted him multiple times (both in good and bad terms ) . 

He mentioned to me that this habit of his won’t affect us!

Well last month he came home, I asked him to tell the truth whether he drank ,but he relentlessly kept on lying , that day before confrontation I had written a suicide note (not that I ever was going to act on it - it just felt to write), I also let him know that this habit will affect us all and about the suicide note ( since I believe he cares about me the most and hearing from my perspective may change him)

Now he is retired and have founded a business that give home way too much money without doing anything.

—————
So last week he came home drunk , my and mom confronted him Yada yada... later police called us, apparently he has hit someone. The person died on the spot , now he is in jail for processing.

Question:

1: can you tell me from your perspective, if you didn’t think you were an addict and this situation occurs , what you will be thinking?

2. Do you think he will change due to this incident?

3. What shoul I and my family do to help him for his addiction?",2

There was a different wine at every course, and I drank then too. But again, my drinking was restrained throughout the evening.

So far these were isolated incidents, and they didn't result in my crashing headlong into drinking again. Perhaps that's because they were occasions when there simply was no non-alcoholic alternative. I drank. I didn't get wasted, and I consciously drank knowing that I wasn't going to start again.

But now I have started drinking again, and it's beginning to feel like the old drinking habit. I've started during this lockdown period, and I'm having one glass, but finding that that first glass goes down very easily, and I end up having three. I'm stopping at three, because it makes me feel unwell... but I know perfectly well that three will become four, will become five, and so on.

The world isn't better or safer when I'm sober. I still have plenty of weaknesses and challenges. But I really appreciate the clear-headedness, and sleeping better, and the ability to be just more competent, and more present.

I'm not naive. I know I'm not the only mentally ill person in the world, certainly not the only one on this subreddit. I know that plenty of people aren't as happy as they seem. I'm also not saying that my sobriety is more difficult than anybody else's; it's a fight for all of us.

I refund love in a woman that I had been with for 20 years. I found out that I have wonderful children.  That the rest of my family were good people. So were did I loss touch with the real and the delusional. Not sure, maybe 30+ years of drinking but mostly I was selfish and self serving. It was always about ME! This is something I found out when I did a investigation of my past. For the first time in my life I look at myself clearly without looking at the others. This last week was hard for I remember being basically homeless and realizing the I was right back at 18 yrs. old nothing changed. It was as if I blinked and the only thing was that there was a old guy staring at me In the mirror. I understood what a old man told me when I was 17. He ask me for some food because he could not give enough blood to eat and drink and he had to drink so he was begging for food. This was my truth three years ago. Today I’m free from this mindset.  I have started living a life that I couldn’t of dreamed of then. I have found out a lot about myself. I’ve been able to forgive and be forgiven. I seek life’s beautiful presence.

I don’t struggle as much as I use to. I don’t miss drinking or the moments spent recovering from it. But with the pandemic I have had a lot of time on my hands to reflect on this year. 
Since Covid hit, I have been laid off from my full time job and left to twiddle my thumbs and wait. Which got me to thinking. I have a great home, a small savings and a great partner. I will make it thru this pandemic in one piece. Than it hit me. Had this happened while I was drinking, I would have been completely broke from spending my work checks in one weekend at the bar. Over-drafting my checking account to pay my bills (and still get more beer) I would have been an anxious mess, at home getting black out drunk calling people I have no business talking to in the first place with no financial safety net. 
I am incredibly proud of what I have done within this year. I have turned my life around and finally put my foot down. Alcohol no longer defines me. I define me. I have control over my life, even in unprecedented times.

So I currently live alone. I’m considering finding a place with my friend so that we can save money. I’m 116 days sober, and it’s all so new for me still. Last night I came a little too close for comfort to the whole “just one beer” situation during Zoom happy hour (I was drinking tea). I’ve otherwise been very much okay with not drinking around people who are drinking. 

I don’t know if it’s because I’m already questioning having a roommate, but the friend drunk texted me tonight about how she bought some alcohol and is getting drunk, ending with “wow alcohol.” She knows about this journey of mine. In fact, I was talking to her yesterday and she reminded me how important it is for me to stay sober. Now, I’m worried about how she might behave if we live together, and not being respectful of my sobriety if she’s drinking. I wouldn’t be able to just mute her texts until I’m in a less vulnerable situation. 

Has anyone had roommates who drink a lot? Did it work out with staying sober? I feel horrible even making this post, because she’s of course a nice person and I would love to live with her otherwise. I guess I’m just looking for guidance on if this is feasible (and how) from others who might understand.",5

I thrived in the environment and dove head first into sobriety. However, my soon-to-be wife and I uprooted to a small town of 1k people in order for her to be closer with her folks who had moved to this town a few years prior. I maintained sobriety for a time, reaching a 1.5 years. I had attempted, be it not very well, to find meetings and a new sponsor in the area. Though, with it being such a small town, there weren't meetings that didn't require 45 minutes to 1.5 hour drive. Being that these meetings took place at 7-8pm on week nights, I found it easy to dismiss the idea of going to these meetings and instead chose to white knuckle it. I would occasionally call my old sponsor but I felt increasing shame not following through with the plan we drew up together for when I made the move. Still, I managed to white knuckle it for a good 7 months until I got my first tattoo. The artist was nice and we became quick friends. After he completed the work, he threw a shooter in my hand and downed his. Without really thinking (or maybe I was) I took the shot. And that was it. I felt my sobriety was ruined. Or so I felt that to be the case. I talked with my wife about it and she encouraged me, essentially saying it isn't a big deal and said its okay if I have one or two. Well, that's not what happened after that. I'm a binge drinker, if I have one, I'll have 13. It began to bother my wife how much I was drinking. It wasn't that I was driving drunk all time, making an ass of myself, or hurting others, it was my safety that concerned her. I chose to shrug that off. Eventually I managed to check off all the boxes that I had previously not been doing. I would do those things. Not often, but I would. It got to a point a where I chose to become sneakier--putting hard stuff in gatorade bottles, or taking pills without her knowing. What made it easier was I am apart of a golf league in a small town where a vast amount of members choose to drink copious amounts, so it was easy to blend in. But the sneakiness turned into tell tale predictable signs that my wife could spot, so I would wait for her to sleep so I could binge drink. Once she fell asleep I would pound down copious amounts of hard liquor while laying beside her in bed. I'd eventually pass out, sometimes pissing the bed. Regardless, I would wake up with a terrible hangover. Sometimes it was on weekend, other times I worked the next day. However, that sneaking around only worked for so long. Soon enough I'd run out of booze and want more. So I'd sneak out and go buy more. Eventually she'd wake up while I was coming back or gone. Obviously this resulted in her being incredibly worried about my health and our relationship. Still, it continues, I just found ways to be sneakier. During this time I would grow increasingly restless and begin to reach out to others via snap chat in order to receive some attention. This would result in flirting. Nothing ever came of it. But it left a heavy weight on my conscious, which likely fed my drinking. We recently moved to a new house in the same town (one we gutted and renovated ourselves which added lots of stress and fueled my drinking) just before the president placed in measures to combat covid 19. Neither of us have done well since then and it resulted in my wife writing me a letter addressing our issues. One where she did not point fingers, but instead opened dialogue. One of the issues was my drinking and she asked that I not drink until we may talk with a specialist about our views towards it. She doesn't really know about the sneakiness, but has caught me being up and about while drunk on a couple of occasions. Which scared her. Anyway, here I am, now sober since Monday when I read the letter, and I'm struggling. All I want to do is take the edge off. It's not worth it. It's never worth it. But I want it. And that scary. But I can't disappoint her. This feels like it's for all the marbles.",5

Pushing into new territory - my longest previous stint was 19 days last year.  I almost gave in on the 18th day this time, but instead I had 3 tonic with limes and 2 cigarettes, then went for a drive instead.

I don’t want to go back.  It has been an emotional roller coaster in ways.  Some great days, some really tough days.  Like some and unlike others, the quarantine has actually helped me a bit.  I am temporarily laid off, while at home with my 4 year old and the wife is WFH.  I still have my job (almost guaranteed promotion coming when things go back to normal).  

So, for me, getting out of the routine has actually helped me, I feel like.  Reconnecting with myself and spending quality time with the daughter, trying to get in outdoor activities, etc.  really, just reconnecting with everything beyond my previous routine of work and drinking for “fun” and “stress relief.”  God, it used to be fun...  I think.  Sure as hell hasn’t been for a long ass time though, and always causes more stress than it ever relieved. 

So, reconnecting is my theme for now.  Anyways, just happy to be at 21 days.  It feels good today.

It has been hard, but I feel like I'm taking all this upset and nervous energy and directing it to self-care. When I was growing up with my abusive dad, I felt isolated and trapped. That stress turned inward into self-harm and eventually drinking. Now I am trying to turn it inwards again, but by:

1) finally washing my face every day and working on my acne 

2) moisturizing my skin and getting in the habit of using sunscreen every day (even if I can't really go outside, it'll be a habit by the time I can) 

3) FLOSSING! I have always felt the DEEPEST shame about my teeth and gums. I have a grey tooth that I am so so so ashamed of. After a solid month of daily flossing, my gums are turning a lighter pink and the swelling is going down! I just bit the bullet and bought a tooth whitening pen so I can get my tooth to match the shade of my other teeth. I haven't been to a dentist in over 3 years because of the shame I feel about my oral hygiene, but now I feel like I can go to one when we're all allowed outside and feel better about having them help me fix my oral problems. (and actually find out WHY the tooth went grey).

None of this would be possible if I were still drinking daily. For months I didn't do any self care other than abstaining from alcohol and I was sitting there like ""where's my great skin?!?!?!"" and now I feel like I finally get it -- your shit gets better after drinking because you have the space and coordination to take better care of yourself. Like, I apparently still have to do minimum hygiene to not have acne.

I know it would be cold and delicious. I'd plan to only have 3 beers at the most, but would end up drinking them all. I would get drunk. Since I've been sober for a few months, and my tolerance is way down, more than likely I'd end up feeling sick. I would have 800 or more gut expanding calories that I really don't need. I'd go to bed dizzy, sleep like shit, and wake up with a hangover. I'd feel terrible all day. I'd feel guilty. Then for some reason I'd want to do it all over again even more than I do right now.

Only recently I’ve turned my understanding around completely and I now see that alcoholism has been taking from the life I wanted this entire time. From an outside perspective, it seems there is no reason for a lot of the troubles I’ve had in life. Relationships, roommates, jobs, you name it. I lost sight of what I was trying to accomplish because instead of accompanying me along the way, alcohol took over control. And I was left the victim, in a lot of ways of myself and my decisions.


So what is left? I can take accountability for what has been done already and move on. For today I can make a decision to not drink. And tomorrow I will see that I didn’t drink today and pledge to myself one more day. I know what can happen, I know all the negatives, I read this sub all the time in case I forget. I’m reminded of my own experiences with every word. 


In this way I can see progress, growth, I’m no longer repeating the same mistakes with a new flair or with a different person. I remember my goals and get to work. Alcohol is minimized to a distraction. I can see where it belongs now. That is how it tricked me, it made me think it was not only necessary in some way, but in a big way.

I had some strong urges - particularly if my partner drinks or if my chronic pain is severe - but I feel soooo much better! I had a cycle of MANY day ones. For folks in a similar boat - hang in there! Here are some things I personally am doing differently this time around that might be helpful for others.

The most important thing is being active on this sub. Previous attempts I have only come on here when I was in a horrible place. This time around I am being more active, and offering support to others. I thought because I didn’t have a long stretch of sobriety my support wasn’t valuable. But in my various attempts I’ve learned some strategies. Plus a kind word or simply saying IWNDWYT today can be helpful, and it helps me feel like I am doing something positive instead of wallowing.

I am allowing myself all the non alcohol drinks I want! I do keep an eye on sugar. But I LOVE Lagunitas Hop Water, and I found a mocktail cosmo that tastes like raspberry lemonade, and all the seltzer! This has been helpful for me, particularly the mocktail, if my partner drinks.

Some very kind person on here recommended Recovery Dharma which is similar to AA, but inspired by Buddhist principles. The philosophy is way more aligned with my personal views and I am so grateful for it! I haven’t been able to attend a meeting yet, but they have a free book on their site that I am reading through and it is very empowering.

Also a tip from my counselor is journaling. Particularly about the times I feel good! Inevitable down the road, I know I might try to convince myself one beer is okay. For me, moderation never works, and I feel soooo much better sober. Keeping a log of that to look back in is helping me stay on track.

Hope you all have a great weekend! I am very grateful for this community. IWNDWYT!",17

I went months without it and without any cravings, but this boredom of being home all day every day got to me. No more though, I am DONE.   


I started to re-read Steve-O's memoir A Professional Idiot, and it's really helping me focus on why I can't be drinking because I know what path it leads me down - I also brought my Addictions Workbook out and I started journaling again.   


I'm confident I can do this - I am pretty strong when I put my mind to it.   


Yesterday I think I had a small breakthrough when I was talking to my best friend. I realized just because I have all this free time at home, it doesn't mean I have to be doing something every minute o the day. It's okay to just sit in bed and read - I don't have to be productive every waking minute. It's alright to take a 2-hour long bath - It's okay to watch funny video clips on the computer.   


I DO NOT need alcohol to ""unwind"" There are so many other ways I can relax and destimulate myself.   


Wish me luck, I know this isn't going to be a walk in the park, but I am ready to put in the work.",3
2020-04-11 13:22:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fzadoj/day_7_still_alcohol_free/,Day 7- Still alcohol free,"Today is the 7th day of not drinking. I am just checking in with some insight I’ve gained so far from being alcohol free for a week.

The past week was good (as good as it can be spent at home), but challenging:

- I started an at home workout in the mornings last Saturday. That night I drank the rest of the vodka I had. Then I woke up Sunday feeling horrible. But I continued the workout anyway and have done it daily since. I stuck with that routine and didn’t have a drop of alcohol Sunday up until today.

- I had to set up a Google Meet for work yesterday at 12:30 and I was nervous something would go wrong all morning, but it was fine and I was able to relax after.

- A friend that had ALS that I chatted and connected with daily on social media passed away last night. Expected, but still sad. His caregiver let me know thankfully.

- 2 of my front door hinges are barely hanging on for dear life. Luckily I live in an apartment so they’ll be fixed for me. My door just has to hang on until Monday morning, which somewhat stresses me out (by now you may be able to tell that I worry about small things a lot, but I’m used to internalizing it usually) You can do it, door!

So this week was good and bad and full of urges to drink. But I have a few realizations just after a week of not drinking:

1. I am strong enough to do what’s challenging opposed to the easy way out. I’ve done this several times in the past, but failed. I think the support here is the extra layer that is pushing me this time, so thank you!

2. Drinking won’t help my health. It takes me out of my good, healthy routines and rewires my brain to normalize my bad drinking habits. I am on the right track by staying consistent with exercise.

3. Drinking won’t make me any more productive at my work. A hangover only makes it harder to do anything, much less be there for others that depend on me.

4. Drinking won’t bring people back that are gone. It isn’t a magical elixir. In fact, alcohol is a poison that takes more people away forever. I refuse to let a substance take me so far away from myself, that I vanish completely.

5. Drinking doesn’t fix doors or alleviate anxiety. Maybe it does in the moment, but stress is something we are meant to face head on and manage in healthy ways.  I wouldn’t put a Band-aid on a shark bite, so I shouldn’t drink and expect my anxiety to lower. 

It’s remarkably easy to forget these very basic things I just typed out in the moment, but the support here and the badge by my username is what truly keeps me from giving up.

I’ve gone a week without drinking in the past, but this is my last 7 days sober post you’ll ever see from me. That’s a promise.

2020-04-11 12:22:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fz8ox1/things_are_already_alright_how_they_are_right_now/,"Things are already alright how they are, right now.","Hi everyone! 

I was isolating a bit and not taking particularly great care of my recovery BEFORE this COVID thing started. I’m sorry that I dropped off the map here on SD. I didn’t relapse, but I went into my head quite a bit, and that’s not a safe thing for me to do.

My AA sponsor called me out on this behavior. She said that I can’t just disappear and isolate now. I have people in my life who care about me, and who worry when I do this. I am a “part of” now. I’m a part of AA, I’m a part of SD, and I’m a part of my relationships. With that comes responsibility. I am responsible to maintain my end of things, to stay in touch, to communicate.

I’ve always been an isolationist, since a very young age. I probably learned to crawl trying to get to another room away from the rest of my family. This conversation with my sponsor pulled me up short, because it made me realize how much I’ve trained people in my life to accept this from me. I disappear and I’m hard to reach at times, and that’s just how it is. It dovetailed nicely with my drinking, of course, but it’s also a separate thing.

Anyway, long story short, it’s not you, it’s me. I apologize, and I’m working on not repeating this behavior. It’s a pattern that pulls me away from others, and that’s no longer how I want to live my life.

Life has otherwise been weird for me, same as for everybody I think. I miss in person AA meetings, that has been the hardest part of all of this for me. I’ve been doing some online zoom meetings, but it’s not the same. It does, however, open up an interesting opportunity for meetings with people in different places. I’m going to set up an SD AA zoom meeting for Sunday morning, and possibly another one during the week, I’ll make another post with more details or private message me if you’re interested in joining us. 

A friend of mine who helped me get sober again this time around has relapsed. I don’t know if I would have gotten sober again without his intervention and care, I was in a pretty black place. It has been extraordinarily painful to see him building up to the relapse, and even more painful to realize that it happened. We’ve harbored romantic notions towards each other over the years, and I feel a deep sense of grief and loss over letting go of that possibility.

I can’t make anyone relapse, and I can’t get anyone sober. I don’t have that kind of power. But I still acted in ways that I’m not proud of, and that I regret. I got caught up in the drama. I reacted to things emotionally, and out of fear. I lectured instead of sharing my own experience. I withdrew from other friends and support networks and things that I know work.

My experience with relapsing after a period of sobriety has been that once I started, I didn’t *want* to get sober again. My demons came out, demons that I didn’t even realize that I had, and I frightened myself. I also enjoyed it. There’s a dark thrill that comes with letting my demons run rampant and letting my worst self take over.

I couldn’t see the point of sobriety. I didn’t want to come on here, going back to AA meetings seemed *impossible*, and sobriety seemed like it sucked. I couldn’t bear to face life sober and I couldn’t bear to be fully present with myself. Numbing my feelings and avoiding reality and myself were the only options I thought I had.

It took a lot to shake me out of that. I’m grateful for my friend who saw the trouble I was in and put the care and effort into shaking me to my senses. I feel a lot of powerlessness and failure, that I’m not able to do the same thing for him. But I know that I can’t, and I’m risking my own sobriety by trying to talk sense into him. I feel a lot of grief in that as well.

But I am returning to the things that I know work for me to keep my head in a good place and my sobriety intact, and being here is a part of that. There’s an AA speaker I quite like, Earl H., and in at least one of his talks he talks about how things are already alright. Not that they’re *going* to be alright, because he doesn’t know. He doesn’t know what things are going to be like. What he knows is that things are already alright right now, in this moment, how they are, right now.

I like that because it breaks me out of my fear. My fear is about the future. Where I am right now, I am okay. Things are already alright. The sun is shining. I’ve got food in the kitchen. I’m going to work on some projects around the house. Things are fine right now.

I love you all. Thank you for doing this with me. Much as I might want to, I can’t do this alone.

Feel full of guilt and shame today.,"I don't think I'm a true alcoholic in that I don't have a physical reliance upon it and I don't drink all the time, but I am a binge drinker. At my peak of drinking I'd get blacked out once or twice a week, then the rest of the week be completely abstinate and healthy. I've never enjoyed the cognitive dissonance of binge drinking while otherwise being a healthy person, so recently I've made great strides to avoid alcohol as much as possible. I made a pact with myself that I wouldn't drink during the quarantine as I saw its potential to turn into a recurring thing, but my brain convinced me to have ""a few beers"" on Thursday night, which of course turned into the whole 12 pack of IPA's and a bottle of vodka over the span of two days. I was hungover at work on Friday but working from home, so as soon as we got early dismissal at 2pm I decided to alleviate the hangover by drinking the rest of the booze. So basically both nights in a row I got damn near close to blacked out, although last night wasn't quite as bad as Thursday.

I feel full of guilt and shame. I sent some emo stuff to a couple girls I hooked up with in the past, re-opening doors that were better left closed. I think I upset another girl I've been talking to because she asked to hang out yesterday and I said no - mostly because I was too hammered and didn't want her to see me like that. I blamed it on the quarantine but I think she took offense. Found out she blocked me on snapchat overnight. 

So today I woke up feeling two days' worth of a hangover, not quite remembering what all I said to people, just generally feeling a lot of shame and hangover anxiety / dread. I am sorry to post kind of a meandering, pointless topic about it, but I felt like I needed to vent to a community that might understand. I'm really struggling with not having structure in life right now but I'm going to try my best not to get drunk again.",48

Now when the feeling hits I simply take a nap. Yep. I put myself in bed and I allow my mind to rest. When I wake up I feel empowered to stay sober. I have gone to bed before 8pm only to wake up the next morning in a new day of sobriety.

My anti-drink had been going and doing activities at my church, which has a strict sobriety policy for working in counselling people, which I really like doing. After a while, I felt I just didn't want to drink and really built up my life much better.

Unfortunately, it's locked up with the stay at home policy, and while I do have a job I can now do from home (very thankful for that) I've had patches of feeling kind of worthless.

It could be partly from the isolation, and partly from a perception of rejection, but in any case I fell off the last few days.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. 

Maybe you're new to \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.  

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent**.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset! 

 What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.  

This post goes up at:  US—Night/Early Morning  Europe—Morning  Asia and Australia—Evening/Night  A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

**Good Morning Sobernauts!**

Saturday at last!  I love being busy on the weekends, and even now it’s good try and keep some sense of normal.

I’ve never been good at sleeping in, even if I was hungover.  I didn’t like missing the day, I didn’t like admitting I couldn’t get up and do things.

How many Saturdays did I white knuckle myself through a hideous hangover while pretending everything was fine? What a relief I don’t need to pretend anymore.

Thank you so much for this week, it’s been an amazing experience to host DCI and it’s been amazing to get to know everyone a wee bit more!

No more drugs for me, save the occasional hallucinogen. They helped actually and I've no history of abusing them, too expensive, difficult, taxing. Never even tried like the rest of the list.

I’m a healthcare worker so things have been busy. My brain hasn’t been struggling too much with maintaining my sobriety. 

Until tonight. I went to the market with my husband and I really wanted to buy a large bottle of vodka. I was thinking to myself ‘I’m in control’. Maybe if I ask my husband he’d say yes? But the truth is, I’d probably be drunk the whole weekend and be a terrible wife. So I didn’t even ask. I know simply asking him would’ve probably upset him. So I kept quiet and bought my oat milk. 

Now I’m home watching The Office, drinking my oat milk, and eating Oreos. I know I made the right choice. I know I’ll sleep well tonight and feel amazing tomorrow morning. Part of me is sad.

I've always been the last one standing type of drinker, not to be outdone. On a bad night I could do a fifth of whiskey and a six pack of high abv % IPA. I've never had a dui, don't blackout much, have missed very little work due to hangovers, whenever I did I beat myself about it so bad it wouldn't happen again for a long while. I do not identify with the long laundry list of ""typical"" alcoholic issues. It's fine then right? No, no its not. 

In the past alcohol has caused me: Obesity, Pneumonia, fatty liver, heart cardiomyopathy, high blood pressure, erectile dysfunction (calling it whiskey dick seemed funny but its not), sleep apnea, lack of motivation, diarrhea, lots of money, and more. My last drink was March 4th. I started having persistent heart arrhythmias. I tried to get sober and fix it myself because of covid I did not want to go to the hospital. A week later I had gained a ton of water weight, my bowels were obstructed and infected, my heart palpitations did not resolve and I had to go to the er.  After 12 days in a county hospital that was understaffed and chaotic due to preparations for covid cases, a reaction to new meds that left me feeling like I was falling to the center of the earth, no food because of the stomach infection, stomach pain, persistent nausea and dizziness, occasional bouts of dry heaving, severe lack of sleep, I was diagnosed and treated for atrial fibrillation, heart failure relapse (low ejection fraction), water retention, stomach infection, and blinding stupidity.  Th0se 12 days in the hospital were a nightmare, and felt like prison. Sleep deprivation, persistent dizziness, and starvation made me feel like I was being tortured and going insane. 

I've been told not to drink.  By multiple Doctors. Good smart helpful Doctors, with medical degrees and expensive tests and experience. I did not listen. I've been getting better this year, weight loss, no fatty liver, lower blood pressure in the normal range. So, after some sobriety,  I convinced myself it was ok to go back to 4 drinks a day, felt good! 4 turned to 6. 6 light beers turned to high abv% IPA. 6 IPA's wasn't as much as a thrill after a while so, hey, yeah let me get two of these cheap shots too. I cannot moderate. I cannot have alcohol in the house, I will drink it all. 

My Dr. looked me straight in the eye upon my release and told me, ""If you contract covid in your current state, you are highly likely to die. Stay home, take the quarantine seriously, fix your heart and you could possibly fully recover, you're young, stop drinking so you can grow old. "" While there is a light at the end of my tunnel, my tunnel is fucking dim right now. I'm disabled, profoundly tired, and after a few more months of strict quarantine I will still be frightened to go out of the house, see friends, date, or be a normal human. In alternate timelines I have killed myself with alcohol several times. I need to stop doing that. I sure as shit need to not kill myself in this timeline. 

So I'm here kids. Trying to spread the word. I've had stretches of sobriety in the past, I have sober friends, I'm also stubborn as a mule and don't cave to any type of pressure. When I relapse it's because I feel good, and I want to feel even better. I need to remember the bad times. I need to think about everything I love, and how I could lose it all, lose this precious wild unimaginably beautiful experience called life. I'm getting another chance. A chance to clean up my act. A chance to find a soulmate and make tiny humans. A chance to see sunsets, eat thai food, cry to beautiful music, to lose weight, get back in shape and enjoy this magical machine called a body I've been loaned.  It's just on loan people, life can yank your lease for billions of reasons. It can all be taken away in an instant. 

Whatever your troubles with alcohol, find motivation not to drink. Realize that you can feel healthy and things can snap and you could take a turn for the worse. Realize that if your driving slightly buzzed, the microseconds of response time during and accident could make you choose the wrong decision and you could pass at the hands of the wheel by no fault of your own. Relationships can end with no chance of mending. Read the stories here of heartbreak, anxiety, poverty, near death experiences, depression and all the black magic fuckery that alcohol can bring about. If you're young and feel the urge to stop drinking, but aren't motivated because ""nothing that bad has happened to me"" know that it will, in some way, or multiple ways, and you will find yourself wishing desperately you could turn back the clock. Go back in time and slap the bottle out of your hand. But, you can't. You have to look at the worst possible case of your future self with alcohol and not make the dice roll. 

This is a wonderful community and I thank you all for your stories and advice. Stay strong, stay safe.

I have attended a few meetings (not AA, a local alternative support group for women that is great; I can't afford therapy unfortunately, without my other job...) but have been slipping left and right and spending money on wine only to throw out half the bottle out of disgust.  I know cognitive dissonance when I see it and yet my behaviors are not good.  I'm not drinking to excess, or every day or anything.  I just lost my way and even though I know what I want and need, can't seem to get there. The isolation (I live alone) isn't helping. I don't want to drink. But here I am. I hate it.

Radical honesty:

When stuff hurts, I talk about it. When I'm happy, I talk about it. When I'm upset, I talk about it. I've become familiar with my limitations and bandwidth and communicate them openly. 

Ego:

Man, I am not the most important being in the universe. I don't know everything. I can't read minds. Not everyone is judging me. 

Time:

Everything takes time. I still have days where I have urges to drink. But, I'm better at acknowledging them and moving on. 

Gratitude:

I try to remind myself to be grateful for everything. I'm grateful I have friends who've supported me every step of the way. I'm grateful to have two great kids. I'm grateful to work for a company that supports me in my sobriety. I'm thankful and trying not to take anything for granted.

Where is that moment where I crash my car into an orphanage or impregnate a stranger?  I drink every day in some twisted search to find that horrific moment, so I can  finally say "" Welp, now it's time for a change.""  But the longer it takes to get here the more bridges I burn, the more lies I tell and the farther I get from the person I want to be. 

Is there anything worse then waking up to text messages you regret sending? Or nursing yourself through that cocktail of shame and guilt in the morning? Is there anything worse than getting pulled over, and your heart drops because you have to find a way to cover up the empty cans? Is there anything worse than checking your bank account, only to see a row of $8 gas station charges eating up your savings? Of course there are worse things, but are any of these things a  true rock bottom moment? 

Not really, but I think it's finally enough for me. For a long time, no one has really said anything about my substance abuse, mostly because they don't know the full extent of it. But I hate myself right now and I'm excited to not be this guy anymore. 

So today is Day 1! I'm grateful this subreddit exists and I will be posting short blurbs to help me stay sober.",27

Want to try again,"Guys, I'm having a hard time and I just feel like crap.. not so much physically, but mentally/emotionally.  I keep trying and failing every time.  Last year I decided to do a sober April (I think?  I can't even remember what month it was), then started drinking again, and then did a sober September this year.  That went well and I drank less than usual in October and November, but it went to shit in December.  I did dry January and most of Feb (drank 4 days), then it again went to shit in March.  I want to blame covid-19 but I know that I'm strong enough to get through anything if I really want to.  Since the world went crazy I've probably only had 3-4 non-drinking days total.  I fucking hate it, but every time have a craving lately I'm like ""eh, who cares"".   I CARE!  For the love of God, I care! But I can't seem to bring that to the forefront of my mind.  It's so stupid.  I don't even like getting drunk, and in fact I usually don't, I just get a slight buzz and then stop.  I typically have only 2-3 drinks a day, with maybe 1-2 days a week where I drink a bottle of wine or more.   I don't even get hungover.   I'm at like 20-25 drinks per week, which I know is more than recommended, but not like \*that\* much compared to many.

Anyway.  I don't know.  I just feel scared for my health, and  have 2 kids that don't need to see their mom buzzed at dinner everyday.   I know I want to stop, but why is it so hard??  I've read this naked mind and I just feel myself slipping down the pitcher plant and know that I need to get out before it gets worse.   Gah.",3

Like the title said, I'm new to this whole process of stopping drinking. Mainly I've used it as a method of getting to sleep, but it's slowly evolved to consuming who I am. It's kind of scary to just think of what life would look like to be ""that guy"" who doesn't drink. I just couldn't imagine it I guess. Mainly I'll be drinking at like 9pm and keep going til I pass out at 2am, and then wake up and repeat; just waiting for nightine to come again.

Do you have any tips on ways to not be so dependent? Is it as simple as ""just don't drink""? This I guess is just alot to wrap my brain around I guess. Sorry if this shouldn't be posted, or if this doesn't follow the rules of the sub. I guess I'm just wanting to know what the practical steps are to become alcohol free. Time is especially difficult being stuck inside due to this quarantine.

On top of that it was Good Friday and the sun was absolutely blazing in my back garden and my three year old son and my partner have been challenging to be in isolation with. No doubt I am a bigger challenge to them then they are for me, but I would have been so easy to go to the off-licence to buy booze. But I didn't.

I say this because I want to make it clear: I've worked with psychopaths, BPD, narcissists, all of it. I love and care for people. But once I started drinking and smoking I started manipulating. The smoking began with freshman year of college. I was looking for an escape from doing poorly. Then, junior year, my best friend killed himself after we were caught smoking at a music festival and they found ADD meds in one of the backpacks. I had a big tent as was stupid enough to let a bunch of friends store theirs inside. 

Having the ability to be drunk and/or high became my purpose. And I manipulated everyone in my life just to coast by and be high. But now I've dug my pit to my bedrock. I'm in school but the daily drinking made me more anxious and depressed. Then I'd drink to make it go away. Once COVID hit I had an excuse to numb the pain in the daytime and now I'm weaning to save my life. I somehow lost insurance months ago and never fixed it, and was too afraid to tell my mom that they would place a 1500 charge in my account that I couldn't pay. So no rehab, no detox. I'm in my apartment, completely broken and alone. Hoping I have enough money to wean off. It's very scary, and anyone who is making their way to my point, please save your life. You're going to kill yourself. 

Oxy and heroin for a year and a half. Alcohol on and off for 8 years, daily for two stints to the point of a handle every 2-3 days. Xanax off and on for 3. Pot off and on for 10. I hope I don't die, and i hope my family and friends will forgive me for being a piece of shit junkie. I lied so well, so much. I promise I'll be honest with them for the rest of my life.

I am going to be rambling here.

please help. I can almost feel the serotonin and dopamine excreting through my pores, and it's extremely painful. so painful. I am so painfully sober right now, so much so that the thought of the drink is starting to tantalize again, starting to tickle and massage my circuitry. the warmth of it, as it goes down.

i need new associations with the concept. clockwork orange that ish.

I'm afraid of everything. everything. everyone. just absolutely terrified. terrified of the pain, terrified of boredom. terrified of obsession. terrified of vanity. terrified of my own humanity. of judgment.

i remember telling my mom, when i was very young, that the reason I'm unhappy all the time is because being happy requires a concerted effort. and i simply can't be bothered to apply myself.

what happened to me? where did my energy go? why can't I seem to ever simply just love myself? why, after ten years, do i continue to poison myself? anyone from a mile away can tell that I'm not the ""fun"" drunk anymore. why am i so tired all the time?

well, I mean, I know exactly why. but why am i so afraid of putting in the slightest amount of effort when there's literally no risk? surely I know, deep down, that there's nowhere to go but up.

why do i hurt the people that matter the most to me? people that i don't feel I even deserve? why do i almost ""get off"" on being withholding?



someone, anyone, please reply in any manner you'd like. I need to know that i didn't send this out into the void. i need reassurance that, yes, I think, therefore i am.",8

Drank a little more than I should've in the last year.  Saw my doc a few weeks ago for panels and wellness check.  Overall good health.  Panels are well within normal including hepatic function, and I'm sure they're better now.  Vitamin levels seem to be where they're supposed to be, and D is on lower side of normal for the winter, so I started taking a supplement for that.  I'm eating better, drink lots of water, and have started running a little over a month ago.  I'm pretty athletic.  35 years old.  B complex supplements, fish oil, etc.

(Edit: One thing I forgot to mention was my blood pressure got a little high with stress from a personal thing a few years ago.  I was put on amlodipine 10mg in 2018.  Drinking caused it, it's come down quite a bit and I need to talk to my doctor about coming off it.  Shit could be the culprit in all of this.)

&#x200B;

However, aches and pains have shown up that may have been masked.  I get some full body tremors that feel more like vibrations sometimes.  I've been having some weird abdominal cramping that rear their heads sometime (doc couldn't feel liver swelling either) - but they're slight and dull, never anything crazy.  Been having some tingling on my scalp but I've also been gradually losing my hair since I was 24, and it almost feels like that's what I'm feeling plus dry skin from having no hair, which I've been religiously moisturizing.  Sometimes they cause tension headaches but again, nothing crazy.  I'm not miserable, but they cause anxiety...

Which leads me to the fact that I get hyperfocused on them and begin bouts of health anxiety at any given moment.  It's driving my nuts but I'm cognizant it's just anxiety and if my doctor isn't a liar and my labs weren't BS, I should be in good health otherwise.  The anxiety just drags me down and I feel helpless to it.  I am working on that with the exercise and support system.  I just wish it would stop.  Not sure if I was magically 100% feeling okay if I'd be anxious about something else or not.

Are these things common?  I don't have any ailments as far as I know.  Liver and kidneys are good.  Etc.  Maybe a potassium issue?  I just got some bananas.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",1

Been lurking for a while now and always thought “I wish I had the confidence to quit” or “at least I don’t drink in the morning” but here I am. 

This pandemic had me working from home - which started off great but then cabin fever started getting to me. After a couple weeks, a quick nip in the morning made day fly by and by 5 I was feeling wild. 

I got out of hand yesterday during a video conference and I had no idea what was going on. I was late to the call and made a fool of myself to the boss. 

I don’t even like my job but was fortunate to have one & with benefits so if I get fired, my wife and I won’t have insurance. Couldn’t sleep after I woke up with the worst anxiety I’ve ever felt. Full blown panic attacks and the works. 

I’m so glad this community is here because I’ll need all the support I can get now that I’m 100% sure I’ve got a problem. It’s amazing to hear so many stories that are all so similar and relatable. I embarrassed my self at Christmas, at weddings, work events, etc. and I always chalked it up to being fun and something to chat about with the boys at work. Now I’m a new line of work that won’t tolerate that stuff and possibly out of the job. 

I’ll be checking in on this sub daily. Thanks internet strangers!

EDIT: Well, I didn’t get fired. But I know the microscope is on me - more than it already was. I’ll have to stay sober and work harder. Thank all of you for the support!!

Sobriety is such a lonely battle, and as I’m sure we have all discovered, only an addict can truly understand and addict. 

   I’ve been sober for a little over three years (29m), but this moment in time is the closest I’ve have come to living my past life. There was no drastic moment that lead me to it. No peer pressure or influence from another person. But my mind has been insisting I am alright, and that I can handle an intoxicant and be alright. That monster I once was feels more like a nightmare than an actual person I used to be. And it has become so easy to not think of myself in that way. 

   So to cut to the issue, I have convinced myself that I can take low dose THC edibles (legal where I live) to manage stress and pain, and that it won’t take me down a bad path. Yet obviously I am reserved and scared. I’ve talked with my partner who never new the loser I once was, and she said I could try it if I feel comfortable, but she will insist I cease using it if it goes south. So of course I get very excited and start doing research and looking up low doses and on and on. But then I think, I could really lose control and destroy this whole relationship, could lose my son, my job, become suicidal and everything else that was once a prevalent issue. Not worth it. My angel and demon are tearing me apart. Figured I could use y’all chiming in to sort this out. Thanks.",8

I feel so good about myself inside and out.

Also this morning I was hanging out with my mom (who is very worried about my drinking), she said ""I need to figure out how to order white wine to the house."" I said I'd help her online, and then I said, I'm sober now though, no more hard liquor, and I don't want any wine later either.

I've tried to quit drinking several times but haven't had much success. I've decided that I really need a support group but AA just isn't for me. I'm hoping I fit in alright here.  


I'm what most people would probably call a high functioning alcoholic. I don't get angry or violent. I don't yell. I don't drink and drive. I do drink heavily almost every day (I'll buy 4 handles of vodka a week and often finish it).  


My problem with quitting is that I'm so reliant on it mentally. I started drinking heavily as an alternative to killing myself (thanks Air Force). Now, whenever I quit drinking I quickly get apathetic and miserable. The last time I tried quitting was new years and I made it about two weeks. I'm working on that part of myself as well, but I really think I'm not going to be mentally healthy until I get off and alcohol.

NO!!!

You ALWAYS regret when you do drink. You are so productive and happy when you don’t drink. You can do all of the things you dream of doing easily and with confidence!

I've struggled with my alcohol consumption since college, but it's gotten progressively worse over the years, particularly the last 2-3 years - both in terms of consumption and consequences. What started as me loving a nice craft beer after work slowly morphed into me drinking 7-10 drinks a night, hiding it from my then boyfriend of five years, whom I lived with. I would find any way possible to drink - going to the grocery store, saying I had to work late, even getting into fights so I could be in a different room (and drink). 

Always weary of my drinking, this caused a lot of problems on the relationship, ultimately leading to couple's therapy. I would always say the right things and do things to ""show"" progress but was never very serious about it. I just wanted to protect my drinking. At first, it was just fun to push the limit on my drinking - how far could I go and not have any consequences? I justified it because I had a great career, graduate degree, and seemed very put together from an outsider's perspective. 

Beyond my deteriorating relationship with my then boyfriend, lots of other consequences showed up throughout the years which I just ignored - high blood pressure, loss of interest in hobbies and friends, I even drunkenly broke my neck. Yes - you read that correctly. That was not enough for me to realize I had a problem. 

Finally, after years of this drinking in isolation, getting wasted every night, my boyfriend finally confronted me and demanded I tell the truth. While not outright admitting to everything then, I admitted I had not been honest with my drinking and had a problem. He was supportive and encouraged me to see an addiction therapist, go to AA, as well as continue going to couple's counseling. I did all three. 

That kept me sober for about two weeks, but, at that time, the consequences didn't seem substantial enough for me to stop. I would go to AA and folks would have multiple DUIs, criminal records, lost jobs, etc. - and many were 10-15 years my senior. I thought that my drinking career still had some runway left. Ultimately - my very loving and caring boyfriend - gave me an ultimatum: choose him or drinking. I chose drinking and moved out days later. My alcoholic brain had convinced me my boyfriend was annoying/controlling/not for me. It really just wanted unhampered drinking. 

After that, I binged for months. I thought it was great. And then I ran into my ex-boyfriend with his new (and still) boyfriend. It crushed me. I felt as if I had always been in control - because the manipulative drinker in me always somehow got away unscathed. I thought when I chose to end my drinking, I could just come back to my old life and everything would work out the way it was supposed to. That wasn't the case. For the first time I realized that, the person who would look at wedding rings with me, who took care of me when I broke my neck, had moved on for good - it's the largest consequence I've had to date. 

Fast forward - that kept me sober for about 4 months. Got a personal trainer, went to AA daily, and was starting to feel better about my life. I then got approached for an amazing job opportunity that took me to a new, very large city. I thought a fresh start would be perfect for me, but it turned into a relapse of heavy drinking, which has gotten worse and worse, and got even worse through the beginning of quarantine. During quarantine, I was informed of a lateral promotion, which in my field is required for an eventual non-lateral promotion. Being as high functioning as I am, my career has not suffered. But I'm sick of faking being ""on top"" of my job. I know, at some point, I will mess up enough where it will affect my career. I'm sick of having no interests besides chasing the next drink. I'm sick of not living life! This quarantine has been a blessing in disguise and has changed my routine enough (working from home) where a lot of my normal triggers (coming home from work, walking by the liquor store) have been disrupted, allowing me to rather easily stop drinking for seven days. I don't know what's clicked in me, but I just can't drink anymore. This is my opportunity to rebuild myself over the next few weeks and finally start living a life I deserve.

That was a nightmare that I don’t have to return to. If alcohol presents itself I will have many moments to make the decision to turn away. It won’t be forced on me or happen all at once. I am in control of whether or not I have the first drink. And I choose to continue growing and learning to live sober no matter what life throws at me.",3

I'm so tired of being alone, My whole life feels hopeless not just dating wise but everything.

I'm 25 and a virgin, I've given thought to seeing a prostitute but, A. I would have no idea if the woman was trafficked or addicted to drugs and I don't want to give money to that, I also don't want to be part of making the lives of other people worse. B. I'm recovering from Alcoholism, I'm something like 60 days sober and I already have one addiction, I have heard visiting prostitutes can be addicting. C. It might just reinforce how lonely I feel.
Its worse because for a while I was planning on committing suicide before I turned 25 and then my family found out and that stopped.

It feels like my whole life is pointless, That I'll never find love, never have a career, and sometimes I feel like I should have killed myself anyway, part of me would legitimately rather die than be a virgin at say 26 or 27 let alone 30, and even if I wasn't a virgin, the rest of my life is still a complete mess and its not lik my major depression will go away because I have sex.  I was diagnosed with depression in Elementary school. I've been on antidepressants for a very long time and I'm so tired of fighting, If this is life I can't live like this, my family and friends are the only reason I'm still living, it's not fair that I have to live because other people will be sad, I just don't want to hurt.

I only stopped drinking because of my family but with all this I don't see a point, I can either be lonely, miserable and hopeless sober or I can be drunk and have that moment to breathe, an hour or 5 where I don't care that I'm lonely, miserable and hopeless",11

My daughter will be doing school work because she ""forgot"" to bring it to her Mom's.  Yeah, that's not so good because she's got a weeks worth of work to do tonight and tomorrow.

I was supposed to work tonight but I got the night off.  I've been working like crazy and work has been crazy.  I'm back to work tomorrow night.  Hopefully I'll be able to recharge a little bit.

It's not Ebola.  So that's good.  It's not a mutated version of airborne rabies, which has a case fatality rate of pretty much 100%.  So things could be worse.  And drinking ravages the immune system so that's good.

He’s been hurt in the past by me blowing him off / being generally unreliable due to my drinking, but he never brings up the past or holds it over me. He’s always been so supportive and patient through all this. 
Clearly though, he’s holding some trauma, and it’s manifesting this way. It was such a good wake up call for me, to realize that my sobriety isn’t just about me anymore - it also impacts my partner. 
That’s something to keep in mind anytime I am tempted.

So, I'm 33 days dry now and have been at this stage a number of times before, and am coming up against ""the wall"" that i often hit in dry spells.  Usually around 2-4 weeks after I get dry, the memories of the misdeeds/embarrassments/shame of the last drunk spell and subsequent withdrawal horrors fade and i start to feel complacent.  Ideas about drinking start to creep into my mind - it's really a case of me imagining it, in the same way someone might imagine being on holiday they feel they need, or what it would be like to own that car you've always wanted - so fantasising or ideation, not actual planning *doing* it (at this stage).

I have no plans acting on these thoughts (at the moment), but at the same time, I find them intrusive and mildly distracting.  Also given past experience, I am aware that they are a pre-cursor to actually drinking...

I know also from AA meetings and talking to other people in recovery that these thoughts are common and in time they do become less frequent and can stop altogether.

I've never gotten ""addicted"" to weed, at least not like alcohol - I've smoked on and off for the past 10 years and it's usually when someone else offers or I've forced myself to try to like it, but it's just never stuck. I actually don't like being high, I feel very uneasy whereas I feel in control when drinking (lol).

Anyways, what are your opinions on this? and this early on is this common to look elsewhere to fill a void? Do I need to power through this?",6

Week of March 15-22 I went on a huge bender. Stopped on the 22 and then began experiencing hallucinations and delusions the next day, which I think was a result of kindling. I had several withdrawals over the past year, so I think I finally hit the point where any subsequent withdrawal will be more severe. 

Anyway, was in the hospital March 23-27. It was a scary experience being hooked up to so many machines while also seeing and hearing shit no one else could. I can’t remember most of that week. I always read stories of people experiencing horrible withdrawals, but I got cocky and said, “That’ll never happen to me.” Well, it did, and I NEvER want to experience that week in the hospital EVER again. I felt like a new man when I was discharged. 

I’m a substitute teacher, and school has been cancelled for the rest of the academic year in my state (still getting paid for the year, thank God). COVID-19 became much more serious in my area, and my mother and grandmother were rightly concerned. Of course, errands needed to be run, but they weren’t willing to leave the house for fear of infection. I have done all of our shopping and cleaning. I disinfect our common areas every night before we all head to bed and keep tabs on them daily. I also cook and generally am more present for them than I ever was when I was drinking.

I would lock myself in my room some days and just drink. I smelled. I looked like hell. It was only a week-long binge, but it was enough to wreck me. Three weeks ago my room smelled like hot garbage from the liquor and beer farts, and today it smells wonderful because I wiped down all my walls with Murphy’s Oil Soap. 

Tell me again why I want to be a drinker? What’s accomplished other than me being a filthy sloth?

50 days ago I was in my cardiologist's office. I'm 49 years old, 5 years ago I had to get a triple bypass for damage caused to my heart by cancer medicines 20 years ago. I had just gotten my vitals taken by the nurse. I was very hung over, having drank a pint of vodka the night before along with a couple hard lemonades. My head was pounding. I kept my hand close to my body to hide my hand tremors. 

""Your blood pressure is through the roof. It's 220 over 110. Any idea what's going on?"" 

Every instinct I had told me to cover my tracks, to lie. But this particular day I was just so beaten down.  I'd been drinking a pint of vodka every damn day for at least a month. I'd blown off two previous doctors meetings because I was hung over. I just spit it out: ""I have an alcohol dependency problem, and I'm hungover."" She didn't flinch. She asked a couple questions and left to get the cardiologist.

The cardiologist pops in. He's in his late 40s. He saved my life 5 years ago when he caught my three blockages and sent me to the hospital by ambulance for emergency open heart surgery. He walked in, ""You were pretty honest with Rosanne"". I got choked up, and dared not speak for fear of him hearing my voice crack. I shrugged instead. ""I'll be honest,"" he said. ""I'm in AA. I'm two years sober. It's been really hard but I feel so much better and I just want you to know that you can find your way out of this."" He went on to tell a vivid tale of heavy drinking, lies to his family. Driving mishaps while blacked out and all night binges.

Hearing his story, and his own decision to be honest with me really put a change in me. I showed my cards, expecting a lecture and I got fellowship and support. I had felt so alone, but now I felt I had someone that understood my troubles and gave a damn enough to put his own reputation on the line to help me. 

Anyway that was 50 days ago and I haven't had a drop since. I'd still be doing a pint a day if I hadn't told that nurse the truth.

I've been sober for a little over 14 months. I don't usually attend AA meetings but I do work the program. So, I'm going to try to keep this short. My boyfriend and I are both recovering and when we met we were both in active alcoholism/addiction. He said some terrible things to me while drunk (over 3 years ago) and I still hold resentments towards that. The other day, I lost my temper. I haven't lost my temper like that, ever. Even in active alcoholism/addiction. We don't fight that fiten but, when we do he will often hang up the phone on me or leave in the middle of me talking. Which upsets me more. He will say we'll talk about it later after we've both calmed down, which is good. But, it never gets talked about. So I end up having all these emotions boiling inside me and it came out in an explosion the other day. There's been a lot of tension between us the last few days. So today, we had a really good talk on my lunch break. I explained to him that although I did speak a lot of truth, I went about it entirely the wrong way. I should not have yelled and torn him down and made him out to be a terrible human being. I know I have a lot of work to be done on my anger management. I have a lot of deep seeded resentments towards him and often times, the things he has told me in the past will replay over and over again in my head. Which ends up adding fuel to the already enflamed resentment. I've done quite a few lengthy 4th steps on him, gone over them with my sponsor, prayed about it. All the stuff that always gets suggested. But I can't seem to let go of the anger and hate I have towards him. I desperately want to but, I'm missing something. He never made amends to me and almost never apologizes for the way he treats me or the things he says. So, I do feel that if I got a genuine apology or amends out of him, it would make the forgiveness process easier. But, that's not my program to work and I can't force him to do anything.

So, my question is. What can I do on my end to let go of these resentments? I'm willing to try anything at this point. I'm mentally exhausted from all this anger I have built up and I don't want to continue fighting with him over stuff from the past. Being angry isn't doing me any good, and it will eventually cause me to go pick up a case of beer. I just don't know what to do in this situation. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Also, if this is not the appropriate sub for this type of post, please let me know. I'm not looking for relationship advice. I'm looking for advice on how I can find it in myself to forgive him even if he's not sorry for it.",5

Long story short, my wife is a big time alcoholic for most of her life.  
I won't bore you with all the stories but for context, she has been living in a town 4 hours away that started out as her going to a rehab there for several months and then she ended up just living there with someone she met in rehab that became her friend.

She has been there over a year.  
The last time she came to visit us (about a month ago), she showed up drunk.

That friend called today and said she has been binge drinking for months and she can't have her stay there any longer, especially since it's a sober-living facility and she has kids and is worried about getting kicked out because of my wife.

So my in-laws and myself will be driving there to get her car (which I pay for, is in both our names, and we're worried about her drunk drive crashing it - she constantly drunk drives).     

Also the plan is to take her from her friend's sober living home and leaving her at a homeless shelter.

We're not taking her back. We've done that for years and we're all pretty much done with her.   
We all love her but she will not change.

Anyway, so my question is what kind of options do we have for places to take her? Women's shelter, homeless shelter, just leave her in the street without a vehicle?   

I'm sure some will wonder why I don't divorce her. Probably the thing keeping me from going through with that is that she's on my insurance and any rehab or therapy was being covered by my insurance. She told me she hasn't been to a therapist for a while though.

As for places to leave her - or what we can do with her besides bringing her back home - any suggestion or info anyone has would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you so much!

**edit** Thank you so far for all the well wishes and info. I want to point out that my wife isn't vindictive or petty or anything like that. In fact she's very sweet and when it comes to all this, she feels incredibly guilty. That's also probably a reason she drinks. If we divorced, she wouldn't ask for a single thing. When it comes to the car, she has told me multiple times I should take it because ""it's mine"" and she doesn't deserve it. When it comes to alcoholism, she knows she's an alcoholic and feels incredible guilt and remorse. I can't explain what makes her pick up that drink utterly knowing it's going to ruin everything, but I suspect if we knew that, we'd be able to cure this horrible disease.",6

Nothing could in between me and the drink, not even sleep. There were times I would come to after being passed out for a couple of hours with a newly opened Old English in my hand, spilled all over the bed from me not being fully conscious. Anyway, about a year ago I got the sweetest dog in the entire world. I loved this dog with all of my heart, but he didn't very much like apartment life. (I rescued him from my local Humane Society and he came from a very open, outdoor living space) That being said, he required a lot of walks in order to be happy. This wasn't a problem in the first year, I was on point, at least three long walks a day, plenty of food and water. 

Fast forward a year, and I was given a position at work that required me to be on site more often, plus added responsibilities and stress. This lead me into a downward spiral of constant drinking and apathy. I wasn't taking care of myself, or the dog properly. 

At this point, I have two roommates. One works with me, and had been a huge help taking care of Chunky (The dog), and the other, who assumed that the dog wasn't his responsibility (He wasn't). Usually between myself and the helpful roommate, depending on who was up first, would take care of the dog in the morning. At this point, he was only going out once a day, because both of us were too drunk from the night before to get up early enough to take him out more. It was wake up from a coma, begrudgingly take out the dog and feed him/ give him water, then off to work until 2 AM. Then we would come home and pass out, and repeat the process. 

The third roommate in this living situation was was staying on our couch in the living room for the time being, and often left a window open that was easily accessible to the dog. Once he hopped out of that window the first time, he'd learned. In the first and second incidents of this happening, I was at work; and got a call from either a veterinarian's office, or a resident saying Chunky was safe. Myself or the helpful roommate would just go pick him up from whoever found him. The third time I got a call, I was at work again, but the news I got was that he had escaped and gotten hit by a car and passed away. My heart sank. I was shocked, but not surprised. I called the third roommate, half crying, cussed his ass out, then immediately started to drink. Heavily. I couldn't even bring myself to go see him after the fact. I just payed for his cremation and kept getting hammered. 

This was about a week and a half ago, and today makes three days without a drop.

My stellar credit rating dropped and that made me even more depressed.  I was living paycheck to paycheck and not able to pay those debts.  I was able to somehow pay some pretty hefty bar tabs, however.  

I've still got quite a bit of student debt, but I'm chipping away at it regularly.  I owe my brother 100 dollars.  But, as of today, I have no delinquent debt!

While that may be against the recommended wishes of the Commonwealth, we stayed safe and didn't not get close to each other. In fact, probably safer than any grocery store trip I've made in the past two months. 

I digress. The point is, on my way home I started to see all of the liquor stores that i would normally stop at on drive home.  I went by two and then told my girlfriend that I'm going to stop at the store and grab something to drink. She said she was all set.  Fact is, I had planned on stopping at the third store because I was prepping my comment to her while driving. She didn't want anything because she is nursing, and I knew she was going to say no.

Well, I woke up with a hangover this morning. Felt just like I drank a bottle of vodka. Weird thing is, I never stopped at the liquor store.  A combination of fear of COVID-19 and her unwillingness to partake in my transgressions at that moment (and maybe other things subconsciously) caused me to stare but not stop at the parking lot and I kept going.

It has just occurred to me, that after starting drinking at the age of 15 I have quite literally floated through life in the real off the mediocre. Alcohol has been the main focus of most things, it started out as partying with friends, most nights.   


Thankfully we were quite an intelligent bunch, so were quite easily able to scrape through school - with mediocre grades. But enough to get into a UK college.   


In College the parties continued, and obviously they escalated, but we were quite an intelligent bunch, and we managed to scrape through - with mediocre grades and supporting ourselves with mediocre jobs, to get into a University.   


Well! things really went off the fucking handle here. University drinking culture is off the scale. But guess what, we were a moderately intelligent bunch, and took the letter of the passing criteria and managed to scrape through with mediocre grades.   


We then set to work, got mediocre jobs, and now work mediocre positions. All the while drinking, drinking drinking.   


I have not been drinking for a little while now, but I have just got this knot in my stomach out of nowhere, what IF we had put down the bottle for a couple of years, and sent the hours staring at the bottle of a bottle actually putting in the effort to study and get higher grades, and a higher paying job, and respecting our health. The what ifs? Just keep coming this afternoon.

I've been using hand sanitizer when I'm not able to wash my hands, but each time I do I get a cringe. It smells exactly like the poison I was drinking. And when I'm drinking a diet coke which I would combine with my poison of choice, all sorts of weird feelings including shame come up.

I'm so proud of myself for not drinking during this time. It has been a Gong Show and while I don't think I'm coping as well as I could be, alcohol would diminish all of the coping mechanisms that I do have.

We're at a time when there is lots to grieve. The loss because of death, jobs and businesses becoming not, restrictions changing what we can not do in daily life, or even the loss of bright times or oblivion that alcohol promised. We are also at a time when there are many things we have, from a growing sense of community and connection to manufacturers and maker spaces converting to medical production.

In December, I misbehaved pretty badly with some other friends. They saw the break in the pattern - knew that I was a different person when I'd been sober, and knew that the behavior didn't match the ""me"" I was trying to be. They got me to seek help. I pulled up out of the worst of it - relapses, but never detrimental.

We've been stuck living together, she and I, and increasingly her unwillingness to confront her own half of this issue has caused her to behave more and more poorly. She came home tonight and immediately sank half a 750ml of El Jimador. I could tell what was coming - another night of defensive spikiness, slammed doors, thrown objects, hideous insults that she'd apologize for the next morning. I cut it off.

I told her that we were through, for real, and that I wasn't going to be seeking to re-up our space together. She's drank away nearly every dollar she's made at her current job, trying to fight off the demons. I've saved enough money to be sure she ends up somewhere safe and isn't going to be out on the street, but after everything, I just can't do more. I wish I could. I tried so hard to be useful, I tried to be kind in a way that would let her see that she doesn't deserve to suffer like this.

It didn't work, and now I finally just have to admit that it's time to get out. It's long past time.

I've been miserable for months, chosen drink so many times for reasons that weren't even mine. No more.

Thank you all for reading. Happy Thursday.

But soon I must be gone

Sail on

When you make up your mind
I'll tell you all my secrets as we slip between the city streets tonight
When you say your goodbyes
Don't let them see the tears that sparkle in your eyes

While you're sick and tired
Of feeling sorry for yourself
Life will chew you up and spit you out
And put you on the shelf
You will wake up every morning expecting to be free
You gotta float on

Our time is on loan
All the hopes and dreams you had were left behind and taken by the storm
It won't be long
And all the pain that's in your life will soon be gone

One of the reasons I’d been drinking so much was because I’d been trying to push down the feelings of being so trapped, unhappy and uncomfortable in the relationship.

Just felt the need to share where I’m at. Hopefully I’ll be able to get past any withdrawal effects in isolation and stay on track, one day at a time. Will try some online meetings as well.

The one friend I was able to stay sober around and go on adventures with, just enjoying scenery and good food and genuine laughs. I was looking forward to having that to rely on?

However, she texted me vey casually to say that she would like to reschedule our skype call to another night (which is fine seeing as I am way too anxious right now to have conversation anyone), because she was enjoying some wine and bustling about the kitchen...

My heart sank - my heart aches because I know she had quit previously, because like me, she doesn't have much of an off button. I am scared because I feel like I lost a potential support. I also feel so much guilt not knowing how to reach out to make sure she is okay? Without offending? I am also not in a very stable and emotional place to support someone else, which I feel is selfish.

I understand it isn't her job to support me and I can build a community and there is so much else that I can do. And I will have to check in with her again and man up... This distance and isolation has really made things a pain in the arse. 😅 

Just really messed with my brain. Good old brain saying ,""if she is doing it, you can."" Nope. Nope. Nope. Not today, brain. 

On the plus side, first online therapy consult tomorrow...

Thanks for the ear.

I grew up with an abusive, alcoholic father and an abused, emotionally distant mother. The majority of family on my mom and dad's side are alcoholics. I began self-harming when I was 12 and began drinking at 16 after I had met my first boyfriend. 

First boyfriend was a dick and constantly pressured me to lose my virginity. I was a people-pleaser and always had trouble saying no. I got drunk so I could do it. 

I was in college. Random memories of being driven home in a police car because I was too drunk at the bar. Losing all self-respect because I was too drunk at the bar. Walking home from parties in -40C without a jacket. Almost died choking on my own vomit, but my friend found me so I was okay.  

My second boyfriend was a sweetheart, the loveliest of people. I'm not me when I was blacked out, and that happened often. We were at a St.Patrick's Day party. I was out back slugging fireball and everclear with a friend. Lose my mind, apparently I started punching my boyfriend in the middle of the party. I made him cry. I banged on his apartment door for hours until the police were called. That was the end of that one. 

When I was 19 I met my ex-partner. He was ten years older than me and drank a lot too. I was high on MDMA and blacked out drunk when we first slept together; obviously I don't remember this. I only found out about that time because he told me. 

Our relationship was very intense and tumultuous. He was the love of my life, we went on so many adventures together. Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, New Zealand, S. America, road trips across Canada, camping every chance we got. We had a dog and a life together, but he was emotionally and mentally abusive towards me when he was drunk or hungover. 

Other random memories of arguing, almost dying from a coke and alcohol binge, cutting myself while drunk etc. etc.

In 2018 he choked me while he was blackout drunk. We were sitting around the fire with a few friends. One of his friends had to pry him off of me. I stayed with him because I loved him. We were set to move to a new country with our dog. 

We moved to the new country with our dog. I had a pretty sweet deal with my career, working remotely for a university.The bottle of whiskey came out. Looks like I was drinking again tonight. 

A few friends and his brother came out. I got so blackout drunk that my ex-partner found me in bed with one of the ""friends"". I have no memory of how I got there. I even woke up in the morning and tried to cuddle with my ex-partner, until he said ""get away from me"". I asked him what happened and he told me. I felt so much shame. I felt so much shame that I broke up with my ex-partner, and he wanted to make it work. We were together for five years. 

I kept drinking. I drank everyday after that. Ruined my career because I couldnt keep up with the deadlines. Alone in a foreign country. Waking up hungover everyday. No friends. All alone, until I met my drinking buddy w/ benefits. I kept drinking until July 2019, when I had a month-long break. I kept drinking after that, but not as much. 

I slowed down with drinking in the later part of 2019 and 2020. I find that whenever I drink now, even only after a couple of beers, I start crying and feel anxious. Great. Now I'm a sad drunk. 

My heart is so sad and I can feel everything. I want to go back home but I'm stuck in this country because the borders are closed. I'm entertaining myself with colouring books, painting, and a banjo. 

I'm 8 days sober. 

Thanks for reading.

TLDR: Grew up with alcoholic father. History of alcoholism in the family. I had lots of close-calls and mistakes made while drunk. I was blackout drunk and ruined my life by sleeping with a ""friend"" while in a long-term relationship. I ruined my life and my career. Stuck in another country while in lockdown.",10
2020-04-08 17:45:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fxflff/day_1_in_over_a_decade/,Day 1 in over a decade...,"So I stumbled across r/stopdrinking today and have been reading through the posts. Some background from me, I have been daily drinking for the last 12 years, what started off as weekend drinking after a hard week at work slowly turned into a more regular thing and before I knew it I’ve spent the last ten years of my life drinking everyday. 

This slowly manifested into more and more as my tolerance built and over the last few years I have consumed a third of a litre of Vodka every evening. I justified it as I have quite a stressful job and I would explain to my wife it was my way of unwinding at the end of the day. I guess a functioning alcoholic is best to explain myself at this point. 

Every morning I would wake and have to fight the hangover and only by early morning I would start to feel normal again. I hate the routine, the habit and I know deep down for the two hours per evening I get good feelings, the payback, loss of interest and bad health are not worth it. But only today after finding this group and reading posts have I made a conscious effort to make the change in my life. I’ve never posted on here before, I quite frankly didn’t know much about reddit until the a few weeks ago, but stopping here today has made me make the decision I need for a better life. 

It is only day one, and this evening I have had nothing but water. I really wonder what waking up tomorrow will be like after ten years of my life in the same routine of drinking. So a thanks from me for everyone on here which has inspired me to change for the better.

Update... so I woke up today and fuck, I feel incredible. I will be honest actually falling asleep took me perhaps an hour and half, normally I just pass out so I did wonder if I’d ever sleep. But in the end I did, and I can’t quite get my head round waking up sober. It feels amazing.",11

I'm gonna try to do a readable TLDR.

So I got sober in 2017 after having a troublesome relationship with alcohol since my early teens - I was in my late 20s when I quit. I kept myself completely sober for about 1½ years after that, and for the last 1½ years I've been *mostly* sober. Meaning, about once every two months I relapse a little bit. Drinking for a night, then feeling like shit for a week and cursing myself. Then repeating the same thing a couple of months later. But still, managing to not fall completely into that hole. When I quit the first time I had so bad abstinence that I got seizures and had to be hospitalized. I had to drink about 0.5 liters of vodka a day just to get the shaking under control, and 1-1½ liters to feel **good**.

Anyway. A couple of months ago I decided that I ""didn't feel like myself"" on my meds (I'm bipolar).  Or so I am told by a friend, I don't really remember much about it. So I just stopped taking them. Big fucking mistake. Don't know how much you guys know about bipolar disorder but TLDR you switch between depressions and so called manic episodes. When you're manic you're like a coke head - you're the king of everything and make extremely impulsive and reckless decisions. Like deciding that ""well, **one** beer can't really hurt"". Big fucking mistake #2.

So fast forward to about one month ago from today. As I said, my memories are very foggy, but I quit drinking and bragged about it to my roommates. They  were thrilled about it, and to prove that I was fine I cleaned the whole apartment by myself. It was fucking shining. Anyway, so one morning I hear shots outside my kitchen window. I go and look, and there's some fucking kids playing with guns outside the building. I asked my roommate wtf should we do? He of course thought we should call the police, so we did.

A while later the police showed up and rang my doorbell. Asked if I were the one that had called about the gunfire. ""Yeah"" I said. They then explained that my countrys equivalent to a 911 operator had thought I sounded confused and asked them to check on me. They asked me if I had been drinking, and I was honest and said ""yeah for a while but I'm completely sober right now"" (which I was). They didn't really sound convinced, and also not interested in investigating the gunfire outside the building at all.

Eventually they asked me to come with them and ""speak to a doctor for a while"", which I gladly agreed to. As we were leaving I threw the extra keys to my roomate Philip and said ""Philip, take care of so and so while I'm gone"". The cops looked at eachother, then at me.

And they told me - ""denvitakaninen - there's no one here. Who is Philip?""

Sooo... it turned out I never had any roommates to begin with. I've *never* had roommates. And needless to say, there were never any gunfire outside my building. They were all hallucinations. And guys.. I've had hallucinations before. I used to really like LSD. But not this kind of hallucinations, where you are one hundred percent convinced that you are talking to a real person. It was some a beautiful mind shit. The doctor they were talking about was a guy at a psychiatric clinic. I got committed against my will for about two weeks.

Under these two weeks I slowly began to realise that a lot of shit I thought happened or were dreams under this period was actually hallucinations. For example I had a dream about me running to my car, and then sitting in the backseat of my own car while waiting for my friends father to start driving. Then getting into an argument when he wouldn't start driving, and then storming away and going inside again. I wrote this off as a dream, but when I got out of the hospital I couldn't find my car keys. Went looking and... well, they were in the back seat of my car. So I just hallucinated the whole thing. Must've been a blast for the neighbours, me in the backseat arguing with an invisible driver and then angrily storming off!

Anyway, now it's almost a month since I got committed. I'm out, I've got better medications and I've gotten an appointment for alcohol counseling. I feel fucking great right now. But it was a close call. When I was leaving the facility one of the nurses said that they thought I was going to die when I came in. My pulse were 220+ and putting too much strain on my heart, appearently. I hardly remember more than lying on a table and having **a lot** of doctors around me and a lot of beeping.

So - if you read all that..so what did I learn?

I learned that I never want to go back to that place. Either that place were I wasn't allowed to leave or shave or the place in my head were I don't know what's real and what's not. And I'll (hopefully) never again think that I am a person that can stop at one beer. I could've died. And my poor mother would be crying to this day. I can be happy without this shit. I **am** happy. But it proves that some of us just can't moderate. You have to just cut the cancer out and fucking burn it.

TLDR - Sober for three years, stopped taking my bipolar meds, got manic and started drinking. Called the cops about gunfire which I just imagined. Also hallucinated a lot. Got committed against my will and almost died. Out now, sober and happy. But learned that I can't just have one beer. And that's okay, I can be happy anyway.

PS. I'm really sorry for my terrible english. I hope you guys can understand it anyway.

EDIT:

Oh yeah, in the police report the cops had noted that ""the apartment was very clean"". So I didn't hallucinate that bit at least :D",11

Hey all, first time posting and am new to this sub. Made an account just to post here. I’m 26 years old and have been a heavy drinker since I was 21. I’ve blacked out many, many times but in 4 particular occasions, I became a monster and tried hurting people, driving drunk and causing a ruckus. I’ve been on a bender for weeks. Between myself and two other friends, we finished 10 bottles of liquor, among all the beer and wine for in between. This past Sunday, I blacked out again and tried driving home drunk and argued with my boyfriend and his family. We have been together for 12 years, so he’s been with me well before I started drinking. Right before this quarantine, I felt like we were madly in love and life was going to change. But then we were forced to stay home, so we sat and drank a lot. He’s very hurt. I’ve tried quitting in 2018, made it 3 months and then thought I could handle drinking again.... I feel like my life has fallen apart. I don’t have work or school or my beloved boyfriend around. My boyfriend drank with me everyday and after Sunday, he said he never wanted to drink and he only did it because it made me happy. I wasn’t happy. I’ve been desperately wanting to quit, in my mind, but never had the strength to. So, Tuesday morning, I called myself out to everyone on my FaceBook. I posted about the awful things I’ve done and how deep into alcoholism I am. No one knew this and I got so many comments from friends saying they never suspected a thing. I did a great job of hiding this dark side of myself. But I posted to humiliate myself and keep myself accountable through my sobriety. So now, I really want to quit. Not for anyone else but me. My siblings and father are all raging alcoholics who can’t quit. I don’t want to be that anymore. My mom is my rock right now. But I’ve been crying everyday from the thought of losing my soulmate of 12 years. He’s hurt and will hardly text me. I’m having a rough time, and all the love and support in this community has me wanting to reach for some of it too. I’ve started reading This Naked Mind and attended my first AA meeting but I still feel like I’m struggling bad. I’m scare for what the future holds. Sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading.",5

It would appear that everything is a trigger.  

I need to stop drinking.  I am happier when I wake up without the dreaded cotton mouth and headache.   I am happy going outside to do yard work without feeling sick to my stomach.

I’ve struggled to get my drinking under control. I have been in a volatile relationship for a couple of years and the yelling and anger has triggered me to drink to deal with it.  

I have been in therapy and my therapist has suggested that I leave the relationship but i’ve struggled to do so.  

With the Virus and shelter in place…I began drinking again. I was at at least a bottle and a half of wine a day. I hid it from my partner because even if I have ONE glass he says he will leave me. He doesn’t want to “live with an alcoholic”. He can be very angry. He literally told me that if he married me tomorrow and I drank the next day he would immediately divorce me.

However, he’s seen me drinking a few times since he told me I was a crazy alcoholic.. and he just yelled at me. He never really left me.

Anyway.. my point is I stopped drinking again. I went to AA (again). I had 7 days and I went to therapy and my therapist told me that she doesn’t believe I’m an alcoholic. She suggested I try just one glass of wine at dinner as my treat or something… she said she sees me as “abusive alcohol” …as opposed to being an “alcoholic”.

Somehow that got me…and I started to drink that afternoon. If she thinks I’m not an alcoholic…then I guess I am ok to drink?

So what happened? Pressure with work…pressure from my partner and I drank the whole bottle of wine over the course of the day.  

He found the bottle last night in the closet and he told me that I should know that my work problems are really due to my lack of judgement. He said that ALL of my problems are because I’m not making smart decisions and I cause everything myself. And he told me that I should listen to him and I wouldn’t have any problems. That everything is due to my drinking …and my lack of respecting him and his advice.

THESE THINGS are MY work? Why do I need to listen to him? He thinks he knows everything and he’s blaming me non stop. 

I stopped drinking agin. Like I said…I’m on day 2. But I wanted to hear your thoughts on my drinking. Is my therapist right? Am I not an alcoholic?",4

I’m pretty damned proud. Especially considering I’ve been in that hideous cycle of quitting and starting for 11 years. The drunk tank didn’t even motivate me to quit. The DUI put a slight scare into me. Finally I think I just got tired. Tired of being stuck emotionally -I’m middle aged but have the emotional intelligence of a teenager.

I'm one who has a hard time saying no to a drink, and an even harder time saying no to a second and third. Before all the coronavirus stuff, I would drink wine more days than I probably should, and while I stop myself from finishing one bottle, I make my way through most of it and could easily finish it. It's kind of like, if I don't finish a bottle, that's my reasoning for why it's OK. But then the next day, I'll finish that bottle that had a bit left then get a new one and drink it down to the same level, so it's not really valid. I am a smart person but these are the things I tell myself as an excuse. 

Anyway with all the horror surrounding COVID-19, the drinking has ramped up even more. I am lucky enough to be someone that can work from home, and honestly having that wine when 5 PM rolls around has been something I look forward to. I have always suffered from anxiety, and I have mild OCD that often centers around something bad happening to my family. I am scared of them getting the virus. They are taking many precautions but still go to the grocery store, etc. Recently an aunt of mine who was previously cancer free for a while had her cancer come back and will need to start chemo again. It's just like, how am I supposed to deal with all this anxiety? You can look at me and think I have things pretty good. I live with my boyfriend who is loving and caring, and I have been able to work from home . 

It just seems like I am using these things as an escape, and I feel distant from my boyfriend. I feel like I'm trying to get through all this and come out on the other end. I don't dedicate the time I should into making myself feel good, I'm self concious about my body so I don't want to have sex and whatnot. 

So, does anyone have any tips or advice? I know, the obvious answer is to stop drinking. I actually did dry January and although it was a struggle because I felt like I was missing out on something, I experienced the lowest anxiety I had in months. What is wrong with me? Despite this, I am so tempted by a glass of wine that I always indulge.

Still don't know what my wife has decided to do, she has gone no-contact despite our need to resolve some common accounts and services whichever the outcome is for us. I've been working on some projects at a slow pace, but after getting sick my heart just wasn't into doing anything.

My therapist gave me an interesting handout on thinking errors, and the odd thing was that I see some of them applying to me... Hoping we can have in person meetings again soon, the messed up thing for me is that having everything shutdown is making early sobriety much easier for me than it would be otherwise. That said, seeing the flood of posts about day drinking I worry about my friends and family. 

I remember watching one of the Talk Sober youtube livestreams where the hosts mentions even if you have underlying issues, drinking that much to excess for long enough will give someone a drinking problem regardless.

It started small and cute, but it’s been growing and I’m scared it’s going to rip my face off. Today is day 1. Looking for advice.","I’ve been a teacher for a few years.  It’s a stressful job where you have a thousand little interactions a day—a thousand chances to make a kid’s day or screw them up for life.  The first few years, I was a kid too, and I had energy.  I’d work all day and go out with my friends and be fine the next day.

After a while, it became habit to come home at 4pm and go to my home bar and make myself something.  I switched school to a really tough one, where it was a losing battle most days.  Decision fatigue. Enough to drive me to drink. 

I binged Mad Men and saw that Don Draper wore a tie and drank old fashioneds.  I was already wearing a tie, so I figured what the hell.  It made me feel classy. After a while it became a habit and a reward—make it through a day battling disrespectful kids in the classroom and there was a cocktail waiting at home. 

After a while, I stopped muddling and measuring. I switched to gin for a bit but it made me sleepwalk and I had to stop.  So straight whiskey became my thing.  Five cubes, then filled to the top.  

I moved on to a better school, but the habit of the first drink after work followed me.  Because of our schedules, I had three hours alone before my wife got home.  

Red flags appeared.  I began switching up the liquor stores I went to because I didn’t want to be judged by how often I went in.  I have three on heavy rotation.  It’s a high wire act...

My wife knows I drink.  My tolerance lets me hide it pretty well.  I try my best to turn the one or two she knows about into four or five when she’s not looking.  She doesn’t confront me about it and I’m not aggressive or dangerous.  I can be loud and say stupid things but she forgives and I don’t remember. 

The thing is, I don’t want to be this guy anymore.  I’ve seen the physical effects of alcohol.  I know it runs in the family.  I carry them around in the sixty extra pounds around my waist.  I rarely get a decent nights sleep, which really helps at school.  I’m just not the best version of myself. 

But I can’t shake those daily cravings.  That first drink is my favorite thing in the world.  The sound of ice in a glass, sitting down with that glass...the way it feels in my hand.  

Now that we’re quarantined, I’m stuck at home with the bottle in the corner...pouring that first drink earlier and earlier in the day.  

There have been a lot of day 1s on my own.  I feel like this is a crossroads though, and I need some advice.  I’ve read all the books about habits, but it seems I can’t fix myself on my own.  

It’s like I’ve been keeping a pet tiger.  It started young and cute but it’s been growing and growing and one day it’s going to rip my face off. I’m scared.

At first it was really difficult then it became easy because I was pumped up on the huge achievement of sobriety. Then it became difficult again when I realised that sobriety includes long periods of boredom, exhaustion and inescapable frustration that trigger big cravings. I just have to keep deciding not to drink.

But all in all life is so much better for me. The sober brain thinks so much differently. I am better at planning comprehensively, I'm less likely to get overwhelmed struggling to get from one day to the next. The best thing for me about my brain now is that I have many more ideas. I picked up my very lapsed piano practice and I keep having a lot of musical ideas. Basic songwriting was my most deeply held aspiration that I believed could never happen and since getting completely sober it's happening like a normal part of life. This is a huge change for me that represents a fulfilling creative outlet for the rest of my life that would never have happened if I stayed drunk.

Since becoming sober I've had a lot of intense regretful memories flooding my mind. Not even just the alcoholic type but all sorts of regrets throughout my life from as far back as childhood. I think part of the reason I was drinking was to blot all that out. Not that I am likely to have especially more to regret than other people just that I'm bad at processing feelings of guilt. Recently I decided to start letting those memories go when they come to mind rather than hating myself over them. I can't get anything else out of ruminating on all this lifetime of regrets. Some of those things happened 25 years ago! I don't have any problem accepting responsibility for who I was but I don't relate to that person anymore and I think it's more important to try to be a good person today. I think it's OK to take a ""fresh start"", this is where I am now and I need to make the most of the rest of my life and just do my best.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. 

Maybe you're new to \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.  

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent**.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset! 

 What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.  

This post goes up at:  US—Night/Early Morning  Europe—Morning  Asia and Australia—Evening/Night  A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

**Good Morning Sobernauts!**

We’re half way through the week! And oddly for me, my last day of work this week.  I got a few extra days off for spring as “goodwill” from my employer.

Not sure what to do with these extra days off... pitch a tent in the living room???  I think that could be super fun, but maybe it’s a sign I’m getting some serious cabin fever!

I’m looking for new ways to enjoy good weather, the outdoors,  and nature.  In the past, I always used it as an excuse to drink but it’s amazing on its own.

Stay safe, and enjoy another day of sober life!",85

It has been tough for me to make this decision because I feel that I mostly have my alcohol use under “control”.  I have counted every unit I’ve consumed for the past year.  You can check that out here.

[Alcohol unit calendar](https://imgur.com/a/i0r2n3o)

Okay so I do have some weeks and days that are pretty over the top considering the recommended units per week is 14. 

For reference a bud light is 1.5, an ounce of 40% spirits is 1, and a glass of red wine is about 2.

If you checked the link I’d say that I average about 35-40 per week.

So far I haven’t experienced any health issues from consuming this amount but I don’t feel like it is something my body can sustain.  I notice that a lot of my decisions and a good majority of the situations I’m in have alcohol present.  

I have a brother who is two years sober but before that he was what AA considered a “low bottom drunk”.  Before he became sober I was almost certain we were going to lose him.  He was drinking a 750ml of vodka a day.  I try not to compare myself to him because I feel like that is a losing mindset but I can’t help but to say “Well at least I’m not that bad”. 

So my question is, is there anyone who gave it up before they felt it got “really” bad?  And what gives you the strength to stay sober? 

I’m grateful in advance for any answers, support, or advice y’all can give.

So, I was wondering when did it get easier for you, especially during the tentative beginning of sobriety? 
I know that it will always be something I have to work with and be careful about, as many others.

My anxiety used to be out of control and although I can't claim to now be anxiety free, I am able to accept and process those feeling instead of drinking myself to numbness. Given what's happened in the world over the last month(s), I can only imagine what kind of debilitated state I'd be in were I still drinking. When I was drunk I used to have a hot temper and would lash out at those I loved the most. I'm now able to control myself, and think before I react.

Physically I have more energy, I am no longer bloated, and I've lost quite a few pounds. I used to binge on junk food after I binged on beer. When I stopped drinking I lost my cravings for the late night junk food too. I've been able to start working out again since I'm no longer hungover every day. My blood pressure has gone back to normal and my pants fit again.

My advice to anyone looking to stop drinking and to bring light into the darkness is to be kind to yourself and be patient. You have to allow yourself the space and time to heal. Look inward and work on your mental fitness. Learn how to meditate and learn about mindfulness. These two things, especially mindfulness, have brought me out of some very dark places.

Three weeks ago when I started semi-quarantining in earnest (I still go to work every 4th day) they were almost non-existent. I felt like I was crushing it, and everything I read and heard seemed to point to it just getting easier with time. Maybe under normal circumstances it would. Obviously the isolation and inherent boredom hasn't helped, and I keep telling myself that if I give in now I'll likely spend the rest of this time-- however long it lasts-- drinking. That's been my mainstay. That and all the other less than great things I'm doing to fill the void: I feel like I'm eating tons of sugar, and I'm smoking a lot more. It's just so frustrating to see people all over social media posting and joking about their day drinking, quarantine happy hours, and nightly six-packs. I've been doing a weekly group video chat with my college friends and all of them are drinking every time. They don't know that I've stopped, I've never brought it up. A big reason why I decided to quit was because of the space that I felt alcohol was taking up in my life, between sitting around drinking, sleeping poorly, being hungover, needing a nap to compensate for the poor sleep. But now I feel like it's still managing to take up significant space in the form of cravings and my subsequent constant convincing myself not to drink. I have this feeling that I'll cave before this is all said and done. Just not tonight.

Thanks for reading my frustration rant.",15

I was sober recently again however this COVID thing has really hit me hard, with no gym, no social structure, no dog parks, and everyone talking about how during quarantine drinking is normal, I fell and I fell hard. Yesterday I blacked out hard and my dad held me in his arms and cried because I couldn’t stop talking about wanting to harm myself. I woke up, told my sister I can’t do this anymore and went to the ER. First of all.. holy crap am I so thankful for the amazing people there. The nurses and doctors didn’t judge me or shame me, they all were so kind and made me feel glad for coming in. As I was leaving they told me that there was no need for thanks, and I could thank them by staying healthy. 

I feel really really scared. I’m scared because I’ve quit so many times and I always fall back down. I’m scared because I don’t want to fall back down again. It hurts too much and I fall so hard. I am scared. However I can’t not try, I have so many people in my life who are routing for me. An amazing girlfriend, amazing parents, sisters, brother in laws.

I was pretty pumped up with my posts weeks 1-4 but lately my mind is starting to mess with me. 
So this last weekend was wrestlemania weekend. I am a huge wrestling fan. It’s a lifelong thing and brings me a great deal of happiness. I don’t thing I’ve ever seen a mania sober though. It is usually a day of over indulgence in drinks and food followed by a blacked out night and painful work the next day. My head was rationalizing how I could drink and get away with it. “What’s a few airplane shots?” “Wine wouldn’t be a problem you don’t even like wine” “just for wrestlemania weekend then back on the wagon”. 
I have avoided the liquor and beer isles in the grocery stores like the plague but I “accidentally” cruised down one when shopping for my snacks. My head was REALLY fucking with me. It has been lately. I looked at my I am sober app and realized I went from “easy” everyday to almost a full week of “questionable” or even “struggling hard”. Anyway...I didn’t drink anything. I did however eat a lot of food but it was health food. It got me again today. I went by a Mediterranean cafe to get my favorite chicken schwarma pita and saw their drink section. They had wines that came in a normal looking soda can and hard kombucha. I thought my wife wouldn’t even realize that was wine if she saw that can, and kombucha is really good for you nothing wrong with that. I rushed home!
BEGONE BRAIN DEMONS. focusing on the fact that today is six weeks and enjoying the hell out of my chicken schwarma.

I don't know if it will be forever, my first goal was to get through today, the next is to make it a week and see what happens.

I sought help through a behavioural psychologist and learned new ways to deal with anxiety and panic. Things were ok for a while. The past few years I decided to change careers, I now have my dream job but my profession has a high burnout rate and is extremely stressful. For the past year, my drinking habits have escalated to drinking pretty much every evening to wind down from the stress of the day, The past few months I have been drinking a whole bottle of wine in front of the tv when i get home each night. This pandemic has changed all of our lifestyles and I feel anxiety and panic rising. The past 4 days have been spent video calling friends and family and enjoying drinks together. Yesterday I decided enough was enough. I have been lurking on here for a while and I knew the time was coming when I would be ready to try it. Today was ok. I did some work in the yard and I cooked a nice meal for dinner. Both of these tasks would normally have me reaching for a cold beer or a glass of wine, but instead I had 2 bottles of alcohol free beer and now, I am settling down for the evening and know that I will not drink today. Tomorrow is a new day. Thank you all so much for being here and not drinking with me. It gives me strength and determination.",9

We've been around several of our friends ( they all drink ) since we started our sobriety and we stayed strong...

We love our friends but I truly feel that once the stay at home order is over and the parties and restaurants open again we will get bored sitting around what is pretty much gonna be a drunk fest. I can laugh and hang out sober and be comfortable but I feel it will be a drop in to say hi...no reason or desire to stay?

I know I'm rambling but I think you get my point lol. I guess I'm asking is what should I expect or should I not expect anything? Any thoughts or words are greatly appreciated as always!

I used to drink a lot. 1 or 2 bottles of wine a day from 2018 to 2019. Sometimes 3. I was bored. I was lonely. Alone in my apartment.

Then I eventually cut it down. From 1 to 2 bottles of wine a day to 1 bottle a day. Then put in 3 or 4 cans of beer instead of wine. Sometimes wine, sometimes wine + beer, sometimes beer.

I tried reducing even more by limiting myself to drink once a week. It didn't work. I ended up binge drinking.

Then one day, my mom gave me pocket money to buy a fridge. I ended up buying wine instead of buying the fridge.

After drinking that wine, bought by my mom's money, it got me thinking. It was like, snap. I thought ""I am drinking all the money away - the money of my loved ones and mine. I could help them with that money. They didn't get that money easily. They had to work hard for it and I just drank it away in one go. Alcohol in no way have improved my life""

For the first time in my life, I **regretted**

Then from that day on (9th March), I completely stopped drinking, to this day. I wanted to save money to buy good things for my loved ones, to buy the VR headset I want, to be healthy and beautiful again. I **wanted** to stop.  Because of that mindset and concrete reasons, I had zero wish to drink since that day.

It's like when you *know* something will happen. That gut feeling. People offered to drink with me, teased me with all the alcohol and cocktail, and I had zero wish to drink.

I'm so happy today, with all the saved money and improved health. :D

My name is Rob and I am on Day 3 of my recovery from alcoholism.,"Hey everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to share my story and get the support from others who are in my situation. I am a 32 year old man who has been drinking for over a decade. Since I was in my early 20s I have always noticed I was not like other people around me. I’d drink more than most if not all around me. I would drink frequently. Sometimes alone in my basement. If helped me feel more confident and more social. It calmed my anxiety. For years it was impossible to go a night spring or summer night without a drink on the front porch. Or before and during a new date , or hanging around large groups of people. Coming from a single parent home and with a father who was a severe alcoholic has been completely out of my life for over 15 years I should have known the signs.  
I saw a major spike in my alcohol intake after an ex girlfriend and I found ourselves pregnant in December of 2018. She opted for an abortion, and while I understand it’s always a woman’s choice the idea of my Unborn child being killed took a part of me I have never gotten back. I drank everyday all day for weeks when I wasn’t working or off. It effected the relationship and I was back at my mothers after quitting my job and binge drinking at my ex girlfriends throughout all of January and February of 2019 and alone. 
I took control of my life and tried to convince myself I could control my drinking. I joined my brothers gym, lost 25 lbs in almost 3 months, dieted , and was down to drinking maybe one or two nights a week lightly, and never alone. 
In June of 2019 when everything seemed to be going great, I met the woman of my dreams. The most beautiful women I have ever met in my entire life. She checks every box, and inside and out is the most beautiful, intelligent, witty, adorable, interesting, admirable woman I’ve ever dreamed of. My dream girl come to life. We fell fast and hard. The downside was she was still in the early stages of a major divorce and she admittedly wasn’t ready for a relationship. 
The stress of dealing with her divorce , and watching the best relationship and girl I had ever been with begin to hit bumps and frequently weighed on me heavily. My alcohol intake increased to points it never had. I was drinking daily , and heavily. There was a night a pro wrestling ppv was on and a drank an entire fifth of Gin. I couldn’t control myself and within a month she was the first person I had ever dated to call me out on my drinking. She noticed a severe problem and between her divorce and my drinking we spent the coming months trying to get it right and get me sober. Without health insurance my options were limited but I found the strength to stay sober for just over 2 months. But by the end of September my ways had manipulated her and I both into believing I could manage and control my drinking. 
After a few month long depression in November and December and so much support from my partner, New Years Eve came and I went overboard again. Another promise broken to her, and within weeks she had left me to focus on her own issues and needed to step aside from our relationship. 
My habits and drinking persisted and while my ex and I had remained friendly and in one another’s lives, I refused to give up on her. She was and still is my best friend and my rock. On Thursday Feb 27 she had told me she thought she needed time away from me and may pursue other options. Upon this news I went on a spiral that weekend unlike anything and I on Saturday March 1st in the AM hours left the oven on and passed out and almost burnt my mothers house down. That’s how bad the drinking had got. 
That morning my ex had popped up just three days later saying she missed me and wanted to fully commit to me. I hadn’t been fully honest with her about the amount I was drinking during our time away and she had thought based off many other behavior changes I made for the positives things would be okay. As the quarantine began in March I moved back into her apartment so we could be together and we had talks about the drinking. It started off with me again convincing her I had it under control. And in just two weeks (two and a half weeks ago)  I had drank a half of liter of vodka and she was pretty much done. I committed to being sober for her and us. Three days later I had my first therapy session over the phone with my new therapist (I hadn’t had therapy in years) and upon talking to her I had begun to understand the severity of my alcoholism. It finally got through to me after years of denial. My girlfriend then sat with me and we spoke in detail about how it has effected her and her fear that alcohol would ruin and end our love story for good, and possibly my life. 
Guilt and anger , fear, confusion all set in because I knew everyone was right all these years about my drinking. I knew I wasn’t like everyone else. I felt guilty. I felt embarrassed. And the days went on and I would get more angry. Irritable. Sensitive. I would struggle severely with my thoughts and my attitude changed toward my girlfriend. She tried so hard to be a support system and I was impossible this last week. It came to a head Saturday when during a wrestling event Saturday I had a relapse. She insisted I didn’t drink but I kept telling her “I wanted control and I wanted to prove I wasn’t an alcoholic. I wanted to end my relationship with alcohol on my terms and on a positive note”. I drank just a pint of whiskey but on a empty stomach and two weeks sober it was enough to send me over the edge. There was a very severe altercation between her and I and I was emotionally and mentally abusive .. she then asked me to leave and she was kicking me out and driving me to my mothers. My refusal to leave lasted an hour and a half and she felt she was put in danger , felt unsafe , she was done tolerating my alcoholic behaviors and my denial. I tried to put a knife to my throat and said without her I didn’t want to live. And if I was truly an alcoholic I was too ashamed to live. I have not , and am not suicidal so this behavior was absolutely blindsided as was my girlfriend. Alcohol had completely taken over my mind and body and almost ended my life. That was it. I ended up back at my mothers this past Saturday night and in the midst of my biggest intervention in my life. 
Today , I am 3 days sober. It took losing the love and greatest support system of my life , my dream girl, the apartment and cats of ours and of my dreams , the home we were building and potentially her forever. She is not committed to anything yet but after two days of communication and her returning my things to me and beginning to find peace from the situation on her own without me there. And mostly the knife, the fact I cannot control myself, for me to finally wake up. 
I am an alcoholic. It is unfortunately in my blood. I’m no longer embarrassed or ashamed. I will not fight it. I do not want to ever drink again in my life. Alcohol has taken years of my life , many friends , some family from me, has taken jobs, opportunities , thousands upon thousands upon tens of thousands of dollars over the years from me, and almost 12 years of my life. My relationship with alcohol has ended and I’m now in the early stages of my sobriety and recovery. 
On google I researched the most effective place to seek support and this was by a landslide the most effective and well reviewed source. So I wanted to share my story. 
If you have taken the time to read this all I appreciate you so much , I cannot thank you enough. I am determined to beat this, stronger than I’ve ever felt and more positive and brave than ever before to beat this. I have chosen this journey with every piece of my heart and any support is appreciated. Thank you and I hope you are all safe during this time in the world and are finding peace in your own personal sobriety journeys. -Rob / Redemption615",69

It wasn't a complete shock, but neither did I see it coming: we had furloughed 30% late last week. It's shocking how quickly everything has gone south. We're a very established organization with sound financials, but we simply have next to zero revenue coming in right now.

This would be so easy to drink over. After all, I'm home alone for the day. But I'm not going to. 

I'm counting on gratitude and optimism to get me through today. Optimism because I truly believe that I will have a job to come back to. I'm valuable and appreciated. And gratitude because I am still so fortunate. My family will not be devastated, as so many have been. I have a ton of PTO in the bank, I'll be able to file for unemployment, and my company is continuing to pay 100% of my benefits. This is going to be difficult, but manageable...unless I fuck it up by choosing to drink.

My wife is asleep. The sunrise was clouded in so she went back to sleep while I maintained my routine. I stroll through the kitchen and smile at the bottle of tequila on the fridge. Yesterday, at the one limited grocery store near where we're hunkering down, there was not a decent bottle of Rose to be found. Now, this is the first world gripe of a recovering alcoholic here. I'm at the point where I'm cool with my wife having a bottle of wine in the house. We keep vermouth to cook too. She'll drink one over the course of the week or maybe not quite finish it. She is not me. But when there was nothing to her standards, I simply said ""Why not get a decent bottle of booze? You practice self control with the wine and I know you haven't had tequila in forever."" Now maybe you can see this coming, I used to drink tequila. Obviously. But I used to drink Rose too. Difference is, I'd never go sneak a shot of Rose. Or so she thinks. She agrees the tequila would be nice but questions whether I'll be tempted by it. This was unusual. I work (or did til Covid) in a restaurant where alcohol is freely accessible all the time. I've been to all kinds of parties, hosted some too. And there's been plenty of boozes around. Access was a first priority for me to learn to avoid being tempted by. But she asked and I said No. But it got it on my mind. Why did she ask me if I'd be tempted by that bottle.

What she doesn't know is that while I look out on the ocean on one side, there's two things behind me in this house. A bottle of tequila and an amazing woman. As I look out to the ocean in front, symbolic of the future and unknown possibilities, I know I can only take one of those two on the journey forward with me. And I have to choose each day which companion I'll invite along. Thing is, if I choose wrong only once, I may never have the freedom to make that choice again. I've been at death's doorstep in ICU with the bottle as my companion, but she was there to pull me out, bring me to the brink of the ocean and the possibilities of life that await, and she has no idea how easy it is to smile at that bottle of tequila and know that with it I have nothing, but just leaving it there, I can have EVERYTHING!

2020-04-07 10:09:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fwl53h/3_weeks_etoh_free_lessons/,3 Weeks Etoh Free - Lessons,"1. Problems Don't Go Away, They Just Get Worse

Biggest lesson here - all those things I was drinking away just got ignored, but now they're coming out to bite me. Biggest thing is financial struggles. I have a ton of credit cards and other debts that I haven't been able to pay from business stuff that didn't work out (yet). Guess what? They're still there. So now I have to pull my big girl panties up and get this stuff taken care of. 100%. Right now I'm only working 1 day per week so a lot of it will still have to wait, but I have made the decision to create a budget, make sure that I pay all the necessary bills to keep the household in order (utilities, mortgage, groceries, gas), and call all the other companies to see if I can work things out - one bill at a time. Yay for no longer hitting ""ignore, ignore, ignore"" whenever a collector calls and reaching for a glass of wine.

&#x200B;

2. My Mood is INSANELY positive

Things that used to stress me completely out (like the above - bills), now don't seem so insurmountable. I'm only 33. So what if this bill stress lasts a few years and ruins my credit? I still have a house, a car, a husband, and kids who love me. At least now I'm not drinking my problems away and I can deal with them in the best way possible. Other people have been through worse - bankruptcy, etc., and I have made mistakes, but I own those now. My mood doesn't get ruined by the fact that I have....GASP....problems to deal with. It seems like before I couldn't even deal with ANY emotion that came my way, and now I feel like I can handle my own life again. And partially due to....

3. Prescription Drugs and Therapy are safer than ETOH

If you are a self medication queen like I was ... you probably came up with a lot of excuses for why it was okay to drink alcohol when you felt anxiety or stress (it's natural! Jesus drank wine! It's been done since the dawn of time! Ever since someone figured out that leaving grapes in the sun created this drink that made you loopy! Blah blah blah) but what I've realized is that medications (currently taking an SNRI) actually work for my mood for an entire 24 hour period versus the 20 minutes that alcohol lasts. Furthermore, they do have side effects - yes - but when compared to ruining my liver and increasing risk of cancer, the side effects are a lot easier to swallow. It's a crazy amount of denial that I had to be in to think badly of taking meds when I was essentially taking another addictive substance that worked way more poorly and had worse ""side effects"" if you even want to call it that. It's definitely that cognitive dissonance that happens when you become addicted to something that talks you into continuing to use it despite all the harm it's causing. My therapist also helped me discover all of this about myself - so yay for her! And yay for my doctor and yay for SNRIs.

4. Mornings are good again

There have been brief periods in my life where I liked mornings, but my drinking days were not included in those times. Mornings usually suck, especially after a bottle of vino. Now, mornings are pretty darn good. I wake up feeling good most of the time, and I have a little time for myself and to drink my coffee before I get started on whatever I have to do for the day. Yes, I am working some - not a lot - but a bit. So I get what I have to do completely finished and then I can watch YouTube videos, movies with my husband, or hang out with my kids. Speaking of which...

5. I'm a better mother

I'm not trying to rush the kids to bed so that I can get my wine down. I'm more patient with them and kind. Maybe a combo of the anxiety / depression medications and the lack of alcohol. But either way, I do feel like I am actually loving on them and giving them the attention they need from their mother. I feel like a good mom again. I remember some days while drinking accidentally hurting them or yelling at them. Nothing terrible or abusive, but one time I reached behind me because my daughter was there and accidentally hit her. I feel terrible about a lot of these moments but they always happened while I was drinking. Also most fights with my husband were when I was drinking. I'm definitely seeing clearly now that while I was drinking I was not the kind of person I want to be.

&#x200B;

So that's all for today. That should be enough to motivate me to continue to stay sober.",7

I was one of those “high functioning alcoholics” code word for succeeding at everything possible to hide my drinking. Running, working late, keeping the house clean etc. I was also “the life and soul of the party” another complete lie as my attempts to keep people drinking and turning the music up I’ve later discovered are just embarrassing and annoying. 

I had completely built my whole social life around drinking and was terrified when I first realised “I’m going to have to quit alcohol forever”. There was no way I was going to go to something like AA. No offence to these amazing places but just not for me. So I started the usual bullshit year of limiting drinks, only on weekend crap! This did not work in fact things got worse. I was polishing off a litre of spirts a week in secret and your usual evening drinks on top (me and my wife might have a glass of wine and I’d nip to the toilet and have a swig in secret). I’d often drink vodka in the shower as my hangovers were so bad.

Long story short things came crashing down when my wife had noticed I’d been replacing her fancy gin bottles with new ones and my rock bottom came not long after when I went on a drinking session with the guys but I carried on in the morning and ended up loosing everyone then going to the pub on my own etc etc

I decided I had to stop but my withdrawals were so bad my wife had to feed me wine whilst I spewed out of both ends on the loo. A real class act.

I quit in my mind and this involved saying goodbye to that entire part of my life. And this was a monumental task. Drinking was one of my favourite things in the whole world! I remember I found a place on my own and just sobbing I said goodbye, it was exactly like a break up.

I told my wife everything and we got rid off all the booze in the house. She quite too (she was never really a drinker) but this support truly did help. She also bought be a really nice wrist band, every day I’d wake up and say the mantra “just for today, I’m not going to drink”. I don’t wear or think about that wrist band now but it helped a lot in the first 6 months. I was using an elastic band so she bought it as a gift.

I’ve waffled on enough but here is an extract of some notes I used to make in the early days. 

“Remember the person you will become if you don’t stop drinking, when the next drink becomes the most important thing. When 100% version of you drowns, and you are diluted down to 10% you, and the dregs of you are all that’s left.”

Hope this helps someone just starting out xxx

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. 

Maybe you're new to \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.  

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent**.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset! 

 What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.  

This post goes up at:  US—Night/Early Morning  Europe—Morning  Asia and Australia—Evening/Night  A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

**Good Morning Sobernauts!**

Before quitting drinking, I tried every approach I could think of to moderate.  I tried just “taking it easy”, yeah right, I tried mobile apps, I tried taking pictures of my drinks, I asked friends and family to stop me, I even made a custom watch face for my Garmin.  One of the quirkiest ideas was a bracelet with multicoloured beads that came in a set and could work like a subtle counter.  

The problem with all these well intentioned approaches was that, without fail, I’d get to a point in the night where I didn’t care how much I had already been drinking, I just wanted more.

Today is 60 days, my longest streak in over 15 years of drinking, and I wear that bracelet every day as a reminder of the ridiculous and embarrassing places addition took me.  When recovering, somehow I forget the low points.

What keeps you strong? What are your best tips for treasuring sobriety when the going gets tough?",126

Anyway, 9 months ago I was awakened in the woods the morning after passing out from beer & wine on a “pit stop” in a park while biking. What the actual shit was I thinking, haha!

The last few months have been a roller coaster, but my sobriety has contributed to personal growth and emotional discernment, somewhat better health, more marriage clarity although probably in worse shape, a promotion at work, saving a good amount of money and shame per day. 

Also the thought of being forced to work from home like this but while neck-deep in uncontrolled drinking scares the crap out of me. At least video conferences don’t transmit the “smell” but they certainly would slurred speech 😛

Anyway, I hope to bring a little cheer or motivation to anyone in need. We’re all in this together. What better way to protect ourselves than by not visiting the booze aisle or liquor store, not weakening our immune systems with poison, and keeping more much-needed money in our pockets!

These conditions are perfect active alcoholic conditions.

I’ve had difficult moments particularly through lonely ness and lack of productivity / engagement in what I’m doing.

Keep replaying how tough it was to quit and my worst moments in active alcoholism. 

I justified so much drinking. Drinking everyday. Drinking bottles of vodka.

My husband surprised me by cooking lobster tail and steak, and had a chocolate cake for dessert. I ugly cried y’all. He’s been so supportive. This whole year he has been the best cheerleader I could ask for. I told him he deserved the nice meal as much as I did, because he’s done a lot of work with me. 

I remember the first day I was sober. I was in living Korea, binging, ashamed and miserable. I woke up so hungover, and my husband was so hurt and upset and I had no idea why. I poured over this subreddit the entire day. Alternating between crying and denial of what I knew to be true: I have a drinking problem. 

We went to the cherry blossom festival and I was so hungover I couldn’t enjoy it. I just wanted to vomit the whole day, but it felt very symbolic. Spring, new beginnings. 

Some days have been more difficult than others, and life has certainly thrown some curveballs this year, but I did it. 
I’m going to keep doing it.

Our bodies are amazing and our minds can take us to depths of every spectrum.

Learning to cope with change and issues without alcohol interrupting those feelings. I remain a student but am willing to practice.

Be kind to myself

Find that comfort in my own skin

Don't bite more than I can chew

A reflection on my rehab roommate.","I was released from a 30-day rehab program almost a year ago. The day I was admitted, another woman came in right behind me. She was poised and displayed such motherly compassion, I found her to be an inspiration in changing how I viewed other addicts. We had an admit who had shot up in the parking lot before being booked. When she was coming down, her missed shot grew infected and extremely painful. I couldn't stand the screaming, but Sonia iced her foot and talked her down with motherly love.

Sonia was recovering from stage four breast cancer, and trying to maintain sobriety while taking pills that made her bones quake. She only ate fish on Fridays being a devote catholic, and in the back of mind I remember her sitting with me while I finished puzzles watching Live PD.

Her obituary says that she died from liver failure. Her husband forced her to live with her parents after a series of bottle-drunk episodes. She admitted herself into rehab so she would be able to see her daughter graduate, and potentially throw her a graduation party. Sometimes she'd ask me what the appropriate setting would be for a bunch of teenagers to celebrate in was.

I miss her.

She had struggled with witnessing her sibling passing away at a young age, thinking that if there was only something else she would have done as a child... her sibling would still be alive. We had actually lived relatively close to each other, and sometimes I wonder if I would've been persistent on her coming to AA with me, Sonia would still be here, but I had relapsed myself.

Sonia, wherever you are, you have always been an angel, and I hope you're finding peace with your sister.

I was so nervous and I hadn't seen him since I was a lot younger but he recognized me instantly. We talked and I told him my story and he made me so much more comfortable.

 A year later this past January he's handing me my 1 year chip. We always chatted at meetings and on the phone so I knew about his health issues but they just got worse after a procedure he went to have in Feb. Today I find out from my cousin (his daughter) that he has passed after getting out of the ICU 2 weeks ago.

I hadn't seen him since Feb right before he went into ICU and no one was allowed to visit with this pandemic doing on. If he wasn't at that meeting that night I might not have stuck around and would be drinking still. Him being there made it more comfortable for me and he made everyone laugh in meetings every day.

I didn’t have a rock bottom experience - no arrest, break up, health consequence, etc. Although the past year has been pretty smooth and uneventful with regards to drinking, it has not always been that way! I’ve had all sorts of shitty experiences with alcohol and have exhibited some very negative behavior while under the influence. 

I decided to stop drinking completely due to therapy. I’ve been in therapy for over a year now and have made a lot of progress. I really want to preserve this progress and continue to advance it, and I just decided that drinking wouldn’t contribute to this progress at all. At best, it would do nothing and at its worst it could completely derail me.

Anyways, due to the past year of moderation I originally thought it would be relatively easy. But now I’m thinking that my experience moderating my drinking might be working against me. I know that if I were to go have a drink, I’d likely not get drunk. Nothing terrible would happen. I’d have one or two and then probably go several weeks before having another. Somewhat paradoxically, this makes the temptation to drink a little stronger!

Do any of you have stories of success that involve a “soft” rock-bottom? Or are there any of you who pursued sobriety after successfully moderating? I’ve made the commitment and very much want to stick to it. I think it would be detrimental for my mental health not to follow through. Any recommendations or advice would be much appreciated.",5
2020-04-06 19:01:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fw911w/my_experiment_with_moderation/,My experiment with moderation.,"I remember hitting my rock bottom in 2016. My family and friends had all lost all confidence in me. I was suicidal and did not have any will to live anymore. Alcohol, pills, anything just to numb the pain.

I managed to drag myself into a rehab facility and 21 days later I was on a road that would see me earn my 3 years clean. Psychiatrists and specialists were genuinely concerned about my withdrawals as I had been consuming vast quantities daily for years. Withdrawal was hell.

Lets fast forward to the last 6 months. During my years of sobriety my friends slowly regained my trust. Friends that I considered heavy drinkers had matured, hit their early 30's and were consuming alcohol in moderation. I started to experiment with moderation - and can you believe it, I managed it, on social occasions.

Since Covid efforts started a few weeks ago, isolation and pure boredom lead me to start drinking alone at home on a daily basis - be it in reasonable quantities. All was well - until I tried stopping. That very same withdrawals that doctors feared might kill me in 2016 was back - after only 2 weeks of 4 drinks a day.

For a week now, I have been failing to stay sober, as my body could not handle the withdrawals. As I type this I have 48 hours, and I never want to go through this hell again.

TL;DR - I believe alcohol abuse is a progressive disease and that time does not heal the changes the poison does to your body and brain. I am an alcoholic, I have a disease. Moderate drinking is not possible for me and I believe it may kill me the next time I try it.",10

Drinking alone is very bad for me, probably drinking socially as well but I’m not sure yet since it is so much better than drinking alone when it comes to my moods. Either way, i will be alone for many months now and if i start drinking again i think i will become completely dependent like i used to be very quickly. 

Right now the best i can do is not drink “for now”, and i think i will definitely slip up a few times (usually i end up drinking every few weeks and regret it immensely because my depression becomes so much deeper and thick). At the same time i think if i drink i will relapse self harm because those two go hand in hand for me, and i haven’t self harmed in almost 5 months so I’m really trying hard to keep behaviors like this down. It is really hard seeing the posts about drinking all day through the quarantine, it’s honestly so weird to me when i see that and it’s passed off as normal when to me it seems very dark and depressing. Right now it’s been probably a month and a half since i last drank.

I hope y'all are holding up okay. Like many others, I had this hopeful feeling to use this time to right myself when I lost my job due to COVID. I've been off for about a month and I have to say... it has been the complete opposite of productive. Some days (very few and far between) are better than others. I will work out, read, create... but most days I am flattened by my anxiety and a lack of motivation. Drinking and using was the easiest way to cure the boredom and it took over my evenings.

Anywho, after a rough weekend (sorry body, I will treat you better...) I am once again on day 2 and starting fresh...

In my toolkit I have:- This subreddit- Podcasts (open to suggestions!)- The Untethered Soul (book)- I used to love to cook so... I will take that up again.

Honestly the hardest thing is actually doing the things that are healthier for me, rather than just reaching for the bottle or being a sad sack of couch potato. Thinking of seeking out Online Therapy as well. I have a sober friend that I may confide in to help me along, too?

Also open to suggestions of Online Meetings or perhaps people who do Instagram Live chats? Seems to be pretty popular right now.

Thank you and grateful for all of you! I will not drink with you today. <3

And acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation—some fact of my life —unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing, happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy.

I have a drinking problem and I know it. For the past year I keep trying to do those 1 month sober things and I never make it. I’ve made it up to 14 days sober and then always given in. I’m 31, steadily drank for the past 10 years, luckily I had two kids during that time and I did remain sober during pregnancies. I’m not the type of alcoholic that has been in legal trouble, but I’m the mommy wineoholic type and I really hate it. 

Here’s what it looks like every time I try to get sober. First two days a lot of self loathing, next week feeling pretty good, I always lose about 7 lbs and feel better and happier than ever. Around day 10-14 somehow I’m faced with an opportunity that I can’t imagine not having a drink for, it may be seeing an old friend or doing some activity that just spikes my need for a drink. I feel so confident that I won’t forget how good it feels to be so sober that I let myself have that drink. Then I go through a “that wasn’t so bad I’ll just try to control how much I drink the next night.” This followed by me not taking any nights off and I will wake up in the middle of the night vowing to stop drinking again and I’ll be sober forever this time. Which this goes on for about 14 days till I get back to where I am today trying to quit again. It’s such a vicious cycle. 

This time I called my EAP service with my job to hopefully talk to a counselor about it or try just something new to make it real this time. I know it’s an issue but I am never motivated enough to keep saying no to boos.

Saturday and Sunday were no-call-no-shows at work as a result, and I just got out of the hospital last night at 6 in the evening. I have since had a conversation with all of my housemates and some of my family and we've got a couple plans in motion for me to get the help I need.

I have, since returning home last night, cleaned up all the bottles and cans from my room, dumped all of the rest of the alcohol I had apparently stashed away, taken my door off its hinges, and general cleaned up my room.

I am on day 3 right now and I feel like a giant idiot because this isnt the first time I quit.  I've been doing pretty alright.  I have zofran and that helped the last few days.  But today I didnt take anything.  Wole up fine, felt ok and then about 4 hours after waking up felt horrible nausea.  Felt like my brain tingled a little.  Got the urge to just shake my hands out and my feet and hands got cold.  My heart started racing and I started having really scary thoughts.  I have anxiety to begin with so I coached myself through that a bit.  I haven't been sleeping well.  I took my zofran and I'm just waiting for it to kick in.  I wasn't an everyday drinking.  I would say I'd drink two bottles of wine every 2 to 3 nights and I'd binge.  I'm scared to do this alone but also too scared to go to a doctor during these times.  Any advice?

If your here and and a part of you still thinks alcohol is what makes life more fun, what gives it that extra boost, what bonds you to others, I want you to know there's another life you can have! I've never felt more grateful and loved in my entire life, and I KNOW  it's because I'm out from under the fog of alcohol. No longer chasing that perfect feeling of intoxication that I always wanted to have with every damn experience.

I just feel so PRESENT and for once, it's not something I wanna run away from. Life is precious y'all, and it speeds past us faster and faster with each year. Dont waste another second of it being drunk. 

Good luck to everyone! I won't drink with you today!! ♥️",10

I’m in my early 30s, and I’ve been a severe alcoholic since at least age 21.  I have since then consumed between 12 and 24 beers each day.  Before the novel coronavirus began to spread, i was convinced for several months that the only option for me was to go to a detoxification facility, but I was, and still am, genuinely terrified of a life without alcohol.  However based on blood tests I’m already developing liver problems, to the point that my doctor has diagnosed me with alcoholic liver disease.  I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and although my psychiatrist prescribes medications to both manage these and reduce alcohol cravings, I’m finding that my alcohol consumption is worsening.  I have difficulty believing a life without alcohol can be livable and genuinely “happy”.

How can I get myself past these fears and, maybe, help explain to me how a life without alcohol can be livable?

EDIT: Thanks so much to everyone that responded!  From what I can see you’ve provided me with a new perspective.

Unfortunately I was an idiot and took a drink, so I won’t respond further until I’m sober tomorrow.",4

I hope you're all keeping as well as you possibly can during these strange times. As per the title has anyone experienced this phenomena before? To clarify, the symptoms, be they physical or psychological, of a hangover without actually drinking the previous day. For me that includes increased heart rate, headache, mild nausea, irritability, panic attacks, paranoia etc. Well yesterday, that was me, fully hungover without a drop of liquor imbibed. It was awful. I'm over it today, just about, and the whole nastiness of yesterday got me thinking. This situation, being stuck indoors, spending inordinate amounts of time in bed, watching too much Netflix, eating crap food, basically indulging our other vices a bit too much, did that become a trigger for a phantom hangover? I think so.
 All of those are behaviours that my brain normally associates with being actually hungover and I think it got confused and was like, hold up you only do these things when you feel like this, why don't you feel like this, well I'm gonna make you feel like this just to keep things consistent okay? Anyway long story short, has anyone else felt anything like this during all this weirdness? 

I know it could be put down to anxiety but this was different, this, yesterday, was 100% a hangover.
Well thanks for reading and stay safe.",3

I've barely had a chance to really live this new way of life but since I've been trying and super reflective about myself and my ways it has been soo eye opening! I jus had my 30th bday a few days after I joined the group and realized there was a problem with my lifestyle and YES...i got shit faced for my 30th..BUT I wasn't upset at myself after...it just further solidified what I wanted and needed to change! Soo since then, although hasn't been long but I have been very aware of what I'm doing, I've had drinks twice since then and succeeded in only having a few...but noticed how just even a few made me really feel. It was enough! I didn't and don't need to have more. And the more I'm exploring and tasting this much more sober lifestyle...the more I don't even want to drink! Today I woke up early...made my husband breakfast before work...got a bunch of things done before I would normally even wakeup. I am realizing I have soo much more time living this way. I can get up earlier and be soo much more productive! Actually getting things done I want to get done because I'm not wasting my time feeling like shit from having drinks the night before! Yesterday I got all my toys out of the garage (dirtbikes, bicycles, paddle boards) and got everything ready for the season. Felt soo good...felt soo alive...now it's all ready to go whenever I wanna go instead of me last minute..probly a bit hungover, rushing to pump up the tires and trying to leave in a pinch! This sounds like nothing perhaps but it's big for me! I'm just amazed at how in such a short time of exploring this new lifestyle..how much reward there is already and to be had! I have the time I never never thought I had! I can get things done I felt too busy to do before! I feel like I'm excited as hell to be 30 and leave my drunken chaotic 20s behind me! I am sad to say this but I didn't see how unhealthy my thinking was before either. I never thought I could have kids really because I thought how the hell could I be sober and not party for 9 months plus say 6 months of breastfeeding?!? Now I'm soo sad for my old self that I treated that like a normal thought process. It's NOT. I can't believe I let alcohol and partying have that much control over me I would soo easily assume and let the idea/opportunity of having my own damm family be out of reach! NOT ANYMORE...i am loving this small glimpse I've had of this new exciting lifestyle that is soo healthy and natural!

It only lasted for one night, and it wasn't more than few drinks (no hangover), but I was definitely planning on doing it again this last weekend since I already ripped the bandaid off the weekend before. 

Come Friday night, when I poured that drink, my wife was completely crushed that I wanted to give into it. I told her I would not drink, and I have not. However, she continues to drink: she has drank on most nights since we've been forced to stay at home. She's never had the problem I had, so the last thing I want to do is tell her she can't enjoy her nightly drinks because it makes me feel jealous and/or resentful. But it is truly making me miserable seeing her mood change from the daily duldrums to one that's more frivolous, care-free, and lighthearted after she gets a couple of drinks in her. I want that to be me! 

I know it's a drug, but right now, all the reasons I felt it was important for me to stop (believing I was doing something bad for my health, believing alcohol was holding me back from the person I wanted to become) are failing to make me think I need to stay sober. Especially when everyone I see/hear/read is getting a break from their daily grind by putting their mind at ease with this stuff. I remember those feelings, and I have no idea how to achieve joy or have that ""let my hair down feeling"" without booze, especially when I see it achieving those ends for her and everyone else I see.

I know I'm lamenting the loss of alcohol here, and I apologize for not railing against it as the devil's brew, but I'm incredibly frustrated right now, caught in between letting my wife do whatever she wants to make her happy while also not trying to be a miserable cuss because I can't participate. Sorry for complaining - so many have it harder than me so please help them. Thank you all.",4

For the past month, I've drank each weekend. I interrupted nearly two years of sobriety. Not ""threw away"" or ""blew"" or ""broke,"" just *interrupted*.

The story of how and why this happened is probably not unique. The pandemic has short-circuited my life in ways that are hard to put into words. Combine that with the fact I had allowed myself to become maybe just a little bit complacent and, voila, you have a relapse. Now, that's of course no excuse -- just an explanation. And at this point, it only matters in the sense of recognizing the weak point and patching it up.

The tale of the tape: Nothing disastrous happened -- no drunk driving, no fights, no hangover or sickness, no blackouts -- but all the same, I could feel myself accelerating on a trajectory that would lay all those events, and worse, at my feet sooner rather than later.

But I have to say what was most surprising, and enlightening, and valuable, was this: After 21 months sober, the difference in how my brain felt after a night of drinks was profound and instaneous. There was a very real and very heavy damper on my whole affect -- my whole being. In RPG terms, I took a debuff on every character stat. And I realized, importantly, that this used to be my normal. This was how I felt all the time, even back in the days when I thought I had no problem at all. 

My long-dormant alcoholic brain circuits also began chirping at me: ""You could do this every weekend."" ""What's the point anymore, anyway?"" ""Fuck It!"" That misanthropic voice in my head sounds so much like me that it's tough to ignore. It's still chirping, and boy is it LOUD. I fed it, now I have to starve it again. This will take **time**. 

During weekdays, the thought of alcohol would bubble up to my consciousness at least once an hour. My work no doubt suffered. My mood has not recovered. At the same time, I plunged into other moderately bad habits (laziness, staying up too late, eating poorly) with reckless abandon. My sleep was jack-knifed, and I had continual bad dreams. All of these things are the consequence of harming my brain again. I created a cascade of bad decisions, each re-enforcing the other.

So for me, here is the value of long-term, continuous sobriety -- the brain **heals**. And that's not just a nice phrase. It's a real and tangible thing. I've been on both sides now, and I want to get back on the right side. I want the quietude that I sacrificed. I want the whole days and even weeks where the thought of alcohol doesn't rise above a whisper on the wind.

I'd be lying if I said the number of sober days wasn't important to me. And it's true that -- most insidiously -- the erasure of that big number became a justification for my alcoholic brain to scream at me even louder. It makes no sense, but it is what it is. In practical terms, I believe going forward I must put my focus back on ""today"" in all its glory. I have to fall out of love with numbers, at least for a while 

\*\*\* \*\*\* 

I'll willingly answer questions about my ""research"" -- if I can keep someone from doing what I did, that would be worth it to me.",22

I would drink till I hurt.  Drinking ruined every relationship I’ve ever had, and has impacted every job I’ve ever had.  Yet I would continue to do it.  I’ve had my last job for a little over six years, and every single day I have had to call out of work (which has been excessive, I can’t believe I still have a job atm) was all related to alcohol.  

What has helped me?  I have a reminder every day on my phone that reads, “Never drink.  Its your kryptonite.  It cheats you from being the best you.  Nothing good ever came from it, everything bad did.”  This has helped me.  AA podcasts have also helped me.  This sub reddit helps A LOT.

In one week I have lost 7lbs, got the strength to stop smoking, read two great motivational books, and have woke up every morning without a single regret. 

My next hurdle is the 30 day mark.  I have not been able to stay sober for 30 days since I was forced to stop drinking while deployed in Afghanistan in 2012.  

I WILL NOT let drinking be my problem, I will make staying sober MY triumph.

About two weeks ago our landlord gave us notice (he decided he wanted someone else living in the house we are renting) and we have no choice but to move.

She wasn't feeling well and we were waiting for test results to come back (negative thankfully) so I was pretty stressed out. I won't go into details but I hit my rock bottom and decided to make a change.

Fast forward to now and apart from a single beer 4 days ago I have not had a drop of alcohol or a drag of a cigarette. I am mostly over my withdrawal symptoms and my Fiancee commented yesterday on how much happier, patient and energetic I am. She also said it was nice to see me have an apatite again. We found a rental property that is better than the one we currently have and less rent, so overall things are looking up! 

Mostly, I am grateful for my Fiancee who brings me joy every day. I am thankful for the melting snow and the garden I will be able to plant in a month. I am grateful all our animals made it through the winter and I am grateful for the new life that will be arriving in a few weeks (it is lambing season folks!).

Most of all, I am grateful I haven't had a drink or a smoke today.

A person watching their life being drained and their wits being taken, who in turn feels powerless to prevent their undeath, will inevitably feel a sense of anxiety, if not secret horror.  We see what’s happening, yet our strength and resolve seems gone. Alcohol’s trick is that it causes the mind to believe it’s a balm, when it’s really a parasite. For me, the process was mundane and slow, with no bottoming out and few big regrets. Drinking just slowly took over as I went about life. It was there, sucking away, taking a little more each day at work, during fun, when I was with family-the need almost hijacked the meaning and beauty of all life. The guy standing in front of colleagues and loved ones was a bloated, good enough approximation of the person who became the thirst, but I knew what was happening, what hollow mass had nearly replaced me. Turns out, I could still take it back. Once my mind had been free of the stupor and hangovers, I realized that anxiety was  one of the last unadulterated feelings telling me to freeze or fight or flee from booze before it was too late.",23

Albeit he does metabolize alcohol much, much better than I. I’ve tried many times in the past to quit and he would always say, “Dude, you don’t have a problem, just lighten up. Drinking is not a big deal”.

Well, I truly made up my mind to quit back in December. It was the same response, but when he saw how I serious I was; it became “Okay, well, we can still hangout, I don’t have to drink”. 

Last time we hung out, he came over to my house and said he was just going to have a couple drinks. This was no big deal to me, I’m strong enough in my convictions to be around it.

However, he ended up getting blasted on half a handle of vodka. Aside from trying to get me to drink many times, not listening to a single word anyone said, and talking about nothing other than himself the whole night. He tried to fight my other friends, cursed me out, and when I confronted him about his behavior (alone, calmly, after everyone else had left) he was irate and yelled at me for over an hour claiming no fault. He never apologized.

He has been trying to hangout again recently, but I haven’t been able to (not that I want to), it just hasn’t worked out. However, he has been trying to press the matter and has been trying to get me to give him a reason beyond the ones I have, and ultimately to apologize. 

I refuse to do either.

I’ve come to realize that it is okay to be selfish, or to protect your self-interest. It is okay to pursue your own happiness and well-being, even if it doesn’t align with others expectations. You don’t owe an explanation to anyone for doing so. Finally, just because you have bond doesn’t make it a true relationship, and it’s okay to move on despite familiarity. Changes in lifestyle will also change many relationships, and that’s okay.

It’s been hurting me more than I’ve hurt in awhile to go through this. Especially being alone in a new place with no friends. However, I am no longer going to put my time, thought, and intentions into things that do not bear fruit and relationships that are not reciprocal. I am no longer going to be caught in a cycle of codependency and substance abuse.

I may have not found my tribe yet, but I know that they do not reside in the bottom of a bottle. I will continue to fight to improve, and the Universe will eventually provide.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:  US—Night/Early Morning  Europe—Morning  Asia and Australia—Evening/Night  A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

**Good Morning Sobernauts!**

Monday is here again! The days feel a little arbitrary under the circumstances, but I’m working to establish routines.

It’s hard to grasp the reality that people around the world have suddenly found themselves in a crisis situation, in unprecedented situations of uncertainty.  

It’s okay not to be okay right now. For everyone here, whether it’s day one or decades of sobriety, we are doing great in a challenging circumstance.

To cope, I’m establishing a daily routine, starting some new creative projects, upped therapy to an hour a week, and getting unlimited cuddles from my wee cat.  

What is helping everyone here stay sane and sober?",73

I’m celebrating 100 days today, but it feels a little different than I thought it would. It’s weird times, man, but I want to document how I’m feeling so here we are:

- I expected to feel a lot more of something. 30 days, 60 days were pure joy and excitement. I don’t think I’ve gone more than 30 days since college, and I’m now 31F. 100 days was a big milestone I’d been looking forward to for a while, but I don’t have the same sense of accomplishment I expected to have.

- The world sucks right now. After cooking dinner last night my husband and I jumped between three different TV shows and I ended up playing video games until I was ready to sleep. I’m bored out of my mind in quarantine and tired of staring at screens. All of my anxiety coping mechanisms (hot yoga, spending time with friends) are off the table. My husband is loading up on box wine and it looks good just to have something to do. I don’t know if I’d call it a craving per say, but the boredom is driving me nuts and was a huge trigger for me in the past.

- I’m irrationally angry about little things. I don’t have a way to gauge if this is because of current happenings or just my brain still adjusting to life without alcohol. My husband’s family are showing that they’re all antivaxxers, meanwhile, most of my family is in New York and I’m worried sick about them and their shit immune systems, so hearing their comments about how COVID isn’t even something to worry about is making me irrationally pissed. I had a fun game night with friends over the phone this weekend, but midway through it was so obvious everyone was drunk and it made it impossible to just enjoy myself anymore. I can’t tell if I’m just cranky because of the situation, or because my brain is rewiring itself.

- But I’m vacillating between angry boredom and happiness that I chose to quit when I did. I know I’d be a wreck, drinking to black out every day if I still was where I was 4-6 months ago. I’m worried about the people who didn’t, or who are getting worse. I’m feeling a lot of feelings, and I know I’d be in a whirlwind of depression if I was dealing with hangxiety every day on top of this.

- I feel a lot of guilt over all of these things. By global standards, I’m doing all right. My job is 100% safe (healthcare tech, so I’m essential, but nowhere near another human to infect me), no one I know is sick yet (save for family of friends, who are doing as well as they can be), but I’m exhausted and burnt out. I’ve caught myself wishing I’d just get sick to take a break from everything, even though I know it wouldn’t be and is the most stupid, privileged thought I could have when others ARE sick and have it much much worse. 

- I’m doing my best to be there for people who are having it much worse than me. I have friends going through divorces quarantined with their soon to be ex spouses. Others who have lost their jobs or live close to hot spots and have sick family members. But I feel entirely alone in my own problems, and like no one is listening when I do try to open up.

I guess a big part of my problem is that all of my coping mechanisms are gone, and the only one I’ve known to “work” is alcohol and it’s right there on my counter. I know it won’t work and I’ll just feel worse, but even thinking about it when I’ve been so strong up to this point is really killing my sober buzz. 

I’m keeping on keeping on. I won’t drink with you tonight. And when things start looking better I’ll be back to celebrate with all of you!",7

Resolved to kick it in late 2017 and went from half a bottle of vodka a night to drinking one night a week. I've been drinking even less lately. But since my country went into lockdown due to the coronavirus, the stress and the depression has gotten to me and both last week and this week I drank on Friday, Saturday and Sunday night. I know I can't drink these negative feelings away, and I'm also not happy that all the extra exercise I'm doing at home is being wasted on empty calories. I feel like a fat, pathetic loser. I don't want to drink today and could use a little  support.

After 6 months of sobriety I ended up drinking on Friday... and then Saturday and Sunday. I'm not sure why I did it. I guess I've been really stressed about the COVID situation, and being alone most of the time certainly doesn't help.

After the third day of drinking, I woke up in the middle of the night, in terror, with the disgusting taste of alcohol in my mouth. This is my life again? No. I don't want to do this anymore. 

I'm sad and disappointed in myself. I'm afraid of sliding back into my old habits. But we can only live one day at a time. And today I will not drink",11

This is the longest I’ve ever been clean and sober in my adult life, which is quite the accomplishment now 40 years old. These are some things I’ve noticed so far:

1. First week sucked. Progressively got better over the week, the shakes stopped on day 3.

2. 2nd week I was able to get decent sleep finally, but constantly waking up through the night with drinking dreams

3. Ate lots of junk food and gained weight

4. Self-banned by going into to every pub within a 5km radius and applying for self-exclusion program

5. Had to supplement vitamins and changed diet to plan based and felt a lot better.

6. Week 2: Major anxiety and self-hatred talk calmed down a lot, but still depressed

7. Week 3 started to have normal uninterrupted sleep

8. None of my life problems were solved by not drinking, but my problems became manageable suddenly. I was able to confront them without cowering to alcohol

9. I was able to fill my time with worth while activities like chess reading and piano.. exercise is still a major hurdle for me, I’m starting to walk more every day

10. I hate my job and am making steps to change positions or employer

11. I have destroyed 15% of my debt with savings and have a $1000 emergency fund, using Dave Ramsey’s total money makeover

12. I’m still depressed after 4 weeks, but it’s very mild compared to my suicidal thoughts of previous times.

13. I’m doing counselling services to help as well

This quarantine is triggering me in so many fucking ways it’s unbelievable.

I’m three years sober. I shouldn’t be feeling this way. 

WRONG

We are all feeling some type of way because this shit is not normal. 

I’m so lost without my routine and structure. Creating my new life and embracing it is what got me sober, and is what has kept my depression and anxiety at bay. 

This is the life of the old me. Home alone, bored, unmotivated, lazy and depressed. Then beating myself up for being home alone, bored, unmotivated, lazy and depressed. Leaving my house and being a productive member of society has literally been THE NUMBER ONE, MOST IMPORTANT AND VITAL TOOL TO MY OWN PERSONAL RECOVERY. And that has been taken away from me, for who knows how long. 
I know there’s plenty of good reasons for us to be on quarantine and I can find the positives of this situation too. But that’s not why I came to this sub. I came to this sub to write this post because only other recovering alcoholics understand what going through sobriety and cravings in quarantine looks like and feels like. And it’s not pretty.

2020-04-06 01:40:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fvt1hj/im_so_close/,I'm so close,"Hello again, glad to still be here.  I posted here about a week ago with my sob story of in the last month and a half my dog dying, my husband now needing a liver transplant, getting evicted by my landlord/MIL and now living with my parents in a kind-of rehab scenario.  First of all I want to say a HUGE thank you for all the kind words, it has been a tremendous help though this incredibly difficult time.  I've been partaking in a virtual therapy message group 6x a week which I highly recommend (it's with Laura McKnown, she's doing free therapy via Zoom until the quarantine is over, check it out)

Anyway, I'm still weening myself off the sauce slowly to be safe from withdrawals, no seizures as of yet!  My tremors are fading, stomach is better, but the insomnia is still a pain.  I will admit I'm still having a small tumbler of wine or two with my parents in the evening before dinner, but never enough to even feel it.  I have a bottle of vodka that my parents keep track of, I'll have a shot if I feel ""wonky"" or shakey but that's it.

&#x200B;

About the vodka.  That was my serious vice.  It was all my husband and I really drank but we drank a LOT of it and too quickly.  Just now I heard my parents go to bed and was thinking, ""hey, I've been really good today, not a drop until 8:30pm and only a glass of wine, I can have a shot""  But first I decided to check my emails.  Oh shit.  See, I signed up for the email receipts from CVS, and as I was going through my new-ish emails I saw 5 receipts from there spanning from March 14th-25th (the day I moved).  Every one of them had ""CVS Gran Legacy Vodka"" in it or only that.  This was during the time my husband was in the hospital, my roommate had moved out, and the quarantine had begun so I couldn't spend the night at the hospital anymore.  Also he was transferred on the 19th so after that he was gone entirely and I was all alone.  I was putting back a handle to my dome every two days or so.  Holy shit.  I was so freaked out about life I didn't even realize how much and how quickly I was drinking.  When I first began this new ""rehab"" life I didn't think I really needed it, now I realize just how far gone I had become, probably because I was so drunk I didn't remember it.

So after that I'm determined to go my first (at least) 24hrs without vodka since January.  When the only reason why I didn't was because I was super sick.  I've got an hour and a half to go, wish me luck!  


Edit: I did it!  :)  Not craving any and feeling ok so gonna keep going.  ",9

Had a good time and went against everything I said this past week about no more drinking. Didn't even get drunk last night though just sat around casually drinking eating pizza and watching movies. Even had a beer today with lunch before heading back to my town. I feel great today just guilty that I drank even though i had complete control over myself last night. All I can think about is the damage I do when I lose control though.  Its so stupid how easily it is for me to fall back into drinking smh. I love the nights like last night and miss when every time I drank was a good night before I started having a problem. Guess I'll chalk it up to a loss this weekend and start fresh tomorrow.,2

I've been out of town for work the past two days and go home tomorrow and I'm really worried I'm gonna have a drink. I've been drinking nearly every day for nearly three years now and here lately I feel I've become pretty pathetic, reliant on alcohol to medicate my anxiety. I really want to quit but I've come to realize I'm a bonafide alcoholic at this point, part of me still doesnt want to quit because I love drinking beer and all my friends drink or smoke pot quite a lot. My anxiety causes crazy heart palpitations and chest pain and I can't fucking stand it. I have no other current coping mechanisms and cant take medication because of my drinking habits so I just self medicate with loads of beer.

I've met this girl who is really nice but not a big drinker and I don't want her to see me for who I really am at this point in my life. I've been seeing a therapist for the past month and he has suggested I go to AA but group therapy is not really up my alley being so introverted, but I really want things to change so I'm looking for some kind of compromise or online community I can reach out to. 

Any advice you folks might have that has helped you abstain or manage anxiety or groups you been to would be greatly appreciated. I just feel like I'm doing this on my own and it's so lonely because I cant seem to express myself to any friends or family, I don't want to worry them because i feel like I've been keeping it secret for so long.

I’ve never been able to handle alcohol. This time 3 years ago I picked up after being sober for almost 12 years in AA. Probably the main cause was my mother’s unexpected death and my father’s subsequent disowning of his family.
I’m in a relationship (for the past 4 years) with someone who I no longer love and, basically, my life is shit. 
I’ve tried to stop drinking countless times since then, but during these past 2 weeks in isolation and shutdown I have done nothing but drink every day - I usually manage to have at least a couple of alcohol free days because of work but as I’m working from home that hasn’t happened.
I realised today that even if I end the relationship, difficult during these times, I will never be happy or fulfilled (or be a success when it comes to dating again) unless I stop drinking.

I love the daughter and understand that addiction is hard to break, as does my mom. But when it came to ME, my mother used violence and belittling as well as emotional abuse to try to get me to stop. It never helped anything and as a matter of fact, made things worse. Being called an “alcoholic cunt whore” made me want to drink more because I felt like shit.

They won’t eat dinner with us at 6:30, because they need a few more hours of drinking before putting food in their system and “sobering-up.”

My parents wanted to thank my in-laws for taking my toddler and I in by sending them a dinner from a fancy restaurant to enjoy at home. My in-laws said no, but asked for booze instead as a thank you. Yesterday I went down to the grocery store for them and they needed a handle of bourbon and a handle of rum. There are over 30 bottles of wine and booze (not empty ones) in the house, I kid you not.

Sometimes it is easier to see things in other people than it is to see it in yourself. It took a lot of painful internal thoughts for me to see my champagne bottle (or more) habit wasn’t fun or glamorous. Now I see their “cocktail” hour everyday and I feel pity.

Before COVID, I would beg them to come spend time weekly with their granddaughter and have dinner. Neither in-law has worked in close to two decades, so it is not like they don’t have the time. They would make it maybe once a month, because it cut into their drinking time. And they couldn’t drink as much as they wanted at our house since they had to drive home. They do not seem to have any long term friends, but people drift in and out of seats in their stories. The same stories, at the same places, only doing activities where they can drink. “Friends” leave the small mountain 120 home community (20 minutes down the hill to a major city) and we never hear of my in-laws spending time with them again. 

I’ll never shame them over this by telling them they have a problem, and at 70, they have been living this life for so long. But I am so grateful I am not in a place where getting alcohol is more important than making memories with my children (grandchildren). Though it is not pleasant to experience, I am grateful to witness my mother-in-laws terrible, untreated anxiety / drinking cycle. I see a reminder that addiction creates people who want to be praised for what they think they are capable of, and not their actual actions, accomplishments (in the goals / dreams sense), and words. I remember my words being driven by a deep need to be validated by others while in my habit. 

I have not always been my best person. I have said and done things of which I am not proud. But I am in a grateful place because the last two weeks have reinforced my decision to stop drinking. The realization that alcohol made me into the worst form of myself.

Stay strong during shelter in place. I am living with proof that drinking does not make any of the COVID situation better. IWNDWYT. This community is amazing. I read earlier a post about not vilifying drinking and people without a problem, and I totally agree. It should not be an us vs them. I am sharing a story of the small subtle effects of long-term daily alcohol consumption. It reminds me of the story of the frog swimming in a pot of slowly warming water.   

No everyone has to have a black-out habit to have their lives hollowed-out by alcohol in subtle, but cumulatively powerful ways.",392

I went through a phase of about a year or so of drinking fairly heavily, with intermittent college partying as a younger guy, and then got down to around 3 days a week. This was good for me as I didn't have a *problem* with drinking (in that it wasn't destroying my life) and aside from a small period of time drinking heavily (mostly out of boredom or due to being a stupid college kid) I was able to correct that with having a more interesting life and doing things that didn't involve constantly being around people who drank a lot.

For the last few years I've drank around 3 days a week. Usually 5-6 drinks a night on these nights. However, I've started to become concerned with my health. Especially because this can't be healthy even at this rate. I don't want to stop drinking because I enjoy the taste of a good drink but I want advice on getting that number lower. I'd like to be able to enjoy a few glasses of whisky or a few beers and not feel the need to hit a goal or ""chase a buzz"" up to my limit above. I've noticed my behavior is as follows:

1. You cant drink during the week
2. You can only have at most a 6 pack (or equivalent)
3. Don't violate the second rule

I've noticed (3) has been a crutch for me and after 2 drinks I'll allow myself to drink to a goal (say 4 drinks) and then cut myself off. Naturally this is a dangerous pattern to follow and I need to continue to work on my mind game.

The typical advice of learning how to say no works sometimes and not others. Not storing booze in the house doesn't really help because aside from the days I do drink I have zero desire to drink otherwise and don't even really crave alcohol. I suppose it feels like ""well I should drink today because its a weekend"" rather than ""I need to drink"" or ""I want to drink"". I'm having trouble internalizing this. I have internalized it at least somewhat however because I feel really, really awful even having one beer on a day that isn't a ""designated drinking day"".

Is there any good strategy to help change my mindset from this sort of ""targeted safe drinking"" to ""enjoy a few drinks"" and be okay with that? Due to the sensitivity of this problem approaching a counselor wouldn't be good. Having some kind of medical record stating I approached them for advice on slowing down drinking could be damning. I'd prefer to do this for myself, or quit altogether, but before considering complete sobriety I wanted to see if there were some coping strategies that have worked for you guys to bring my drinking down further into a safer level. Ideally I'd like to hit a once every two weeks or once every month milestone. That would be a very big deal for me.

I didn’t drink for about three months before March, but I went on a ski trip with some friends and decided it would be “okay” for me to drink on the trip. I think I quit again for maybe two days after the trip, but then I immediately decided I didn’t care anymore. I’ve basically been getting drunk every single day since I started again. I’m really sad about it because while I was sober I lost about 15 pounds. (I’ve been trying to lose weight for years.) I seriously gained 8 pounds in a single month because of my drinking and generally not giving a fuck. My poor husband doesn’t know what to say or do. He told me last night that I’m going to really regret having gone off the rails when I gain all that weight back and I know he’s right. It is so incredibly tedious and difficult to lose weight. I’ve never had so have so much patience in my life. I want to go sober again, but I’m just so anxious about this Coronavirus stuff. I feel like I can’t handle it sober. I used to be prescribed an anti-anxiety medication but I got it taken away from me due to my misusing it. Now I have nothing specifically for my anxiety. I’m glad I got off that latest anti-anxiety however. Why do I feel so convinced I must feel “altered” constantly? I don’t get it. My life is pretty good right now despite everything. My husband and I have been getting along really well. I lost my jobs because I worked in a bar and a restaurant so I’ve definitely been crappy because of that. I used to have to stay sober to go to work. Now that I’m not working I feel like it doesn’t matter. I talked to my therapist last Friday and that made me feel okay. Slightly better than I had been feeling at least. I see her again this Friday and I already can’t wait. My mom told me some really fucked up shit about my dad. (he was abusive to her when I was a kid, they’re divorced now.) I feel like I egged her on to tell me some of the fucked up shit my dad did.

But lately, like so many others, the current state of the world has me fighting off more cravings than usual. And last night I came dangerously close to slipping.

My husband still drinks, so there is beer in the house frequently. But whatever, I don't care. It's his and I have my kombucha and sparkling mineral water in the fridge. But it's the weekend and we both have today off, and I kept thinking, ""fuck it, I'll just have one beer."" But deep down I knew it wouldn't be just one, it's never been just one. And again, the voice chimed in, ""well even if it's not just one, the past couple of weeks have been hell and you have the day off tomorrow, so it'll be fine. It's fine.""

So I sat and wrestled with those thoughts for a while, thinking of what I had to do today, trying to justify the hangover I knew I would sustain and what chores I could complete while hungover (laundry, vacuuming, etc).

And then I remembered: I have a recurring Sunday morning virtual yoga class my friend offers. I committed to it, and to her, because she's a god damn light in this world and she can't teach right now because the yoga studios where she teaches full time are closed, so she's offering classes via Zoom from her home and she's only asking for donations. I'm still working full time, and she went from working full time to asking for donations. I thought the past few weeks in my life have been hell? They don't even compare to those who have suddenly and absolutely lost their source of income. And she's still showing up for her community! She's still positive and loving and shining her bright light. And guess what guys? I know from a lot of experience that I do not practice yoga or meditation when I'm hungover. So, no, I don't need that beer. I need to show up for the people who are showing up. 

Some might argue that I could've had the beer, I could've just skipped class and still donated. But one of the main reasons I decided to quit drinking was because my yoga and meditation practices had suffered over the years, and I decided that those things, not alcohol, were the priority in my life. I did not drink Saturday night and I woke up Sunday morning and practiced yoga with my lovely friend. And guess what? I feel fucking awesome and I'm so ready to make this a great day.

In the past 100 days, I’ve made it through a baby shower, birthday parties, New Year’s Eve, and a week-long trip to New Orleans.  Getting through some of those events were tricky, but I never regretted not drinking the morning after.  When I first joined this sub, I spent hours reading your stories, quotes, and advice.  “Something terrible didn’t happen every time I drank, but every time something terrible happened, I was drinking,” is the phrase that has been in my head since I read it on here on day 1. 

One of the big reasons I decided to stop drinking was our wedding, which was set to happen in July 2020. Not happening now, but the strategies I’ve developed and events that I’ve made it through (even enjoyed!) without alcohol have given me confidence that I can still be in this spot for our rescheduled date next summer - and beyond.  I know that I have a choice in how the day goes and the moments I remember. I know that choosing to appreciate such a special occasion means not drinking. 

Taking things one day at a time has been hugely helpful.  Some days are definitely tougher than others, but I’ve learned that this is not going to be a linear journey.  Isolation has been tricky, but the new polar seltzer summer flavors (released a month early!) and sweets have been working pretty well.

I stopped drinking due to binge drinking habits, I'd drink to the point I wouldn't remember anything.

My last binge was 41 days ago in total and I'm glad lockdown hasn't made me slip up.. I can clearly see its not worth it.

Trapping yourself in 4 walls in a state that makes you feel so pathetic and disgusted with yourself during a time like this can't help at all.

Hello everyone, my name is Beth and I'm brand new to reddit. Being sober is my new life. I ruined everything 6 years ago with a DUI. Family lost respect for me and friends chose to distance themselves from me (similar to these times now). I was rude, had no respect for myself and was an overall disaster waiting to happen everywhere I went. I drank before work, when I woke up and at any free opportunity I had. BUT, I HAD AN EPIPHANY! As I sat on a cold cell floor next to my meth head cellmate, I decided that this life was not for me. Changes had to happen.

That's when fitness came into play and changed everything. It started with running. A mile here and a mile there eventually led to a 13.1. Not just one 13.1 run though, a couple. Running eventually led into home/gym fitness with just my body weight. I'm up at 5:00 AM everyday to do a workout first thing in the morning. I record a video and post it because if I help even one person, it was worth it. I've lost 27 lbs and have changed everything! After my turn around I got married, the best job I've ever had, my family back and two wonderful dogs that mean the world to our family.

This is more than possible for everyone here and I just wanted to leave a short snippet of my story in hopes that it could potentially change someones life for the better. Good luck to everyone and I hope you all find success to a brighter future.

(Hope I posted correctly, like I said first time here)

Over those years, especially in the last 10, I've made countless attempts at sobriety, all of them with no success. A few stays in residential  treatment, several intensive outpatient treatments, DUIs, jail, loss of jobs, relationships, and friendships. In January of this year, I walked into an IOP facility and asked for an assessment. I was honest, I knew that if I kept drinking, I would die. I took on treatment with a fresh set of ears and an open mind. After a few lapses, and my counselor seeing right through me, he suspended my treatment, told me to ""get off the fucking fence, and take some fucking action for once."" That night I went to a meeting, then 2 more the next day. Over the next 4 days I went to 9 meetings, met my eventual sponsor, and most importantly, had that spiritual awakening everyone talks about. I was allowed to return to groups (treatment) and everything was really moving forward. As daily life started changing as a result of covid 19, I had one thing keeping me sane, the fact that I knew drinking would only make everything worse. I am now done with treatment, have a great recovery plan, go to online meetings, talk with my sponsor everyday, have a daily routine that begins with meditation, and showing gratitude to the universe, my creator. This fucking works y'all, it really is that simple, just do what they suggest, and you'll see. I now have a confidence I haven't had in decades, joy I haven't had in just as long. 30 days is the beginning of my life of recovery.

South Africa is currently on the 10th day of a 21 day national lockdown - this includes a ban on cigarettes and alcohol. Considering that many citizens rely on alcohol to take the edge off of living in my country (with the crime, poverty etc) I feel bad for those who had to unwillingly go cold turkey and the potential hazards it might have for them. 
 
With that being said; I am very fortunate in that I am completely fine and haven't had a craving for alcohol in this period - it might fleetingly enter my thoughts once or twice a day, but the incessant yearn is gone (because of course it is impossible for me to get any).

My real fear is once the ban is lifted and there is no impediment towards me obtaining booze, that those cravings will hit me like a truck, and that this current feeling/attitude I have towards alcohol will simply disappear - which I don't want.

Can anybody please offer some advice as to how to carry this feeling going forward?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent**.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:  US—Night/Early Morning  Europe—Morning  Asia and Australia—Evening/Night  A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

**Good Morning Sobernauts!**

I am so honoured to be hosting the check-in this week!

The thing that bothered me most in the first few weeks of sobriety was realising how much time I had lost because of alcohol, and how little I cared about my time when struggling with addiction.  Now in lockdown, I have even more time on my hands and even under these insane circumstances I am trying to find meaningful ways to spend it.

I've been keeping up with dance classes, and learning some new skills in costume design and construction.  Turns out making tutus is tedious and time consuming, but very satisfying when you complete one!

What is everyone doing now with your reclaimed time and/or your lockdown time? I think the world is going to see a burst of creativity when people are cooped up and looking for positive outlets for their energy.

 I'm 2 months unemployed, depressed, experiencing extreme chronic pain and have quarantined myself and am trying to figure out next moths bills, while trying to beat my addictions alone.

I woke up this morning and had a hunch that he was lying to me as he is a liar. I \*67'd his workplace and bam.. he's working and has been working and the business is thriving as its 'essential'. 

Not only that, last night he was going on about how cool his new $50k Mercedes SUV is and that he needs to trade up to the more expensive one... 

So I had a internal meltdown today. 95% of the time I start guzzling booze to ease the rage and tension..this is common for people to take advantage of me so I get angry and upset fast and at high levels.. booze ALWAYS calms me down very quickly and start forgiving and sweeping stuff under the rug .

I passed that damn test. 

So far I've beaten the withdrawals, severely deep sadness and got so low to where I wished the entire planet got COVID and died (sorry, don't take any of this personally), told God he sucked ass and is not real for the first time ever, experienced nightly extreme chronic pain, sleep deprivation all week,  got full of rage, rejected for a job by being ghosted by so called 'professionals',  all in 6 days.

Fuck it all.

I ain't drinking or smoking with you today, I hope you will join me in battle.",8

Taking one day at a time became ""the thing"". Waking up every day with renewed energy and going to bed with a smile. 

Somedays I felt more proud than others,   
somedays I didn't even think about alcohol.  


I had a feeling this day was something special, I just couldn't tell why. So I looked at my sober app to check the count. ""140 days.... What's so special about that"" I thought. Then I realized it's 20 weeks and boy was I baffled ""THAT'S A LONG ASS TIME - ALMOST HALF A YEAR!"" I was taken back by the fact that I was this far in my journey. Wauw! I feel so happy. So reliefed by the fact that I I'm not in the strong strangulating grip of alcohol. 20 fucking weeks! Phew!  


Friends, families and collegues have all accepted the fact that I don't drink anymore. They don't question my choice anymore and I don't feel like I have to explain anything to the world anymore. I had that feeling a lot in the beginning.   


I felt like I had to excuse that I didn't drink - And people acted so confused as to why I didn't.   


But going through an entire month of Christmas, a live rock concert, two birthdays parties a wedding anniversary and now this pendemic lockdown without alcohol have really strengthened my commitment and how I with no problems openly states that I don't drink.

  
I feel stronger in both body and mind than I've done in ages. It's like a more pure strength. A clean strength. Something I can feel I want more of and never wants to let go off. But it is also a fragile strength that is easily weakened and beaten. All it takes is one little drop of alcohol.

  
A drop that I haven't had in 20 weeks!

So with that being written and raise my mug of coffee and say to you all ""I will not drink with you today""",11

I was a decent cook before but I recently started expanding my menu. Since the only places that I can really go is the groceries store and funds are tight, it’s a cheap way to keep my mind and hands busy. I even tried to make bread.... tried..... 


The internet is perfect to find simple recipes that use the normal items in most kitchens and if there is one or two special things I don’t have it’s a cheap trip to the store. I personally use the Company’s Coming Guys Cook Book for the most part. (Just skip the cooking with booze section)


Feels really good to watch others enjoy your hard work if you are not alone but even if you are, a good meal is very satisfying; especially if it took hours to prepare, let’s face it... we have the time.


Anyhow I wanted to pass on what has been helping me through all this. Stay hungry my friends.

The seemingly endless days with little to no responsibilities, nowhere to be, it could have been a recipe for disaster. The only thing that kept me alive when I was drinking was a demanding work schedule that limited when and how I could drink. So without that, I can safely assume I'd be in a pretty deep hole right now, either figuratively or literally.

So instead I've been waking up early, spending time in the garden, making improvements around the house, cooking a lot of delicious food, and genuinely enjoying the added time with my girl and our cats. I even installed an above ground pool to help keep the blood flowing. We've talked about it for years but I never had the willpower or energy to get it done. Now, with seemingly endless time and boundless sober energy, there's no home project I don't think I could tackle.

This has truly been the best 100 days of my life in over a decade, and it all started right here in r/stopdrinking, casually perusing posts and comments as they'd appear in my feed, and slowly gaining the belief and confidence to do it myself.

No pressure to hang out with friends.   
No weddings, parties, or travel on the radar. 

I woke up at 6:30 on a Saturday morning to take care of my disaster of a yard. I was able to speak to a neighbor I've been hiding from because I was always hungover or mildly drunk and checking the mail when I saw  him, and we talked about normal shit like the weather and invasive plants and I was able to connect without feeling guilt and shame. 

I managed four hours with an internet outage while, at the same time, my phone kicked the bucket. Four hours with no internet, netflix, music. I was even out of books to read and I still managed - cleaned off my bookshelf and found a few I hadn't quite finished. I won't say I managed it well (I vented and got pretty damn irritable), but I absolutely would have used that as an excuse to day drink a few days ago.  

Finishing the day watching a newly-hung birdfeeder with a [strawberry lime tonic](https://imgur.com/a/BBXSs5e), getting ready for a long hot shower and a face mask. I can't wait to wake up at 6:30 tomorrow, and more excitedly I get to sleep through the night instead of dragging through another day on 4-5 hours of intermittent sleep.   


I work 60+ hours a week and I hate feeling bored, and today I got to a point where I just had to sit with myself and my brain and I felt okay. I have a lot of anxiety about work and this whole mess and how I will manage in the coming weeks, but today was okay.",17

At least, it is for me. I've developed a new routine for my program:

Wake up, make coffee, sit on the side porch and read the daily reflection, the daily ""24 Hours a Day"", and the 3rd, 7th, and 10th step prayers. Then, I start my day and prepare to work from home (while my middle-school son ""attends"" online classes).

Throughout the day, I text or call my AA friends (those people who had given me their numbers in my early sobriety, or off my home group's phone list, people I had never called nor texted before now), pick up the big book or the 12 & 12, and call or text my sponsor.

I am lucky enough that a woman who goes to one of the local meetings I attend lives around the corner. I've known this since my third day of sobriety, but it took being isolated for me to reach out and text her, and her to text back & ask if I wanted to go for a walk. We now walk through our neighborhood (on opposite sides of the street) at least three afternoons a week, once we have both logged off our work computers.

There are loads of virtual (zoom) meetings, but I've yet to sign into one. I've bookmarked several lists of meetings all over the world, all around the clock. My home group has a daily morning meeting, a 6 day a week evening meeting, and a book study on Saturday. Yet I'm not participating in any of them.

I'm not saying I won't attend one before this is over, but I think I've just found that the other parts of my routine are meeting my needs right now. Before, the only person I really spoke to outside of meetings was my sponsor. Now I feel like I am developing real friendships with other AAs. Once we are allowed to go back to meeting in person, I will be there. But more importantly, I will continue these friendships, and that makes me feel good.

When I got sober, I had long before isolated myself from any of my friends, even those who were only drinking buddies. Other than my husband, only five people I know IRL know that I am sober (and all but one were completely blindsided - I truly had kept my alcoholism hidden from almost everyone). Until now, I have struggled to connect to people one-on-one in AA. So even though things suck right now around the globe, I find this to be a warm fuzzy that I can hold onto.

And, of course, all y'all here are as important to me as always. Let's stay sober together.

What to expect with a sober mind?,"So, a little over a week ago, I was to the point that for three days straight, I couldn’t eat and could only vomit bile, my body growing weaker and my partner more concerned. Constant panic spells until I would drink at night and then feel “fine”. I had been medicated for ADHD for some months with a stimulant that severely dehydrated me, combined with my 5 year nightly drinking of 4-5 mostly-vodka (water glass-sized) juice cocktails. It was tearing up the inside of my gastric system and a scan/blood samples showed that my liver was fucked. A couple of different ER visits later, I went to the addiction center at a nearby hospital and admitted myself into the detox program. I made it through and they started me on Lexapro for major depressive disorder. I was super happy the first couple of days before leaving and then evened out.

Unfortunately, it turns out that I was incorrectly prescribed to take a benzodiazepine every day since five years ago and once I stopped taking it at the end of the program, I had horrible withdrawal panic attacks that landed me back in the hospital a couple of days later. They gave me a prescription to taper off of them and explained how it was wrong for the doctor back then to have misinformed me that they were a daily medication.

Currently on week one of tapering those, I’m not sure what to expect on the other side of final, official sobriety. Will I be happy and energetic like I was those two days at the end of the detox program? Will my creativity come back like it had then? Will things be less out of focus?

I had to choose between killing myself with booze and a future with my fiancé; the answer was pretty obvious, but I am still so nervous about how my brain will be without the stuff that made me feel more “fun” and less inhibited. I am a sexual abuse survivor, and alcohol made it so much easier to relax and enjoy sex as well, my PTSD put aside for a while. But I can’t drink anymore; I can’t hurt myself anymore. No self harm anymore includes no drinking as well. I’m worried and wondered if anyone else had experiences or info they could share about how different your mind felt when you were sober for a while.

Over a week now, i don't know the number, i don't care. I just don't at the moment because I am living this life. 

I simply cannot fathom the other person I am when I am drinking, by this time in another life I would have finished a bottle of wine already, or a considerable amount of vodka (that's if I was still factoring 'day' and 'night' it got worse where these things didn't matter anymore) and would be planning the logistics of getting the next 'days' supply, slightly panicky because i only had one more bottle left, or very panicky if I had none left.

What the actual fuck? I am literally two different people and it suprises me sometimes. I feel perfectly fine and normal, very productive, very loving, very caring, very helpful, hard working, smart enough etc etc. It hits very hard sometimes when the people I love have been living with the other me and I have hurt them very badly, many times and for a long time, come back into contact with this me and I am like what? Whats the matter? Then it sinks in. They are still living with the other me and they have every right to be acting that way towards me.

Two lives, lifetimes apart. Difficult to reconcile, but today I will stick with this life.",6

2020-04-04 14:59:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fuz70e/i_have_a_confession/,I have a confession,"Hey everyone, 

So I recently in the past two weeks started drinking after a little over 4 years of sobriety.

It started when I had the insatiable urge to have a drink (I wasn't depressed, sad, or feeling any type of way) I just wanted to feel different.  Also I suffer from Introversion if that is a thing a person can suffer from. 

So I started by buying a 24 oz. Beer from the local gas station. I felt good and felt content with the one drink.

A few days of this and I eventually bought a bottle of wine. I would drink half each day then it became a whole bottle.

Now I bought my first 375 of whiskey. I haven't been to a meeting in a long time. Haven't had a sponsor for even longer. I haven't screwed my life up (yet) but I am afraid to get help because living in an area with a large recovery community I don't want to pick up a white chip and be recognized. 

I know it may seem petty because it's my life that's at stake and that I shouldn't worry what people think. But I do, and always have. Always wanted to fit in but I never have or at least percieved I didn't so I heavily isolate. I take antidepressants that make me apathetic and I have no drive to better myself.

I feel hopeless right now but I can't express it to anyone.

Update: So I ended up not drinking that liquor I purchased and I am going to flush it down the toilet. I am not sharing this update for any sort of praise or anything like that. I just spent a couple of hours fighting with my mind debating whether or not I'm an alcoholic. (Which has been proven to me already to be true) but some reason I still have to ask myself since I guess deep down I wish I had a cure all for my anxieties and fears. I don't want to put any work in because facing fears means pain. And I am terrified to feel pain and rejection.",36

That was huge, but I ultimately caved. I failed. An old friend, drinking buddy, really, popped up unexpectedly. I hadn't seen him since he moved off to Baltimore 2 years ago. I didn't tell him I had quit drinking, this was a friend who I worked at a world famous craft beer bar with, we brewed beer together, it's all we talked about, drinking was the glue that made up our friendship. When he showed up, with a huge sampling of all the best his locale had to offer, I just caved. I didn't have the gall to tell him ""I don't actually drink anymore"" I panicked, imagining him being crushed, the man drove over 1,000 miles to surprise me, I was tearing up with joy and in the heat of the moment I just caved. He asked me where my glassware was (since I quit I donated probably $500+ worth of flutes, chalices, snifters, etc) I made some lousy story up and I felt so sick, lying to him, lying to myself, not to mention the high octane drinks sent my head spinning and my stomach uneasy. He had planned to stay late drinking but I again lied to him and faked being sick. I told him we'd get together again the next night, which we did, and I drank. Again. I swore I'd own up and tell him, but I didn't. That night led to another with him and one more, all back to back.

I'm resetting my flair, but more importantly I'm resetting my desire to live a healthy, clean life. I waited to tell him until he left to go back home, I called him the night he got home and had a long conversation about it with him, I told him everything, he told me he felt horrible but how could he have known? I didn't tell him. It was relief when he said ""next time I come, we'll just stick to finding good seafood, sound good?"" He was actually proud of me and told me he wanted to cut back himself and that I was an inspiration and also a reminder of just how strong this stuff can grasp a hold of us.

I drank the first half of a liter of vodka, and when my girlfriend called to check on me I could barely finish a sentence. She picked me up so she could keep an eye on me while I sobered up, and I began what is now my longest stretch of sobriety since I started trying to quit two years ago. 

I was a binge drinker that could quit for days at a time, and I was able to keep my job in a very public and safety-focused industry, so it was really easy for me to rationalize my ability to drink. 

This is what has helped me so far: 

An addiction specialist doctor to make a plan with layers of accountability and monitoring. I sought out and found outpatient level treatment without meds that didn’t put my job at risk, and so far it has been much more effective than trying to go it alone. 

Weekly therapy sessions with an addiction specialist counselor (who was also a binge drinker for added relatability).

A very supportive girlfriend and alcohol-free house. I have flat avoided a lot of risky situations while I build up time and resolve. At the moment that’s pretty easy (hooray social distancing). 

Telling my close friends and family. Lot of support and added accountability there. Even the one long time friend and drinking / traveling friend that didn’t want me to quit came around and offered his support. Anyone that I can’t count on to do that doesn’t need to be in my life right now. 

Some books recommended here, especially Alcohol Explained and This Naked Mind. It’s very helpful to understand that it’s a chemical and behavioral addiction and not a flaw of character. 


And now the six month struggle. I realized last week that I didn’t really want to celebrate six months. I don’t know how common this is, but I can tell it’s my mind trying to convince me enough is enough and justify drinking again. I can tell it’s the start of a difficult battle with a very insidious opponent. 

I am nonetheless very proud that I could do this and happy to be in this together with a bunch of awesome sober people. 

Thank You!

I am in counseling, I read Annie Grace and tried Allen Carr but it didn’t really help me too much. I just am tired of being this way and don’t know why I can’t stop. I have ADHD, anxiety, and depression, none of which are improved by drinking.

Since being in isolation I’ve been drinking a lot more than normal. And I’ve been getting drunk and feeling dumb. I’ve had an issue with drinking for a while, but I almost always kept it to 3-4 drinks. Lately I have been having more.

Also just a note - I am not able to exercise right now per my doctors orders. Yoga would sometimes help the anxiety but I don’t have exercise as a tool right now.

I found this thread and wanted to reach out for some people who can help me with some guidance. I turn 21 in two weeks and I’m pretty concerned. Although I don’t find myself craving 
alcohol even when I’m stressed, I struggle with a serious pacing / ration problem when it comes to drinking. I started when I was 12 and have built up a tolerance to the point where I can barley feel tipsy or hungover despite how much I seem to drink. Even friends have brought up to be that despite being 120Ib, 5’6, I don’t act much different drunk from being sober, therefore they have a hard time telling me when to stop because they say even when I’m sober I act the same? That is quote on quote “yelling over people, lack of filter, repeating myself, tripping”. This scares me because I have anxiety (especially during quarantine) thinking I could drive home and kill someone (fuck the DUI (which is coming if I keep going) I worry more about someone dying because of me). I have been known to have evenings where I have a few drinks and cut myself off, or give my keys away from the beginning. However, it’s gotten to the point the other times I can start around 12 (off day of work) with a “few white claws, “ turns into about 3 12 packs, then I’ll split 2 or 3 bottles of wine with friends, then a few shots and or mixed drinks before I finally feel like I’m tispy and decide to go to bed. It’s those mornings where I Am never hungover, just so dehydrated I “glide” through the day. One thing that scares me is even at 14 and 15 I can’t ever remember having thrown up for getting a headache due to alcohol. I never have blacked out and thrown up by force 3 times in hopes of sobering down, even when I don’t feel that drunk. The times I am scared are the few times I have seriously fucked up. I’ve had my parents recently pick me up off the side of the road because I blew a tire(I was seriously fucked up- 6 bottles of vodka split with a mixer with a friend in an hour), and just before that I had gotten my car fixed due to having damaged it about 4 months before because of being semi intoxicated and coming home and not being fully aware to avoid a car coming towards me so I turned into a wall. I acknowledge I have a pacing problem and want to get this fixed. I just get upset because I do want to be able to socially drink at 21 and have a few then call it off.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day.

**For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!**

This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at: US - Night/Early Morning Europe - Morning Asia and Australia - Evening/Night A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

**“Like so many addicts, I'd thought that if I could only sort out my life, I could then sort out my drinking. It was a revelation to see that it would be simpler the other way around”

This is my last DCI for now anyway. Please all of you stay healthy & happy! Even those of you who don't care for me! You know who you are out there, & I'm OK with that! We will come out of this intact. I just have to believe that for all of us!",53

However for the most part I accepted I'm not drinking and moved on. Of course this is the sane decision, and anytime I resisted, I was so grateful in the morning as dealing with this would be a disaster if I added hangover depression and paranoia.
The thing that filled me with regret wasn't drinking to avoid shit. This week I passed a big exam I'd been studying for. I'm currently looking for a job and getting this exam is hopefully a big step in the right direction. I haven't done any study or exams in decades. I was super happy and proud of myself for focusing, studying and passing this exam. I wanted to celebrate, I wanted to get some beers, maybe some wine and hell some rum to cap it all off. But I didn't, because I don't drink anymore, but not going to lie, I felt some resentment to myself for denying myself a celebration. Why can't I have a few beers like other normal people.
So this last few weeks I learned I can cope with stress without my alcohol clutch fine, but when things start going right, then I miss it, and the pangs kick in. Things are back on track but I worry in the long-run that this feeling of missing out will be my downfall.
Or maybe I'm just over analyzing it, a bad night's sleep and a lot of time on my hands isn't always conducive to rational thoughts.
I guess this is a vent post, I don't have close friends I'm comfortable sharing these thoughts with.

It was a huge relief for me just to know I have the strong legal support and, for the first time in these 13 days, I feel the urge to celebrate.  I guess I’m just somewhat relieved in general, but we all know where this can go for us drinkers.  

My mind is justifying drinking tonight with things like, “of course I won’t be driving again.  Maybe I can make this a once a week/twice a month thing...”

I also treated my wife like shit the day I got busted, almost 2 weeks ago now.  We have made amends and I’m sure she wants to have a little wine tonight herself (she is not a problem drinker).  Ugh, just need to take this day in stride, I guess and let it pass...",5

This last week, however, I feel like I’ve regained some of my withdrawal symptoms that used to be a daily occurrence.

I had 9 month sober one time and I thank it all to bodybuilding and aa. Surprise surprise going all in on dieting and bodybuilding gave me a fucked up sense of body image and a eating disorder. So I burned out, quit aa and relapsed. Now im struggling to even have a couple of days sober back to back since. The gym are closed , im not motivated to train at home its just not the same. 

My mind tells me I can smoke only and not touch alcohol but its probably a lie or something , have you ever seen a successful addict do that ? Dont think so. So im just venting here... man its tough with the lockdown. I can only watch so many movies or play games alone before I go crazy.

Life has been rocky since november 2019, marriage on rocks, wife sleeping in separate room, no physical contact. Bouts of sobriety followed by binges

March 15 my wife had enough and left with 3yr old daughter to her parents. I proceeded to drink my face off till Saturday.

Following monday I started drinking again. Tuesday my cat had a stroke, thursday I had to put her down.

Here it comes:

Friday I was drinking in the morning talking with my wife about stopping and start the antabuse pills I had on hand. I wanted her to come over for the weekend (leave daughter with grandparents for the weekend) just to get me through the withdrawals safely. She declined and said if I was so worried to go to the ER.

Fast forward a couple of hours on friday of talking to (wait for the reveal) my friend and brother.... they started communicating themselves and my friend decided she was going to collect me to make sure I'm safe, and hold me hostage to get me sober with military level supervision, etc.

My friend? My highschool ex girlfriend. From 17 years ago.

Rock bottom is when your own wife is so tired of putting up with your shit that she won't watch over you to make sure you withdraw safely, so instead your highschool ex collects you to stay with her family, on her couch, to get you cleaned out and on a good path. And I'm grateful for it cause I obviously wasnt going to get sober alone.

Today is Friday, April 3, 2020. As of 5PM EST I will be one week sober.

I will not drink with you (all) today.",38

I haven't had have any cravings at all thus far, and actually, I feel like I'm more likely to thrive in this distancing/quarantined-style situation. There's no alcohol in the house (well, I drank it all about 2 weeks ago and just didn't get more), and I'm not tempted by social situations because they don't exist, so I just wake up, work out, work, come home, make food, sleep and repeat. This is a good situation for me.My big weakness in these stints of sobriety (that I've attempted in the past) have been my husband. He doesn't realize the extent of my drinking at all - I keep trying to fix it on my own. He knows I've had problems with drinking too much when we go out, but not much more than that. So whenever I (quietly) decide to stop drinking, my usual vice is when he feels like drinking - which he rarely does. If he orders wine on a date or feels like having some while we watch a movie at home. I feel like it's an opportunity to drink WITH him. But then what usually happens is I find a reason to go to the store next door and end up getting more alcohol or a break into those bottles of wine that have been in our house for years as if we're saving them, but we aren't. I know if I told him it triggers me into this secret world of drinking, he would stop drinking - but I don't like the idea of him changing anything about him because I can't control myself.

Well, last night, he had a virtual networking happy hour event and he asked me to go buy a bottle of wine. I went into the store with every intention of just buying the bottle of wine, but then in that damn aisle, I got that trigger to just buy one for myself - he'll never know if I drink it and it will take the edge off that I didn't even have about 30 seconds ago. And by the checkout are those $1 shot sizes that they've moved up there recently. The last two times I went to the store, I bought 10 of them each time and drank them all in one night both times, only to kick of a three or four day bender.

But last night, I bought nothing but his bottle of wine. Checked out, drove home, gave it to him and went for a run. That strong, strong grip of suddenly really NEEDING a drink passed in about 5 minutes.  I got home and asked if he wanted the remaining half of his bottle of wine, he said no, and I poured it out, carried on with the rest of the evening, woke up feeling great and have moved on.

My father has since passed. He passed at my moms home at 66 surrounded by family. His liver and kidneys were shot. He decided that he would rather let himself die than have to stay sober and do dialysis indefinitely. 

Here is a link to his [r/lastimages post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lastimages/comments/ftoy96/picture_of_my_dad_from_two_weeks_ago_he_had/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

I don’t know if or when I will ever drink again. I no longer miss it or crave it. I feel sad when I see other people drink and I feel angry when I see it glamorously laced into tv, movies, and advertising.

My wife is 7.5 months pregnant and is due with our first child on June 2nd. I am immensely stressed out, anxious, angry, and afraid. We have had to cancel all of the fun support events for my wife, no baby shower, no family events, no visits with friends and well wishers, our families will not be allowed in the hospital, there is a chance I will not be allowed in the hospital, etc. Our birthing classes and baby classes have been canceled so we feel unequipped as new parents. The anxiety of all of this is crushing my wife and I am struggling to lift her back up as her only physically present support system at the moment. Everyone I know with the exception of my pregnant wife and fellow recovering alcoholic sister is managing their stress though the pandemic by drinking; but I cannot do that. While a tall glass of oblivion sounds better than just about anything right now, I have to remind myself why that is a bold-faced lie for alcoholics like me. If I were still drinking, this would undoubtedly be the darkest hour of my drinking:

\-I would start fights with my pregnant wife for no reason and damage our bond when our relationship health is more important than ever.

\-I very well could lose my job as I would be drunk 24/7

\-I would recklessly spend money at a time when our financial planning for the baby has been significantly setback as we had to pull my healthcare worker wife out of work for the baby. 

\-I would not be emotionally present for my wife, who needs me now more than ever 

\-My chances of catching the virus would increase exponentially as I would throw caution to the wind

\-I would not complete the many projects I should before the baby comes

\-I would be creating the sickest version of myself right before I become a father and taking away from the well-being of my daughter by sacrificing my own.

I woke up struggling today, so I wrote this post to remind myself that I chose the right path and temptations to waiver from it are lies. I know many have it far worse than I do. I know I am lucky to still have a job. I am lucky to have a baby on the way. I am lucky to have a healthy marriage, one that took loads of work to repair from my actions before I put the bottle down.

I have been feeling so much better and feel like my brain function is becoming better each day. I was worried about withdrawal symptoms when I decided to quit this time - from past experience I was expecting sleepless nights, night sweats, and strong cravings. This time, I experienced little of that (though taking melatonin those first few nights helped with the sleeping).

One thing that has been very empowering is doing a lot of the work myself to take care of my anxiety, which is part of the reason why I was drinking. Last Friday, when I was in a bad place, I thought I was going to have to rely on my support system to figure things out for me (basically was going to let them decide my treatment path). Instead, I found a therapist myself through one of those app-based services and so far my therapist has been really helpful and I really like her. I also found a psychiatrist and made an appointment with them for next week! One of my friends has not been as supportive of this, thinking the only effective treatment would be an intensive outpatient program, and that I should have no say in my method of treatment (basically because I am an ""addict"" I can't be trusted with these things). This, though, just gives me even more drive to maintain sobriety and treat my anxiety.

I should be returning home this weekend, which I am a bit nervous about because it means I will eventually need to talk to my bosses (work a few small part-time jobs in one organization) about seeing if I can return to work (i.e. still have a job with them). However, my recovery is more important to me than work (I luckily have an emergency fund) and my partner is coming to stay with me to help me stay sober and re-establish good habits, and I am very happy I will get to spend time with them.

I thought I’d use the time to get a load of little jobs done in the house and garden. Unfortunately we can’t travel to pick stuff up unless it’s essential . I can’t say fitting a new garden gate to keep the nippers in is truly essential at the moment. It’s hard to get the materials delivered via online but that’s all ok , I understand the need to use these measures.

My only point for this sub would be that, a while ago, the government decided that off-licenses were deemed essential and they are staying open . For non U.K. residents an off-licence might sell a few other items but essentially it’s a shop full of booze .

I’m trying not to get preachy but what we deem essential has highlighted the extent to which we are a booze soaked culture.",24

Now when I am in most need of support I have so few to turn to, and its my fault.  Thankfully my spouse is tabling her resentment and allowing me to talk with her about what I am going through. Alcohol was the thing I protected more than anything, and now that I say goodbye I must rebuild from the ground up.  This wont be an easy road, but I have found support in finding peers on this sub and
 r/alcoholism to know that I am not alone in the toll drinking has taken.

Few hours away from being 25 days sober - the longest sober period I’ve ever had since this summer. 
I am generally fine. The first 14 days was pure hell and then the daily cravings finally stopped. The last couple of days have been horrible with my boss acting like a maniac, threatening to fire me (she did that while shouting in front of 50 people I.e. my colleagues on a virtual meeting, extremely humiliating) and yelling at me every single days sometimes for hours. She is trying to throw me under the buss to save her own ass. I recorded one of our meetings and it’s borderline “adult bullying”. Now the cravings and desire to drink has come back HARD. 
It’s constantly in the back of my mind, it’s like a physical toxic in my blood. I try to keep busy, eat healthy, meditate, exercise and be kind to myself but the thought of drinking is so overwhelming. It’s like a seed that has been planted and now I can’t keep it from growing. 
Every time I talk with her, my boss, I immediately want to empty a bottle of wine. 

How do you cope with such things? I really really don’t want to fall in. If I do, I fear I will never get back up again and be able to stay sober. 

Thank you for you and your support!",10

Over being the one to ruin nice things for themselves and others. We got a puppy in January (after, I kid you not, something like 3 years of me constantly campaigning to my husband that I want a dog) and it's been a relentlessly exhausting and rewarding journey of pee, successfully learned commands, chasing the dog who's chasing the cats, cats in-fighting from fear and stress, more pee, waking up every 2 hours  for potty breaks, and sleep/house training regressions and milestones. I can't imagine what this would be like were I still drinking. It takes all my patience sometimes not to shout at her, if I piled a hangover and the anxiety/low feeling of knowing that even when I'm not actively fucking it up I'm passively fucking it up by drinking...well, I'd be that much less of a good dogmom.  

 I've had to develop new ways to relieve stress. I remember one day, after penny had peed on the floor for the 4th or 5th time (and this was like. IMMEDIATELY after I'd JUST taken her out too. like just mind games, endless pee mind games) I just sat there crying at the dining room table. I was exhausted from the overnights.  I wasn't getting any work done. Penny felt like a mistake, my ideas of being a mother in the near future felt like a future-mistake (""you can't even handle a *dog* and you expect to raise a *child* ??"") and I wanted a glass or 2 of wine to numb down those feelings. I think that was my only serious craving. Instead, I cleaned up her pee, took her out once more, then put her in her crate. I strapped on my shoes. I put on some Nine Inch Nails. And I pounded out a 5k. Beat my best mile at the time too! So now that's what I do. When she gets to be too much, I hand penny off to my husband and I make sure I get what I need to unwind. Maybe it's a run, maybe it's knitting with my audio book. But I do not let those feelings build, suffering in silence and taking care of the puppy despite needing a break. I quit being the martyr. A guy I used to work with - also an alcoholic - used to say ""get off the cross, we need the nails!"".

Recently, maybe around my 70th or something day, Penny graduated her Puppy class! We got to take a picture of her in her adorable little motorboard hat and I realized I was wearing the same sweater that day as I had been on day one. I didn't expect to see much a change, my drinking wasn't ""that bad"" ... but you know, I think I do see the difference. I see a woman who is strong and confident because she's made the choice to put herself and her mental health first. Someone on here once described quitting drinking as ""the ultimate act of self love"". I see the evidence of that self love. I'm looking forward to continuing on in my journey. I'm so thankful I have you all here as guide posts and companions.

So yesterday I was 10 days sober from smokes and booze. Today I am slightly hungover from one beer.  
See, we went to town and I saw a liqueur store. My fiancée wasn't around and I was weak so I went in. One beer. That is all I got. One tall beer to take home and drink I mean, that IS the government's recommendation for drinking right?  Two standard drinks/day for men?   
And I had to know, after being sober for over a week, if I could do just one beer. If I could handle buying a single beer and drinking it and enjoy just that.  
Nope.  
The MOMENT I tasted it I wanted another. It was surreal. 'One is too many, Two is not enough'. Like goddam isn't that the truth? I wanted another before I had even finished the first. My hands are shaking slightly just thinking about it. I finished the beer, got a mild buzz and soon after my Fiancée and I went to bed. I woke up feeling a little sluggish and hungover but overall ok. My mood is a little lower and I expect to deal with some renewed cravings today but milder than before. I feel like with smoking, a single drag makes me crave it as much as I ever did. Like one drag resets me. Drinking, I will feel off but I don't think I will get the sweats and shakes from one beer.  


But I ran my little experiment and you know what? Overall not worth it. One beer is not fun for me. A little buzz isn't fun. I wanted to get wasted and that is EXACTLY why I can't have even one.

I am only slightly ashamed of myself this morning for my moment of weakness haha. But I know now that I can't have just one. That isn't an option.

  I think that a lot of people wouldn’t blame me if I picked it back up again. I definitely considered reaching for a beer for its numbing effects. But I know exactly what would happen, I knew that if I found an excuse, the alcoholic part of my brain would find a thousand more. 
 


 I spent a little under a decade finding excuses. Celebrations, sorrow , social anxiety, anger, loneliness, Tuesday, etc. I never reached for a drink to get well, but once I started there was no stopping. I would drink until I was on the brink of blackout and sometimes more. The thought of going home and being alone with my own thoughts filled me with anxiety, which led to an array of questionable decisions and put me in some dangerous situations. 
  


   I tried quitting a bunch of times and always picked it up again, sometimes worse than before. I wouldn’t call them failures because I did learn something new every time. The reason it stuck this time was because didn’t quit to prove to myself I wasn’t an alcoholic, I quit on the principle that I was. 
   


   Clay (my best friend) really helped me on this journey, because he understood my condition. He was 2 1/2 years clean off of heroin and he understood the struggle that when you take out a toxic part of your life, you are still stuck with a part of you that falls short, and that part of you is actually who you are and not something you can blame on inebriation anymore. 
  


  Clay was really really proud of me, and right now I am really proud of me. Yes, I lost a lot this month, but because I didn’t drink I had an opportunity to grow. I was able to feel raw emotions, communicate with people effectively, allow myself to be vulnerable, and mean what I say. No one had to take care of me because they had to, but because they wanted to. I get to have way less regrets and harbor less guilt. Clay and I were able to talk through our problems and didn’t get the brunt of angry drunk person who wanted everyone to be as miserable as she was. 
   


  Its easy to look for excuses when you look for them and unfortunately,ultimately,even when he knew all they were good for, Clay found his. He knew good and well what would happen when he used again, but there is always a voice in the back of your head that convinces you that you can manage it this time. Theres a part of your brain that says, “if you made it this far without, you don’t have a problem”. 
  


  I will spend the rest of my life with the same voice in the back of my head, and really with time and luck it will get quieter. In the meantime, I have a bunch of texts and footage of the small positives Ive been afforded because Ive abstained. I have reminder that even though he faltered, I have the strength for the two of us. I have hope that even if this month or the next month or the month after still manages to get worse and worse, it will eventually get better.",21

Somehow I started taking opiates for the pain and I think I was addicted in a week. It was mainly boredom that drove me to take them. Still wasn’t drinking though.

Then my best friend came over and offered me a sleeping pill one day and that was that. Back to smoking ,drinking and taking sleeping pills every night in a matter of days.

I’ve now lost another month of my life to just drinking and getting off my face. Not to mention all the money.

Two nights ago I managed to make do without a sleeping pill but now I need to work on the drinking. 

I woke up and ran to the store to buy some healthy food ( so important when I am detoxing) but I know cooking and showering is going to be a challenge for me today. 

The worst thing is that it’s not even 2pm here and I’m so bored.

Mostly I’m so tired of losing weeks if not months of my life to substances. I don’t even know what to say to myself. 

I’m just going to try to stay hydrated and I guess it’s back to reruns of the office for me.

I know there are people out there with more serious issues but I just wanted to put in writing how shocked I am again about how easy it is to slip up.

I just cannot believe how bad my mental health can get. I don’t know why I didn’t start taking it seriously 20 years ago. I can’t wait to see if my medication can help me feel better soon.

Over the last 5 years, I got myself into a situation where I was dependent on alcohol in order to sleep for work (night shift).  This all started with 1 drink per night and ended with me drinking a 1.5L bottle of wine about 5-7 days each week.  I didn't crave drinking...I didn't need alcohol every day to function, but I kept drinking out of habit.  My problem was that I got into this habit of drinking to fall asleep, which spiraled out of control to the point that I just couldn't stop myself from drinking every available drop once I began drinking.

**What I did about it:**
6 months ago I decided it was enough...I quit cold-turkey.  I made an agreement with my SO that no alcohol would be present in the apartment going forward...and I spilled out everything that was present at the time.  I also promised myself I would not walk into any business that served alcohol...that included picking up anything in a liquor store for anybody else.  Simply getting away from alcohol was my solution.

**The first 30 days:**
The first month was extremely difficult...I was extremely temped to stop in the liquor store after work so I could relax before bed, but I stuck to my promise and drove straight home.  I knew that if I cracked a single beer, I would drink every single one available to me.  Over the next two weeks my urge to drink slowly subsided but I still had a difficulty with sleep for the entire month.

**The last 5 months:**
The last few months were unexpectedly easy for me...I had no urge to drink.  My sleep quality skyrocketed, and I now fall asleep (and stay asleep) with no issues.

**What helped me:**
I kept a bottle of 91% rubbing alcohol around, and any time I got an urge I would sit down a take a ginormous whiff.  This helped me remind myself that what I was smelling was literally poison...I was the same stuff that was in that bottle of wine, except is wasn't masked by all the flavors and carbs.  Taking 5k IU of D3 and 200-400mg of L-Theanine daily also seemed to help significantly....the D helped my mood and the L-Theanine helped me relax.  When I could, I made a point to not to be alone or bored...picking up some new hobbies/crafts helped here.

**Was it worth is?**
You're damn right it was! The biggest change I noticed was that my mind became so much clearer...it made me realize just how much the alcohol was fogging up my brain.

I know we have people from all walks of life here...and your mileage will vary.  I just hope that my story will help all of you in some way and I want to say that life likely will get easier and you're life will likely improve if you can manage to put in the time, effort, willpower, and persistence in.

I'm crammed for time, so I probably won't respond to many comments (if there are any), but I will eventually read them all.",36

Anyways to get to the point. Thoughts going through my head: I hate my job. Not motivated. Probably going to lose it soon. I've made some bad financial decisions while drunk and now my savings is essentially worthless. Still there, it just might have to cover some things soon we'll see. So if I lose my job I might have to move back in with my parents. I'm 25, I thought I could handle all of this. 

Honestly even if I don't lose my job I kinda do want to go back to my parents house. I need to get my life together bad and the support I had there would probably help. Maybe I'm homesick I don't know. 

But im on a lease. And I don't even know how dropping a lease goes. I mean I signed paperwork, so I'd imagine id get penalized. I signed for a year and we're five months in I think. 

Maybe I just need to see my parents, but given the current situation I can't really do that either. I'm honestly just stuck in my apartment wondering if life is about to fall apart. It would be so embarrasing. I have a college degree, good credit score, never missed a payment in my life, nice car, good PAYING job.

So I really don't even know what to say or to start but I'll wing it. I'm 22 years old and have been going through a lot of mental issues this past year. It has been more for like 8 years but didn't recognize it until this past summer which made it worse. 

Well I got on Zoloft in November and I had side effects and now switched to Celexa. 

Let me just say I do go to a university that is recognized as a ""party school"", Washington State University so I have been drinking quite a bit while in college. Well I have noticed myself drinking without anyone. Once I started on Zoloft and now Celexa idk why but my urge to drink has increased. Like if I'm not doing anything I want to just go get some IPAs and chill. 

It has come to a point where people have said stuff to me but I'm still getting over a 3.0 in school and hasn't affected any of my relationships. People have just noticed I drink a lot. My dad did have a very bad alcoholic and pill addiction and sadly that was partly the cause of his death.

I came home for spring break and have been home for 2 weeks since classes went online and I think I only haven't drank 2 days since I've been home. 

I just always find a reason to ""celebrate"" or ""drink"" whether it's finishing a homework assignment, etc.

Well moral of the story is that I know I need to cut back on my drinking but when I'm alone bored, alcohol is almost like having someone hangout with me, keeps me entertained and busy or something to do. 

I have noticed that when I drink heavily the next day or two it definitely messes with my meds. I just feel dead in my brain like I used to before starting the meds. So, how do I fix that? Drinking 

Sorry if this has been asked before but how do you slow down the drinking? I honestly don't want to completely stop drinking due to the fact I know it isn't reasonable being in college and all that and I do want to still go to parties and play drinking games with my friends and such. But I would like to slow down drinking myself. 

What is some stuff you can do to mentally help/prepare yourself along with what you do to occupy or take your mind off of alcohol when you're bored and want that ""friend""?

2020-04-02 21:52:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ftzcmt/i_cant/,I can't,"""**I can't""** was the beginning of the first sentence I wrote in a suicide letter about a year ago.   


I was at the tail-end of the worst semester I ever had in graduate school which then became the peak of one of my worst experiences in life. My program was in turmoil due to unexpected faculty turnover, the financial strife of the university, and also their general negligence. We also had many students transfer (smartly) from the program which added further drama. 

During this semester, as part of my PhD training, I was tasked with teaching undergraduate students in my area of interest - which is a great passion of mine. This was not the same thing as being a TA, however. I was teaching the entire class as I had created all of the lectures, assignments, and tests myself - all approved by my mentor of course.

I was also a research assistant in the middle of a very time sensitive NIH grant under my mentor. With the mass exodus of faculty my mentor's time and energy began to thin significantly and the burden of furthering our research by collecting data and recruiting participants was staunchly on my shoulders. As someone still learning the ropes...this was a lot of work.

&#x200B;

I was also taking a full load of graduate level courses

I was also working as a clinician 2 times a week seeing patients and mentoring younger students.

And you know what else? The entire time I was, and still am, a complete and utter addict. 

Alcohol, weed, video games, YouTube, Netflix. It doesn't matter what it is...I always need one more and I always need one more the most when I have important things to be doing.

  
I never asked for help because I thought if I could not figure out how to handle all of those things then I did not deserve to be where I was let alone graduate and work professionally...and so the timer was set and it was only a matter of time before things blew up.

&#x200B;

So....the result? I completely failed one class and had to take an ""incomplete"" in another. Although I (somehow) aced all the other classes the damage was done and my reputation as a student was permanently tarnished. To this day I cannot bring myself to contact the professor whose class that was - and we had a great relationship. He is now at a different university. The man even gave me a chance to at least pass the class after I went to talk to him in person. I promised I would turn in all of the assignments I owed him and thanked him profusely...he was going to accept them even though they were WEEKS late. And what did I do? 

I fucked it right the fuck up is what I did. Those assignments were never turned in and he rightly failed my ass. Do you know how hard it is to get an F in graduate school? Students often joke that the only way to fail a class is to actually TRY and fail....  


Folks, I am here to tell you that its a lot easier than that. I learned you can fail a class by simply not trying at all.  :)  

&#x200B;

Know what else? It was probably the EASIEST class in our entire curriculum. The shame I put on myself the day I knew what I'd done to seal my fate in that class is a memory I wish I didn't have. I about tore all my hair out while having what I would assume is a panic attack on the floor of my bathroom. Naturally this was all happening under the harsh embrace of a hangover too...because why wouldn't it? 

&#x200B;

But wait...there's more. It was also around this time that I learned my application to another PhD program had been rejected. Now, I can't imagine you feel surprised by this if you read this far. But I can tell you that I am so good at what I do and I have absolutely accomplished many great things since I started graduate school - many of those things were very challenging and forced me to grow in new and interesting ways. What's more is that my mentor knew I was applying. Hell, he even supported it and wrote a letter of recommendation for me. I was FLOORED by his understanding....until I later learned that what he wrote in his letter put me in a very negative light as a prospective student because he wanted to keep me in our program. 

&#x200B;

A lot of what he wrote was simply untrue or grossly exaggerated. People have since told me that the letter said more about him than it did me...but once again the damage was done and I was rejected. To this day I have trouble looking that man in the eye. I will never trust him again.

  
By this point I was so tired of everything. Tired of waking up every day feeling anxious about checking my phone....PRAYING nobody needed me and that my mentor hadn't asked for any updates on my work...knowing I would go into an anxiety induced emergency productivity mode if he did. 

I was tired of swapping out addictions like video game cartridges as the novelty of one wore off and my tolerance for that vice peaked...I could not accept that I was going to have to stay were I was to finish out my degree with a mentor that did not have faith in me...I also could not accept quitting the program because of my pride and ambition. Yet, I had convinced myself, for a time, that the only way to win was to opt out entirely...so I cleaned my apartment, cleaned my gun, and wrote the letter.

I put all of my pain, sadness, and frustration into that letter and stared at the screen until my eyes went numb and I didn't have any more tears. Then I went to save the letter...

Except I never gave it a title. And here's the thing...Microsoft Word will take the first words before any form of punctuation and make that the default title. Remember how I started the letter with ""I can't""? 

Well....

When I went to save that letter the default title became ""***I can***""

And so I do.

So if we're thinking about drinking, we should think - am I experiencing any of these triggers, because I should take care of that and probably that will relieve my urge to drink.

I've been thinking about this a lot and it's occurred to me that a huge reason why I feel an urge to drink is boredom. I can have nothing to do and be bored, or I can be overwhelmed with work tasks and bored. ""I'm so BORED! This is BORING!"" It makes me want to drink.

So when I want to drink I should consider if I feel bored, and if I do I should try to do something interesting and stimulating and fun, that gets my brain going and makes me feel good, like piano practice, or drawing, or maybe some other skilled discipline that I value.",7

I drank for the first time when I was 15, drank like 8 beers, puked and passed out. Didn't drink again until my senior year of high school where I got drunk I believe a total of about a dozen times, a few of those times getting drunk enough to puke. This didn't seem so bad but I still earned the reputation as ""that friend"" that would drink until they'd puke when we hung out.

I had my first incident my first year of college when I chugged a tall vodka mixed drink and projectile vomitted all over my friends living room rug. I puked for most of the night and my friends almost called 911 but luckily we knew a full blown alcoholic who walked them through how to take care of me and I just ended up being sick for a couple of days.

I think I only got drunk a handful of times over the course of the next two and a half years, getting drunk enough to puke a few times, but nothing serious, I'd usually drink 8-10 beers and I think I had a pretty weak stomach.

Once I turned 21 I started drinking by myself and I'd say I'd have one half to one full 750 bottle of vodka a week, usually over the course of one or two drinking sessions each week. At the time, I thought getting plastered in my room by myself was normal for some reason.

I had my first bender type episode when I was 22. Some stuff happened and I ended up drinking for a couple consecutive days. I think I had like 3/4 of a handle of vodka over two days, taking drinks consistently from morning until night.

I went back to my normal habits and my next episode was a few months later, when I had 6-10 beers a day for about four or five days while I had some time off from work.

After that I got things more under control and I went back to my normal drinking sessions and over time switched over to just having a couple beers a day three or four days a week and getting drunk maybe twice a month. I think I got to a point where I realized I hadn't been black out drunk in a year or so which made me feel pretty good.

I'm now 24 and some relationship blues happened and since the beginning of this year I've been black out drunk about six or seven times. These were usually spread weeks apart and I was able to keep it down to like 5-10 drinks throughout the week so I was thinking I was still doing alright, but this past weekend I had my worst episode. On saturday night I drank about 9 or 10 beers, blacked out, woke up and had two more beers and then drank I think about 1/2 - 3/4 a 750 of whiskey, blacked out again, and then woke up and had one last beer, this all being over the course of about 24 hours. I've been feeling really bad ever since then, I think it was kind of a reality check on how I have a history of bingeing by myself and it has me pretty worried. I haven't had a drink in four days and I haven't had any withdrawal symptoms or anything as far as i'm aware. I guess I felt a little ""funky"" for a couple of days as in I had some mild heat flashes but I might have just been over thinking things. I guess my questions are: does my history seem very worrisome? I mean, obviously it does, I guess what I mean to ask is:  is there a realistic chance that I've already damaged my liver irreversibly? I think I'm going to try going a year without drinking and then drink more responsibly, as in less than five drinks per week, but I know if I were honest about my habits with the people I know, they'd most likely tell me to just stop drinking period and call me an alcoholic. I also have been doing some reading on the effects of binge drinking and some research has been saying that binge drinking once a week for just six months can lead to health problems down the road, even if you cut back now. And I've been binge drinking regularly for at least three years. Like I said, I'll ask a doctor but I thought maybe you guys would have some knowledge, thanks.",2

2020-04-02 19:24:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ftwzes/a_work_in_progress/,A Work in Progress,"A long time lurker here, finally taking a more active role. I just finished writing my first post earlier today, describing my journey it becoming addicted to alcohol and my relationship with it today. I also included my goals (""I want to quit drinking because X, Y, Z"") as well as my triggers. Unfortunately, I made some sort of bone-headed mistake and my lengthy, fairly well-written post is gone and lost to the void (despite saving drafts, etc.) …. needless to say I got pretty frustrated and sad that this post, including my ""journey"" of becoming addicted and what's happened since, is gone forever. That being said, I need to learn to accept reality as it is, so I'm moving forward. (I was so tempted to go chug a beer when I realized my post was gone, but I didn't!!!!)

I've identified my older brother and my mom as triggers for my emotional well-being. Until recently, I would consider my job a trigger, but thanks to mindfulness and some other things, I've got the stress/anxiety from my job under control.

I started drinking very heavy by myself at home for two general reasons:

(1) My wife was gone each evening, and so it was my way to make chilling at home alone ""fun."" Also, it was my way to make household chores and also college work more fun. I would be proud of myself and my ability to function while being ""ripped"" on some booze. It was almost a challenge - I remember I would play drinking games with myself via video games (call of duty)!!!! (Each time I die, I take a shot) It was all very much motivated by the 17 yr old spirit of ""let's see how messed up we can get and still walk straight."" I had no idea the long-term damage I was doing to my brain each and every day at that time.

(2) I began drinking very heavy during the last two years of college. At the time, I was beginning to believe that my choice to study at university was a bad choice - that I was wasting so much time, effort, and money! So, I started to become really angry and frustrated at the universe, the world, society, people in general, etc. which fueled my drinking.

Unfortunately, my heavy drinking got to the point I was buying 1750 ml plastic bottles and finishing them myself within a few days. I drank every day, and did NOT miss a day. At one point, I was waking up and having a beer/shot or two to help feel better before work as well. At this point in my drinking, I got to a point where I literally had a hard time imaging a night without booze (it would actually kind of scare me) My brain chemistry quickly changed so that I was no longer drinking for the above reasonsI listed - rather, I was drinking to curb my baseline level of anxiety caused by booze in the first place.

Since late 2016 I've reduced my drinking from what is described above. However, since then, I have still fallen off the wagon and gone on binges when triggered or if I'm feeling super frustrated/stressed. I might go a week or two without any booze, but then maybe I'll stop and buy vodka on my way home from work and be pass-out drunk each night for the next week or so. It's so frustrating to still be doing embarrassing things, like having my wife say how I was passed out on the living room floor last night (it's been a few weeks now) and she couldn't wake me up. She was scared. Here I am scaring my wife again and again because I can't deal with some stress!? What kind of man am I?

I want to stop drinking so that I can return to the person I used to be- the person I know I can be. I want to reduce this knot feeling that is always churning in my stomach, telling me to drink booze to alleviate it. That feeling of irritability and edginess that makes me miss the present moment, act rude or mean to my spouse., etc. I'm ready to be an engaged, healthy individual again who wakes up each morning feeling (more or less) good and happy about myself and my life! I want to have kids so bad, but (due to my own past) I take being a parent extremely seriously, and I refuse to have kids until I know my alcoholism is controlled and not a problem at all, even when things get bad/stressful.

2020-04-02 19:12:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ftwsjs/sober_tips_from_someone_who_has_had_both_failure/,Sober tips from someone who has had both failure and success in extended sobriety,"Here are 10 things I’ve learned and principles to stand by. They are individual to me but I bet they might resonate with you! 

1. Don’t quit quitting. 
2. If it helps, refer to my relapses as SETBACKS, and get right back on the saddle.
3. It’s not “either you’re sober or you’re drinking/using”. That’s not the core dichotomy of my life. The core dichotomy is “either I’m taking care of myself or I’m not.” I can still be taking imperfect but decent care of myself when still drinking/using, and I *must* take that harm reduction care of myself. I think that fact is unfortunately a taboo in some recovery spaces.
4. People who have unproblematic relationships with alcohol do not fantasize “if I were in a magical heaven type of place I would drink all the time.” Wanting to drink all the time is a coping fantasy. We are building new ones. 
5. Everyone is going to tell you to “replace your addiction” with exercise. I mean if you can, go ahead, but most of us can’t, because that’s unfun, it’s as simple as that lol. Instead, I physically interrupt cravings with *frequent* stretching or exercising breaks, not with *long* chunks but *tons of 5 or 10 minute* breaks to do for example micro individual dance parties every week. I do 20 jumping jacks before watching the next episode. 10 pushups, 10 kicks, whatever. Taking care of my body means moving it OFTEN, taking little walks and such, not mere monk like abstinence or thick time chunks of intensive physical training. 
6. Rock bottom is not a necessity. I can become sober after diminishing my drinking and improving my life for awhile. Plenty of people get sober on a life upswing, and their sobriety is valuable, wholehearted, and long lasting. 
7. When I meet other sober folks, observe their body language and social lives. Emulate what makes sense for me, disregard what doesn’t. We are LEGION!
8. Create a list, in my mind or actually on my phone or in a document, of sober mentors, and let their characters inspire me. Maybe a celebrity whose artistry or philanthropy you admire practices sobriety or is teetotal. Maybe a coworker who spends her free time rock climbing has been sober for many years and it informs her adventurous hobbies. Maybe an instagram influencer you love to follow has mentioned sobriety a few times and you realize she changed her life and developed marketing influence skills BECAUSE of getting sober. Maybe your handyman is a chill skilled dude who lives by the beat of his own drum and regrets nothing of his drug years while also regretting nothing of his sober years. 
9. Develop my own sober mentor version of myself. 
10. Know that my life has value whether I am sober or not. Self compassion goes a long way to making it easier to try again. Self compassion makes it easier to succeed in sobriety. 

Number one again is DON’T QUIT QUITTING.

I’m a mixed race, 26-year-old, Pansexual man, who ended his relationship with alcohol and substance abuse on February 2019. Was always a social butterfly, and prided myself in being well-known and in multiple friend groups, and the one guy who can go the distance on nights out, who had to be carried home to end his night, or would go on even after sunrise. But I lost all that. All my fault, not the alcohol. 

The following is what I’ve realised/achieved in the past year that I’ve not in 25 years: 

* Marched in two Prides. First year ever in Pride, got to do two at that. Go big or go home, haha. 
* Ate 3 meals per day for the majority of the year. 
* Got into fitness and am the strongest I’ve been physically. 
* Grew my hair shoulder length, finally. 
* Got a proper full-time job. 
* Joined a D&D campaign. 
* Able to spend time with myself, in silence, and appreciate my own company. Used to freak out when I didn’t have my earphones or something to keep me busy. Now, I can just be. 
* All my problems were because of me, not the alcohol, not other people, me. I was the common denominator; it was time to fix me. So got therapy. 
* It’s okay to have bad days, to have negative thoughts, as long as we don’t act on them and let them define who we are. Take a self-care day on such days.
* Have had people want to sleep with me, but said no because I wasn’t ready. In the past I’d only say yes to please them and because I was starved for affection. 
* Stood up for myself as I’d do for a loved one. 
* Not talk shit or gossip about people. 
* Chaired multiple AA meetings, and got my 1 year sobriety chip at the same meeting I got my 24 hour one. 

This might not seem like much, but it’s honest. This pandemic has caused us all to go into quarantine, and I’m so grateful to the Universe that I have a roof over my head, and my health with me. Was very lonely last year, and weirdly enough, I feel the Universe was preparing me to survive the current situation. Before I’d not have even survived a day. 

Struggling a bit mentally and emotionally, but that’s Human. Remember, you’ll feel pain at the start, so much pain that you’ll cry and suffer in silence, but that’s a sign that you’re growing. It hurts to grow, but it’ll be so worth it. You are not who you were on alcohol, that was not the ‘real’ you. Taking mind-altering substances and doing stupid shit under influence isn’t who you are. You are who you choose to be. So be the very best you can be, one day at a time. Don’t focus on building a house, focus on laying the best brick in the world. You’ll end up with the best house in the world.

I love you all. Peace.",5

I've read so many posts on here to try and ease the urge to get off of work to go pick up a pint (or 5th) from the liquor store and go at it once I am home. I have still been able to come to work with the virus, but I have been drinking so much that I have only made it in a total of 4 days within the past 2 weeks. I find myself waking up, hungover of course, managing to make my kids (5 and 2 years old) breakfast and plop on the couch to feel like I am ""there"" with them. My daughter has gotten use to asking ""Mommy are  you tired again today?"" or ""Mommy are you sick again?"" I know I have a problem, and her asking that on a daily basis breaks my heart.

I keep seeing comments like ""don't do the same things you did when you were drinking"" or ""avoid places you drank"" to help stop. The problem with those 2 things....I would drink anywhere, and while doing everything. The biggest problem I have is that I would mainly drink in my kitchen while cooking. So when I get home and I end up in the kitchen to cook dinner I get the urge and crack open a bottle. If we planned vacations we would base it on drinking, and if we wanted to go play outside I would have to have a couple shots before doing so. I don't know how to live my life without drinking.

How can I control my urge from drinking while being in the same places everyday, and doing the same things everyday when I would be drunk??",6

I quit drinking 5 months ago, in part due to the fact that I started feeling pain in my mid-right back that radiated up to my shoulder blade.  After googling my symptoms (super fun time), I wouldn't find it hard to believe that I'm experiencing some liver inflammation. I'm only 25, but I did some heavy drinking during my 4 years of college. When I exercise and eat right, I feel fine. But yesterday I ate horribly, didn't exercise, and now the dull pain is back. Here's the kicker: 

The doctors say I'm fine. Over 6 months ago, I got everything tested except for my liver: my stomach, gallbladder, and kidneys were functioning normally. The reason they didn't test my liver was because ""I'm too young to be experiencing any liver failure."" But I still feel the pain at least 3 times a week. 

I scheduled a virtual dr's appointment tomorrow. I don't know what can be done virtually other than scheduling other procedures, but I need answers.",2

I ended up going through a bit of relapse in March last year after a few months sober and after some NyQuil got involved I really had to think if this is the path I really wanted to go down. I ended up making choice to have my last drink and gifted myself with a necklace with the date 04.02.2019 inscribed on it along with the words ""not afraid"" and I've worn that necklace almost everyday since last April.

As I sit here I think about the whirlwind of a year I've had. I've stood up at a wedding sober, got a tattoo, began therapy and trauma recovery, started a new job, I've gotten back into regular exercise and meditation and have experienced countless other things, both good and bad.

Getting sober is not an easy journey but I don't regret that I am doing this. Even through the triumphs and the struggles I didn't think I would survive, I'm still here, sober, and actually envisioning a future for myself for the first time in over a decade.

I wasn’t hungover, hadn’t had a bender or anything close. I’m thinking that I was just sick of myself, and the feeling that *it* was creeping into every part of life, and there was no way to stop it. It consumed my thoughts, and it stared early, sometimes when I was getting ready for work at 6am, I’d start thinking about getting a bottle of wine. Not to mention how many times a day I thought about the drink I was going to have a 6pm. Or, I’d be getting ready to take a little weekend trip and thinking about all the drinks I was going to enjoy. Going to a wedding and hoping they would have good wine at the bar, or more importantly, plenty of it. 

I guess I just got sick it ruling my life, and especially my thoughts.

Grateful: To have discovered guided meditation on YouTube. To have found someone ahead of me in sobriety to text with. To be in a safe home with people who love me, and like me -- most of the time. To have a job and a regular paycheck. 

RANT: I am absolutely GOBB-smacked by how much F\*&$ING anxiety I have. Okay, which came first the booze or the anxiety? Was I always a person with anxiety and kept drinking to remedy it? Did drinking all those years (32 of 52) give me anxiety?  Or, is this just what it feels like to get sober? (early days??)

Recent accomplishment: Had “happy hour” over Zoom with two girlfriends and enjoyed my dry ginger soda  which I poured from the can in front of them into a champagne flute. One of them asked why I wasn’t drinking and I said, “I’m going through a phase” and then I laughed at my own joke. It’s a long phase, called the rest of my life.

We’re keeping in touch via messenger and it’s becoming clear to me their dependance on alcohol is extreme.

Posts about being on their third glass of white, or the jug of banana cocktail for one person. Inevitably this leads to nonsense talk like conspiracy theories and all I want to do is close my messenger and never open it again.

 I’m solid in my sobriety (1000 days yesterday!!) and this pandemic isn’t changing that in fact I’m glad because I know how much of a mess I’d be without it and yet I’m calm because I know that I can deal with anything as long as I’m sober, but damn if it doesn’t make me feel worried about where my family is heading... 😕

My family and friends were not supportive at all, everyone seemed really offended that I quit drinking. 

Today when I think about drinking I remember a chemical taste, a sticky stinky sweat, saying things I don’t mean and being over emotional but not taking responsibility for any of it because I was drinking at the time so it doesn’t count?!
I remember the panic and torture when I was out of money or the liquor store was closed and I couldn’t get any. I would even hang around people I don’t like if they offered me a drink for momentary relief, It was never enough there was no satisfaction.

Today I find I am not an overly emotional person, I’m on an even keel. The smallest things bring me pleasure and joy and it costs me nothing. There is still a slight craving now and than because of nostalgia. But it’s easy to wave those thoughts away because I don’t want to give up this peace and freedom, I am my true self now.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day.

For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Tried to get in touch with a doctor to cover me for a sick cert but he's not seeing anyone due to Covid-19. It's nuts. Doctors won't see people but off licences/liquor stores are still open. Opiate of the masses I guess. I wish it were my opiate. But for me it's damned toxic. It ruins everything I profess to love. And then I go back to it. Over and over.
I hope rehab works for me - I'm aware I'll need a support group like AA too. Sometimes I don't mind the meetings. There's an atheist one here once a week which I enjoy.

Just wanted to share a little bit of my story - today I graduated from an inpatient residential drug and alcohol abuse treatment center. I chose to check myself in on March 2nd after a particularly bad bender and it was the best decision I’ve made in my adult life. As I started to sober up I noticed how brilliant colors were for the first time in years! After the detox process I refused any other drugs as I wanted to do this as naturally as possible (I have nothing against using anti depressants or anxiety meds to help cope especially in early recovery but I wanted to challenge myself and do it this way for me) 

It was amazing how much fun I had in there and how many great people I met - both patients and staff. I am continuing with outpatient treatment offered by the facility for the next couple months and I actually look forward to going. I have found myself a sponsor who is well suited for my needs and I check in every night and he is helping me work my way through the 12 steps. 

For the first time in years I feel positive about what my future holds! The possibilities are endless. I know I’m just starting my journey and one month may not seem like much but I’m proud of myself. 

So today and every day forward IWNDWYT!!",26

Some things that have been better:

Sleep

Poops (and poop control)

relationships with wife and kids

being present and available at all times of day and night

returning the favor to my wife by being the designated driver after every party. That was her job for 20 years

ended a difficult work-personal relationship

didn't gain any weight

more regular and deeper meditation practice and exercise

saved thousands of $ in drinks and food

setting a better example for my kids

I think I influenced a few people to either stop or reduce their consumption

won a few poker hands

When I decided to stop drinking exactly three years ago, I didn't know if I would be able to do it. I had tried everything - moderation, counting drinks, drinking only on weekends, etc. etc. nothing stuck. What I learned from this sub has stuck. One day at a time has stuck. If I can do it anyone can try and if you try you can succeed. Here's wishing everyone a happy sober day!

Iv always wanted to cut my drinking back and never thought it was THAT bad i mean. A handle a month. Turn 2 handles. Turned to 3 handles till it was a handle or a 2 a week with my room mate. Mostly on the weekends. Gotta work you yanno? Can not go in sweating it out for everyone to smell.

Cut back to August 16th 2019. Im in a cross walk. Got hit by a car, rolled over the hood and fucked my knee up good. No broken bones but DAMN was i hurting. So. No work. I get to drink woooo.

Well that drinking ramped up hard. My depression hit even harder. Self medicated the depression prior with drinking and videogames on the weekend and unless i had my two little girls than i was dry and spent all my time with them during the weekend. During the week i worked my self to the bone 50-60 hr work weeks and finding small jobs to do. My girls and playing Pool was the only thing i felt living for. Some days. Things were rough with the GF but getting better. Que back to get hit and just drinking all day. Couldnt drive to get my kids, ex Finance couldnt bring em so i drank. And drank. And drank some more.

Well august 30th. Helped my GF get ready to go out with her gfs. Told i would see her in the morning. Come next morning. Head on over use they key she gave to go in... Found her in bed with another man at 730am. Fan-fucking-tastic. Great 3 years down the drain.

Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink. 

Only thing i knew how to cope. Drinking, and being a man hoe. So i did for a couple weeks. Got tired of hoeing to new girl every couple nights. Im old i guess didnt see the fun in it anymore.

Nov1st at at about 1am. I roll my truck off the interstate avoiding some break checking me. Break my nose, pull some muscles im alright. I got lucky. My passenger almost died. Didnt have their seat belt on. Went from the front to the back seat with a couple fractures...

Well than. Decided i need to drink to cope again. Fast forward a to thanksgiving. Had dinner with my brother, my kids, my ex, anf my mom who flew out from IL to see me and my girls.. Great me and the ex argued some. Than she got grounded and told to go home (shes 27 btw) be cause Exmil is raging cunt. So lost time with my girls on the first holiday in 2 years i was able to have them, even though i shared it with my ex.

Well i decided for the next 2 and half days to drink a little over 5L of yeager and Crown. Ended up falling over a waist high fence. Dislocated my elbow and than broke it the way i landed. Its a foggy memory but i remember screaming in pain jumped up and popped it back into place. Well. Called 911 and xrays showed it broken. Fantastic. I just cant catch a fucking break since August sobered up and cried. Straight broke down crying. Im not a horrible father. But im far from the best....Asking my mom for help. She took me out to IL the next day with her home to go to rehab and to heal. Emotionally, physically, and mentally.

Its been r months since i broke my Elbow. 4 months since my last drink.

The road ahead is still tough. Made harder by this Virus going around trying to get back home to the state i live. I miss my girls who i love so fucking much. I miss working, which thankfully i have an AMAZING Boss and still have a job. The man remembers when my oldest was born 8 years ago this month. He is a great friend as well and has always had an open door when i needed it. Im blessed to have him.

I actually met a woman online right before xmas. Shes amazing. All the time to talk we have gotten close and have real feelings. She is supportive of me not drinking and understands so a huge plus and im stupidly excited and nervous to meet her when i get home. But i know for a fact she is a real friend of mine and the feelings go both ways..


I wanna go home. As bad as it sounds i miss video games sold them to have a few bucks in my pocket since i wouldn't have any money. Been living in the country bored out of mind.

This virus caused my mom to lose her job so shes barely making ends meet. And trying to figure out how im gonna get home.

I will. This road is road but worth it. I can only go up from here.

Keep your eyes on the light in the tunnel and it will only get better.



Edit: my biggest take away here in IL only i put myself in my position i am in. And only I can drag myself out. No matter how great of a support group im in or net work i work for myself to have. I have to be the one to do this. Just like im the one that got myself there.",7

I remember them coming under the stall with their parts out asking me what I thought. It's a memory that I have tried so hard to repress for years. Now at 27, I never wanted to be viewed as weak, non manly, or whatever else goes along with being a man. So I have repressed the memory by over doing everything I have ever gotten into, including drinking. Hearing that today just took me to a place of mental clarity where it all came back.

And I think that is a wonderful lesson!  Before, whenever the mildest discomfort came, I would run away with a drink or a drug.  I couldn't handle life on life's terms.  In order to get better it was imperative that I get OK with not being OK.

But somewhere in there I think I got a little lost.  Somewhere in there I started thinking that I had to be not OK all the time.  Like it wasn't OK just to be myself, be a human, relax, not nitpick every little thing about my life.  It's like I have to be constantly striving for self-improvement, growth, and total serenity or else I'm ""missing out"".

I think it's a behavior that's been reinforced since childhood, and it's good to recognize that.  But that's not to say I should blame the world for the perfectionist in me.  Even if the whole world wants to live that way, I still have the right not to.  I still have the right to say, ""Nah, I think I'm just going to take it easy.  I'm tired of living the other way.""

And today that's what I'm choosing to do.

2020-04-01 16:52:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ft8dz8/after_too_many_years_of_drinking_way_more_than/,"After too many years of drinking way more than any person should, I’ve finally decided I need to stop drinking.","I’ve been a lurker here for years at this point, as it’s one of the most wholesome communities on reddit. I’ve known I should significantly cut back my drinking for years, but I always put it off because I’m not your stereotypical alcoholic, so it can’t be that bad, right?

I’m posting this to let you know why I’m now taking action and see how many of us are/were “high functioning“. Maybe my story can scare others like me into taking action too! 

Warning: long stream of sleep deprived consciousness.

The problem is I don’t get “drunk” drunk anymore and haven’t in years, so I felt like my drinking was under control. I drink my 5 - 10 (closer to 10 more often than not) standard drinks every evening across 6 hours. I don’t feel the urge to drink more than I do. I’m not moderating. I just don’t want to drink more than I do. My partner doesn’t drink more than 1 or 2 most days and frequently goes without, but doesn’t consider my drinking a problem because I give off no warning signs. Nobody knows how much I drink or would pick me as an alcoholic, or a likely candidate for cirrhosis, or that I struggle to go a single evening without “a few”. Even when I was drinking my heaviest, most strangers, friends or family can’t tell when I‘m drunk, even when I‘m shitfaced. I’ve even had people tell me they didn’t know I was drunk when I was blackout and can’t remember the conversation. People can only tell when I’m slurring or puking, which is rare. I’ve avoided shots and getting drunk enough to wake up with a hangover for a good 5 years, successfully 99% of the time. Haven’t had a blackout in years either.

I don’t know when I started drinking every day, but I‘m guessing it was about 13 years ago. In my younger days I would go out drinking with friends in hospitality multiple days each week, and occasionally end up having too many and puking or blacking out. On days when I stayed at home I’d have wine or mixed spirits, carefree and never really tracking my consumption or worrying about how much I was drinking; knowing I should cut down in future, but not worried about the present because future me can worry about that. My housemate also drank almost every night, so I was in the perfect enabler company. My drinking continued this way for a few years up until about 5 years ago, where a stressful job increased my drinking to glaringly obvious (to me) alcoholic status. I still don’t think I was physically addicted, as when I quit that job I went cold turkey for a week without any withdrawal symptoms, despite drinking upwards of 10 - 20 standard drinks a day for months, but that was when I knew I had a problem and needed to cut down significantly or I would die. Of course I returned to “beers only” and would have 4 - 6 of low carb a night (5 - 8 standards).

I’ve always said I would quit if there were signs of damage. I even tried Revia, but its side affects made it unviable. The problem I always rejected is that the liver is so good at what it does, a majority of the time it only starts to show signs of damage when it’s nearly failing and too late to return to normal function. I have a friend who never drinks alone, but would drink heavily on Friday/Saturday; he once hit 10x the upper limit on liver stats and got an immediate fibroscan done. The results were fine, but he stopped drinking as the dr said his liver could not handle his weekend bingeing.

I get my blood and liver function tested at least every 6 months, and only my most recent liver function showed **both** stats above the upper limit for the first time, and *only* about 20% above. A few years ago I even tried getting super drunk the day before a blood test, hoping the results would warrant a liver scan, as I know it’d be much easier to stop if there were obvious signs of damage. I had maybe 20 - 25 standard drinks and woke up with a hangover specifically so I’d have alarming results. Again, as always, only one of my liver stats exceeded the upper limit and only slightly; reassuring me I was fine.

I’ve noticed more and more general symptoms over the last year that indicate my past has caught up with me, that I’m no longer “healthy” and drinking is finally taking a noticeable toll. Faint mild internal pains (and occasionally sharp quick ones) that come and go in various parts of my abdomen. Lymph node inflammation. General malaise. Sweet smelling urine. Horrific smelling poops. Benign painless cysts appearing in random locations. Bruising very easily and bruises lasting longer. The heartburn/reflux/GERD (likely from alcohol abuse) has spurred more and more noticeable dysphasia (spasms when I swallow too larger chunks of food) in my esophagus. My last results of complete blood work and urine/STI tests etc came back all good, except for the elevated liver enzymes. I was finally honest with my Dr though, and she told me I need to stop immediately and referred me to a drug and alcohol center.

I often envied people here that drank so much they had to stop or they would certainly die; drank so much it gave them clear warning signs that scared them straight... It feels harder to quit when there’s a possibility you could get away with it for decades more without life threatening damage. Unfortunately I’m able to easily maintain a low level of alcohol dependence without embarrassment or noticeable impacts to work, finances or relationships. I drink less now than I did 5, 10 or 15 years ago. I only drink to the point of a decent buzz. But dammit. Each and every night around 5pm, I really want a drink. 

Still though, alcohol is a poison and I can tell if I continue to drink as I am, there’s a real possibility I may not make it another 5, 10 or 15 years (I‘ve probably already done irreversible damage) so I guess it’s time I say goodbye to alcohol. I’ve decided to not stop drinking with you all only for today, but forever too.

Big thanks to u/mangocupoftea for [this post](https://reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fstjqb/ive_been_wanting_to_post_this_for_a_while/) and scaring me into taking this step. I know I’ll probably fail a few times but at least I’m now being honest with myself and what I need to do. Hopefully any future failures don’t push my body over the edge of no return (and I haven’t already)",6

I know I have been reading a lot of posts how folks are struggling and if you are please reach out .  For anyone new ,including me, early sobriety is a tough one especially given the state of things .  I hope if you are struggling right now you know you don’t have to do it alone , reach out and someone will answer .  

So here is a few things that have to say are really positive in the last two weeks. I have been socially isolating at home with my partner and child .  Spending a lot of quality time with my son has been amazing , though he gets on my nerves I feel like I’m just showing up for him day after day.  Today we started his first day of homeschooling and I put together a lesson plan and have spent the day so far working though the lesson plan. It’s been great !! 

I also love how I don’t feel like crap.  I’m getting good sleeps and I feel strong . I feel like I can focus on making sure everyone is taken care of in my circle.  I am delivering grocery’s to the seniors in my family and making sure they are well looked after .  I also have extra money in my pocket after a few months of not getting pissed all the time so that again is helping financially though this thing .  Im feeling a bit down about the whole situation but for the most part my depression has not really been present which is amazing . 

The old me would have used this as an excuse to get drunk for days on end.  There is a voice in my head that tells me that I should have some drinks but today I made a choice and tomorrow I’ll make another one .  Stay safe out there and thank you for all the love .  You folks are amazing and I love you all .",3

Today marks two months of sobriety.

&#x200B;

This is my second period of sobriety. I was sober for about 140 days last year and I got complacent. I thought I could have just one drink.

&#x200B;

Oops! Wow, oops is an understatement.

&#x200B;

One drink towards the end of last year led me to hitting that slippery slope. Yeah it got me. I had to find out for myself that drinking any amount of alcohol is not good for me. I cannot moderate my drinking. That's it. I'm acknowledging it.

&#x200B;

I have learned that having none is better than having one.

&#x200B;

The first few days of February were difficult. I mean really tough. There was fear. There was guilt. There was shame. I went to bed, I crawled under those sheets and I white-knuckled it for several days.  I learned about ""kindling"". I'm not going to lie, reading about that scared the wits out of me.

&#x200B;

Kindling is the body having an ever more powerful reaction to withdrawl. I don't want that in my life. I  do not want to be a burden on others as a result of my actions.

&#x200B;

Everyone has difficulties to deal with. Mine are mine to deal with. I'm sure that you, dear reader, have yours too. Whatever they happen to be, I'll share this with you... No problem has ever been made easier by drinking.

&#x200B;

At the moment, I'm getting my act together. Writing is one of my ways of coping with my situation. I am trying to be kind to myself. I know that others are in a more difficult condition than I am. I've been saddened and fearful of recent global events. I've cried. I've been emotional. I did not drink.

&#x200B;

I have also prayed. I know... Its not everyone's thing. My faith is my own. I'm what some would call an ""Agnostic"". I believe in a higher power. I'm not sure exactly what it is. It could be an omnipotent being, it could be that the higher power is our collective consciousness. I think I was praying to the goodness of humanity. I was praying to all of us; all pulling together to give ourselves and our neighbours  greater serenity, peace and contentment in our lives. There is no contentment in a hangover.

&#x200B;

Alcohol is part of my past and I want it to stay there. I do not want it ruining my present. I do not want it to ruin my future. I'm going to overcome my fears and my doubts and I will keep moving forward with my life.

&#x200B;

Love to you all!

I can honestly say the difference has been unreal. I have seen a positive change in my mental heath, parenting, and ability to complete goals/tasks.

My mental health has not been great, and since I've been WFH for the last month, I've been alone in my thoughts. What really has sucked in my position with alcohol recently is that I have a great relationship with some local brewers, and I get a lot of free/cheap beer. Well, instead of saving this for special occasions, I've just been consuming it all. At least 2 beers a day for the last month. It's tanked my mental health and I've realized that I need to get my mental health back into an acceptable place.

So, for the time being, I'm done with alcohol. My social life tends to revolve around bars and breweries, so I think the quarantining will help me reestablish an okay relationship with drinking and in the future trying to lean away from that. It might be forever, and it might be temporary. Who knows, but I want to have a good relationship with alcohol. If I can't, I'll know.

It started simply because the doctor said my liver numbers were a little high. He wanted me to cut back for 6 weeks and have the blood work done again. 

I decided to use this time and really try to better myself. Stop drinking, eat a little better and maybe exercise a bit. 7 days in and it has already been crazy! Without alcohol and just walking/jogging daily for the length of an episode of Tiger King (just finished today; She definitely killed him), I already feel so much better. So much so that a 6 week break may not really be what I needed. Maybe it's a complete lifestyle change. 

Now, I know we're all here for different reasons and whatnot. I never really had a big problem with alcohol in the past. Just enjoyed scotch and wine while living a sedentary life these past couple of years. I'm not saying I won't ever drink again, but this past sober week was been amazing. I' sleep better, have more energy, long weight and just feel a sense of accomplishment like I'm actually doing something productive during this ""working"" from home time. 

My 6 weeks for the doctor is the first week of May, but if we are still stuck at home, I see no reason to hop off this train. As shitty as the world seems, life feels pretty good right now.

If I drank a moderate (heavy by medical standards) amount, I would fall asleep but then always wake up around 3:30-4 AM in a cold sweat, anxiety-ridden, heart-pounding semi-panic. I would usually lay back down, watch Netflix or something and try to fall back asleep but would never get past a light doze, then wake up feeling like shit.

Last night, on the eve of my first 2 weeks sober in years, I woke up at 3:30 AM. I KNOW I didn't drink last night, so what gives? 

I got up to get a glass of water, deep in thought as to why this happened. Was it a ghost-withdrawal? Some sort of mind-fuckery my addict brain was playing at me to try to get me to get a night-cap? 

Then I remembered something I read in this forum the other day... the reason you wake up in the middle of the night after boozing is because your body starts processing the carbs and sugars from your drinks after a couple hours. When this happens, your other systems start to come back on line as well and it it wakes you up.

Then it dawned on me... I got instacart delivered yesterday and it included ice cream which I haven't had in WEEKS thanks to the isolation. I finished work late last night and ate a bunch of ice cream around 11 right before bed... my body must have been in SHOCK with all that sugar flowing through my veins. So much so... that it woke me up 4 hours later. It had to be the fucking ice cream!

I laughed to myself as I drank my water. Who would have thought... all the years of alcohol abuse I have under my belt and now, 2 weeks sober and I'm getting foiled by late night ice cream. How delightfully ironic. 

I went back to bed and I'm happy to report my heart wasn't pounding, I wasn't sweating, I had no anxiety, and I wasn't panicked... though I did have the giggles a little bit because of how ridiculous this situation was.  Annd... about 20 minutes later, I was able to fall back asleep.",8

This is SO awesome! Wa-frickin-hoo!!!,"I went boozing Friday/Saturday nights, like standard party drinkers to a full fledged, multi day benders drunk. All after my wife cheated on, then divorced me.  Broken heart, broken ego, broken home - it all broke me and I found a solace at the bottom of an empty bottle.  I have FULLY realized and accepted booze is not for me.  Big life positive right there!  

Anyway...  *Sleeping* has been a problem for me for years and years.  My issue is going to sleep.  Let me rephrase that, my issue *used to be* falling asleep!  Somewhere around the 20-day mark my sleep started to get better. Now I'm finding myself going to bed, because I'm sleepy and I want to.  In the past, for many years I would have to go to bed because the clock said so.  

So here I am, 44 days sober, I went to bed last night just because I was sleepy. And I woke up refreshed!  This is so different guys, I can't even put it into words.  

So clearly, even when I was ""just"" a Friday and Saturday night boozer, I was totally fucking up my sleep.  My sleep rhythms, my circadian rhythm.  A bit of googling around and talking to some close friends, and much to my surprise, it's not the least bit abnormal.  Screw your sleep up two nights in a row, and it will take you quite a few nights for your body to get back to normal.  And of course when I was drinking three, four, five days a week, and sometimes going on benders, omg, my sleep was atrocious.

This is such a pleasant surprise for me, I had to share with you guys!  I'm going to say since I was about 30, I had decided that I was just a crappy sleeper, and it is what it is.  It's not! It's fucking alcohol!  **And that means there is actually isomething I can do about my sleep, and I'm already doing it!**

I LOVE this sub, and I love you guys!

2020-04-01 12:09:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ft2njh/1_year_free/,1 Year Free,"Hi Everyone,

I quit drinking one year ago today with the help of this subreddit. The emotional baggage that came with giving up drinking was immense, and those first few days were spent empathizing with everyone else going through this struggle. It's been a roller coaster of a year, but I have emotions again and I'm genuinely excited to connect with new people (as difficult as that is for me) in my life. I feel more patient and have a much greater sense of appreciation for the things I can't control in life. Things aren't perfect, but they DEFINITELY aren't what they were. I've stopped comparing myself to other people - they may not have gone through the same things as me - their success doesn't look the same as mine and that's ok. 

If you want to stop also, begin seeing yourself as someone who can beat this - someone who isn't controlled by this. When you re-conceive your sense of self outside of the drink, you can be free. My life is immeasurably better, thanks everyone and stay strong! You have all given me strength and I hope to give you some too.",30

I've been lurking this sub for years, don't think I've ever posted.  I'm a 23 y/o college student, I've known my drinking is a problem since I was 18.  After going away to college fall of 2015 I quickly developed a 10+ drink a day habit, almost daily, 9 months out of the year.  I was taking adderall in large doses every day, vaping constantly, eating poorly, and drinking every night.  I've been to 2 outpatient courses, one after passing out in front of a bar and the other after a DUI.  I still continued to drink.  It was fun the first year.  Then I failed out of school, lost my friends, started drinking heavier.  I managed to work my way back into school while continuing to drink, I'm currently a junior and plan to graduate next spring.   

I started having hip pain April of 2019, it didn't go away after a month of PT so I had an MRI done.  At the age of 22 I was diagnosed with Avascular Necrosis of both hips, and signs around my knees as well.  I had never heard of this, I didn't realize how this would affect me.  After speaking with an orthopedic surgeon I was told both of my hips are collapsing due to a fatty buildup in my blood, preventing my femurs from receiving blood.  After being honest about my drinking, my doctor told me that is the most likely cause.  I had surgery on my right hip to try to stop the deterioration, I don't think it worked.  I quit drinking for 5 months after I found out about this problem, but started again after my surgery.  I still need a total hip replacement done on my left hip (and maybe my right).  My surgeon wants to wait as long as possible before doing this as I'm way too young for hip replacements.  My mobility has gotten progressively worst over the past year as my femurs continue to collapse.  I can't run, jump, hike, stairs hurt, and I have a bad limp.  Some days I can barely walk.  Every step I take is painful, I honestly can't remember what it feels like to move without pain.  I'm 23 with the mobility of an 80 year old man.  I still continue to drink knowing that this can and will spread to my other joints and they will collapse if it does.  

I know I need to quit, I quit for 5 months before so I know I can do it.  I've quit taking adderall, quit vaping, I'm trying to eat better.  Sometimes I'll go a week+ without drinking but I can't seem to quit for good.  It's hard living in a college town where I've built so many drinking habbits, and I only have 1 year left so I don't want to move somewhere new until I graduate.

It's truly amazing how I can be in so much pain from a disease caused by my drinking, and continue to drink when I know it will get worse and spread throughout my body.

Please don't think that health problems due to alcohol only come later in life.  It's easy to read a post like this and think ""that guy got unlucky but something like this won't happen to me, I'll quit before I develop health issues"" but unfortunately there's no telling when alcohol will ruin your life.  This past year has been one giant blur, I still can't believe this is happening to me.  I used to be healthy, happy, smart, I had good friends, I have a great family, I don't even know how this happened.  All of a sudden I'm a shell of who I used to be.  This isn't supposed to happen to a 23 years old.  I will never have the healthy body I once did.

I realize the hypocrisy when I say to seek help and get this under control before it's too late, but if this post inspires even one person to get sober then it's well worth it.  Thanks for reading.",16

I haven't had any cravings really so that's a win. But some of the withdrawals were tough. Really had to force myself to eat and when I did I felt like vomiting half the time, never did though!

The other major symptoms ive had is both exhaustion and difficulty sleeping which had me feeling like a zombie. 

Last night I got a solid 6 hours though which is better. Today I still feel a bit groggy, but it feels closer to ""I didn't get quite enough sleep"" groggy and not crazy withdrawals groggy. 

The girl has a product shoot tomorrow, bottle of wine which we'd normally drink afterward, obviously I'm not doing that so it'll be the day she learns I'm quitting. Shouldnt be an issue just feels weird to bring up but that's something I'll get used to I'm sure. She doesn't drink much at all though, maybe a drink or two a week. Usually just when she video chats with her friends. 

Ya know when this was over I thought I still might have the social beer occasionally, at the birthday party or on Friday with my father but at this point that has zero appeal to me. Maybe much later on I could handle that but right now I don't even want to touch the stuff whatsoever. 

Overall starting to feel better. Still got a bit of haze and I'm not sure my appetite is quite back yet but think I'll be able to throw back a sandwich or something soon.

2020-04-01 07:31:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fsy267/day_8_i_am_so_angry/,Day 8 - I am so angry,"Hi everyone,

First of all, I am sorry about the quality of my writing. Brain no work good this morning.

TLDR: Me sober, fiance wants snu snu. The buildup throughout the day made me more and more anxious and when the time came I bailed and have been anxious ever since. 

&#x200B;

So this is day 8 of no drinking/smoking for me. I am so angry/sad/determined. I feel like I am gently fizzing. My head is a little full but not hurting. I have been having waves of anxiety since last night.

See, my Fiance wanted to be intimate and she can be very intense when she is in the mood (which is often). We have had a few conversations previously about my lower sex drive and need for personal space (I don't like being touched sexually by surprise/casually) and usually, we agree on sex tonight or tomorrow and that gives me time to, fk idk mentally prepare or something. I was sexually assaulted when I was in my late teens which has something to do with it but I also just do not like being touched without my consent and it takes me a little while to get in the mood mentally.

One thing I should mention. The lowest point in my 'drinking career' was recently when I blacked out after finishing 750ml of whisky in a few hours, then (in my blackout state) took some benzos that were in the house and THAT extended my blackout state into the next day. I came too in a store in a nearby town chatting normally with a clerk. I was shaken to my core. It was the least amount of control I have EVER had in my life. I had more control over myself when I was coming off anaesthetic post-surgery.  I had more control when I was tripping on 3 tabs of acid at a rave. I was terrified after and I think that loss of control affected me more than I knew.

Anyway last night, after a day of random make-out sessions (which is always an indication my Fiance is in the mood) my nerves where fried. Usually, I enjoy kissing her and once the time comes we have amazing sex that is so intimate and makes us feel so connected. But this time, the moment I started to get physically excited I was hit by huge anxiety and had to pull away and literally go into another room and shut the door for a bit. The anxiety stayed with me all night and I don't sleep well.

I figured it would pass by the morning but I got very little sleep and woke up feeling as bad if not worse. The cats where being rowdy and I was unusually strict with them, throwing them both outside as soon as they did something that annoyed me. It felt good to do that, then I felt like a bastard. Now I am sitting here, fighting conflicting emotions and trying to focus on work.

I don't want to drink because I know that will make me feel worse. But I don't want to feel this way either. Sometimes I guess you just gotta bite the bullet and deal. I know that this will pass and my fiance and I will find our new normal with sex and my sobriety. I will probably calm down once my body has time to adjust to being sober but this sucks for now.

Also, my fiance already accommodates my lower sex drive with so much patience and love, and I feel like I just cranked that tension up a notch which is SUPER.",4

I just wanted to share this with someone as I’m a bit lonely, I think we all are. I don’t have a lot of people in my life, I don’t go to AA or support groups, I was more of a spontaneous quitter than someone who wrestled with quitting and relapsed and tried again and again. I never had any desire to stop or saw any reason to, until one day I just did. It’s still been hard, early sobriety being the worst part. Oooof the feelings! But this quarantine has been getting to me. Like I said, I’m usually alone anyways, I work from home, don’t have a car, but I love to go see concerts, go on trips, thrifting, antiquing, other things I enjoyed that gave me some social interaction and satisfaction with the obscene amount of cash I saved from not poisoning myself. Anyways, I’ve been feeling really cooped up and frustrated.  I know we all are, but I was pretty unphased at first. I like solitude and enjoy doing things alone, but the anxiety and loneliness is starting to get to me. I’ve been tempted to drink. I know it’s just to fill the void left by the lack of doing the fulfilling things I love, seeing the few friends I have, seeing my family, and also seeing what feels like everyone on social media drink at 11 am and romanticize alcohol, having ads for wine delivered to your door pop up on social media, etc etc. I know I just want some stress relief and to tune out of everything that’s going on, to feel numb and blissful and happy. And I know that drinking and using would only create a bigger void, make me feel horrible and guilty, cause me extreme stress and sadness, but fuck if the little devil on my shoulder isn’t trying to tell me a few glasses of wine or a joint won’t kill me, it’ll make me feel better! I deserve it after being almost a year sober, I deserve it dealing with the quarantine, I deserve it for working so hard. I know it’s all bullshit, but it’s weird being sucked back into this backwards ass way of thinking. I guess I’m just feeling desperate and anxious and cooped up. But again we all are.

Now, I've been struggling quite a bit lately. For the first time in several months I have found myself  tempted by the vodka bottles at the grocery store; the only place I have been in the past 2 and a half weeks. The thoughts, you know THOSE ones, have been strong. ""You can have just one. This is a stressful time and literally everyone is drinking right now."" When I saw those bottles the other day it felt like I had to restrain myself from grabbing one and putting it in my cart. 

Anyway, back to the dream. Everyone was drinking in my dream. We were out roaming dark streets and people were walking around pouring liquor into people's mouths and it was a big strange celebration. I kept saying, ""No, I don't drink"" but people were pressuring me anyway. A guy from my SMART group was hosting a party so we went to his house. In the dream he had a girlfriend and in real life he is married. I kept saying, ""I thought they were married!"" like reality was trying to seep in.
We sat down and he told me I could drink in moderation and that he had been doing this successfully; that all this abstinence shit we learned about wasn't even true! So I decided I could have one wine spritzer type drink which I sipped carefully. But soon after I opened up my bag and there a bunch of little vodka bottles in it. They had just appeared and I didn't drink them but saved them for later. We decided to go home. Then I became violently ill- worse than real life detox sick, but similar. I woke up from the dream gagging with a pounding head. There was more but other people's dreams tend not to be interesting for others, so I won't bore you if you made it this far.

This was honestly the dream I needed to have. I needed a reminder of how poisonous alcohol really is and what would most likely happen if I had ""just one glass of wine"". All of the sudden, there would be several bottles of vodka out of nowhere and I would end up extremely ill. Maybe my subconscious was looking out for me this time. I know a lot of us are struggling right now. Stay the path everyone!  I definitely will not drink with you today!",3

I feel like it'd be a missed opportunity for a lifestyle shift in a time like this. Bars are closed which just leaves me to drinking at home but even at home it's the same thing. I scared myself a couple days ago after a night of binge drinking in my room. At least I know I won't have to go out if I'm experiencing withdrawals. I'm also taking an indefinite break with weed so I'm in for a wild ride but I feel like I can handle it as long as I stay open, honest, and active in spaces like this and others.",36
2020-04-01 03:30:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fsv1ll/hot_mess/,Hot Mess,"A mod kind of ""talked me down"" yesterday, at check-in. He has 1000+ days. I don't know how he (or she) grabbed me so quick, but I suppose the universe works that way, if you're trying. It's 3am. I simply can't stop thinking about it. I got some gruesome news about my daughter, in an assisted living, and my schizophrenic grown son almost got arrested yesterday. I have a bad case of the ""Poor me...poor me...pour me a drink""....I know other people have it a lot worse than me. I am grateful for this sub, and sobriety. I decided to make sourdough bread,  to distract myself, and for the first time in three years, I actually though about drinking the hooch off my starter! And like a fool, I started smoking again. I had three ""emergency"" packs stashed, and I'm blowing through them. (Emergency packs...that's an addict mentality for you.) And of course, the Nicotine has me all jacked up. If I get in that car...I'm done. So, say a prayer for me. I hate to be such a drag. My sister has 22 years, my mom does, too. Why am I such a loser at this? As a nurse, I know the dynamics of my addiction is screwing with my head, but there's a REAL part of me that's feeding into it. Big time. I just didn't expect it to be so soon. If you pray, please pray for me. Too many people need me, to not screw this up. Especially me. God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the Courage to change the things I can, and the Wisdom to know the difference. Godspeed, my sober friends....",8
2020-04-01 03:15:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fsuunm/i_could_have_died/,I could have died....,"I have been drinking probably 15 to 20 drinks a day for several years plus. Never arrested, no DUIs, no violence. I’m a 67 yo female so no youngster. Every time I went to my doc, everything was okay. I could drink a 6 pack, bottle of wine plus various size bottles of liquor every fricking day. Then I had a Covid scare and decided I needed to stop. My stomach was a wreck and doctor said I had pancreatitis. I woke up every morning in pain, nauseous, dry heaving etc. I said that’s it. I want to live. 

So I stopped drinking and immediately went into withdrawal. I drank every day, all day and never was drunk. My spouse didn’t know how much I was drinking. Bottles hidden all over the place. I had some Valium so that helped the first night, but I was jerking around, sweating, dry heaving etc and I thought, this isn’t working. The next day, I didn’t know what to do - shelter in place plus I was in no condition to drive. I finally went next door to my trusted neighbors and said I need to borrow a bottle of wine. This was last Friday. I came home shaking and drank it. I immediately felt better but still in withdrawal. Went back the next day, said I needed another bottle of wine. Brought that home, drank it throughout the day and kept most of the worst of the withdrawal at bay. Next day was Saturday. My dry heaves were gone but still shaking. Went next door in the afternoon again and said, I need a beer. They gave me a beer and I drank it down. Then I had a second. Then I said I think I’m okay now and thanked them. I went to the corner store and got some Natty Lights which taste like beer water. I drank two of those. Could now somewhat sleep at night. I was really starting to appreciate how much alcohol I had been drinking for years. So on Sunday, I had 4 Light Beers spread over the day. The shaking stopped. Monday, I had 2 Light Beers and my appetite greatly improved. All my calories had been alcohol. I slept last night for the first time in about a week. Tuesday late this morning, I had my last Light Beer. My pancreatitis is subsiding and my food intake has been phenomenal. 

That’s it folks. It’s not worth it. I don’t care how great your tolerance is. It was the withdrawal that scared me to death. Tonight I am 10 hours sober and no beer in the house. IWNDTWY",125

Actually picked it back up a couple weeks before I left when I went out with some co-workers but now it's become a daily thing.

Had a couple ***drunks*** since I've been out of town and the last one (Saturday night) wasn't fun at all, being in quarantine and whatnot. So I told my coworkers/housemates I'm quitting entirely until we're out of quarantine (hopefully longer but I'm trying to set short term goals).

One other guy here doesn't drink so it's cool to have someone on the same page as me. Another coworker tried offering me a beer a couple times because his drinking buddy (our boss) went home over the weekend so I guess he's lonely (haha). I turned it down, which was really tough for about 1 or 2 minutes but I didn't really think about it after that.

Last 2 days were kind of hellish mentally and physically but tonight I went out for my bedtime cigarette and noticed I felt a lot more peaceful. I think turning the beer down helped bring about that sense of inner peace as it put action behind my decision.

Anyways, it's almost 3 AM here and I've been dicking around online for like 2 hours. Gonna try and get a couple more hours of sleep before work tomorrow. Just thought I'd share.

Thanks for your support!

In the meat department. The past three weeks have been HELL. 70 hour work weeks, rude customers , being yelled at spit on, coughed on and totally disrespected by uncivilized human beings thinking the end is near.  
Finally I broke down last week and bought a bottle of wine. Had a glass one night, finished off the bottle the next night. Next day bought a 12 pack. Lasted 2 days. Next day bought a bottle of tequila, 2 days gone. 
I went on a week long bender and I'm so fucking ashamed. It happened FAST and I'm so surprised how quickly bad habits can come back! I did not drink today and I will not drink tomorrow. I won't let those 2 months of sobriety be erased because I fucked up for a week. Back on the wagon for me.",220
