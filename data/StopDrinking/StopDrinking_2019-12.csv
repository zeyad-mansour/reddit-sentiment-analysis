Day 1 of the trip is about done and it has been a 12 hour party, which includes heavy drinking by almost all others participating.  

I enjoyed myself thru dinner before it got really drunky around here.  

Would I be out of line leaving tomorrow and spending my NYE away from this situation?

I'm over 3 years sober and I enjoy my friends up to a point.  But we passed that point tonight and I have no doubt it will pass again tomorrow on NYE.  

The worst part is being told by my wife that I need to lighten up and get more involved.  This is the woman that almost left me dozens of times during my active drinking.  I feel bad leaving the party but I think I know what I should do.  My sobriety has to come first.  

Am I over reacting?   Thanks for reading and IWNDWYT.",10

Growing my business. In 2019, I was able to directly attribute my productivity and business growth to the periods when I was sober. I’m looking forward to additional, continuous growth in 2020. 

Losing 25 pounds. I was able to drop about 20 pounds in 2019. Logging my meals and weight (including drinks) regularly in an app showed me that I gain weight when I’m drinking (because the calories in booze plus always eating like crap when I’m drunk and/or hungover). When I’m sober, I make better food choices, move more, and the weight sort of falls off. 

Continuing and growing my yoga practice. Let’s just say that hungover hot yoga is the absolute worst. 

Reading at least one book a month. I love reading, but I loved booze more for way too long. I’m looking forward to getting lost in at least 12 books in 2020. 

Taking a risk. I’m not sure what this one will actually be...maybe starting another business, or auditioning for a play, or sharing some art, or taking some classes...no clue. But when I was drinking, my anxiety would be so high, I wouldn’t ever take a risk or put myself out there. So we shall see about this one...

Since weed became legal in CA, I started buying edibles. I’ve always enjoyed burning, but the edibles are great. When I was drinking, my sleep was erratic at best so instead of taking sleeping pills, I would take an edible. 

Every now and again I will take them socially, but it’s mainly for sleep.  When friends find out I quit drinking (I didn’t broadcast it at first), I don’t tell them I’m “sober”.   When they find out I’m still eating edibles, they say those don’t count when it comes to being sober.  While I don’t completely by that, I’ve never had an issue with weed.

I’ve been getting super depressed, I even stayed home Christmas (I live about 2200 miles from my family so I go to a friends.) Well guess what I did? Yup you got it, had a pitty party for one and drank a six pack of 9% beer getting drunk.

Last night I decided not to drink, even though I wanted to use my teams bad playing as an excuse....we always have excuses. After New Years, After the Super Bowl, after saint patricks day. It’s a day I’m awake. 

I can’t handle hangovers anymore so if I do drink a ton I sit at home playing video games or binging tv so the cycle starts all over because I’m tired of being hungover. I even started smoking cigarettes again. One saving grace I have found is if i smoke weed I don’t crave nicotine or alcohol but I have to be careful because I don’t want to replace two expensive/destructive habits with another one. 

Also my doggo. Doggo helps me a lot. A lot.

  I had been sober for about a year and a half. I’ve never really been a heavy drinker like everyone else I’ve known so kinda I feel out of my element here, but I do have a drinking problem. What started it was I got a retail job mid 2017 and picked up drinking for the 5 months I had the job. 
  
  
I quit drinking temporarily when I quit the job, not much in terms of withdrawals but by early 2018 I was back at it. I quit again in may of 2018, right before my niece was born. This time was worse and I almost went to rehab for withdrawals. Sweating, racing heart, heavy anxiety, bad insomnia. But I live with my grandmother and she had dealt with way worse with my drunken grandfather and we’re too broke to afford hospital bills. Not to mention my younger sister went to rehab 5-6 times for booze and then opioids, and I didn’t want all the attention. Sooo... I just plowed on. 
  
  
At worst I was going through a fifth of bourbon every 5 days so she didn’t feel I was that bad off, compared to my grandfather who died drinking while on dialysis. Or her friend, for example, who drank so much he would have full blown DTs while still drinking, would wake up in a rush at midnight and tell his wife the ferry was docking and they had to leave now.
  
  
So I quit. And I was doing great up until this month. It was a bunch of things that started it. Having to move houses. Dealing with living where we are now. Dealing with my anxious dog and grumpy grandmother. Trivial stuff but because it’s the holiday season why not have a couple White Russians? 
  
  
This turned into having 1-2 drinks every other night, which quickly spiraled into “hey I need a bottle of grand marnier for my cranberry sauce recipe”, and of course fuck the cranberries, this is really for me. When that was half-gone, “hey I need a bottle of kraken for my annual rum balls”. And because I was trying to walk a thin line, I’d measure my booze out. One or two 1.5 oz drinks most nights. A day or two break here or there. I think I had maybe 3-4 drinks just once, on my worst night. I did make two big batches of rum balls this month, ate one batch and half of the second one.
  
  
So here I am again quitting, hopefully for good. I had my last drink 3 days ago when I swigged off the same  grand marnier bottle and dumped the rest down the drain, much to my grandmothers horror (“how DARE I waste half a bottle of booze when I’m trying to head off a drinking problem”, this coming from a teetotaler, money is more important I guess).
  
  
Big mistake, it was like immediate hangover from maybe 3/4 ounce which amazed me. So my last drink was 3 days ago but before that I didn’t drink for three days. Now all the temptation in the house is gone, down the drain, reduced to atoms.
  
I’m pretty sure I’ve got minor withdrawals, I feel stupid saying that coming from 2 drinks a day habit for hardly a full month. Especially after not drinking for a year and a half. I see online “men can have 2 drinks a night or no more than 14 a week”. Bullshit. I didn’t even reach 14 a week and I still feel minor withdrawals.
  
My grandmother empathizes now and tells me not to worry. I’m really feeling the fear. Mainly it’s anxiety and acid reflux. If I focus on doing something the anxiety level goes down a bit, typing this out for example. I’ve noticed my ankles swollen lately, water retention I guess. They aren’t as swollen today. I craved sweets like crazy the first 2 days, I didn’t realize how much sugar was in just 2 drinks a night. Got a slightly sour stomach these last few days too. Trazodone and Prilosec helped me but now I’m on my own.

Anyway that’s my story, thanks for reading. This all feels stupid to be typing out but I need to vent this anxiety somewhere. Keep telling myself I’m not dying from a 2 a day habit for a month. It’s really good inspiration to never drink again though. A year and a half clouds the mind to past withdrawals. Trying to quit smoking pot and that doesn’t help either, but that is a different story for another time.",6

I cannot stop until I black out and do stupid shit. I think I am going to ruin my life as I am completely out of control when drunk. I honestly do not know what I am capable of.

The last 4 weeks, I have basically went on a bender every 2-3 days and get black out every time. I went out with friends to a bar and told myself I wasn't going to drink. I had 2 cups of coffee, then talked myself into having ONE pint. Then, 2 hours later, I downed 3 PITCHERS of Long Island Ice Tea in 20 mins. Then I went to the bar and ordered 2 bottles of red wine and that is the last thing I can remember. Lost my wallet, phone, got punched a few times. Probably should have been arrested.

There are countless stories like the one above. I have smashed pubs up, chucked glasses around, started fights, been arrested. I just can't help it. I wish I could moderate, but I just can't. It is either all or nothing.

Do I sound like an Alcoholic to you?",10

I recently started a new job and quite frankly it’s just never going to work if I don’t try to do it sober. When I first started I got sober for a month, but after a round of bad luck with a few different things I was right back to buying a box of wine a few times a week. Tried again a few times, but after a week or so I’d fly off the handle again.

Thanksgiving was a breaking point; I was so hungover Thanksgiving Day that I was running off to throw up every hour or so. I don’t see my family very often, so it was just disappointing to me and I barely got to eat any of the food we all worked so hard to make because I knew I just wasn’t going to be able to keep it down.

Since then it’s been a little here, a little there and bouncing back and forth. I wanted to really commit to a dry January, and I knew the easiest way to do it was going to be to take Day One on a weekend and go from there. I have a big event planned on the 1st, and starting there and facing withdrawals was just not going to work. So yesterday it was.

I felt miserable all day, pretty much just binge watched Netflix and played around on my phone. Read a lot of posts here. I was shaky and wobbly if I got up to go to the bathroom, and didn’t sleep at all last night alternating between being hot and chills. I knew what to expect and I’m glad I got my day one out of the way. I’m still tired from lack of sleep today, and still getting some chills, but it’s better. My day one is usually (thank god) the worst; idk how some of y’all do it where it gets worse before it gets better. Even today I’ve been tempted to have a small glass of wine just to make the feeling go away, but I’ve played the tape forward and I know where that’ll take me.

Anyway, just posting for accountability’s sake; I’ve done my best bouts of sobriety when I’m consistent about coming here and I’m ready for a new year of health and a commitment to sobriety. I found a picture of myself only a month into sobriety from a few months back, and I looked so happy, thinner jawline, clearer skin. If I had that in a month, I’m just concentrating on what I can do in a few months or longer!

Yesterday I vowed not to drink after a couple weeks of getting drunk almost every other night. I went to a comedy show with a friend who was drinking and decided, ""okay maybe one or two"". I was doing great with that limit...until the feelings came. I'm recently divorced (2 weeks) and am living alone and single for the first time ever at age 33. It feels bad and weird, man. A friend invited me to play pool to take my mind off things and of course it was at a bar. I don't remember how many I had...

I ended up getting recruited by some random college guy (🤦🏾‍♀️) and we went back to my place. Luckily nothing sexual took place but he did drunkenly pick me up and then dropped me on my head on hardwood. I also somehow cut my shin really badly.

I need help. 😞

Alcohol is really starting to rear it's ugly head. The past few weeks have been full of regrettable hookups, injuries, hangovers, embarrassing comments on my part, and poor eating. But even before the divorce the drinking  was a problem.

I'm scared to be sober though. Going to bars has been a part of my life for 10+ years. I feel confident and fun when I drink. I don't want to be left out because people know I quit. The journey seems hard but at this point my only other choice is to let this become worse, which would probably end up in a physical addiction. And that's scary.

I think I will look up SMART Recovery and finally address this problem head on instead of pretending I can moderate.

I’m 34F married 12 years with 4 young kids, aging 1-8. I’m a stay at home mom and I love it. But this year has been rough. From a fussy eating infant, to a big death in the family, to a leaking roof that led to a huge renovation, it’s been one thing after another. Plus in the spring my husband suddenly developed some pretty serious personal issues related to mental health. He’s in therapy, but it’s still ongoing and I don’t know what the future holds for us. (Which was a huge shock, we’ve always had a remarkably strong relationship.) Then in the summer I developed a health issue of my own, but it’s in my right foot. It may be months before it’s healed, and in the meantime I can’t really exercise. Where before I went at least 3 times a week religiously, as exercise was a big stress reliever for me. I know I have been drinking in a different way this year. I’ve quit or cut back plenty of times without much trouble, of course for 4 pregnancies but also just to lose weight or feel healthier. It’s just that right now I have some really tough days and I’d be lying if I said there weren’t times I was grateful for alcohol. For example, on Thanksgiving I spent the morning crying, wondering what my family will be like next holiday season. I could tell my kids felt lousy and confused, and that my husband felt awful about hurting me. In the afternoon I had a couple glasses of wine and I was able to get out of my head a bit, smile and just enjoy the meal as a family without worrying so much about the future. I know it’s not a long term solution though, and I’m committed to doing dry January - already started - to reset and reevaluate. But it’s hard to think of feasible outlets for the stress I’m under. With 4 young kids I can’t just take a walk or meditate or something. Most of the time I’m running around like a chicken with it’s head cut off while being screamed at by small humans. Is there anybody out there with young kids that can relate? How do you relieve stress with them underfoot all the time? Thanks for reading.",3

I've been hospitalized multiple times for detox symptoms, I've gotten a DUI, sabotaged numerous relationships, the list goes on. The last couple months have gotten worse after a break up, which I was told wasn't because of my drinking, but it would be foolish to think it wasn't a contributing factor. 

Last year was my longest stint of being sober that I could remember, a total of 5 days. How did I reward myself? A six pack of my favorite beer. Six turned to Eight, then to 12, then to 15 or so a day and suffice it to say this years been a blur.

 Ive been waking up the last couple months to being sick, throwing up just straight stomach acid most times. I don't eat a whole lot since most of my calories come from beer. My hairs thinning, my eyes need eye drops every morning, my weights to high, im always a sweaty mess even just sitting in an AC'd apartment.

My weirdly enough wake up call? Trying to buy beer Sunday morning, I just through on Jeans, t-shirt and a hat to hide my greasy unshowered hair. Got an Uber because I had been drinking all night alone, went to my go to gas station down the road. The clerk who ive seen quite a lot didn't even recognize me, he thought I was homeless, even yelled multiple times within the span of seconds ""NO ALCOHOL"" when he saw me head for it. I then remembered oh right its Sunday, cant buy beer until noon, so I started to put the beer back. He thought I was stealing it, he sprinted around the counter and down the aisle and looked like he was about to fight me.

When I got home I looked in the mirror, wow. Just wow. I honestly didn't blame him, I didn't even recognize myself.

I can't keep making excuses, I need to do this for myself.

I’ve been keeping a daily gratitude list... on Saturday I listed my bike on that list and decided to go for a long ride. It was raining a bit and I slipped turning onto a rode going faster than I should have. I ended up popping the front tire and scraping my arm pretty bad. I thought of the irony ... perhaps it was some kind of a test? 

The reality is that the first thought that came into my mind was to go drink tequila. That seemed liked the best solution in that very moment of anger / pain.

But I dusted myself off, and walked my bike home (about 2 miles) I was bleeding and it was raining, but it was also pretty peaceful! By the time I got home I was laughing about it and the urge to have a drink over the accident was lifted.

One day at a time... some days have been easier than others but I’m trying my hardest not to drink “no matter what!”

I had already pretty much gave up alcohol for my diet. I was down in weight and in pretty good shape. Well my work was not making payroll right before I went on vacation. Then there was talk of a merge.

I went on vacation. I was a bit upset at the situation. I was also stressed from the vacation, driving and the lure of alcohol. I had stopped drinking for about a month before then and when I would drink it would be very little, like one drink at dinner. Almost to the point where I thought it was kind of rediculous to continue drinking.

We showed up at the campground where we met my sisters family. I talked to my brother in law. He asked if I want a beer. Without hesitation I said yes. That was that. From then on I drank every other day to push down my negative feelings about work. All the worry all the pressure, only do have it bubble up again with indigestion and cold sweats at 3:30am every day.

I still have daily work stress, but I face it head on. If it is too much I go exercise, read posts here or nap.

I was self medicating to run away from uncontrolled problems but it really just made the fear worse overall. Now the stress and anxiety is a low hum in the background compared to the constant screaming and shouting I would get when in withdrawal.

I never want to be back in that headspace again. IWNDWYT. I actually set out to legit quit this time... No lingering doubts. My mind is made up and I'm stubborn.",1

I am a binge drinker so I can go long periods of time without a drink but when I drink I usually blackout because I seek oblivion, to not be present at least for a while. At first, I thought it was normal because a lot of people go through this stage in college (getting as wasted as you can and not caring). (I have social anxiety)

I have gone to a few parties sober and it is great but all my energy goes into not pushing the ""fuck it"" button instead of mingling. I finally admit this year that yes I have a drinking problem and that my drinking is not normal.  

I read ""This naked mind"" by Annie Grace which has helped a lot but just because I understand that I am poisoning myself does not mean I am fully against it because unfortunately, no matter how hard I try to forgive myself I still hate myself for my past mistakes. I have been going to AA and therapy. I have apologized to everyone but I crave to be punished if that makes sense. I have written in a journal for myself to read when I next want a drink but somehow I completely ignore it when it matters the most. 

I have many regrets and my shame is so strong I sometimes do not want to be seen in public. If someone was to confront me for actions which I would not even remember I would have a panic attack, I would take responsibility and apologize of course but I would literally let the person treat me like shit and take it. I feel like I have gotten away with many things I should not have and I want atonement. Some days are easier but others make me want to be swallowed by the earth. The hardest part is that it is an endless tug of war between sober me which is a good person she gives and does not care if she receives and drunk me who is a selfish, loose and self-destructive girl with an unrealistic ego (that I do not agree with like at all).  

I hope to do better in 2020 and wish you all a sober 2020. <3

My dad has been struggling with addiction for over  25 years now (he’s 49 and I’m 21 for reference)  which has been a very bumpy road for our relationship. Watching it affect his life so greatly, I’ve tried everything in my power I can to encourage him to get sober. I even stopped speaking to him for over a year when I turned 18 and said that I couldn’t let our codependent relationship continue to be the way it was and I was hoping by cutting him off it would motivate him to get sober. Eventually, I realized the only person that can make him get sober is himself and we were able to set boundaries that he would not call me while he was drinking or if he’s around me he won’t drink (he lives across the country but this was still a very big step) 
I can tell how miserable and lost he is. He watched his own father struggle with the same addiction and he passed away right around the same age my dad is right now and I’m terrified every day that he will die before he gets to see what life is like sober. 
That being said, I was wanting to send him a late Christmas present of some kind of tool (like a book) that might help him find a sense of direction and encourage him to consider getting sober. I’m just looking for suggestions of any kind of books or anything that are directed or might be taken well by a middle aged man. I just wish there was a way I could get him to understand that I love him and there’s more to life than just drinking which there probably isn’t but I just wanted to see if anyone had any suggestions or recommendations that helped them get through this hell of a battle.",3

Long time lurker, first time poster.

I would like to ask advice on how all of you strong people decided enough was enough. I want, and know I need to, stop drinking every day. My health has gone down, I’ve lost friends and my loved ones are distancing themselves from me. It’s awful I see this and I feel that I don’t care, that I like drinking and that’s their problem.  

I have drank a half bottle of vodka every day for the last 11 years and I have never told anyone that. I function in my job in finance and as a person (barely) and because I haven’t had a moment where I’ve burned my world down I keep following the same routine, like a zombie. I’m always tired, agitated and reliant on my routine of sober till 8pm then wrecked off whatever I can lay my hands on so I’m in a heap the next morning trying to hold off the next drink till 8pm again. 

I’m sorry if this the wrong sub to ask, this isn’t a cry for help and I’d appreciate if there is a more appropriate sub to subscribe to, but since I’ve joined this sub a few months ago it’s given me a lot of reason to question myself and my actions that I didn’t have before. I know all of those reasons I shouldn’t drink above should be enough but so far it isn’t. I’m afraid of when the reason I feel enough is enough comes around it will be too late to keep the people I have in my life.

Much appreciated for even reading this far, your friend who doesn’t know what to do.

I’m going to try not to drink with you today. X

Edit: I’ve been drinking every day since I was 17 which is what I meant above (i can only remember 3 days In that time I haven’t had at least a 5th of vodka). It is my routine and how I made day to day normal, I haven’t really known anything else. 

Thank you for the support, it has been an incredible response when I felt alone in this. I haven’t drank today and I don’t want to.",17

i have some questions

i am not the one drinks but my hubby does, someday he can drink a 26 er a night and some nights he drinks a flask. 

a week or so before Christmas, things went pretty bad and he decided to quit drinking for a while ( he wasn't sleeping for 4,5 days then sleep for 1 maybe , and he didn't realized  that it was alcohol that kept him up and thought the drink helped him sleeping )

he didn't drink until Christmas. it was a very good time. his mood was better, started to sleep better at night. and i felt like i'm having the person i know and love back.  he had a flask throughout the Christmas Eve, then nothing Christmas Day, and 5 beers boxing day during family dinner. 

He didn't drink after that, but his sleeping was off again, not as bad, but he didn't go to sleep till 4,5,6,7 ( all kinds hours in the morning ) and didn't get up until afternoon. he also felt like he is going down with something like a flu and feeling super tired ). 

last night during the family outings, he wanted to go to the store and asked to get a beer. i didn't say no, but he picked up  two beers along with two of those tiny tiny drinks. i was really pissed of when i saw it when we got home because i felt betrayed and i felt like he is not trying anymore and the alcohol is talking (he bought me a beer and gave our son some money to buy candy, which i think is not being nice but making him feel less guilty about what he is doing ). he was pissed off because i got mad at it and dumped out all the drinks to prove to me that he is not alcoholic. 

&#x200B;

am i right to think that his behavior last few days are from Alcohol withdrawing and he is acting out of wanting to drink again last night? and  he is going to revert back to drinking heavy  again being nasty ?

i really don't want to go back to the circle again like we will never make progress in life. like one week he was good and gave me some hope then the next week he s back to drink heavy again and being nasty and depressed and everything else that alcohol brings on ?

i'm trying to go to counseling because it really give me anxiety when i see him drinking and i don't think social drink is possible yet at this stage as i'm feeling like walking on ice to think he is going to snap at any time during the drinking if i say something wrong, but he doesn't get it and doesn't understand why i am being like that even though i told him im traumatized by the past

&#x200B;

i just need some insight 

&#x200B;

sorry for the long story",1

2019-12-30 12:52:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ehpcnv/100_days_an_honest_look_back/,100 days - an honest look back.,"So here I am - 100 days without a drink.

A few months ago I would have been happy with 3 days.  I was caught in that viscous cycle of feeling like shit from drinking, and drinking to not feel like shit.  My drinking started in high school although my first drinks were probably when I was 13.  Growing up i was always in bands.   And my friends and I partied a lot!

I got into college for music and both my drinking and music career started to take hold.  My drinking progressed pretty rapidly in college - lots of blackouts.  Being in the music scene, my drunken episodes were on full display for all to see.  Its not that everyone didn't think that i wasn't an alcoholic - they would just get annoyed with me when I would declare that i was going to stop repeatedly, and never did.  The band I was in at the time broke up in spectacular fashion on the day of my graduation.

That morning I woke up and started drinking with my friends to celebrate graduating.  But when everybody else stopped, I kept going.  Even leaving to go a bar to take a quick shot.  I kept drinking throughout the day and that night my band was performing.  I don't remember any of it, but from what people told me I could barely speak, couldn't remember my lyrics or how to even play my guitar.  I took off my guitar and threw it at a wall and then just sat on the floor while my band continued to play.  They were not happy with me.  Luckily there wasn't too much bad blood - and we're still all friends but they couldn't be in a band with me anymore.

In the years since graduating I moved around with my long term girlfriend, whom I eventually married.  And my drinking went from social drinking (albeit not under control) to drinking alone at home.  I work from home so it was easy for me to kick back a few brews throughout the day.  But that progressed to the point where I was drinking all day, every day.  Fully isolated from the world.  Drinking wasn't fun anymore.  It was making me miserable.  Its only with hindsight that I can see that slippery slope I was on.

This past summer I tried stopping on my own a hand full of times.  The drinking was starting to effect my health.  My stomach was always in pain and I was so bloated.  Then one day in September I decided enough was enough and I was going to rehab.  Within 48 hours, on September 21, I was at Highwatch in Northwest Connecticut.

It was an amazing experience!  Fully separating myself from the rest of the world to just reset my head and look at my drinking from an objective vantage point was truly eye opening.  I was killing myself slowly.  And couldn't see that when I was in the throws of my addiction.

But here's the honest part.  I haven't been good with sobriety, or I should say being a member of AA.  When I got out I went to as many meetings as I could.  I was staying with my parents in CT so I knew some of the people at the meetings from Highwatch.  But then life happened.  My wife and I moved back to Arizona.  My grandfather passed away shortly before that, so within days of us getting home we had to go to Chicago for his service.  We stayed for 10 days through Thanksgiving.  By the time I got back home to AZ a month had gone by without going to a meeting.

I've been to a few since but not going nearly as frequently as some suggest.  The thing is - I haven't drank, and frankly dont want to.  There have been moments where I would think - ""what about when such and such happens"" - but then I think I can't worry about that - I just know I can't drink right now.  Tomorrows another day.  And that mentality has been whats been getting my through this.

Playing the tape too has been really helpful.  Its not hard for me to think back on my drinking and come up with a few memories that make me see how bad drinking was for me.  No more rose color tinted glasses.  Being honest with yourself is so important.  If you can't see that you have a problem, then no one else will be able to help you. Speaking of which, I should probably hit up a meeting today shouldn't I?",5

If it is…that is all you need to know. It then becomes a choice of what we want out of life and what we are putting up with that is standing in the way. Not whether or not we are an alcoholic.

>>TRY THIS: Do a future self meditation. One of my favorite tools EVER is a guided meditation I did with my coach that allowed me to go deep on visualizing future Holly.

The meditation itself will do a number of positive things, but most importantly, it will help you hold a vision of what direction you want your life to go, and who you want to become. And that person most likely isn't stumbling out of bars or drinking a bottle of wine in the evenings by yourself 10 years from now. When you focus on THIS…and hold a clear idea of who you want to be in 2030…it makes the question of ""do I have a problem"" moot."" - Holly Whitaker",8

This is my biggest issue with drinking. Not the dumb shit I do the night of,  but that I always fail to reach my potential the day after.  So many lost opportunities and experiences. I'm such a waste when i'm hungover.",26

I was doing lots of drugs the first time, research chemicals, $40 coke a day, stoned all day long, moderate drinking. The second time, I had stopped doing the drugs, partially because I’m on probation, but mostly because I knew that I would just get too out of control too fast. But I was still drinking a fifth (2 pints) of 43% Evan Williams whiskey a day. 

My time sober was very confusing. I went head on into AA. I attended business meetings, made friends, even chaired a meeting once a week. But I still felt isolated. I thought that I fell in love with a girl in the rooms who doesn’t give a shit about me. I started going to the gym 5 days a week, and the immense effort that I put towards my diet and strength training was another addiction. 

But eventually, because I’m sick in the head, I had the thought to drink again. To go to a metal show. And now ive been drinking for 5 months. It’s completely out of control. I can’t pay my bills, I’m only working at my job because it’s easy and I can drink on the job. Last night I went out with one of my childhood friends to see the new Star Wars movie and I blacked out and made an ass of myself.  

He called me this morning to see how I was. I was completely blacked out last night. apparently I had to be escorted out by security, I fell, by his description, “about 20 times”, I have a huge cut on my head and my arms are bruised. And my car is still at the theatre and I have to work today. 

I’m getting to the point where I don’t view sober life as any better than drunk life. I tried SO HARD to do everything right when I was sober. You’ll all probably say to work the steps and maybe that’s the problem, I made it to step 4 but I was really a “dry drunk”. The spiritual awakening that some of the old timers talk about though...they aren’t living it. Maybe one in a hundred. 

Honestly I want to die. But that’s giving up, and I never give up. Just hoping for some personal experience or wisdom from people like me...",3

I use to binge drink 2 to 3 times a week so getting it down to once was a small success. For some reason I feel on edge, anxious even... maybe because I don't know what life or how I'll be without my comforter (alcohol).

When I started my journey, I was retaining a massive amount of fluid.  It was difficult for me to walk without losing my breathe, having to stop and rest, let alone climb stairs... I literally could not climb 10 stairs without being seriously winded...

I've now lost all the water weight (65lbs to be exact) and have begun starting to work out.  I invested in an apple watch, I exercise (mostly by walking long distances with my wife and dog for the time being) and walking up and down the stairs in my home.

On my commute to work, during the final leg, there is a realllllllly long escalator, like you're literally on it for 2 minutes to get to the top... There is also obviously a stair case, which consists of about 8 sets of steps  / landing platforms and is quite steep.  I never in a million years would even entertain the thought of walking up them even when I was not sick.

Today I got off the train and stood at the base of the steps... I thought to myself, you know what... I'm gonna do this.  I have to do this.  If it hurts, deal with it... If i get winded, I'll take a breather... I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna do it everyday from now on to build my strength...

AND...

I DID IT!  I didn't run up them Rocky style, I just walked normally, not even slowly... I did get winded but I didn't slow down, no pain or stress in my legs and I friggin did it... I counted on the way exactly how many steps it was... 102 to be exact.

I got out of the station and I was so proud of myself!  I am going to do it every day!!!

EDIT:  It may not seem like much, but when you get the point where you can barely function, you begin to take simple things like walking up stairs for granted!  I felt so silly yesterday telling my wife that I am going to take some time every day to walk up and down the stairs in the house... But hey, I am going to do everything in my power to stay sober, healthy and stronger than I ever have been...

Since then I have gone to watch my soccer team on boxing day and got home around 3am, which is a normal standard for me

What is not normal by any standard is my inability  to tolerate a hangover. 
My method to combat my hangover was to start drinking, which has been known previously. So while I was sat in my living room with my partner and child, the next day (27/12/19), I was secretly drinking vodka mixed with tea. Normally I would have no issue with making tea 'Irish', but I was only doing so to evade detection from my partner.

She has then asked me to go to the shop for her, to which I agreed, but then on the way out of the house I got caught up in a conversation with the neighbours. I have little doubt that they knew that I was drunk at 1.30pm in the afternoon.
I am embarrassed and believe that they already have their suspicions about my binge drinking.

Long story short, this culminated with me nearly finishing a whole bottle of vodka between the hours of 9pm and 2.30am to myself.
I am no longer dismissive about my partners concerns about my drinking an her claims that I will end up dying as a result of my drinking.

The knowledge that I can drink that much an still be standing seems to have opened my eyes about my drinking. So I have stopped earlier than  I said I would (28/12/19).

I just dont know what to do with myself now, in terms of how should I be starting my recovery  ?

2. You see things more clearly, with improved focus.

3. Other people don’t notice as much as you think they would. Ultimately they say “oh, you got glasses; they look good on you”, and then nobody notices or mentions anything again. Similarly, “oh you stopped drinking? Good for you, you look great”. Then your “new you” becomes just “you”.

4. You gotta protect your glasses so you don’t forget them, scratch them, or break them. Same with sobriety; prioritize it, keep it with you at all times, etc. One lapse of attention or judgement will cause a setback to deal with, etc.

5. I got the “blue light” filter since I work with computer screens all day. Similarly, sobriety will keep the blue lights (aka the police) away. Haha 😬 

Could think of more but I have to get to work.

In this time, I have started a lot of things, and finished a few others. It isn't easy, I am still me and the past is still the past, but the future looks a lot more approachable.

I'm struggling mostly because my wife still drinks nightly, and it is an ongoing balance of detachment, concern, and hope. I'm spending equal amounts of time on my own sobriety and al-anon related media and thinking. It's a lot. 

I have some strange and intense family members where I live, and some very real ptsd from the place where I lived before. People are so self-worshipping, and it drives home the aloneness. 

My mom died suddenly last year and I'm finally able to start looking at pictures, saying her name or taking about her out loud. It is so hard but so real. I don't want to miss an excruciating minute. 

My work is in transition and I'm winding down a 15 year business to make room, while waiting / hoping for a new offer from my primary client to take me on full time. It is hard to let go but I need the peace more than anything at this stage of life.

My band has added a new (sober!!) drummer, a guy half my age with great energy and attitude. Lots to work on there. 

My kids live all over the country but I helped one of them move into a new place yesterday. Saying yes to things at any time of day or weekend is so nice. 

I'm afraid because I'm exhausted. The rush is wearing off and temptation is still in my face constantly. I'm also afraid because I feel so alone in all of this. Nobody gets my work, my family, my sobriety, my challenges, my strength. I work out alone, eat my own diet, write my own songs, seek my own comfort, and rely on my own strength, all the time. 

Lately I've been having a lot to do and think about in the evenings and the smell of alcohol on my wife's breath just makes me want to scream. She wants to care for and support me but it's worse for her than I wanted to admit, and that scares me too. 

But you know what? Fuck it. Life's too short. I'm gonna keep doing me and see what happens. Grateful, hopeful, scared, whatever. I'm going for a run because that's what I said I'd do on mornings when I felt like this. 

And yeah, did I mention I haven't taken a drink for two months!?!?? 

That alone is a lot to crow about. My worst character flaw might be  never being satisfied, no matter how good things are going. But it also drives me to go further. 2020 is going to be my first sober year. So excited. So scared. So hopeful.

By accident because I'm clumsy and stupid when drunk. Last night I smashed something valuable to me and I can't get it back. I was devastated but if that can motivate me to stop drinking it will be worthwhile.

I tried to moderate my relationship with alcohol, that has failed and I have ended up with daily binge drinking again. So now I will be aiming to have no relationship with alcohol and have alcohol be permanently not a part of my life, any more than I would drink any other poisonous substance.

I drank alcohol over years to deal with social situations. I'm a very shy and reserved person and the truth is that being in a social situation stresses me out very much. I think I have been blaming friends or family for requiring me in situations thst stress me out enough to drink (both during and after to wind down), when I should just be blaming myself for saying yes to situations that stress me out, and stop using them as an excuse to drink. From now on it's just short 1 on 1 interactions for me like a coffee or a walk in the park then I'm going home.

I drank alcohol to deal with many other stressful situations in my life, I have been told that I have had a more extreme life experience,  everyone has their troubles I know.

I live with and care for my parent who has complex, treatment resistent psychiatric diagnoses originating from childhood trauma that have been treated with inpatient care a number of times. I have also blamed my alcoholism on my parent's emotional intensity but won't be doing that anymore.

I'm pretty optimistic about my ability to stay dedicated to an alcohol free future and just keep on trying to be sober. Right now I feel completely worthless as a person, I am just a worthless drunk getting drunk every day. I don't want my life to get more out of hand than it is. I just want to feel ok in life and not be acting on my alcoholism by drinking all the time.

That's all I can think of so thanks IWNDWYT",4

So far, I've beat the social pressure of drinking and can resist it easily. Honestly, my current challenge lies in my propensity to drink alone. I've asked myself the question of why I do this so many times it almost gives me a hangover  just thinking about it. Having thought about it all last night while not being able to sleep, I started asking myself some questions, and I ended up wondering whether some of the addiction is reflected in how well I know myself. In other words, what my core values are. Wtf? I realized I hardly ever take the time to examine and define my core values. I can't be the only one....how many of us have taken the time to truly think about, and write down our core values? 

So I finally fell asleep, and when I woke up I took a pen and paper and started investigating my own core values. Things like Integrity, Accountability, Humility, Helping others, Curiosity, Transparency etc. It opened up a whole new set of beliefs that I believe will help me fight my addiction. I will do this periodically to see how my values change and prioritize themselves over time. I think this is something everyone should consider doing just to see how it can help. Know yourself. Does this resonate with anyone or do I sound foolish?",5

Family of mine hosted a party. I brought along my new boyfriend. It started out smooth, but ultimately, I indulged into too many drinks. Before I knew it, I blacked out. My boyfriend told me that I kept dancing on him (no music), feeling on him and sitting on his lap...in front of my family. He said he was super embarrassed for me as I was the most drunken one at the gathering and was sure that I never displayed that sort of behavior around my family. That statement was very legit. He said he tried to talk me into leaving, but I wouldn't do so until my family literally sent everyone home. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed of myself and I'm sure I'll never be invited out again. It's almost New Years and I have absolutely no urge or desire to ever drink again. I've definitely blacked out before, but it has not been to this extent in a long time and my family has never witnessed this side of me...I feel like I disrespected myself, their home and violated my boyfriend and put him in a very awkward situation. I plan to apologize to the family, soon. I haven't been able to sleep or eat as the anxiety of that night has haunted me. I'm generally very respectful and really do not know why I drank so much and displayed such behavior. I hope their perception of me is not too bad...their perception is probably the biggest thing that's eating me alive, right now. I generally partake in drinking on the weekends and usually, I set a limit. However, this event out of all events, I simply did not stop drinking and openly displayed sexual behavior toward my significant other, right in front of family who maintain conservative views. I can't help but to think about how I've been a single mom and how they may be associating that night's behavior to my situation. Lol.

A month later I went to college, and I have never lived back there again. However, I visit my family there every Xmas and I think about my dad constantly when I am there, I like to drink. I like to drink until all of the alcohol (beers wines, spirits) are gone. I know I have a problem. I can drink a few beers, but I always want more. I went to several parties with my alcoholic family and I just drank too much over and over again, culminating in me pissing and shitting my pant in my mom’s room, which I do not even remember because apparently I had also taken my double dose of ambien. The level of shame I feel about this is palpable. It is difficult to think of anything else right now. I am back home, away from my family, so think are ok now, but I have to deal with my drinking, I am tried AA, but so did my dad and everything I think about going, I think about him and how it failed him over an over, I did tried AA for about 9 months, but it didn’t eWorld for me, I think my next step should be to find a therapist who I can’t trick and lie to him (or her) too help me through this.i feel like a real dick for putting my mom through that, she has has her experience of cleaning up drunks.

""Hey dude, good idea on the stop drinking thing. January 1st will be three years for me and it is one of the best things I could have done for myself. I have achieved so much in that time it's crazy to think about. 

I'm happy to chat anytime if you want but here are a couple tips that helped me:

* Take up a new hobby to fill the time. In the beginning you might get bored so it's important to get out and do something e.g. Running, hiking, swimming, gym 

* Have a goal or something to work towards and link it to the above like running a half marathon by the end of the year or losing X amount of kg from gym etc. 

* This might be tricky but don't abstain from social events because you aren't drinking. Rather go and have one or two non alcoholic beers or invite friends to lunch somewhere that doesn't serve alcohol. If you don't socialize because you aren't drinking, when you eventually do you might slip up because you associate socializing with drinking. 

* Download an app that will keep track of how many days you have stayed on course and be proud of your achievement. 

* There is a really helpful online community that I often visit and read some of the stories that both resonate with me and bring back some past memories of how it felt the morning after and reminds me of how badly I wanted to stop the cycle because over time, you forget how bad you felt the next morning and how much you want this.  https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/""",27

This post is pretty unstructured and ramble-like.

I don't know that I've chosen to quit drinking altogether, but that's the direction my life seems to be going.

One thing I've noticed is that I tend to turn to alcohol when I feel sort of hopeless about my life. Alcohol distracts me from my pain. Unfortunately, it also makes me feel depressed, drains my bank account, and affects my memory, which in turn fosters the conditions for me to feel even more trapped and hopeless, and so the cycle of drinking to cope with feeling sad perpetuates itself.

Anyway, I managed to change a few things in my life that were contributing to a general of feeling of hopelessness for me, which in turn led me to cut back on my drinking substantially, and... here's the thing I've been thinking about:

Since cutting back on drinking, I've returned to meditation and Buddhism - two things that used to be a huge part of my life. The less I drink, the more present I feel. The more present I feel, the more I feel drawn to meditation and Buddhism. The more drawn I feel to meditation and Buddhism, the less I want to drink, because drinking interferes with my ability to be present, to pay attention to what I'm thinking and feeling, and to live in alignment with my values.

Not sure why I felt compelled to share this here, and my post is pretty disorganized, but still wanted to post this anyway. I hope it helps or inspires someone!",9

2019-12-29 23:59:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ehhfq9/day_5/,Day 5,"Just wanted to record a few thoughts here. Any advice or thoughts are welcome. 

Long story short - I've always been a heavy drinker but things started getting much worse this past summer. I started drinking alone 3-4 times per week and going into work hungover, something I had never done before. Most nights I would get drunk and cry by myself. I'm a 35 year old guy, BTW. I also started getting into cocaine, another activity I hadn't touched until August of this year. In early November I tried to run a check and quit drinking but I only lasted about 9 days before I got wrecked and did much more cocaine in a single night than I had ever done before. At a work event, no less. Things were getting out of control fast. 

That weekend while recovering with a hangover, I reached out to an addictions counselor and started listening to This Naked Mind. I didn't stop drinking right away, but I knew that I wanted to. We've met a few times now and I decided in the last session that I wanted to quit drinking January 1. The therapist and I both agreed that the holidays would be too challenging of a time to quit. I've spent a lot of time since then reading about alcohol abuse, learning about long term effects of both alcohol and sobriety, and writing in my journal about what role (if any) I want alcohol to play in my life from now on.  

I got drunk on Christmas Eve while home visiting my parents and I realized something - I don't even like drinking anymore and I haven't for years. Alcohol just numbs me while I'm drinking it, and then leaves me depressed, anxious, angry, paranoid and thick-witted when it's worn off. I can't sleep. The only emotions I feel then are anger and hopelessness. I'm rude and irritable to the people in my life who love me and who are trying to help me. 

So I decided on Christmas morning - why wait? Why should I wait until after the holidays to stop this and turn my life around? There's always going to be a reason to drink and reason why it's a bad time to stop. It's always going to be someone's birthday next week, there will always be a wedding coming up, New Years is just around the corner, and oh yeah don't forget about St. Patrick's Day! My addiction is always going to tell me that the weather outside is EXACTLY perfect for a coffee with a bit of liquor on the couch, or an ice cold beer on the patio downtown. So I decided I wanted to stop that day instead. 

I was supposed to go to a party with a bunch of friends yesterday evening, but instead I made up an excuse and drove a few hours away to a town where I knew nobody for the weekend and made up a BS excuse why I couldn't go. I knew it would just be a drunkfest and that I wouldn't be able to say no once I was there. I'm going to do the same thing for NYE, too. 

Instead of getting drunk, I relaxed in the hotel hot tub and worked out in the gym. I went to the mall and shopped, but didn't buy anything. I got some really bad cravings the first evening but I tried to counter them by drinking a ton of water and then going for a walk in the cold listening to This Naked Mind on audiobook again. I played that first drink forward in my mind and assured myself that I would CERTAINLY regret it. I made a list in my journal of all the benefits I hoped to get from sobriety. Then I drove home this morning, relaxed for the afternoon and then posted this. 

I'm just going to try to take things day by day and stay focused on my sobriety. Ultimately, I want to stop drinking entirely but for now my goal is to make it at least until the end of January and re-assess. I also want to surprise my therapist on Jan 9th and tell her that I decided to start earlier than we had discussed. 

Thanks for reading this. I have been lurking in this community a lot lately and have found it to be a great resource, there are many inspiring posts here. I hope that one day I may contribute with some inspiring words as well, but for now I can only pledge that I will not drink with you today.",19

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi everyone! 

Thanks for your lovely welcome, congratulations and gratitude yesterday. You all warm my heart, every day. 

Here we are, the day before New Year’s Eve!

Yesterday I told you I’d post about the sober supports and strategies I’ll have in place for tomorrow. It’s a long post, but it’s that time of year and I think it’s important to make solid connections with each other right now:

Planning ahead is part of my statement of intention to remain sober. 

***Eat properly throughout the day***

Making sure my blood sugar stays stable throughout the day will minimise anxiety and reduce the likelihood of cravings.

***Take an afternoon nap if I need to***

If I can, I’ll squeeze in a snooze, even if it’s only 10 minutes of lying quietly and resting. 

***I won’t bow to obligation***

I’m not spending time with people I don’t like or who don’t support my sobriety, no matter what pressure is put on me. If I find myself in the company of a dickhead, I’m out of there!

***Keep YOU in my pocket***

Even if I find myself alone in a sea of drunken revellers, I will have you – my sober support network – with me the whole time. If I find myself struggling, I’ll duck into the loo and read some of your stories, comment and post if I need to.

***Have plenty of special drinks available***

I’ll make sure I stock up on nice soft drinks, bubbles water, mocktails, fruit juice, maybe some Seedlip, or something else that makes me feel festive. And cheese! There will be cheese and chocolate.

***I’ll pay attention to my feelings and bail out if I need to***

I will let everyone know ahead of time that I might pull a ghostie on them. I’ll pay attention to how I feel. If I get tired, if I’m not having fun, if I get cravings, I’ll leave. I’ll go to bed with my book. Because I am important, and everyone benefits when I look after myself.

***Observe and remember – cultivating gratitude***

I’ve found that this really helps me a lot. I will observe – *without judgement* – the effect each drink has on the people around me. 

I’ll see their faces get flushed. Their eyes get a little bit glassy. Their volume rise. I’ll watch them lose their straight posture and good manners. I’ll watch their facial muscles get slack. I’ll watch them become more demonstrative, affectionate, lose their natural reserve and discernment. I’ll listen to them tell the same stories again and again. I’ll listen to them argue, get emotional and reactive. I’ll see them slide slowly down into that place I never want to be again. But they want that; it’s still fun for them, and that’s okay with me. That’s their business. I just don’t want that for myself anymore. 

I’ll take myself to bed. I’ll wake fresh and settled. I’ll watch them struggle through the morning, joking and groaning, choking down greasy food and gulping water. Talking to each other and me, trying to fill in the blank spots. I’ll watch them check their phones and wait the day away, tolerating the first day of the new year until they can either start drinking again or go to bed and get it over and done with. 

And I will feel so damn grateful that’s not me anymore.

That’s just a night with intimate friends and family. Not out on the town where things could get *so much worse*.

See, it just stopped being fun anymore. It became a nightmare I was trapped in. And I never, ever want to go back there.

So, those are my plans. 

I’m interested to hear what you guys are doing. Are you hitting a meeting? Choosing solitude? Going to a community dinner? Doing a yoga retreat or Netflix binge with ice cream and your cat? Camping? You never know what will help another friend on the journey, and it’s often not what you expect it to be. My list isn’t comprehensive by any means, and is customised for me. Yours might be completely different, so please feel free to chime in.

I’m stepping aside tomorrow so our beautiful mods can steer us into the new year, and I’ll be back on New Year’s Day to check in with you all!

If you made it this far, I’m impressed! I’ll make my next post short and sweet.

I will not drink with you today!

Have a great day!

Love,

Starlight",91

I will preface this whining with the statement that I am definitely better in all areas of life since stopping drinking.  Being sober is the best thing I have ever done done for myself and my children. However I just need to get some things out that no one in my life will understand. My marriage is pretty crap. It was before, but I could just drink my way through it. I have kids still in the house, and I will stay through that. Mostly, my favorite time of day is when I go to sleep. Sleep brings the avoidance of an empty life. This sounds so pitiful when I type it out, but I’ve been thinking the thoughts for so long. I’m not going to drink, but man do I miss the complete obliteration for just those few moments. It’s the disaster that follows that keeps me from picking up. Thanks for letting me put my negativity out into the universe. Perhaps getting this out will help me with some much needed perspective. Have a great night all and IWNDWYT.",15

I’ve become mostly vegetarian and am working to get my weight down to what it was when I got married 15 years ago.  This is not to brag, but rather for the first time in perhaps years, I’m invested in myself and am seeking out answers, despite difficulties, to many of the questions and slaying the demons that I’ve been living with. 

I’ve noticed a few folks that are close to me working through some issues and self medicating over these holidays.  While not specifically commenting to them about their drinking, I’ve offered a voice of concern and compassion and have tried to always be helpful, even making suggestions on life choices that are alternatives to booze.  

I’ve learned over my journey that I can manage me.  I have agency and authority over me, and things that are within my mental and physical power.  I also recognize that I do not have authority nor responsibility over YOUR (collectively) happiness or well being.  Im not going to judge others, nor force my thinking on others, hard though it is out of want to help.  

Right now, I’m ok with me - have more to figure out, but I’m working on it, and I’m ok with that. That whole ‘put your own oxygen mask on first’ thing.  Self care is not selfish.  

Be well friends regardless of where you are on your journey.",5

So yes ive been coming here for years.  I've made progress but i have a hard time sustaining sobriety.  
The first reason is that outwardly i dont pay a high price for my drinking.  So its easy for me to fall in with my mom friends and drink, tho for sure im the drunkest.  
Inwardly not good...mornings comingto instead of waking up, embarressment, shame, low self esteem, anxiety, bloated off my diet/excersise and meditation practice...oh the self loathing

But my big siren song is my childhood.  It was exciting.  My parents were the toast of the party.  I was always on the peripheral of their lives.  Loved and a part of things, but lets say not really emotionally supported.  But then at 16, i was certainly old enough to drink with them and my older siblings. And it was so inclusive, i belonged. There was definetly a dark side, but we did not acknowledge this.  The coffee in the morning was hard to swalliw but we were back at it that night and thats when the ""fun"" would begin.  People loved my family, tennis playing and gin and tonics!  Exciting camping/hiking/traveling drinking! Never trust a man that doesnt drink! Dont be uptight, let loose, what do you have to hide?
I have held on to this craving to recreate the excitment and sense of belonging for years.  But today i thought what if your parents didnt drink? I mean its unimagibable really, but what if?
Would your family had less or more fun? Do you honestly think they would become dullards? 
Or would there have been less crazy fights? Depression? Anxiety? Neglect?
I cant believe in all these years i never questioned this.  My fathers devotion to the merits of drinking were unquestionable. He was a great intellect, capable , seriously a pillar of the community. His short cut to bonding was lets have a drink together.  The downside was the hours spent drinking from there.  My mom drank a lot and was moody, distant and at times depressed, but then the drinks would flow and the world would sparkle
In the past efforts this was a stumbling block, because i couldnt see that drinking was their weakness not their stregnth. We could have been stronger and had healthier bonds without the drinking.  Not drinking isnt a betrayal to their life.  Tho i kind of still feel like i was raised to work hard and then play hard and its hard to switch to more even keeled life. The ups and downs is what is familiar.
The things you learn about yourself on this path is amazing.",2

I’ve been in and out of AA for almost 20 years. I appreciate the connection, accountability and ritual I get from the program. 

But I hate identifying as a newcomer. I shared with an acquaintance at the meeting last week that I slipped at the beginning of the month. His immediate response was that I HAD to raise my hand and announce it to the group. He scoffed when I said that was a tradition I don’t find helpful. 

I feel judged and minimized. I wish I didn’t have this reaction. I hate feeling resentful and cynical.  

Have any of you dealt with this? How did you get through it?

I’m feeling pretty hopeless right now. I had seven years sober in my 20s but I’ve relapsed over and over for the past decade. I’ll get between three months and a year, then pick up a drink. I’m so tired of this cycle.

For the past couple of months I’ve been feeling like my resolve is starting to break - just a crack, but opening wider and wider every day. Thoughts of drinking and numbing out are becoming more and more frequent. Haven’t I been sober long enough? Is this just IT now?

I’ve hesitated posting about it because I don’t want to be discouraging to anyone just starting out. But then I thought, the only reason why I stopped drinking in the first place was because of this sub and the people posting their real, difficult stories and struggles. I haven’t been to AA or any other group- you guys were it for me and for that I am thankful. Maybe by putting this out there I can get some inspiration from some old timers, and maybe my experience can help someone else, if only to set expectations that yes, not drinking IS great and fantastic and life-changing, but it’s not all unicorns and rainbows and skipping through the tulips 24/7, so be prepared for that. I feel like part of my problem is I've romanticized sobriety like I romanticized alcohol.

Because yes, in short, sobriety has lost its luster. In the beginning, I was on fire. I had so much energy, was so proud of myself, feeling calm and peaceful all the freaking time, just happy. Somewhere around, I don't know, 9 months, life just set back in. Taking away the alcohol - my numbing agent - just revealed the problems and issues that caused me to drink so much in the first place - and thus far, I haven’t been able to wrap my head around them. I’m trying. I am- I’m trying so hard to take care of myself, to fix things, but I just feel sad, stuck in the past, fearful of the future, and unable to cope. I’ve developed a nasty sugar addiction that I’m trying to kick. I know it sounds harmless compared to drinking but it’s been a real problem honestly.

On the up side, sober me is a kick ass mom. That, and possibly only that, is what’s going to keep me from drinking, at least until my daughter is grown up and I’ve raised her properly. I also feel like an adult for the first time in my life, which is nice - I (mostly) keep up with all of my responsibilities and obligations and everyday stuff is easier to manage. I just wish I could figure out how to get my head in a more positive mindset again. I have to remember that life has ups and downs and that's normal. Maybe this is just the “14 month blues” :) 

One thing I can say for sure: IWNDWYT. Thanks for reading. I wish for everyone a happy and peaceful 2020!

My family and I just got back from a long weekend away.  We went to a little town, hiked, stayed in a hotel with a pool and ate out.  We had a pretty good time.  

One thing that I like to do is people watch.  I love looking at people's complexions and watching them.  There are the ""red puffy faced folks."". Those are the drinkers.  I like watching how they behave, how much they drink, etc.

There are the grey faced folks, the cigarette smokers and how inactive they are...

There are the healthy looking folks; even those people in their 70s and older can be nimble and fit, hiking and camping, etc.  

I really enjoy watching folks.  I hope to be a healthy old person.  Right now I'm 47 and I am healthy and fit.  I plan to keep charging forward role modeling to my kids what healthy aging looks like.

One benefit of people watching is it reinforces my decisions to not drink and to continue to exercise.",8

2019-12-29 19:41:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ehedvf/gay_guy_bent_on_binging_and_self_medicating/,"Gay Guy, Bent on Binging and Self Medicating","I’m on my fourth sober day today - the longest I’ve been without alcohol or weed in nearly 4 years. With that has come some clarity, some STRONG emotions and the need to organize my incredibly loud thoughts - keeping them inside my head is resulting in a building pressure and I need to release it. Coming to all of you, and hopefully being able to speak to/ with the LGBT community as well, felt the most safe and appropriate way to spill my guts and safely organize my thoughts. This is incredibly long, and I’ll be printing it to bring to my therapist, but if anyone has some time to kill on Sunday or Monday, my story is here for you to reflect on...

The day after Christmas was the first day I’d been sober in quite some time. I’ve typically not been a daily drinker, but I have had MANY experiences in the last 13 years (I’m 31 now, for reference) where I’ve been out partying with friends and gone absolutely black out. Most blackouts were relatively benign - I might do embarrassing things, call and text people I shouldn’t have, buy $60 worth of pizza for my friends (with money I shouldn’t have been spending). Other blackouts would result in much riskier, dangerous and downright humiliating experiences. I had unsafe sex with strangers (I was consistently tested, still, but the anxiety of not knowing if I had contracted something permanent would weigh on me for weeks until I’d get a ‘negative’ result \[I was concerned largely with HIV, and after contracting the virus you can still test negative until you are 3 months in, hence the ‘weeks’ I would wait to get tested\]. I would completely abandon friends only to wake up to 30 missed calls from them after I would storm away or just wander into the night. I would start fights with my now-husband over… absolutely nothing, except a perceived slight which wasn’t based on reality. These events would happen about every other month, but they would stick with me for a long time and result in anxiety that I knew was unnecessary. 

These events would weigh on me pretty significantly, but because of my generally extremely outgoing and personable nature, most of my friends would be grateful I’m safe and just brush it off as something to not stress myself over. The biggest source of anxiety that weighed on me, however, was the fact that both of my parents are alcoholics. I’m grateful to say they are both in recovery now (one is an avid AA goer) but it was a very tough road growing up. I would come home from school to my mother who would be irate, irrational, volatile, and would need all the support my 10 year old brain could provide her. So the family/ genetic connection was what really frightened me on a deeper level, because it made me HAVE to question if I had a problem. I had so much fun drinking with my friends! I could go weeks or months without a humiliating episode - was quitting drinking worth it? I looked so different from my parents drinking habits - I wasn’t a daytime or even daily drinker, specifically like my mother - maybe I wasn’t an alcoholic and like my friends insisted, this was normal behavior?

That conversation with myself went on for about ten years. As I got into my late twenties, my career really started solidifying and I generally saw less of those blackouts, but they were never gone completely. The reason I’m here today is I found myself at the end of a three month episode of what I recognized the whole time as the road to a real alcohol addiction. 

In the middle of October 2019, I was drunk downtown in our city, leaving a concert I attended with friends. We went our separate ways as we caught cars home, and as I was waiting for my Uber to arrive, I was mugged and violently assaulted by three men. They beat me, robbed me, and left me in an alley all bloodied up. I didn’t lose consciousness (no idea how), and an ambulance and EMS team found me pretty quickly as I was crawling down the street wailing for help at 1 AM. I didn’t sustain any permanent injuries, but the thieves forced me to give them my iPhone password which gave them access to everything, most critically my ApplePay and therefore all my credit cards. They spent like crazy and I spent weeks working with detectives and my bank to reverse and report thousands of dollars of charges they racked up. This was not rock bottom for me - this was an opportunity for me to receive the empathy of my friends and family, and to prove that I would be alright, I went out just three days later, still bruised and cut up, for drinks with my husband to prove I was fine. It’s true that I wanted a return to normalcy, but I also needed the comfort of alcohol - the numbing effect worked WONDERS ON MY TRAUMA!!

Two weeks later I was in my cousins’ wedding - again, I agreed to carry on (with some skillfully applied makeup by the maid of honor) because it was important to me to show my family I would be alright and I would come back swinging. I got drunk, as the rest of my family did, and nothing embarrassing happened, but I knew I was leaning heavily into alcohol as my crutch at that point. I told myself it was “just my story right now” and that once things calmed down I would go back to my normal patterns. 

Then, from Thanksgiving to the week before Christmas, my husband and I moved into our first condo! Exciting as it was, this was incredibly stressful as we were the first tenants and there was so much to be done before, during and immediately after we moved in. My husband’s job had him travelling for 2/4 weeks in that time frame and a lot of the responsibility was left on my shoulders. Everything eventually got done, but not without anxiety attacks and some big old vodka sodas, every night, because I deserved it, right? This was the point at which I started heading to work completely hungover, useless, and tuned out - and I am the head of my department, something I prided myself on achieving, so I quickly understood this was not going unnoticed by my amazing, caring and sweet team. I felt like a liar to them, and I felt I was giving them the shaft by not being the leader I knew I should be for them. So in order to show up mentally for them, no matter how hungover, I’d trudge to work and pop an adderall - something I am not prescribed, and began to rely on just to keep up the appearance of getting useful work done.

Three weeks ago, my grandmother died. While not unexpected, it was another blow in what had been a very tumultuous few months and I completely leaned into not just alcohol and weed, but Klonopin to relieve my stress. So at this point I’m always either drunk, stoned, or speeding a little. There was no more normal, and for the month I was still seeing that this was not a lifestyle that would bring me closer to my goals, but I told myself it was what I had right now. 

My rock bottom hit last weekend, a week ago today. My husband and I went out for drinks with our friends, and I eventually blacked out, humiliated myself at a gay bar in town, got my friends and I kicked out, and still headed to another bar. My husband later told me he was trying to drag me off the dance floor but I was pushing him away telling him “I just want to have fun!” and completely dismissing him, even as a drag queen was trying to perform and telling me to sit the fuck down. Eventually my husband gave up and went home, but kept calling to check on me (apparently, I would pick up but wasn’t able to give him any real updates or register what he was saying). In my blackout, I went back to my friends house and crashed, only to wake up completely in shock and confusion as to where I was and how I got there. I went home to my husband who had stayed up through the night crying out of concern for me, especially after my assault in October. He was so glad I was safe, but he was wondering how I could make him feel the way I did. We talked a little, and I apologized profusely, but he said he had seen this in me before and didn’t want to put himself through this pain again - that this would be the last time he would still be here when I got home after a night like that. My rock bottom was the realization that my very gracious and forgiving, caring husband was willing to walk away if I didn’t learn to love myself enough to stop going down a path of certain destruction. 

And with that, I knew what I had to do. We went through Christmas Eve and Christmas together, had just a few glasses of wine, and when we woke up on Thursday I told him I was going to do my best to stop drinking. He even volunteered to be completely sober with me (no alcohol, weed or pills) at least through January. I don’t know for how long it will last; I only know I can take it “one day at a time”. But I knew /stopdrinking was here, and was full of people with similar stories and experiences. I know I will need to work through a lot of shit I’ve got going on mentally, which I’m not afraid to do, and that in moments of weakness I can turn to all of you for that extra vote of confidence to keep on this sober path that so far, feels incredible. 

To end this, I want to say specifically that I think there is a huge, potentially outsized population of the LGBT community with addiction issues. We as a community do not openly acknowledge this, although I am happy to see there are more resources out there when you intentionally seek them out. For any other gays out there struggling with any and all substances, whether you’re in a big city or living in a small “red” town, know that you aren’t struggling alone.

I’ve never asked for help before, and it was incredibly tough, as most of my family are alcoholics and think self help/therapy is for the weak willed.

I had a moment of weakness and had suicidal ideologies and also conveyed this to my family.( I’m good now btw, but wanted to share.)

They told me not to bother them with my problems and to stop seeking attention.

I’ve never been so let down by my family, and this has been a true awakening for me.

I cancelled my planned vacation 2 weeks from now with them, called every friend who’s struggled with addiction, and not letting a crappy family get in the way of my health, liveliness, and happiness.

Has anyone else struggled with their family in this way? They’re more upset that I’m not going on vacation, which is beyond my comprehension. 

My parents believe rehab is a cop-out and told me to grow up.

I’ve never asked them for a thing (as it pertains to mental health and addiction in my life; F, 34 btw,) and the past few days have been emotionally draining.

Thank God for tacos, ice cream, my dogs, and Netflix.

I'm not in AA so 90 days is more of a personal achievement than a ceremonial one. Anyway! Things are still going really well. I've reached a point where I've moved from the mindset of ""this is a thing I'm doing"" to ""this is how it is now"" and I'm good with that. Being sober through the holidays, with all of the parties and gatherings, has been interesting but not in the negative way I'd assumed it would be. Here are some of my observations for any of you who may be stressing about staying sober in social situations:

\- Most people didn't even seem to notice that I wasn't drinking.

\- Those that did notice didn't question it when I said I wasn't drinking/taking a ""break"" from booze. The biggest reaction I got was ""Huh, that's a good idea. Maybe I should take a break from alcohol.""

\- Other people don't drink as much as I thought they did. I had always assumed everyone was getting super drunk, but turns out, nope. Just me. That was a tough one to swallow.

\- I've been more open about telling some people at least a version of the truth as to why I'm not drinking. I had planned to just make up stories or excuses until everyone got used to seeing me without a drinking in my hand but it turns out a simple ""I don't like how much I've been drinking lately so I'm taking a little break"" is much easier. They don't need to know that ""lately"" means ""for many years"" and ""little break"" means ""forever"" (hopefully).

\- Finally, mockails are awesome. I've actually seen mocktail menus at some restaurants and bars lately, but if there's not one a nicer restaurant or bar can usually mix you up something good. Non-alcoholic mojitos are super tasty.

After a pretty gnarly four weeks, I've finally arrived at a state where I can:

1. Read and write my ass off the way I used to.
2. Enjoy music again.
3. Sleep all afternoon like a goddamned cat.

And so on.

I've done a lot of little things to reach this point: exercise; getting myself on a somewhat set schedule; reaching out to people when I feel the need to get shit off my chest. But I am finding mindfulness meditation especially helpful. I've dabbled with it in the past -- and saw a therapist who specialized in mindfulness more broadly -- but eventually lost the patience to keep up the habit. This time, however, I'm pretty committed to doing two sessions a day (using Headspace as a guide) and after three days, I'm already noticing a marked decrease in anxiety and a sharpened focus on whatever it is that I happen to be reading or studying.

I imagine that quite a few of y'all do the meditation thing, and that Headspace is probably pretty popular on this forum. How helpful has it been for you guys on the long term? Any tips, or little tricks that really helped you get the most out of it? One of the problems I've always run into after a few months of sobriety is a mind that is, if anything, a bit *too* active: everything is intensely vivid and my neurons feel like they're ping-ponging around the inside of my skull. Meditation seems to quiet them down in an acute way -- I feel immensely relieved and relaxed after a session -- and in a more subtle, all-day kind of way.

This is not the first time I’ve posted anonymously in this group; here I am with another throwaway.

I’m 33 and I have a one year old. Been drinking heavily or *vigilantly* moderating my drinking since I was 22 or so. I married an alcoholic. We used to love getting smashed together.

We had a baby in late 2018. She’s amazing but to be honest, I don’t really like being a mother. In other words, I love her, but I really don’t love the “job.”

I was sober for my pregnancy except for one glass of wine during the second trimester. My pregnancy turned out to be a shitshow of serious medical complications (unrelated to that one drink), one of which was very rare and very dangerous, and me and my baby almost died. Yes, PTSD and PPD and PPA and everything. 

The year before I got pregnant I was moderating my alcohol intake very well. I only drank one or two nights a week, maximum. I was running a lot and eating super healthy. I felt pretty good and I did feel like I had a good handle on alcohol. My husband would binge drink to the point I was disgusted with him and I thought I was the superior drinker.

On Father’s Day this year my husband decided he was breaking the cycle of alcoholism in his family. He was raised by drunks; he knows at least half of my grandparents and my mom is an alcoholic, and he was over it. He completely stopped drinking and smoking all on one day. No AA, no therapy, nothing. He was just done. He said smoking (which I don’t do, cigarettes are gross to me) was harder to quit than booze. He wanted to be sober for our daughter.

I, however, am not done. I’m not ready to stop drinking. I want to drink basically every day, you guys. Not in the morning but usually starting around 3pm. I like vodka, I like wine. 

I justify it by telling myself I was sober for 40 weeks while pregnant so I’ve proven I can quit. I just don’t want to, so I don’t fucking have to. I also know most kids don’t remember anything before age 3, so I tell myself there’s no way my drinking is impacting my kid. She has a sober father so if I’m drinking (and I don’t get drunk every time I drink), she has a sober parent. She’s safe, and she won’t remember this.

I also dwell heavily on how hard it is to be a mother and how biologically unfair it is that I had to carry the burden of pregnancy and breastfeeding and now I’m still the favorite parent, the one my daughter clings to when she sees strangers; the one who she loves so much that she sobs when I leave the room to go to the bathroom. Parenting this kid is fucking tough, I think, plus I work and keep the whole goddamn household running and do SO much emotional labor that I deserve not to have to be sober.

I don’t know why I’m posting this. I’m not ready to quit. I just need to tell this to people who know what I’m going through.

I want to drink tonight but I’m tired of telling myself “I’m going to start getting this under control“ at 8am and then buying wine at 1pm three nights a week. I also know I want to go on a run tomorrow and I won’t if I’m hungover. I’m 15 pounds heavier than I was prepregnancy and I’d be kidding myself if I said it wasn’t due to anything but booze.

I’m already being treated for a host of psychiatric conditions but none of my medical providers know I’m an alcoholic. I’ve told my therapist that I like to binge drink but he seriously brushed over it like it wasn’t that big of a deal. Maybe it’s not. Maybe if I work through all this bullshit I won’t want to get shitfaced anymore.

Another thing I need to say to this group is now that my husband is sober I find myself wanting to hide my drinking from him more and more. I used to be the one that had their drinking under control. Now he has quit and I’m the loser drunk of the family.

Today is the three year anniversary of my beloved dog dying and every year since it’s happened I’ve gotten smashed to commemorate her and to get the horrible memory of seeing the vet euthanize her on our living room floor out of my mind. I want to blur the sharp edges of my mind with ethanol; I want the frustration and the pain to be duller.

It is only Day Four and I was cool until I went to the grocery store.  I was with my fiance.  I did not buy any booze and am still sober, but man, the craving was crazy.  I used to only drink on the weekends so I would easily go four days without a craving of any kind.  This was different.  I have been drinking each day since Thanksgiving and this walking away from drinking feels different from other times away from alcohol.  The sensation of not drinking anymore seems so overwhelming as it has been a part of my life for the past 18 years.  I had a dangerous panic attack over Christmas week due to wedding planning conflict and my anxiety and alcohol combination.  I have had a huge amount of support from talking with my loved ones and going to therapy sessions (which I do solo) with members of my family.  The guilt of ruining Christmas Break for my fiance (who had to tell me on the 26th that she thought we needed to postpone the wedding until we both got our physical and mental health on track) because she was so stressed about my state is large.  We have made huge strides in just a few days and the wedding should be back on track as planned, but the sheer fact that any of this happened is kicking my rear end.  My family have been incredibly kind and I want to do the right thing and get myself healthy.  The anxiety is back a bit (amazing to see that my drinking was really fueled by so much stress in my own head of my own making) and I am seeing that I really have a problem with my own head thinking about what I cannot control fully and this is driving me to want to feel swimmy and fuzzy to deal with my own perceptions.  It is depressing to me now seeing the Christmas decorations still up.  I want to fully appreciate the rest of the season and make it nice to compensate to my fiance, but it is a reminder that the break we were looking forward to for so long ended up being this heavy, stressful crisis period.  That added guilt made the trip to the supermarket extra hard, especially compared to the routine when I would almost always buy beer and wine for the week so the routine was super weird.  There was so much booze on the shelves and my city is a big drinking place with a lot of folks in the store wearing brewery shirts and alcohol references.  I had never felt like that before.  Man this is a lot rougher than I thought it would be (the pressure to not drink seems more intense than any time previously) but I am sober and I am planning on going to an AA meeting again tomorrow (went to one a few days ago).

Could this just be that all of the toxins are working their way out of my system? It’s like, really yellow. I was drinking A LOT for my size. I would start my morning off with a drink and continue to drink through the day. Just enough to keep myself from going into withdrawal and then I would drink to sleep after work. I’m finally gaining my appetite back as of today and feeling a lot better and actually sleeping through the night.

When I first started, I was half sleeping. Hard to explain... I would be dreaming (crazy dreams and non stop thoughts) but completely be aware of everything around me and not get a rested sleep.

2019-12-29 16:17:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ehbo9k/i_want_to_stop_drinking/,I want to stop drinking,"My drunk history - apology in advance for this long post- I kept it as brief as I can.

I had my first drink - a stolen bottle of Porphyry Pearl at my 16th birthday party. By 17 I’d left home and was a regular drinker. By 18 I drank every day and would get black out drunk at least a couple of times a week. I was also an enthusiastic recreational drug user because drink wasn’t enough.

I continued on this way through my 20s and 30s. 
In my late 20s I saw some broken blood vessels on my nose. This was the first evidence of the effect alcohol was having on my body.

I’m pretty sure that the alcohol free day was reserved for if I was very ill, up until my 40s when I started to moderate my drinking. In my late 40s I realised that I needed to not be hungover on a workday and started having AFDs a few times a week.

In my 50s this was a regular occurrence. I started to hate the hangover and resolved to change. At the same time, I decided to become an expert on wine, even though there was a nagging doubt in my mind that this was a good idea. So I enrolled in professional wine courses and became that expert and in the process, an expensive drunk with friends with expensive wine tastes.

All through this time, I was employed in high paying jobs, raised a couple of kids and paid my mortgage.
2019 was a year of change for me. I turned 60. I shut down a business that, through my own mismanagement, cost me my superannuation. I went through a period of seriously considering the pros and cons of suicide and then had a spiritual awakening. 

The awareness caused by my newfound state has led me to become have a whole food plant-based diet and take up qigong for my health. I can’t drink and continue on my path. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with having a glass of wine, at least not for most people. But I know it makes me dull and lazy (as a relaxation trigger ie sit in front of the TV and Netflix binge). My body has had a lot of self-induced abuse over the past 45 years and I’m not a young man, but I have got much to do over the next decades. I don’t think that I can achieve what I need to achieve if I keep drinking. I’m afraid I’ll just be an old boozer with a big purple nose and red face whose days are measured by bottles. I have alcohol induced insomnia and one glass will exacerbate this. Despite being on a plant-based diet for almost a year, summer time is gout time due to lots of white wine and dehydration. I have high blood pressure and cholesterol which is undeniably linked to drinking.

My beautiful wife is more spiritual than I, but isn’t committed to any lifestyle changes. All my close friends are wine drinkers and I fear that I’ll lose them as friends when I’m sober. I have two wine fridges full of very good wine that I’ll never get to taste. I love food and my favourite and memorable experiences involve friends, tables of food and the accompanying beverages.

I understand that addiction is a continuum and I’m not at the extreme end (my first descriptor was hopeless drunk so I guess that says something about my subconscious thought process). However, I’m definitely on the continuum. I just want to be the best possible version of myself. 

My plan is to go completely whole food plant-based no oil and no alcohol, for three months with a health check at either end. I’m thinking that it won’t be as difficult to broach the subject and have people try - on purpose or inadvertently - to talk me out of it if I do this. However, it’s long enough to form new habits and create measurable health effect. But make no mistake, this is a permanent thing.

My question, if you got this far, is with your experience, am I kidding myself?  I laid out the following as honestly as I can, to give you some context as well as seeking support from like-minded experienced people. I know you can read between the lines and see if I’m setting myself up to fail.",17

Now I’ve never gone to work drunk, never drank and drove. All accounts I’m functioning but I’ve been using drinking as a crutch for my deeper issues with depression and anxiety. 

Today I looked at myself after drinking far too much, vomiting all over my apartment’s bathroom. I didn’t like what I saw at all. I’m on a slippery slope if I don’t stop now.

I’ve come to visit once again. I live to see you suffer; mentally, physically, spiritually, and socially. I want to make you restless so you can never relax. I want you to be jumpy, nervous, and anxious. I want to make you agitated and irritable so everything and everybody makes you uncomfortable. I want you to be confused and depressed so you can’t think clearly or positively. I want to make you hate everything and everybody, especially yourself. I want you to feel guilty and remorseful for the things you’ve done in the past that you’ll never be able to let go of. I want to make you angry and hateful toward the world for the way it is and the way you are. I want you to feel sorry for yourself and blame everything but your addiction for the way things are. I want you to be deceitful and untrustworthy and to manipulate and con as many people as possible. I want to make you fearful and paranoid for no reason at all. I want you to wake up during all hours of the night and scream for me. You know you can’t sleep without me. I am even in your dreams.

I want to be the first thing you think of when you wake in the morning and the last thing you touch before you blackout or pass out. I would rather kill you, but I’ll be happy enough to put you back in the hospital, another institution, or jail. But you know, I’ll still be waiting for you when you get out. I love to watch you slowly going insane. I love to see all the physical damage that I’m causing you. I can’t help but sneer and chuckle when you shiver and shake; when you freeze and sweat at the same time; and when you wake with the sheets and blankets soaking wet. It’s amusing to watch you make love to the toilet bowl; heaving and wrenching and not be able to hold me down. It’s amazing how much destruction I can do to your internals while at the same time I work on your brain, destroying it bit by bit.

I deeply appreciate how much you have sacrificed for me; the countless good jobs; all the fine friends that you deeply cared for and gave up for me; and what’s more for the ones you turned against yourself because of your inexcusable actions. For these, I am even more grateful.

But especially for your loved ones, your family, the most important people in the world to you – you even threw them away for me. I cannot express in words the gratitude I have for the loyalty and respect you have for me. But do not despair my for on me you can always depend. For after you have lost all these things, you can still depend on me to take even more. You can depend on me to keep you in a living hell, to keep your mind, body, and soul. For I will not be satisfied until you are dead, my dear friend.

Sincerely,

Alcohol",87

I'm an as of yesterday 26 year old male. I've been struggling with alcholism since I was about 14. I can't really say I've gone more than a week since then without drinking. 

It's always in large quantities. Usually vodka. And the results have so far been damage to my liver and kidneys, high blood pressue, over-worked heart, loss of friendships, relationships, memory problems, severe depression, stomach problems, esophagus problems, concussions, scarring and painful joints due to falling over so often, two suicide attempts and even a job. Not to mention fights, beatings, lost devices and money.

Then last week happened.

I had intended to stay in for the night so I took my medication. Anti-depressants and my other 5-6 pills I now need to take to manage my drinking induced ailments. These reduce my appetite and are not meant to be mixed with alcohol. 

Then my flatmate asked me if Id care to join him for a steak. (Theres an awesome steak place in town) I didnt need to be asked twice. However, after I'd taken my pills, I was not hungry so I didnt really eat at the restaurant. I just drank.

Afterwards I ended up at a friends leaving party, more drinking and then visiting another 4 bars afterwards...or at least that's what Ive been told. 

I have some screenshots in my head of various unfoldings, but not a great deal of reason. As I understand it, the mixing of the pills, alcohol and lack of food messed up my head. I smashed up a bar racking up plenty damages in display cases and throwing punches at security. The police turned up and put me in some very pretty bracelets and took me down to the station, after knocking me about a bit in the back of their van.

I woke up in my cell. No phone calls were permitted to me. I could not leave my cell except to use the toilet and get water. The cells were hosed out daily and there was no daylight or ventilation, so the cell was constantly cold and damp. The screws were often bad tempered so often didnt allow us out of the cells to pee, so the detainees would just have to pee in their cells, which was great considering a lot of us were sleeping on the floor.

I spent 4 days in the cells with no contact with the outside world, daylight, contact lenses or medication. So I had a great time with withdrawal on top.

When I finally got let go after a hearing, I found my ex outside. She was shaking and crying. My family had been worried sick and had called every hospital in the area, and finally the police. Due to privacy protection, many of these paces would neither confirm or deny if I was there.

Now Im walking away with a new court date, fines and a permanent criminal record.

The worst part about this is while I was in my cell, I realised this would not be enough to stop me drinking. I dont know what the hell it will take. 

TL;DR. I mixed prescription medication with alcohol, smashed up a bar and got arrested. I know have charges and a criminal record.",4

Like everyone - I am starting off very new and fresh. Even posting to this forum is new for me and a bit of a learning curve. *editted to nothing short of beg-can someone comment on this post so I know I did it properly?? I am so lame....*

I want to reach out for help, which seems abnormal and uncomfortable but I promised myself I need to do whatever it takes. 

I am a 33F and have been drinking pretty heavily over the last 2.5 years. Prior to that, I have always been the individual that’s gets marginally more messed up than everyone else when we go out. This has always been the case since I was a teenager. There are many many embarrassing stories I could share but I am moving past the shame and guilt and looking forward. 

I have been mostly successful in many areas of my life but that’s also because I worked very hard at it. Until it seemed like all the wheels have fallen off at the same time when my very short marriage fell apart. The good news is, my divorce was a positive occurrence in my life (now that I have got through it) and my drinking was not a catalyst for that. However, my coping mechanism was amped up while I was enduring most of it - drinking more and more and hiding it. I am lucky that I have a successful career and make a good wage and have been able to maintain all of that. I got a DUI in the thick of my divorce and going through the legal process has been so challenging. I think finally I am on the otherwise of all of this. 

I have managed to buy a house this year, on my own, but my boyfriend now lives with me. That seems to be another issue-as I am starting to think we got together in the thick of our drinking and I am I worried about the changes I am going through and how that will affect our relationship. I am remaining hopeful and trying not to pass judgement on his drinking but I definitely need to ensure I have good boundaries in place. This is new for us and will not happen overnight. 

Today will be 29 days sober. I was blacking out often and was drinking a bottle to two bottles of wine each night. Or whatever was in the house. That was not also what I binged on over the weekend. I just got tired of it all and the risks I was taking. I was in situations I just didn’t want to be in any longer as I was starting to really experiment with drugs. Something inside of me said-this is just not what I want for my life and if I continue down this path, I couldn’t see the light out. It felt very now or never. In addition, for the first time in my adult life, I suddenly want to start having kids. I know I need to work on myself first before I bring another life into this world. 

I guess where I am struggling is that everyone appears to be “doing so great! I have lost so much weight! I have so much energy!”  Me? Not at all. I ensured I had a solid work out routine (every morning for 1-2 hours) that includes yoga and mediation and until the holidays (as we are still out of town) I had kept that up everyday. That has been the only thing that has helped me release some negative emotions and thoughts and just get through the day. However, I’m still tired all the time. I don’t feel AS crappy overall today as I have for the past 28 days..... but when does this stop!??! Also- I want and have been eating ALL the things!! I battle between accepting this for now and telling myself how gross and fat and disgusting I am. I used to be the person to go from 5am-2am the next day and full of energy and get everything done.  Now I feel the opposite-feel super ugly (I think a lot of my drinking was being able to tolerate being in my own skin). 

I have been to one AA meeting. I did not like it. I found this place which has been a life saver and done a ton of research. I have been going to therapy often. I just feel alone. I know I am throwing a really bad pity party and this too shall pass. I just feel like I managed to get through Christmas. New Years is next and I know I will do it. It’s just been tough. I think the routine I had I was heavily relying upon and right now being away from home has really challenged me. I feel alone as I can very easily put on the perception of having it all together all the time. So any milestone, each moment of not drinking, is HUGE for me. But I know it doesn’t matter to others and it shouldn’t. But I feel like just getting through to bedtime is a WIN. 

Not entirely sure what I am seeking for here right now. But maybe for people to really tell me how long they struggled at first. Or that they wanted to or DID smash all the candies in sight or started jonesing for some Diet Pepsi, even though pop is so strongly frowned upon. Hahahha maybe I just want to not feel alone that things weren’t great and unicorns and rainbows immediately and it’s ok to hop in my vehicle and go buy bags of candies and not feel guilty! Come the New Year I am going to get this new sugar addiction under control but I just feel like I am allowed to not feel guilty about this right now.",3

I am 34 years old and I've been drinking since i am 15-16 years old. When I was young, I enjoyed it, and through the years my alcohol consumption rised up exponentially. Especially after my mother died and I got a divorce in the same year which was 2016, and then got a boyfriend whom i was madly in love with and he broke up with me too, and it was just too much. I started self medicating with alcohol. I mean every day, two bottles of wine, or 70cl vodka, or some equal amount of alcoholic drink of my choice. I used to had blackouts when I drank too much before, but recently, I started to not remember my nights anymore. Not a single night. It's so bizarre living like this. I feel like dr. jekyll and ms. hyde. I just have to trust ms hyde to not to fuck up at nights. But I don't have any control on it. And she does fuck up a lot. She is rude, she is embarrassing and she is arrogant. Another very important detail is i am on autism spectrum and my drunk self doesn't seem to be on the spectrum. So i think that's one of the important reasons I liked and started to drink at a very young age and drinking since then. Because Dr. Jekyll is so awkward and embarrassing in social situations and cares. Ms Hyde, just doesn't care.

I also got fat from so much consumption and also I am worried about my liver. So for the last 3 nights, I didn't drink. First night was awful, my brain was making up excuses to go to the store to buy something, and I couldn't slept that night. But I endured. Next day was much better, because I saw that I could do this so I just consumed cups of tea and soft drinks, but not a single drop of alcohol.

Now we are planning a huge party on the New years day with all my friends in our town. I think I will say my goodbyes with the drink at the party and then try a dry-January, as some of you recommended in other posts comments. If I enjoy it i will prolonge the sobriety. And after these three days, I am sure that i will enjoy it.

On another note, I don't live in a country that has functional AA meetings, not in my area anyway. And to add to the injury, everyone is either alcoholic or on the verge because where i live is a beach holiday town. But i believe that i can do this on my own.

I am a dipsomaniac so I think I will channel it to sports. If that becomes an addiction, I will deal with that later haha.

Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for recommendations and tips.",3

Hey all , checking in on my 35th day! Gotta say feeling good.  I had a friend ask me the other day what being sober all the time was like.  I told him that it was sort of the same as being drunk accept I dont feel like garbage all the time.  I really feel this way.  Life is still generally the same but I dont wake up hung over, tired, full of regret, I dont lay awake at 4 in the morning wondering how many drinks I had the night before, I dont black out and forget the night before, I have more self respect for myself every day I stay sober and so does my partner.  Iv got to say so far things have been overall pretty good throughout the holidays.  Went to lots of parties the 2 weeks and had a blast, was kind of an eye opener to see how my friends where when they got drunk, makes me all kind of happy that I was not sending it with them.  I think one of the most important things I have learned in the last bit by reading This naked mind is that alcohol is addictive, and anyone who drinks it can become addicted mentally and physically.  There is no two ways about it.  I like the analogy where if the Dr told me that apples where poisoning me I would probably just stop eating them, I would not lament the loss of my great old friend the apple and I would probably be happy that he told me about this before I got sick and died, why is it when we are told to stop drinking booze that we have this pit of despair kind of moment?  Apples are not addictive and we are not physically and mentally addicted to them like we are booze.  Anyways just a short rant by me hope yall have a good day and I wont drink with you today!",3

I’ve had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol since my first drink towards the end of high school.  I was a complete binge drinker throughout college and had so many regretful nights that I don’t even remember.  Social anxiety issues, a tough childhood, and just general mental health issues combined with blackouts that caused me to act way out of character started this horrible cycle of regret and drinking to numb the pain that lasted up until I graduated. 

I had a period of 2 years after graduating where I gave up alcohol.  These were the best 2 years of my life so far-a period with self reflection and growth, with so many relationships healed  along the way.  Then I had one night out with some friends where I had a couple of drinks, acted fine, and thought that I was “healed.”  Over these next 3 years, I’ve been drinking and while I haven’t blacked out like I did in college, I’ve had several incredibly regretful moments culminating with last night where I went out to a club and got way more drunk than I’d like to admit.  

As I reflect this morning, I realize that I don’t even want to moderate anymore.  Life without alcohol brings so much clarity and peace,  Sharing my story to give myself a checkpoint and to hopefully warn others that moderation just isn’t worth it.   It’s a slippery slope that only leads back to the habits we’re all trying to get away from.

Wishing you all strength on this journey.   To a strong end to 2019 and amazing start the new decade.",12

Reddit won't let me cross-post from r/women_in_recovery, but I wanted to share this article here since that's a pretty small subreddit. A fair bit of it resonated with me—like ""But today’s women don’t need to be broken down or told to be quiet. We need the opposite."" I have been to AA and definitely found it to be useful in some ways—I think there's a lot to be said for being around a group of people who are all fighting the same fight. But I did find the twelve steps and the program itself to not be for me, for a lot of reasons similar to this author's. Like her, I do think AA is great for some people (women included), but not for everyone.

I'd be really curious to read more about sobriety and recovery programs through a feminist/social justice lens—does anyone have any recommendations?",12

I am three months alcohol free today! The longest I have gone in the past is 8 months, followed by severe relapse that ended up in a bender lasting over a year. Three months ago this morning I was in jail as a result of my drinking and drug use. 

After hitting my rock bottom, I have made changes in my life. I have changed my eating habits, joined the gym and practice yoga religiously. 

I also was accepted into an outpatient program to tackle some of my mental health issues that I am battling, which become more present when I am sober. This program ends next week. 

I feel like I still am needing a lot of support. I meet with a therapist but am wondering if AA is the next logical step.

The thought of AA TERRIFIES me. I guess I am just looking for people to share their experiences going to AA with me. Should I start with an open meeting? Closed? Should I be going to a different city so I don't run into anyone I know? Should I not go at all?

I am Female and 28 years old, no idea if that's relevant.

I haven’t told anyone. I haven’t done anything. Except bitch in my head about how much it pisses me off that I have to not drink. It’s an endless cycle. I’ve already lost a lot of friends over the last few years for somewhat unrelated reasons. The rest of my friends are big drinkers. I feel super lonely. I’m distant from my husband. I’m stressed at all times. And clearly there is just a lot of self pity I need to get rid of. I’m still pretty young. I want this amazing life. I’ve been depressed for the last 3-4 years and just am over playing life on hard mode. People who get to the other sober side say that we are the lucky ones. And maybe when you’ve felt soo so bad and get though, you do appreciate happiness more. But right now it just sucks that for whatever reason, (genetics, environment, own dumb ass decisions), just existing is difficult. Idk who to talk to about all this. My husband has no idea what to say. He says I’ve already tried to stop drinking and it didn’t work. I logically know that a few 30 days of sober time isn’t enough. I know I need to surround myself with actual sober people. I know all the things logically I need to do. But my brain is just angry.

I’ll say terrible not even true things to the people I love with, seemingly though yours truly isn’t exactly *present* enough to say for sure, no real aim besides to wound the other person.   

It’s always, as well as causing me a lot of shame and self loathing cuz who wants to *be* that person, a lot of confusion as well. I don’t think of myself as a mean person, not really. So why is it that when I get really drunk I get *mean*?   

I think it’s rooted in what my family always calls the Noone Wit. We can make a comeback, sharp as knives, as quick as can be. I know *just* the right thing to say and in *exactly* the right tone to illicit a laugh at someone else’s expense without coming across as mean or taking it too far.  I never really thought about how next-door to mean that is. We’re all just having fun with each other, the things my family might say to me never bother me and so I think the things I say to others (and in my defense, no one gets it as bad as another family member. I’m not out there at work cutting people down at parties for the sake of a laugh) also doesn’t hurt them. It’s all in fun!   

But I think that ribbon of wit and quick humor runs deeper into my character than I realized. Day to day, things like social conditioning and generally not wanting to be an asshole keeps me from being terribly mean. But add in a depressant that briefly gives you a burst of energy and, while we’re at it, strip away that social conditioning? Recipe for hostile drunk bitchiness.  What was an ability to pick lightly at someone’s sore spot becomes an ability to knife them where I know it’ll hurt the most.   

I don’t know WHY. There probably isn’t a *why*. It’s like a kitchen aid mixer. Use it correctly, and you get tasty treats. Use it incorrectly, and it’ll break every bone in your hand. It doesn’t care one way or the other. It’s not inherently evil just because it has the capacity to take a finger or two off and I’m not an inherently BAD person because I know where your sore spots are.   

I guess ..  idk. That’s it I guess. Today’s big insight. I have the capacity to be cruel and *mean*. I don’t want to be that person and so I won’t drink anymore. Too much of myself is on the line.

What I have learned this time around (AA warning, I do attend AA regularly):

1) I take it one day at a time.  This works for me.  I rarely even think of alcohol anymore.  I just focus on today and it seems like a manageable challenge.  Staying sober for the rest of my life is impossible, but I can manage to do so for one day.

2) I am willing to believe in a higher power.   I always find it strange when people in recovery state ""I just can't believe in God"".  These are the same people who believed they had to drink.  I was one of those.  I don't know why or how but willing to believe in a higher power makes the belief that I need to drink lose any traction.

3)  I connect with my group members on a personal level.  I say hello to everyone I meet in the group.  I used to arrive one minute before the meeting and leave one minute after.  Now I get there early, make an effort to talk to people and tell people what's really going on in my life.  

4) I practice gratitude every day.  I am so grateful for each day of sobriety.  I am grateful for how I manage my life now.  I am less anxious, desperate, afraid and angry.  

I post here to help me and I hope that it helps others.  I have found that helping myself and others are two interconnected things and when I do one I am doing the other.

All that went away after a while. After a while alcohol stopped being fun and it just started making me numb. I still loved good food, but I didn't know that I was tasting less of it while drinking than if I had been sober. Sex is less physical effort without alcohol and it actually feels better! And as for other activities, I find that I enjoy them more when I actually pay attention. 

Towards the end there, the only enjoyable part was the moment between being sober and having the first few drinks. The moment where I indulged my compulsion and decided to ""get drunk"", but only the getting drunk was enjoyable, the being drunk was definitively less fun.

It's all so confusing because we wonder where we went wrong in all this, and I think that's because alcohol is a sly mistress. It was fun, it was better, it was a confidence boost, it was relaxing, it was good. Was. But that all stopped, slowly and insidiously it stopped.

No matter what they throw at me or how ignorant they can be, i have this they cant break me. 
I realized i would have done nothing different at 12 to my parents, especially with all the let downs. So I cant even be mad. To be honest I did worse to my alcoholic parents then my own son is doing to me right now. Is he pushing it for sure, but atleast now I'm not drunk dealing with it. I have a clearer mind set then I did 10 days ago. I was given so many chances and this is my last. So either I got this or I don't. I'm not drinking today and I will continue to not drink, cause I know I got this even on bad days. One minute, one hour, one day at a time. Cheers to my sober Sunday and coffee to keep me going.",2

I’m currently hungover as I’m writing this - I had a night of bad decisions, wasted money, damaging my body,  all for interactions and conversations I don’t even remember. I’ve realised something. I have to hold myself accountable, there is only one person that can stop this. Sure , I’m young, but that’s no excuse. Sure, I was seeing my mates, but that’s no excuse. Sure, it’s Christmas time , but that’s no excuse. The common denominator here is me.

I’m sick of the shame, the regret, feeling like shit, having no money. Why am I doing this? Where’s the fun? 

I’ve realised I can’t do moderation, as soon as the third or fourth beer is down the gullet - I seem to hop on that train to oblivion. I’ve realised something else, oblivion is what I’ll get if I keep going on like this. No one that has taken drink on wins. It will destroy you. Your relationships, your mental health, your body - everything. I will be just another number to drink.

The only option is to walk away. IWNDWYT",5

Prior to Christmas Eve I hadn’t had a drink in over two months. 2019 was the year I finally made the decision to make a strong effort to knock it out of my life completely. The thing is, if I’m being honest with myself I would get overconfident that I beat drinking and usually have one slip up per month, sometimes two. This past run was the longest I’ve gone without booze since before I was 21. 

Flash forward to X-Mass eve and I’m at a party with friends and family that I haven’t seen in a long time, the majority of which didn’t know I’ve been trying to quit. Well, I get sucked into the party vibe and have a bud lite. I really tried hard to keep it at just that one beer but it led to glasses of wine, more beer and me being drunk in front of my wife and three kids. I think only the oldest would have caught onto it but it was still embarrassing. The next day, Christmas, I feel like I should just keep going since I already fucked up the night before. Get drunk though thankfully this time not as bad and it’s undetected from my wife and kids. Next day I make a vow that I’m done forever and what do you know, one of my co-workers gets me a bottle of whiskey for a present. I took it home (Thursday) and debated smashing it or giving it away. Well last night I lost the temptation and had a shot. This was followed by the four beers I had left in the fridge from the parties. I think the holidays might be a trigger for me and I need to somehow get tougher around them. I will get through this but any advice or help (or of this helps others) is appreciated.",5
2019-12-29 09:39:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eh6lqw/figuring_out_why_you_drink/,Figuring out why you drink,"I realize that this post will not resonate for everyone. For some folks identifying the “reason” might turn into an excuse to keep drinking. But for me it really made a difference, so I wanted to share in case it would help others. 

I’m a 34 year old mom of three and a corporate lawyer. I also have had ADD probably my whole life and it was never treated. My parents were hyper sensitive to the stigma of an ADD diagnosis because we’re a military family and you generally will not get into the military if that’s in your medical record. 

I self medicated for years. Smoked cigarettes mostly, and drank. A lot. I switched to nicotine gum when my first child was born and never got off it. The nicotine managed to help my focus a bit, enough that I could ignore the rest. I had issues with impulse control, and overdid everything. Including, of course, drinking. 

A year ago I decided to kick nicotine. The gum is expensive, and because you can use it anywhere I used a crazy amount of it. Once I was off it I could not ignore my ADD. I had been diagnosed in 2013, but was never treated. Earlier this year I finally got treatment. I started therapy and medication in the spring of 2019. 

It was a game changer. It turns out drinking was an “easy” way to avoid dealing with more difficult issues, including a treatable mental condition. I learned it affected other things, primarily because people with ADD often have shit for impulse control. My impulsive spending, which has been a struggle for years, is largely a non issue now (I still watch myself closely and have systems in place to check myself). My poor self care was also related.

This year I quit drinking, quit spending, quit a shitty job and made the leap to a much better one, started therapy, started working out more, started journaling, and started spending more time caring for my relationships. 

It all started with quitting a thing that I regarded as related to nothing. Nicotine gum! But in the absence of that crutch I could see a lot of other things that were amiss. And one by one I have tackled them, each being a little easier than the one before it. 

What will be your next domino? Or your first one? I know now that by far the biggest one, the one that glued all the others together and perpetuated everything was the booze. But I don’t know if I would have figured that out without kicking the nicotine and starting treatment first. 

So if you’re struggling, take a hard look at yourself. What struggles do you deny or ignore? If there’s something beneath the surface, dealing with it can help you have the tools you need to kick the booze. For good, or at least for today. IWNDWYT",9

When it was Drynuary, I would start craving a beer by the end of the month and I could see the Feb 1 line...  whereas now I don’t have a “finish line”.  I made it through xmas and will make it through NYE.  I even made it through a trip and a concert.  I think this time is different, I don’t plan on restarting drinking alcohol.  Is it willpower? Is it because I just drank enough/too much?  

As with many others here, this sub and This Naked Mind have really helped me.  Maybe I firmly see alcohol as poison now and how much money and time I was spending on it.

One quick note:  Sundays used to be my favourite drinking day.  I’d have a few craft beers at my local brew pub followed by a shot or two with the bar tending staff and then my SO and I would head to dinner for more drinks and shots with the bartender there.  I miss those days but I don’t miss the hungover Mondays at the office and the resulting “presenteeism” at work.  I think I will go to my local pub today to hang out but will have a soda & lime (and maybe a splash of cranberry if I feel wild!).

&#x200B;

I have been lurking on this subreddit for a few weeks, and I have finally decided to take steps towards sobriety. A large part of this process was looking through so many posts and stories here, how many of them I related to, and the eloquence, kindness and compassion that people have here. So I would like to share a bit of my own story, in case there is someone else who is going through similar. Any advice or support is really appreciated.

&#x200B;

This may be a little long-winded and rambling, but I have been trying to get my thoughts together about all of this.

&#x200B;

I am 27F. I have had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol for half my life already. I am an alcoholic.

&#x200B;

Like a lot of my peers where I grew up, I started binge drinking at the weekend when I was 12/13. I told myself that it was about being sociable and 'hanging out', it was 'normal' etc, but even then I could sense that primarily I just liked getting wasted. I was always the friend that needed booze to have a good time.

&#x200B;

By the time I was 14 I was stealing booze from my parents regularly, and had every shop that would sell me in the city memorised. About 2-3 times a week I would have a few cans or a few shots, alone, to 'help me sleep'.

&#x200B;

This continued through my university years, where I was also involved with social groups that spent a lot of time drunk/high. Looking back, I sought out these types of people as my own issues didn't seem to be out of the ordinary. For several years, my behaviour was completely unhinged and erratic. I burned a lot of bridges. Alcohol was the accelerant. 

&#x200B;

When my career started to happen, rather than cut back on booze I started to cut back on social outings. Early on, there were a few times I made an arse out of myself, forgot deadlines, didn't follow up on connections etc. It held me back. So I stopped going out so much and drank at home.

&#x200B;

This has been the pattern for the last 5 years. From 2-3 times a week, to every night. I will drink until there is no booze left. I will drink until I blackout. I plan my day around when I can drink. I vomit bile every morning. My own husband, who I love dearly, regularly has to clean up my own shit and vomit. Last week we had to leave our in-laws as I was throwing up blood and bile. I have a stomach ulcer. I have eye twitches. I have a death ball of anxiety permanently lodged between my heart and stomach. There have been more than a few occasions where he has come home from work and I am already wasted. So I started to drink more after he went to bed. So we don't really share a bed, because I am a drunk. I promised him her wouldn't marry a drunk. I promised myself. My kitchen is full of empty wine bottles and cans, my house is a mess. I am unproductive, I look and feel like shit all the time, and I have come to the sobering conclusion that I can never just cut back. It doesn't happen.

&#x200B;

I don't speak to my father, for a lot of reasons that ultimately stem from his own unresolved issues and addictions. I am on a path to end up like him, with ex-friends, ex-spouses and ex-children if I haven't already pickled my womb to oblivion.

&#x200B;

This is the longest time I have gone without booze for 15 years, and it is normally on Day 3 that I falter.

&#x200B;

The amount of things that I am completely ashamed about seems to be at a high today. I am not proud of myself. But IWNDWYT.",12

I feel like I used to go along with the flow more, do things or be in situations that I didn't enjoy, because it didn't matter if I could still get a buzz while I was doing it.

Now I don't feel the need to go along with others if it's not something I'm into. Even down to excusing myself if everyone is watching a film I'm not into. Not feeling the need to accept social invites every single time.

Now I value my time, and if there's no buzz to make the situation a bit 'better', I simply make a different choice. And it doesn't feel awkward.

It feels so liberating and I feel calmer and less resentful of others.

There's so many added benefits to this no-drinking malarkey!

I'm sure this sort of post has probably been done in the past but I thought I'd kick one off for this year.

We are going to dinner with 3 other couples at one of their houses on NYE. The host is a very good chef. I will be the only one not drinking but will take three bottles of good wine for the others as our contribution since the host buys the food.

I'm actually not worried about not drinking. The people are cool (well not sure about one but I'll shut him down quick if there's a comment) and I've already done one Saturday night there since I gave up -oh- it's three weeks ago today :). My guard is up as always but I'm feeling confident with my newly cleared brain and a few days back in the gym making me feel better. 

So, what are you favourite drinks to take around to someone's for an evening that will last for a good few hours?

At the moment I quite like a big glass half full of ice, a slug of lime cordial, ginger beer and diluting it somewhat with soda /sparkling water for more of a refreshing long drink feel as the ginger beer on its own can be a bit too much I think. Add a slice of real lime to mix up with the sweetness of the cordial and serve.

What about you?",3

I was often tired, could not handle stress, and often beat myself up over not drinking the night before a shift at work but not being able to not drink the night before a study session. My emotional stability was questionable at best, and I thought I lost the 18 year old, intelligent, curious, and kind version of myself. Turns out I tried to drown her.

I found someone on Instagram posting about a 1000 hours dry challenge and I felt overwhelmed. 41ish days is a lot if you've barely ever managed 30. I found out about this subreddit and downloaded the app. At first, the only subreddits I followed (joined?) were this one and one with cute puppies (and other animals, it's called something with 'aww'). I told my partner and the rest of the board of my choir that I wanted to put my relationship with booze on hold. I kept quiet to the rest of the world, and I did not drink that day. 

You guys pulled me through. The first two weeks were rough. I sorely missed the socializing I used to do with friends, I missed my drinking friends, and I isolated myself from the world until I felt I could handle being around booze again. Every time I was tempted or felt bored I would open the app and just read. Mocktails replaced my daily bottle of wine, and recently NA beer has been my drink of choice out of the house. 

Most people around me now know, including some of the bartenders at my favourite bar. Life did not get easier, but my ability to roll with the punches, stand up for what I believe in, and take care of myself has improved tremendously. I am emotionally stable (ish) now. I am more reliable (and way less erratic). We are now moved in to an apartment for just the two of us, my sobriety has become the norm, and if we go exploring the pubs in our new town I will be drinking NA beers :) 

I am a happier person now, a better daughter, a better partner, a better friend. Most of all, I'm better at saying no. I don't overstep my own boundaries on the regular. I manage my energy levels better. I sleep. I still wake up multiple times a night, but I don't need to knock myself out with booze to fall asleep. I can take naps now. I discovered that I grew tremendously in the past two years, but that taking away the booze also uncovered the real me. I found myself again.

Thank you. Thank you for sharing your advice, your slip ups, your day ones, your day 1000s. Thank you for upvoting, for lurking, for letting me know that I'm not the only one. This subreddit is the one thing I changed this time around, and it has stuck so far. Thank you.

It had gotten worse recently with him acting out with drinking. It got to the point where I had to tell him I could not interact with him while he’s drunk anymore. His psychiatrist/therapy really encouraged him to get sober and go to AA so he finally agreed to. He’s not happy about it but is doing it for his mental health and to keep me in his life. I told him I would quit with him so I’ve been sober as well and I don’t plan on drinking for the rest of my life. On Christmas Eve, I went with him to AA but there only turned out to be a men’s meeting so I just had coffee while he had his first meeting. He didn’t share and he hated it. Yesterday we went to another AA meeting, this one all genders so I could go too, and he just sat and didn’t share or participate. I shared though. I’m pretty comfortable in the setting. I grew up going to Alateen and Alanon with my mom to help cope with my dad’s drinking and my uncle’s drug addiction but that’s another story. So I talked about how I’m quitting with my dad for my dad but also for myself. I don’t like how much this substance has had a negative influence on my family and I don’t want it in my life anymore even though I didn’t abuse it as much as my dad. I just want alcohol out of my life so I’m not drinking anymore even if my dad relapses. My dad hates this whole process. He doesn’t want to quit drinking and he hates AA. He blames Alanon for his marriage with my mom failing even though it obviously didn’t. His bipolar and drinking led her to get help and set boundaries and then HE divorced HER. But whatever, main point is he hates AA for whatever reason but he’s going because his doctor is telling him to because he HAS to stop drinking. Finally. Even though he is complaining about AA, he isn’t drinking and ever since Christmas things have been really nice without the drama of late night drunk calls, only nice sober calls where if there is an issue, we have actual discussions that he actually remembers after and hanging out with him in person is nicer as well. We are both on disability and don’t work and live near each other so we spend a lot of time together. We both still smoke weed. My dad doesn’t plan on quitting weed and I don’t mind that because he doesn’t act out when he is on weed like he does when he drinks. I’d like to quit weed one day as well but it’s not as urgent. Right now I’m just focusing on quitting drinking with my dad and it’s going well so far overall.",4

Just having somthing to get my thought in order on the good, and bad days without judgement has been such a blessing. I really mean it I would not be here without you guys. Thank you for this gift you've helped me achieve.

I had a friend (who I really haven't known very long) the other day try and explain to me that I didnt really have a problem seeing as this time round I was able to quit relativly easily. I said one day I quit and that was it. I didnt have the heart to tell him I chose to be sober because I couldn't remember the last day I hadn't become black out drunk. I didnt have the heart to tell him how hard it's still is every day. I didnt have the heart to tell him in the early days of this sobriety I'd yell myself horse in the anguish I felt from not drinking. I didnt have the heart to tell him the struggle I've dealt with for over fifteen years. How I got sober once for almost six months before it all came crashing down again. At the end I just didnt have the heart. Some people can never understand what it's like and they are the lucky ones.

At the end of the day it doesnt matter what others think of out paths. I do this for me and because I know it's what I need. We go through what feels sometimes as a very lonely struggle, because alot of outsiders do not know our pains. Do not know the sacrifice we've made, or the trouble we've cause, or the people we've hurt. We carry the burden of our addictions. Without you who understand what its like I know I wouldnt be here sober today. I honestly couldn't of made it with out you. 

Thanks for everything
Best of luck in your journeys.

  I've been struggling with loneliness lately and almost everyone I know will be at a party of some sort that night.   Thankfully, I work that evening, but I'm still dreading what is to come after i get off the clock.  My brain has tried to tell me that one (or 2 or 3) won't hurt but I know that's a load of malarkey.  In order to combat both my loneliness and the temptation, I've volunteered my services as a sober driver to all my coworkers and the handful of friends I have. I only recently moved to my city and being sober has made it more difficult to socialize, so I feel more isolated than ever when I'm excluded from drinking events.   I scheduled a phone date with one of my sober long distance friends, but what else can I do to make it through this night?

I needed to get through the withdrawals I was suffering, and needed to be told that I could and that I needed to talk to my partner about this.

Well you guys told me, I talked to my partner, and here I am. Yesterday I did drink a few beers just to ease the pain I was in, and thought I’d have to do that until I could make it to the detox center on Monday. Then I woke up today and something just felt... different. I felt okay. A couple times I’d get hit with a wave of panicky anxiety, but instead of going for one of my emergency beers I’d gotten myself to make it to Monday, I just came here to read your stories. By the time I had to leave for work, I hadn’t had a drop. Then I worked a very busy serving shift (during which there’s regularly drinks available), and as I was walking out without stopping at the bar for a few, I felt so light. As I’m laying in bed now, I still do. Not a single drink all day. My choice.

I’m practically giddy with excitement to have finally made this first step. I’ll still be going to the detox center Monday, just to cover my bases and see what programs are available etc. But damn, do I feel great about this decision. And I wouldn’t be here right now if it weren’t for you guys and my beautiful, supportive partner.

Sorry for the rant, but boy does it feel good to be able to share.

Without alcoholism running through my veins, every second of every day, I would not have been able to find my true self. Through all the alcohol related problems, through all the relapses and failed attempts at sobriety, and through all the pain I did not realize I was causing the most important people in my life, I thought my life was manageable. I thought that living a life that was essentially a twenty-four hour emergency was normal. I was constantly putting out fires that I thought were life problems, problems that everyone went through. In reality, these were problems that were directly rooted in my drinking. Once one problem was solved to my liking, which was really just finding a way to mask it, another arose. This was my life. Tears, sweat, blood; but not the good kind. Not the kind that one endures when completing a difficult project or dedicating themselves to some initiative. These were the bad kind and often the kind that others endured as I lived my alcoholic life.

I am grateful to be an alcoholic. My life is manageable. The insanity has escaped me. The vicious cycle, that continued to worsen with revolution, has finally been fractured.  Life is beautiful. Life is not meant to be centered on putting out fire after fire. I can finally deal with normal life problems with a rational mindset and solve them, rather than just sweeping them under the rug.  Life is meant to be spent with the ones you love and enjoy the time we have here. The earth is a beautiful creation and its fruits are best enjoyed with a clear mind, not an altered one. Life is meant to be centered around the ones we love, rather than our self. Alcoholism has taught me this. Without it, I am not sure I would have ever realized how much of life’s beauty I was missing with drink. I can enjoy my family and finally put them first, where they have always belonged. I can continue to work on myself and take a daily inventory to determine if I continue to do the next right thing and live out God’s will. For once, I can be happy; not the pseudo happiness I was living for so long, but the real happiness that everyone is entitled to. I am free. I am free and alive. I am free and therefore, I am grateful to be an alcoholic.",39

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi everyone! 

I'm putting a bit of pressure on myself to get this right, and I just realized that I actually don't need to. Being here is enough. I am enough. 

We're coming to the pinnacle of the holiday season now, for those of us who celebrate New Year's Eve on 31st December. It might help to remember that for some people around the world, it's only another day. I've read that there are 11 cultures that don't celebrate the New Year on 1st January. There are probably a lot more than that, really. Various celebrations are held at different times, including the Chinese Lunar New Year, Diwali, Rosh Hashanah and the Aboriginal Murador New Year. 

Personally, my New Year's Eve celebrations never turned out to be the fantasy I excitedly anticipated. Every year felt like I was chasing something, never quite getting there. I often went to bed in an angry drunken funk, sulking over some imagined slight from my poor lovely husband, waking up hungover and having to apologize for being a hostile bitch (sorry, I tried ""meanie bum-bum"" but it didn't have the same punch) the night before. Is that how you want to start your fresh year?

This year I'm excited to start my 2020 the way I intend to continue. Like that line from Coldplay's 'Rush of Blood to the Head': *""Start as you mean to go on...""* 

To make sure I achieve that I'm going to shore up my sober supports and strategies, which I'll go through with you tomorrow.

I'd love to hear from people about when/how their culture celebrates the turning of a year. We have so many cultures represented in this group and I'd like to extend myself beyond my little life and find out what's going on in yours.

And for now, my cherished sober tribe, I will make this promise to myself and you: I will not drink with you today.

Love,

Starlight",78

She lives across the country, but I immediately thought about her. I randomly texted her about how good the documentary was. My phone rang, FaceTime. It was her. I saw her face and fell apart, sobbing and reaching for comfort, feeling sorry for myself. Then I snapped out of it and realized something was wrong. I went silent, not wanting to scare her away, I stopped talking and just listened. After a while of her making eye contact and then looking away, I finally asked, are you ok. It took a while but, I just sat there while she took as much time as she needed. As soon as she started talking I could tell she had not only been drinking but was drunk. I started to try and figure out where she was and if she was alone, and where she was going. Come to find out she was in her car in a parking lot. Getting ready to drive home after a fight with her husband. Thank goodness I texted her when I did, thank goodness she called me back, and thank goodness I was sober... Even if only 44 day’s...

I stayed up and made myself a nice veggie dinner. I feel like it is a healthy way to end an unhealthy day. I don't want to keep hurting myself like this. And maybe just making a good dinner is a good step in the right direction.",14

2019-12-28 20:31:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/egzj77/a_new_journey/,A new Journey,"  

Ok new person here lurking for the last couple of weeks. I must say the stories on here are a great inspiration and it is helping me with making this decision to travel this new journey.

Many years ago I used to drink a 6 pack of beer a night if I had nothing on. Luckily that stopped. I am a social drinker, but will find any social situation just to have a drink at times.

These days if it was during the week it would be 1 or 2 pints if it was during the week, but could easily get written off on the weekends. But if I was doing nothing I was happy to not drink. I would seek out people at work to go to the pub for a drink to not have the excuse of not drinking alone.

Last year for a ""New Year's Resolution"" I told myself to not drink for as long as I can (I finished my last beer at 11:55pm NYE 2018). Soon after new year, I started doing Park Runs and have gotten into running. Then I was convinced to do a 12km run in May. This is when I made a pact, that I will not drink until after this fun run. During this time I went from 84kg (185pounds) down to 75kg (165pounds). I haven't been in the 70's for like over 15 years, so I felt good.

It went well, but I missed the drink (esp beer). I was looking forward to the reward of doing the run. I still went out but drunk soda water and lime. But I didn't stay as long as I found it boring and always craved the taste of beer. When I did the run and went for a beer I made a ""promise"" to myself that only drink once or twice a week and only have 1 or 2 each time. Yes that failed and whilst I ensured I didn't drink alone, I did drink more than 1 or 2 nights (maybe about 4 nights) and I did drink more than 1 or 2 pints if it was on the weekend.

I have come to the realisation that if I want to cut down my alcohol intake it has to be all or nothing. I have gone back up to my original weight and my running has taken an impact and not as enjoyable anymore as I get puffed a lot faster.

I was thinking about waiting until the new year (which is only this Wed) to start the process of not drinking again as New Year's Eve I have a concert that I am going to that there will be alcohol and knowing myself I would probably fail if I start say today. This of course is all in my head and the bands would be just as enjoyable (and probably more memorable) if I didn't drink. I just know that the temptation will be far too great and it would be very hard for myself.  I see a few people on here that have their anniversaries around this time, so I know it can be done. I just need to ""survive"" New Year's Eve. I can't cancel NYE to avoid the alcohol as I am going with a group and have paid and organised a while ago. I have been looking forward to seeing these bands. I suppose if I do ""fail"" I have wasted 2 days of trying....

My goal is to do a Marathon in October. For that I know I need to lose weight and to maintain a good running schedule. Quit drinking (and crap food) will help with this goal.

Cheers all for reading and I hope you have a great 2020.",3

I’m 35/F, professional career, engaged with no kids. To the outside world, I probably look like I’ve got it all together... but I’ve been dealing with extreme anxiety and PTSD for years and using alcohol to self-medicate and to deal with the stress of my job.  I’m one to have a bottle to a bottle and a half of wine at night just so I can sleep.

Recently, my psych wrote me out for three weeks of work due to anxiety. I cut back a little bit at first but during the holidays, I really indulged. Last night, my fiancé and I stayed up until 4 am drinking Jack and cola.  I felt fine when I went to bed (I very rarely black out); I’ve never been a puker and didn’t even have a headache this morning, but my hangovers are measured by relentless panic and today was about the worst I’ve had.

I was sober for 7 months last year and I felt GREAT... so much so that I was able to go off of my antidepressants.  I know that there’s a strong correlation between anxiety and my alcohol use, and now it’s time to put it away for good.

Any and all encouragement is welcome! IWNDWYT. ❤️",15

&#x200B;

I have posted here on my main before but not recently. However in the coming weeks I feel I will be here more and more often. This post is more just me writing my feelings and concerns to gather my thoughts and throw them into the void. But if you listen and have advice I appreciate you taking the time.

&#x200B;

I have court on Jan 15th for a DUI I got in August. I struck another car and fled the scene. There were no injuries that I have been made aware of and my insurance paid out to them as far as I know.

&#x200B;

I have been a mess the last few months. I haven't had a run in with the law in the last 20 years until this. I have been a daily drinker, often upwards of a fifth of cheap whiskey a day. I didn't feel like I had a problem because I was still able to get up at 5am and do well at my physically taxing and exhausting job for so long.  I had a family reunion last Sunday and the holidays following - it's safe to say that I took my consumption to new extremes. I killed a handle of Kentucky Deluxe in a little over twelve hours on Christmas and my kidneys still hurt. I haven't drank since I woke up from that binge and the idea of drinking makes me physically ill so I think I'll just keep riding that wave. 

&#x200B;

As for my upcoming court date, it's going to be an absolute embarrassing fiasco. I opted for a public defender but instead of filling out the paperwork I went and got drunk. I know I'll be put on probation but I'm going to ask to be put on a SCRAM (Secure Remote Alcohol Monitor) ankle bracelet because I'm incredibly overweight. I'm over 400 pounds and urinating standing up, let alone into a cup is a difficult, embarrassing task that I'd rather avoid at all costs. Even though I'm on my feet for 9-12 hours a day during the work week and eating 300 calorie frozen meals the sheer volume of my alcohol consumption means that I just keep putting on weight. 

&#x200B;

Forced sobriety has nothing but good things to offer me but the fact that I can't escape my own head scares me. I'm incredibly lonely. I live an hour away from my family and it's too for for them to want to make the trip more than once every few months. When I still had my car I would go visit either my sister or my parents every weekend. My room mate is a chore to hang out with. Constantly talking, talking over you whenever you start a sentence and once he's done telling a story he loops back around and tells it again with slightly different wording.

I feel so alone.

Only a few drinks, but nonetheless, was sober for 6 months before. Didn't get drunk or do anything dumb, but definitely had poor sleep, heightened anxiety for a few days... **the reasons why I quit.**  Night after, I went out with a friend in town, had two drinks; after cutting myself off, felt bored and wanted to leave. If I'm not there to drink till getting drunk, I don't find any joy of hanging around a bar after the conversation topics dry up in an hour and my attention span disappears.   


I'll admit it being the weekend have considered hitting up a few former drinking buddies to catch up; NYE is coming up and the only way I'm going to be able to get my laundry list of friends out an in one place is to go out to the bars.   


This is the longest period I've ever been sober and the magic around alcohol has disappeared for me - I'm acutely aware the only thing a few drinks do for me is make me tired and dull and the extended sobriety makes that hit even harder. If I'm being honest with myself, the partying muscles have been dormant for so long that I feel like I'd probably bail after an hour or two.  


How can I reconcile the limited drinking the other day and the NYE conundrum with my desire to stay sober?

Professional career, married with no kids. I’ve been drinking for 18 years. The last 5 years consisted of 12-15 IPA’s, 20 nights a month. I quit 1 year ago today and will never drink again. I was able to quit without any assistance, no AA, no doctors, no religion. It was just grit and a couple of gems I learned through trial and error. For anyone looking to quit, here are some things that I wish I had known before quitting that were unexpected. I don’t have all the answers by any means, but I am completely open to discuss anything with anyone regarding the quitting process, so feel free to ask any questions!

1) Life doesn’t suddenly become easier. But, it becomes easier to manage. 

2) Cravings, they come and go even a year later. 

3) You will have more energy than you’ve ever had, and that in itself can become a huge problem if you don’t expend that energy in a healthy manner. Prepare some activities that will exhaust you both physically and mentally. 

3) Sadly, people (especially on the internet) will down play your accomplishment if you quit cold turkey without assistance. IE: “You must not really have a problem if you didn’t need AA.” or “You don’t know what it’s really like to have a drinking problem, obviously you were able to quit on your own.” These comments will make you second guess your decision and give you an excuse to cave in. You will think “well I don’t want to go to AA right now, so maybe I’ll quit when I’m ready for AA.” It’s all garbage and misery loves company. If you quit on your own, be prepared for these comments. 

4) The act of quitting doesn’t change things, but it gives you the time, energy, creativity and mental clarity to make the changes yourself. 

5) Most of your friends, aren’t really your friends. 

6) You’re a good person, deal with it! 

7) You will feel a strong connection and responsibility to others who are suffering from alcohol abuse. We are not alone! We have each other.

I love you all very much and I hope you have an amazing 2020. Feel free to hit me up anytime.

A family friend (who my mother insists on including in every event) got very drunk and spoiled Christmas Eve. This year that family friend was ""sick"" and didn't show up for the big family event on the 24th. My wonderful brother & SIL gave me flowers in lieu of the wine they used to give me. I loved not only the flowers but also their gift of ongoing support. I notice of the 4 bottles of wine opened that night, only two were consumed among all 9 adults there over a 5 hour period. Three bottles of sparkling cider were polished off.  One brother had a beer. One beer. It was a wonderful, memorable evening full of laughter, memories and fun. Nobody was drunk.

Family friend ""felt better"" for Christmas day when it was only me and my folks. She drank at least a bottle of the leftover wine all while chiding me for not joining in on the ""fun"" of drinking with her, and her tone grew more hostile as the evening continued. I suspect she also pre-gamed with martinis (her poison of choice). She lasted through most of dinner and then suddenly disappeared. We thought she'd gone to the restroom, but she had stumbled out to her car and drove 5 miles home drunk. She did not meet us for breakfast the next day as she was ""sick"" again.

Two very different ways to celebrate the holidays. I have not had one day of regret since I quit, and I still hope this family friend will quit booze before her liver quits her body.

Got a root canal/crown in the middle of this year, and long story short this year has just been medical bill after medical bill. So when that familiar toothache kept me up last night, I was sent into a “here we go again” panic. Don’t be careless like me, guys. Start flossing and brushing TODAY if you’re not already. And if you feel pain, go to the dentist ASAP. Yes it’ll cost $$$ but it’ll be even more if you wait. 

Anyway, to what matters: Yep I’m going to be on anti biotics and pain killers for the next few days. And I’m kind of relieved because now I have a very solid reason to not drink! I confirmed this with the pharmacist as well. “Definitely not, especially with the painkillers”. 

The timing is just perfect. Friends birthday party in a bar today, New Year’s Eve coming up...I was planning to not drink anyway, but I am happy that now I have a more concrete reason not to. And “I’m on antibiotics” tends to steer people away from the topic of alcoholism more than “I don’t want to drink”.

So! Just wanted to share the good news. Happy new year guys! IWNDWYT",3

I drink probably twice a week on average, but when I drink I get really drunk and I say things that I regret saying and I act in ways I would never act sober.  That’s not even the worst part.  The worst part is the hangover and how it destroys my next few days.   I eat like absolute shit when I’m hungover and I end up staying up late and I skip the gym and I become foggy minded and I’m not even able to think straight.  It seriously last for about three days until I’m back on track and then I just do the cycle all over again.  So I’m basically recovering and trying to get back on track throughout every single week and I’m getting so tired of that feeling.  I’m gaining weight and I’m becoming more irritable and it’s starting to seriously affect my work.  I know that I’m smart and that I have a great work ethic when I have a clear mind, but I seriously need to kick this drinking problem before it turns into something bigger than it is.  I have a one and a half year old daughter now so I’ve been sort of keeping it under wraps, but it’s seriously killing me inside and I want to be more present and happy with my family.  Whenever I’ve stopped drinking for over a week, I could see my life slowly start to become better but then I would just get drunk again and ruin all momentum.  Anybody have any advice on how to stay sober?",7

Let me tell you.. I didn't like sweets as a child. I didn't even like cake (still kinda don't. I need to scrape off the frosting to eat it). I didn't like chocolate bars or anything like that.

Since getting sober, though? I can't get enough of ice cream and chocolate and donuts! Sometimes, I feel like my body is craving to make up for those years. 

So, if you are suddenly craving sugar since kicking the booze, know that you are not alone. I hear it's normal for recovering alcoholics to crave the sugar. 

I don't want to clean the house, and I haven't eaten anything substantial today. But, fuck it, I'll have some ice cream. Then, I'll eat vegetables later.

Day 1 quitting.,"My ex struggled with alcohol addiction. I’d never be able to understand because I’ve never had problems with substance abuse. Never had a problem not drinking because I hadn’t ever drank more than 3 days in a row. 

I’m a 29 year old female, 180lbs. No/low tolerance at the start. After I left the relationship (for other reasons), I started drinking... At first only at night, at least 9 standard drinks, but I didn’t like being drunk. So I switched to just having 2-3 shots every few hours starting from the time I woke up. 16-24 ounces of vodka a day. Kept it up for a month. 

Well this is my first day off it. Noticed that I did have passing impulses to drink. Kept a mixed drink from last night on the bookshelf for the temptation. (Or if I notice any physical withdrawal issues I might drink it to prevent severe problems.) Looking at it does make me want to drink it. But not more than wanting to stick to my plan. 

Idk. Had a killer head ache a few hours ago. Cramps. Now shallow breathing and flighty heartbeat. Might be the anxiety.

How about you guys?  If anybody is just starting out, here's some of the changes my body has made 


Mental health has improved.

I haven't called in with a fake excuse to work in over a month and a half.  I'd always think it was my depression, but in reality that was fueled by my alcohol abuse.  

I don't get crippling heartburn.  

I used to wake up choking on acid in the middle of the night. Each time I thought I was dying. I hated it. In the last 6 weeks or so, it hasn't happened once.  

I can hold conversations.

No constant umming and ahhing to find my words. My head is pretty clear now.

Losing weight.

My problem was 2 fold. I drank but I also ate the worst shit when drunk. Full pizzas, 3-4 burgers, giant bowls of pasta...you name it. Now that I don't drink, my appetite is normal. I started intermittent fasting too. Down about 20 lbs

The bullshit of being bloated

Fuck I hated that feeling. Coupled with my over eating...Ugh. It's also subsided.

Oh and the bonus of not pissing away $15-20 a night on booze. Always a bonus.

So if you're new here and you are tired of certain aspects in your life that you think may or may not be linked to the booze.  Pretty much all of my physical ailments that were a hinderence were linked to it. Shut that down, all the others slowly but surely followed and started fixing themselves.   I'm not perfect by any means, but it sure is nice to give my body help instead of killing it every night.

I haven't posted here at all much but I thought a trip around the sun warrants a post, especially considering how much this subreddit has helped me. So here's my tale. It may be a little long, but hey, maybe you need something to read to avoid those beers in the fridge. It helped me reading stories, maybe it will help you.

My story is probably familiar to many of you. I spent my free time doing what I liked to do best - drinking. I was the guy who showed up with a bottle of whiskey and made everyone do shots. Two bottles of wine a night was pretty much a standard ritual. Plus of course a bottle of hard stuff at hand just in case. I honestly don't know how I got through so many things drinking so much. I could hold my liquor and prided myself on how much I could drink.

I got a DUI. That was a wake up call. 2 years probation was not a fun thing to have to go through. But I made a rule, I'd never drive drunk again, and I didn't. I still drank like a beast when I didn't need to drive.

Moved to a different country, go accepted to a school, went to class most days with a killer hangover. To this day, I don't know how I pulled it off. If I had to guess, it was being productive in ""emergency"" mode. Getting stuff done in the anxiety-ridden panic and guilt after blacking out the night before. You know the feeling, the mania trying to get your sht together after messing up again. I kept myself together enough to put on a show and pulled it off.

I hid bottles, had my stash of gin that I'd hit so it didn't look like I was drinking so much. I'd order a drink and already have the next three or four planned. Strategy my friends! You should order the highest alcohol per dollar drink you can! All the tricks you read here, I've done. And I thought I was so clever!

I was never a morning drinker, or afternoon drinker for that matter. Come evening though, it was time to drink until I passed out. Rinse and repeat. For over 20 years I was on this cycle.

A year ago this time I was in the hospital. I drank the night before and tapped into the gin bottle, so the hangover was strong this day. After a lovely lunch, I was walking with my SO and my chest started feeling funny and I couldn't breathe. My heart then dropped and everything got slow. I thought I was having a heart attack. I collapsed and slowly got home with tunnel vision and then my heart started racing. I ended up in the ER on a busy night. Lots of wires on the chest and some pills to bring the heart rate down. They kept me overnight and by the time I actually saw a doctor, I was feeling better. They said it was probably just anxiety. Hmm... maybe, but I've never felt this way before in my life. Did I have a heart attack? Oh no, we don't think so. I told them I am a heavy drinker and was worried about my liver, maybe that had something to do with it? Oh no, your young enough, don't worry about that! To this day, I'm still pissed at these doctors. There's no doubt in my mind this was drinking related. My liver always felt bloated and hurt often. I lived in a constant hangover. 20 plus years of heavy drinking was taking its toll.

So I thought it would be good to take a break from good ole Buddy booze. Health wise, I was destroyed. I couldn't have drunk those days following the hospital, I was pretty much bed ridden. The third day, the fog cleared a bit and I realized if I keep drinking, I'm going to die. It was tangible to me. This path is killing me. This is not ""haha, saturated fat will kill ya, kid"", this will end with me dead. I guess you could call this my rock bottom, but I could also list a dozen rock bottoms I've had over the years. My body was a wreck, everything was always bloated and hurt. I gained lots of weight. I told myself what I told myself every morning for years. Man, I should stop drinking.

Looking back, I realize those days after, I was going through withdrawals. The shakes, sweats, a total mess I was. But I knew I needed to stop. I knew for a long time. I tried before. I tried so many times. But I had to try again.

So I took it one day at a time.

I know it sounds cliche to you. It sure did to me. Heck, it still does actually. But it's in the moment that I am at my weakest. How many times have I said ""the hell with it"" and just dove in? It happens in a split second and the decision is made, and then the bottle is empty and I'm back in the cycle.

Not now. I can do it later if I need to. Not now, I can always drink tomorrow. Not now, there is always next weekend. Not now. That's what I need to tell myself.

So I took it minute by minute and hour by hour then day by day. Then back to minute by minute when it got rough, and back to day by day when it got better.

And folks, that's what I have to share with you. Not here. Not this time. Not now. Constantly telling myself this every day is what gets me through. Give it a try. Say it to yourself right now. Say it outloud. Say it with conviction and believe it. You can do it in this moment. Try to focus on just this and push those voices screaming at you to the back. Not now.

I still take it one day at a time. I still need to tell myself this. But it gets easier. It really does. Life gets better without the weight. Drinking used to take up about 75% of my thoughts. It's amazing how much we think about it: regretting it, planning it, making a strategy. It calms down. The screaming voices get quieter and the bastard on your shoulder who says ""just this time, it can't hurt"" starts to lose their confidence. Not now buddy, not this time.

Lastly, I'll leave you with some reflections.

I didn't lose a lot of weight. I still have a hard time getting enough sleep. I did not get super fit. I'm still not a morning person. Life isn't perfect.

But I do feel better about myself. I am amazed what it feels like to live without a constant hangover. I didn't realize how much anxiety I had until it went away. I am more productive. I feel healthy. I don't have to constantly live in fear of what I said when I was drunk. I actually remember things. My relationship is better. Everything is better. I don't spend a fortune on something that just disappears. I make less excuses. I can make plans and actually follow through with them. I can think about other things than booze. I can concentrate better. I am more confident. My digestive track is not a sewer. The hard things in life are still brutal, but facing them sober allows me to handle them better and with my head held high.

Is it worth it? I can't express how much life has improved. The change was slow for me, and at times I wondered why I can still be miserable. However, looking back at the cloud I lived in and the things which have improved is eye-opening to me. Drinking was personal. I thought it WAS me. It's only by walking the path that you can start to see through the Tom foolery. I hope that you join me on this new sober adventure. Let's walk for awhile together.

So here's to you. Fight the moments and keep going. We all fall and we have all fallen hard. That bastard on your shoulder is trying to say something-nope, Not now buddy, not now. I'm here fighting them off with you. Let's pick up and keep going. You got a whole gang of people right here behind you and we have your back. You're worth it. I am cheering you on. One foot in front of the other and one minute at a time. Keep on keeping on. You got this. I believe in you.

I won't drink with you today.",855

In addition to not drinking, I’m afraid to take a Tylenol bc I don’t want to do liver damage with my history. This is not a medical question, so please don’t delete it, The doctor says it is fine if occasional, but does anyone else have this hang up? I know they say the liver processes alcohol and medication differently, but I feel like taking a dose of Tylenol is the same as having a drink (liver speaking). I’m not weird about things that don’t affect the same mechanisms FYI, I’ve smoked pot since being alcohol free and feel no guilt about it as it’s not my drug of choice, I can take it or leave it, and I don’t think it’s bad for me on occasion.  But if I have a headache or muscle pain, I suffer from crippling fear of damaging my body more than I already have. 

I also have tremendous guilt that I haven’t been exercising and I’ve been eating a lot of junk food for the same health reasons. I used to eat a near perfect diet (short of drinking two bottles of wine a day) and worked out daily. To get over the hump of sobriety I started lounging at home and eating cookies, candy etc... I haven’t gained weight, I guess because of the 1000 wine calories a day I’m not getting, but I’m also not getting vitamins from healthy food or the benefits of exercise. I feel like even this far in, my motivation doesn’t extend much further than just being able to keep myself from drinking. 

Bottom line is I haven’t drank in 4 months but I’m feeling more guilt, worry and stress over my health and lifestyle than I did as alcohol abuser.",3

Before, when I was drinking, I would dread having to wake up on the weekends or come home early from work to take care of my 15 month old daughter. But being sober, I’m loving every second of fatherhood. Even when she acts like a little shit lol. It really is a great feeling and I’m super stoked to know that I am making all the right moves to be the best father I can be. The only issue I am having is with my wife, and understandably so. We are trying to make things work, but honestly, I get why she is hesitant. A lot of damage was done over the last 3 weeks that caused me to stop drinking in the first place...I’m just hoping she can find it in her heart to forgive me and realize that that person I have been since the day we met is not the person I really am. I’m trying my hardest to show her love and make up for all the shitty things I’ve ever done to her while being drunk..either way, I know the only way to keep my family together is to stay free and clear of booze, and that’s what is the most important to me.

And when I type that out, I realize it sounds kind of ridiculous, but I'm anxious about how people will react.

I don't think of myself as an Alcoholic, and yet I realize that I'm a disordered drinker. I only drink 3, maybe 4 times a year. Like on classic ""party"" holidays, such as New Year's Eve, or 4th of July. Seriously, MONTHS will go by between when I drink, and when I next drink. But when I do, I go too far. I always find myself trying to ""chase the buzz"" and just stay in that ""safe zone"" where you're loosened up and able to interact better in social situations, without reaching the ""drunk"" level. But I never can find that balance. One drink becomes two, then three, and before I know it I've had too much. I'll forget certain parts of the night, or wake up and pour through my phone in a terrified frenzy wondering who I texted, and what embarrassing thing I said, etc. I'll have a pounding headache and a nauseous stomach (and it will take me a full 2 days now to recover from the physical repercussions of drinking that much), and I'll tell myself ""that's it, I'm done!"" 3 months will go by and I won't drink a drop. Then some friend's birthday will come up, and I'll have another one of these out of control nights.

I hate this feeling. I hate that I can't moderate, that I can't just have one drink in a social setting. I hate that I have embarrassing memories because of things I've said or done while drunk, or that I'm always ""that girl"" at the party that can't handle her liquor and ends up passed out in a corner. But I've never had a ""rock bottom"" moment in my life. I've never gotten a DUI, or had to be rushed to the hospital to get my stomach pumped. And yet, I realize that I have a bad relationship with alcohol, and don't know how to use it properly.

I want to stop, forever, but I'm afraid of coming out and saying so for being feared of being judged, or labeled with the ""A"" word. I have a very judgemental family, and I fear they would slap me with the ""Alcoholic"" label immediately if I came out and said I wanted to quit drinking. But I don't feel like that word represents me, and I just fear judgement. My fiance is extremely supportive of me, and I feel like most of my friends would be too. But really it's my family I'm afraid of. Every get together (And there are a lot of them right now, because of this time of the year) has tons of alcohol at it. And if you don't have a drink in your hand, you're asked 1,000 questions about ""why, or what do you want to drink, we have beer, wine, mixed drinks, champagne, or are you pregnant? No? Then have a drink!"" The peer pressure is crazy and I'm stressed out just thinking about the next family event coming up.

This post ended up rambling, and I'm sorry for just shouting my emotions into the void. But I want to thank everyone who is a part of this community. I've been a lurker for some time now, and while I don't really interact much (I'm just a lurker kind of reddit user in general), the stories here give me a lot of hope and comfort, knowing I'm not alone in feeling the way that I do.

For so long now, I kept thinking it was my lack of will power alone that made me break my promise to her time and time again.  For so long now, I thought my drinking habits were normal.  There is nothing normal about drinking till I lose my memory, losing phones and wallets, getting bruises and cuts, verbally abusing my partner and family, and getting raped.  I need help.  My partner thinks I cannot quit and I broke my promises time and time again because I don't love her enough and that seems to be the consensus among my friends who do not have a drinking problem.  I don't want to lose her, I don't want my parents to lose their daughter, and I don't want to lose my health.  I can no longer tell myself that I can just cut down instead of quitting cold turkey.

I think back to that night a few years back I held my gun in my hand...just wanted to feel it, entertain the thought...try it on for size.   My brain recoils now at the thought.  Instinctively I want to jump through my memory and slap myself!   

Happiness is found within.

Now to the reason for my post! I don’t know where else to post except an amazing subreddit where many people who are going through (went through) the same challenges as myself.... all areas of health have increased greatly except for my joint pain, I’ve looked up the symptoms and it seems pretty much like rheumatoid arthritis, I am young 30s and while I did heavily drink I am wondering if anyone else experienced this from around 3-6 months (and who knows how long) after becoming sober. Does it go away? Is it just lasting inflammation of the joints that is healing? If this were to become non-existent I believe I will have made substantial overall recoveries but this affects my life greatly, especially in the mornings where I can barely make a fist. The pain seems to only be in my finger joints (not even knuckles) and nowhere else.

I haven't gone more than a week without drinking since I started. I don't like the road I'm going down. I plan to stay sober a month, I'm on day two. It's not that hard to not drink but I'm scared that it will be in 2 weeks. I'm scared that I'll find out how reliant I really am on booze.

In the past always a booze fest and I usually led the charge.  My mind used to prepare for the blackout and the hangover.  No more.  No problem abstaining either.  

My friend is a daily drinker as in about a six beers a day (that he admits).  Weekends more.  Yesterday it started at 1100 am and went at least until I left at 800. Had to have had at least ten beers plus some whiskey.  

In the past that’s nothing for me but now it just seems so pointless.  I watched him put them down and keep going for more.  Conversations got harder as he couldn’t stay on topic, couldn’t find the words and at times made no sense at all.  

We talked a little about my quitting drinking.  He’s curious about it but stubbornly says he will never give it up.  He asks questions like “do you feel better” and “how do you go somewhere and not drink”. I’m not pushy about it at all. I simply state that it works for me and I can’t see myself going back. 

He doesn’t think there’s a problem because he stays pretty even.  He does pace himself and is usually not a sloppy shithouse drunk (like I was) but the sheer amount he consumes regularly is concerning.  He’s even starting to get the purple nose and red blotchy face and is aware of that.  He says he needs it to cut the edge off. 

I told him it’s like he’s dosing himself with poison in order to maintain that buzz balance.  I also said I don’t need to play that mind game with it anymore asking myself how many have I had, wondering if I need to slow down, looking for more, physically feeling like shit.  

He’s still my best friend and I don’t mind if he drinks. That’s his business.  It’s just strange to see someone taking alcohol as medicine thinking it’s helping them when it’s actually hurting.",17

The last 15 years its daily and my husband and I are both deep in it although we hold down good jobs and seem only like the fun couple who has fun gatherings. The last year my husband has become a daily pot smoker too, I dabble but it makes me have very dark bad thoughts. Our sex life is nonexistent. I’m very worried about my marriage but know I have to take care of myself first and that’s most important. Yesterday I drove 3 hours for a family holiday (my family). There was booze and wine but I had tea. Things have gotten very grim with my mental health and I’ve been having suicidal ideation thoughts, my self esteem is shot, I look and feel horrible, and the hangover anxiety is unbearable. 
I think I ate something bad at lunch so went to bed around 7. No booze, no smoking cigarettes (light smoker but daily since 18). I read and felt better in a couple hours and easily could have gotten up and mixed drinks and smoked until midnight...but my husband wasn’t coming until the next day and I just said STOP. 
I slept very poorly and I swear I had some very vivid dreams maybe hallucinations and now I’m having coffee with my mom, feeling really tired like I’d been hit by a truck but my mind is ... pretty good! I feel like I broke a cycle that I’ve been trying to do for the last 10 years but was terrified and afraid my life as I know it would shatter. Well, I think that’s the idea. My husband will be joining us today. I plan on not drinking and I’m so scared. I have high potency CBD oil and gabepentin that my psychiatrist gave me for anxiety.

These are my own personal findings and you may experience different results / have different needs. 

Yesterday I posted about how I’ve been sober for 93 days and working towards repairing the damage I’ve done to my body. I wrote about how I had labs done for the 6th time and how they are increasingly better and better. 

One stat that hasn’t budged is my globulin levels which are elevated. Determined to find something I could take to possibly accelerate or fix that number, I discovered a lot of research regarding the use of safflower oil. 

So, with that being said, I started researching safflower supplements and came across CLA, a supplement that they sell in GNC that is used primarily to promote the breakdown of belly fat and get rid of excess water...

Given the fact that I have issues with water retention to begin with, I figured what the hell, it’s just a supplement, lemme buy it and see what happens. Not only that, I found one at GNC called CLA PM which you take at night before bed instead of before a workout, to help you sleep better... since I’m still having trouble sleeping, this thing sounded like a god send. 

Fast forward to last night. I followed the instructions and took 4 pills before bed as directed. Woke up a few times peeing like a race horse (removal of excess water) but every time I laid back down, I immediately passed the fuck out!!!  

It actually worked!!!

Let’s see if it keeps working....",10

I usually take it with food but today I didn’t get a chance to have a full meal early in the day. I took my supplement and felt a little burning sensation in my tummy and in that instance my whole body perked up and my eyes widened as my body had a sudden rush of adrenaline
*It was that feeling of bliss you get when you take the first sip of your drink* 

On my way to work I couldn’t brush off the strange adrenaline I suddenly had, and I had a quick flashback of having a cocktail. I couldn’t believe that I’ve been so strong and not even thinking of having a drink but in that moment that physical feeling really triggered my past mentality.

I suppose I wanted to drink today. I say suppose because I really wasn't interesting in getting completely wasted. In my mind I decided that 8 beers would be the magic number. But then I thought about the days I racked up sober, is 8 beers worth all of that? Yea, I probably wouldn't be too hungover tomorrow from 8 beers, yea I would have gotten a good buzz. But for what? to sit in my room and watch pointless sports highlights of sports I don't even like? As I was driving back home and passed the liquor store, I had this strange sensation that I actually didn't want to drink today, even despite all that rationalization and analysis. I just stopped at my favorite mexican joint and got a fat burrito instead. This is definitely the first time where I came to conclusion that I didn't want to drink, It just didn't seem worth it to me - as if someone offered me some other hard drug and I would think about it and say, ""yea probably not worth it"".

IMO: ***Transparency*** is about my willingness to be seen, to be open about my truth, and to be willing to be vulnerable with what is true for me.  I think it's pretty essential to healthy relationships.  Transparency is not about not having appropriate boundaries (meaning I do't tell everyone everything, by any stretch of the imagination), but it's about a commitment to being known by people I want to know me.  

Now, ***privacy***; I'm not going to tell everyone my financial info, my fantasies, or even some things about myself  that, perhaps, I have judgment about.  I'm going to choose to whom I tell what.  I'm a high introvert, too, so I don't necessarily share a lot with most people.  But I'm much less private with people I trust.  I have a friend who is so private about things that seem to me to be innocuous -- like not being willing to say who she's having lunch with, that it has made me wonder about the tipping point between privacy and ***secrecy***.  Perhaps because of my family history -- where there were a lot of secrets, including around alcohol, mental health and intimate partner violence -- I find secrets to be toxic. My drinking was also a huge secret (well, of course I thought so, anyway) because of the shame I felt around it. So I'm working this tangle in my head and I'd love some other reflections.

***For your Weekend Writing consideration:*** What does transparency mean to you and what is the difference between privacy & secrecy? If there is a spectrum of transparency --> secrecy, where do you land? How do the dynamics of each of these play out in your life, especially in regard to alcohol?",20

Sometimes a 1/5th, most times a pint. Alcoholism runs in my family. My mother died in an accident from it, and today my brother died because of it. Eric was one of the smartest people I know, and with a sharp sense of humor that cut like a knife. 22 Years ago he married his dream girl. They had a child named Andrew. Andrew died 2 days later from a heart defect. Then his wife cheated on him a year later and left him. Eric had found two friends to help with the pain. Gaming and vodka. For 22 years the addition got worse until he remarried. He had a son with his new wife and enjoyed life. His wife was an enabler. Slowly but surely, his son wasn't his passion anymore, it was his drinking that became more important. Then the fighting came, and the fighting became so bad that his son was placed with the daughter of his wife.

Eric and his next wife divorced. She also passed from alcoholism a few months ago. Found behind the chair in her apartment 2 days after she passed.

Eric found love in a new enabler. She wasn't happy unless he was drinking with her. They married, they fought and my brother was drinking up to a gallon of vodka in a weekend. He lost his well-paying job and his son. But continued to drink. He was arrested for battery, and tried to sober up. They reconciled and the drinking continued. She would buy him booze, saying it was medicine. She was an enabler. Eric was hospitalized with drink induced seizures several times. But he kept drinking saying she was the only one that understood him. Yesterday, 12/ 26/19, Eric had an aneurysm.

Even at my worst I had hope. I was shocked when the emergency room personnel did not judge me. I was certain I would be treated like I was crazy... like my former gf, friends, and others said I was. They did not judge me and it made all the difference. I felt safe with them... I am not judging you either, reader, for whom these words resonate.

It gets better. Even in the depths of the despair of my sickness I knew if I could hold on I would see the light at the end of the tunnel.

As a former Ph.D. student in psychology (left for a good job offer with the master's) it does get better if you will it to be so. Thought can change emotion. You can control your thoughts. You can have joy.

Every obstacle can be overcome. The statistics say I will have at least one more major depression... and suicide is more likely than most of the population in my life time. And to that I say: ""Give me a fucking break. Lol. I command my mind, I have peace, and I have joy. My mind cannot kill me because I command it to be happy.""

And to back up... guess what? I proved those haters in my life wrong. In fact, their hatred fueled this burning furnace of success in my mind. I am more successful than most everyone who ever made me feel small. I also wish them success too yet who they were and maybe still are... I do not respect. ;)

""I finally want to be alive. I don't want to die. I don't want to die."" - Logic

I am alive because I chose alcohol to deal (along with CBET & positive psychology) and now... I choose to help others more than ever before. 440+ days sober in 2018-19 cannot be wrong. I am healing drastically... moreso than ever!!!!

2019-12-27 21:28:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/egktoo/relapse/,Relapse,"I relapsed over Christmas after 7 months. I was away from my SO that I was also trying to patch things up. I was doing really good and was also helping her with things that are affecting her life. She said she was proud of me. She hasn't said anything like that to me in a long time and I really loved hearing it. 
 Something else happened, my Mom invited my Dad who I haven't seen in 15yrs to a Christmas get together. They have been divorced since the mid 80's. He went white as a ghost when he saw me and barely said hi. I let it roll off my shoulder and open up with a ""hi, how are you?"" introduction. By the end of the night he said it was good to see me and that it would be nice if we talked more often. I agreed. 
 The next night I hung out with a friend who has been super supportive of me and had offered to pay for my phone as I was recently unemployed and  needed help with my phone payments.  It was so thoughtful and nice I could hardly believe it. After helping him get gifts under the tree for his kids we parted ways and I proceeded to drive home.
 I passed the old watering hole I used to frequent when I was younger. Like a laser beam I pulled over, walked in and started to drink. Why? I still don't know. Wasted, I left and while driving I started to call everyone in my contacts. So rude. My SO always said if I relapsed to call her and it would be ok. I did, she answered and it wasn't ok. She was with her parents for Christmas dinner and I didn't like what she had to say to me so I drunkenly yelled at her for a long time and told her I wasn't coming back. I don't know what else I said but it wasn't good. Just threw it all away. Somewhere along the way I called my little brother, he knew what was happening and sent my step mom to pick me up who was over an hour away. I yelled at her also in the car on the way to her house. She saved me from possible worse decisions that night and I acted like a true asshole. 
 What a terrible night. 
Now I'm alone, my SO won't talk to me and I can't stop breaking down in tears. This sucks. I'm not drinking though, and it was just one night of drinking but it caused soo much damage. I gotta keep trying to be a better person. 
 This is a tale of caution. I wish I could go back in time.",7

Got some after Christmas blues kicking in.  All of my daughter's stuff is impacting my serenity. 

She refused to clean her room and front room.  Her crap is all over and her puppy steals her stuff everytime she goes from her cage to the front door and back as well. 

On top of that I'm waiting back from hr of my prospective employer to find out if I'm just supposed to get a drug test, or if I'm supposed to get a physical and Tb test too.  They didn't say anything about those, only drug test, but on the papers work, it said drug test, physical, and Tb screening as well.

So things were getting really thick, and then her Mom randomly showed up.  So daughter is now with Mom, the house is still a mess but now I just have to deal with her puppy instead of her snooty attitude .  Very rarely am I happy to see her mother.

Anyways, I decided to go for a walk to the store to get a few things .  Feeling a bit better now.  Hr still hasn't called, house still a mess, but my perception has shifted. 

I've seen a lot of newbies around these parts lately.   And welcome.   Perception changes, throughout the day.   It was only after I stopped trying to quit drinking that I was able to quit.    

I know only this,  I haven't drank yet today and well abstain for the evening.   Tomorrow?  Who knows...  I will reevaluate then.

I’m a 31 year old man who has been wasting their life, their short and precious life, being an alcoholic. What a sad legacy. I’ve gotten (back) into serious binges followed by 24 plus hours in bed, not eating, maybe getting a day or two of sobriety in and then ramping back up to the aforementioned situation. Days, literal days just wasted. Being wasted and wasting away in bed. 

How fucking depressing is that? 

I recently had surgery and sobered up for ten days, which is the longest I’ve gone in probably a year. But then the frustration of not getting immediate results, or any “results” kicked in and I was back to drinking a six pack plus in a day. Now I’m slowing my recovery down, I know, and putting my results in jeopardy, I know and am worried about. Add some anxiety and shame, and I’m even more in the bottle. 

Not being able to work or exercise has me bored and depressed. Staying in bed is my usual MO when I’m depressed, being ragingly hungover is an additional excuse. I have no outlet currently. I can’t do much. And what I can do I scoff at, and then wait until it’s a decently socially acceptable time to drink. And then I go all out. 

It’s been a month since surgery. A whole month of no work that I could have been doing something fun or productive. I could have learned something new. I could have cleaned the house. I could have organized my abode. I could have read something intellectual. I could have coloured. I could have thought about my future, a hopeful future...

But no, I drank. And I won’t get those hours and days back. I’ve scared my parents, hurt a relationship, ignored others, and just been a selfish useless person. I’m so mad at myself. And I’m so sad. And both, ironically, make me want to drink more. Life’s already fucked, why not fuck it some more. What’s the point? 

I’m defeated SD. I’m depressed. I’m angry. I’m sad. I’m mad. I’m guilty. I’m ashamed. I’m just lost.",12

Wife left, grades were far from good, my health was shit, and the only thing that would get me out of my house except exams was my daily trip to the liquor store. A year ago, I was standing outside in front of my house. I left my family's Christmas dinner early so I could make it to the liquor store before it closed. I still had 5 minutes - which was plenty of time - but for some reason, I just went inside. 

That first step is how I got to be the person I am today. I got my grades back up and finished school at the top of my class. I lost 10 pounds, gained it back as muscle and am now in the best shape of my life. I started a job in my field with a great team of people, people that encourage me, got me back into reading and working on solo projects outside of work. I have a great relationship with my family now and see them almost every week, something I avoided before since it prevented me from drinking as often as I liked.

I have a few videos that I recorded over the last 2 years or so, and the change in my general appearance, especially the eyes, even after just a couple days of not drinking is astounding. It still hard for me to realize I spent 5 years injecting poison. I hardly remember any of it, outside of big events, which is kinda scary.

To some, a year might not be much. But for me it was some far-fetched goal I spent too long convincing myself was unreachable. And yet here I am. 365 days without drinking. By far the best year of my life. I am looking forward to experiencing what life has to offer me in 2020 and am extremely grateful to my past self for making all this possible.

Somehow, the opposite has happened, I still get social anxiety but the fact I’m not only thinking about getting a drink to “relax” has changed the whole situation for me. I also realised that the first 30 minutes of any social event is just a little weird and awkward. Half an hour in is when people loosen up a bit, and happens to be when your buzz kicks in so it’s easy to see why we fool ourselves into thinking this is the thing that makes it less awkward.

Anyway, I’m now at 6 and a half months sober and feel great. I survived Christmas, a holiday party and will survive New Years sober. And I’ll be a lot better and happier for it.

I feel kind of guilty because I feel like I'm ditching my friends when I had already agreed to plans. They're supportive of me and not mad at all, it's just my irrational anxiety brain trying to convince me I'm an asshole, which is not true.

I kind of announced my intent not to drink right off the bat each time I arrived at a gathering. First offering of alcohol, taking off my coat, I said firmly and kind of loudly (ha), ""I haven't been drinking lately... feeling my age/extra sensitive/just doesn't agree with me"" etc. Stated out loud a bunch of times that I wasn't going to drink. Then I'd put it out there and set the stage for myself so I wouldn't be tempted to go back on my word as everyone had just heard me emphatically state I wasn't going to be drinking and it would have felt weird not to stick to that.

Helped myself to extra tasty non-alcohol things. Looked for cheeses I hadn't tried, ""allowed"" myself a second or third dessert, looked for flavors of seltzer I'd never had... actively sought out plates of other delicious things in other rooms any time I felt like maybe I needed ""just half a glass.""

Hung out with the kids or dogs at any gathering I went to. Starting to feel the pull of ""just one, maybe,"" I'd wrangle a group of kids and go outside to play yard games, or ask who wanted to go for a short walk. If the host had dogs, I offered to take the dogs for a walk with anyone else who wanted to join us. Just the nice healthy jolt of chilly fresh air and exercise was enough to reset the alcohol temptation.

Since it's expensive to replace them, and we are a technology company with cloud-based software, they decided that we are all now remote. I just got back to work to discover this today.   


The thing is, I'm scared about working from home.

Now I'm at home all day with only my cat and dog to keep an eye on me. My drinking has always been on the heavy-but-manageable side with occasional bad days.

Dinner is around 5 but come as early as you want to hang out and stay overnight if you want. We had 3 people fly in from 9hrs away, 4 people drove 4hrs and the rest were local. A lot of family spent money, took days off work and traveled to come for Christmas. 

It was a great time until dinner was almost ready at 445pm and my dad and step mom hadn't arrived yet. I txt them and they said they are just leaving work and will be here for 630pm. Dinner was ready at 5, so we ate without them and then after dinner everyone was ready for the family gift exchange and they were tired and wanting to leave soon. My dad and step mom still hadn't arrived. So I called them at 615 and they had just left their house, they asked 20 people to wait for them to play the game. We did and they didnt arrive until almost 7pm. 

I was extremely disappointed in my father and step mom showing up 2hrs late to family Christmas dinner. I know they work Saturdays, but they had a months notice and they RSVPd they were coming and looking forward to it. 

I had people fly in, drive for hours and my own father and step mom cant make me a priority and arrange to leave an hour or two early from work and be at my house for dinner time. Then I ask my sister if she spoke to them about why they were late and apparently my step mom went off on a rant about me to the point my dad had to tell her 2 different times to stop saying such bad things about me.

I'm newly sober and full of anxiety and depression and so many new thoughts and feelings.

Right now I want to kick them out of my life. I want to never speak to them again and pretend they dont exist. I want to ignore any future phone calls, don't reply to any txts and if they happen to show up, not answer the door. I dont want them in my life.

He and his wife had kids and they needed a bigger house, so they had to move. He might look back fondly on that smaller house, but would he move back there? Of course not -- it doesn't fit his current life.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately, since during the holidays I go back to my parents' house and sleep in my old room. And get reminded of past holidays when I was drinking. How fun it could be to get tipsy with my siblings and come up with silly contests, or how solemn we were when we toasted to memories of my grandfather when he passed. (The fact that Gramps was an alcoholic and kind of an asshole somehow did not ruin the moment. Or even make it ironic.)

It can be hard to push past those feelings of nostalgia, to remember that there are REALLY GOOD reasons why I gave up drinking. But I made it through this Christmas by reminding myself that ""I don't live there anymore"", and I meant it both literally and figuratively. I'm no longer the person who hung up those posters in my childhood bedroom, and I'm no longer the person who drinks and gets angry and says stupid things. The person I wanted to become couldn't fit in those houses (my parent's house and alcohol's house), so I moved out.

Moving back in with my parents would mean giving up my career, marriage, pets, and friends. Taking up drinking again would mean giving up my peace of mind, my lower levels of anxiety, my hangover-free mornings, and my new healthier eating habits. I don't want to move back in with my parents or with alcohol.

**To any of you who are thinking about alcohol with nostalgia, just remember: You moved out of alcohol's house for a reason. There are things you would have to give up in your life to move back in.**

**You don't live there anymore.**

Getting together with her is very triggering as every time we've spend time together, it always included binging alcohol.

More recently when I invited her over to my house, I told her I wouldn't be serving alcohol as I'm newly sober and it was a sensitivity I had to avoid. She said she completely understood and brought over wine for herself. I understand that I'm responsible for myself and I have no right to ask someone not to drink, but it feels a little insensitive.

I've been pushing off getting together with most of my friends since, given past experiences, alcohol is always assumed to be involved. 

I don't want to be a shitty friend and not be present for my friends, but I just don't think I'm in the right space to be around them and around alcohol and maintain my sobriety (for now).

Have you had an experience similar to this? How have you handled it?",3

Yesterday my wife confronted me and said I have to stop or she is leaving with the kids. So I am one day in. I have appointments set up with a therapist and am thinking about AA or other routes. 

I have to stop. I want to stop. But I keep sliding back. My family is the most important thing in my life and losing them would be losing everything, for nothing.

The longest I've ever made it was six weeks. I treated it like a video game or table top game - sobriety seemed like a quest of epic proportions, so I should have a treasure waiting at the end. A hiking trip in the Blue Ridge Mountains, complete with staying at a hostel atop a mountain, was my reward. It worked - I stayed sober because I was committed to going on this bucket list trip with my best friend.

The trip was absolutely epic. I left my hiking shoes at home and didn't realize it until 4+ hours into the drive north. The first restaurant we ate at for dinner had the best damn bangers and mash I've ever had, in the most unlikely place of a tiny mountain town. We took the silliest pics when hiking and I still need to print the damn things to hang them. The sunrise over the mountains made me cry. We sat next to a roaring fire, reading and knitting, for a whole gloriously quiet day, surrounded by windows, praying for a little snow (we live too far south to see snow regularly and both miss it). I hiked five miles out of the mountains barefoot because it was more comfortable than my replacement hiking shoes, which had chewed up my feet on the way in.

Then ... I had a drink to celebrate. ""OP Makes An Obvious Mistake, for $500, Alex?"" Back to drinking daily in no time. Whoops. The only silver lining here is that I was drinking way less than before, but I still wasn't happy with the arrangement.

Anyway, here I am again, ready to do this. New goal: Six months sober. I've stocked up on some rare favorites (Clearly Canadian and Twiglets, both are hard to find around here) to help get me through the first week. I bought one of those Soda Stream machines, as sparkling water has always been a huge help. Got a hoard of herbal teas for a new nighttime routine. I've already started going to the gym again, because working out + feeding myself and cats + daily chores can easily fill up my whole evening, leaving no time to think about the drink. I uninstalled all the video games I usually play while drinking and installed a few new ones to break that association.

Now I just have to figure out what sort of ""treasure"" will be as motivating as my Appalachian trip. I was thinking of maybe heading west this time, out to Colorado, Oregon, or maybe Alaska. Maybe something cool like learning to ski, or going rock climbing, or taking a long train trip. Any suggestions?",18
2019-12-27 10:28:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/egcgj5/thank_you/,Thank you!!,"Hello everyone- I just wanted to send a special, specific thank you to everyone who has shared their relapse stories.  I'm so sorry you had to go through them, but they really help me stay on track.  This morning I had a brief thought of, ""I'll be alone for the next few days, it would be easy to sit with a bottle of wine and..."" but I stopped the thought right there.  I immediately went into my mental rolodex of all the relapse stories I've read here, and reminded myself of how bad those ALWAYS end up!  I made a conscious decision to save some of those stories for just such an occasion, and it really, really works for me.  I recommend saving the posts that you think you might need later on for motivation, and read them when you're feeling vulnerable (not ""weak"" as I used to label it- simply vulnerable).  I have a tendency for self-destructive compulsions (unlike everyone else on here HAHAHA) so I'm hyper aware of what I'm doing when I have those intrusive drinking thoughts and I try to label them quickly as such.  So I come on here and read stories of relapse disasters and it changes my mind.  THANK YOU. 

p.s. On another note, the best thing about sobriety so far has been my complete lack of guilt over any other vice that I engage in.  I spent about 3 hours at the dessert table on Christmas (having completely skipped dinner) and have no regrets.  Just a few years ago I would have spiraled into a ""how much I suck"" self-pity inner monologue.  But now I'm just like ""oh well, that was fun! At least I didn't drink!"" This approach has helped me enormously, and ironically keeps me from indulging in the dessert table very often.  My theory is that somewhere inside me, I liked giving myself the ""how much I suck"" speech so when I took that away, it took away the desire for the sugar.",14

i want to say something that might have rung a bell. 


if i had a 24 hour chip for every time i tried, over the last 15 years, i could fill up a storage locker with them. there wasn't a real sign which one was gonna stick until the next day. so everyone one of those was a shot worth taking. 

it's been a trip. i've grown. i've suffered. i'm much happier.,but also had some huge lows. but they were somehow less desperate. the stuff underneath my lifetime of substance abuse is still there, and still demands attention. 

i don't struggle, i never miss it. i found that rebellion was the right mode for me. i rebel against the need to have oblivion. to need a thing to live. to give one more shred of myself to something that i have seen causes so much suffering, to fail to get stronger as a person. i rebel at continuing to punish myself, and chasing escape. getting fucked up isn't rebellion at anything. once i got this whole picture put together, sober wasn't a struggle, it was just who i was. channelling a little punk rock in my attitude towards quitting helped me. 

i'm not sure even now i can fully appreciate how much drinking took from me as a person, but it feels right to be headed the other way, under my own power. stopdrinking, and especially the IRC channel, has been basically my only resource. i am just now getting involved in real world recovery stuff, where i hope i can be of service, and grow. 

i used to be very judgy about peoples flair. under 50, meh, you are just like me, and i'm an idiot. over 200 days? you are like some kind of deity and i don't understand you. 730 days? impossible. you might as well be a monk. days aren't a great measure for where we are with this, just a convenient one. 


one of the biggest obstacles to getting sober for me was i couldn't get the fuck over myself. everything seemed so special, so particular, so me. it wasn't. its a simple chemical with predictable effects, even when it happens in each of our unique circumstances. that's why community works, that's why the opposite of addiction is connection. the lie is that we are special. the truth is that we are all in this same world together, with the same kinds of bodies, and the same kinds of stuff around us, and i have found that the things that have made life ok, have been things that other people put work into for others, and i think that is good work for me to look for, and good work for me to appreciate in others. this sub is a huge one, and i am deeply grateful to every one who posts and lurks here.",77

I can avoid the single place I drink like this entirely, that means cutting off some friends completely, I know the price, just looking for anecdotes from people who've been there and done it.

Also, any advice for helping to remove the guilt and depression after such nights? I know it disappears within a few days but it's like a private hell during this time.

I'm at 172 days sober and I absolutely hate going to parties, get together, dinners whatever. 

I get crazy anxiety and just want to leave the entire time. I hate saying no to drinks sometimes 20 times to the same person, I hate people asking why I dont want a drink to the point I fake drinking by putting Coke and ice in short glasses. 

Having to lie, faking having drinks and generally feeling like I cant be honest puts me into a depression and makes me feel like a broken person. I've told some of my friends/family about why I dont drink but really dont want to advertise it to groups of people.

In regular day to day life that doesnt revolve around drinking I'm so much happier and productive but these interactions at these social events put me into a depression for days. I guess I'm looking for advice on how to handle these social interactions and gatherings.

I've suffered with alcoholism for several years with dry spells lasting up to 7-8months. I'm in my early 20s, so I don't know many people my age going through the same struggle.


Anyway. I can fall into quite black and white thinking- especially with my alcoholism- that in the past has caused me more trouble than worth. I'd try to swear off alcohol for a month, a year, my life, and after any relapse tell myself I'd already ruined it so why try again? I may as well drink casually if I've already thrown away my sober time.


This year I'm trying something different. How far can I get into 2020 before I drink? And after that, how long can I stay back on track for the remainder of the year? 2 months? Six? We will see, but it's better than nothing. I thought sharing here might help some of us, because a lot of us seem to come from similar places and can struggle with being too hard on ourselves. So, I encourage anyone to (as well as the 24hour method) try it out. Making yourself an ongoing challenge rather than a win or fail situation makes it a little harder to repeatedly self sabotage.

I called them, and clarified their return policy - one week, with original receipt. Failed Monday, failed again on Tuesday, despite driving right by both days...but yesterday I got up the gumption to get it done. I needed to return the bottles, for my own personal reward, and responsibility. Well, I did it.

It's nearly all gone).

Every day the drinking has started early (morning usually) straight through to the early hours all in the name of Christmad celebration. By the time I've been heading to bed around midnight everyone is smashed.

We've had a lot of board games with us so that has kept it fun for me although as the evening has drawn on they've become less coherent and less capable of keeping up with the rules/gameplay etc so that's when it's got boring and off to bed I go.

It's been an enormous challenge. Even my husband, who claims to be supportive of my non-drinking, has asked me every day pretty much ""will you be drinking today?""

I get the impression they all think I'm less fun than I used to be but honestly they're all a LOT less fun than I thought they were too.

So it's the last full day today. I'm up early, I've cleaned up after the late night drinking and made myself a delicious coffee with my new aeropress (highly recommended).  We were meant to go for a walk this morning but there's no sign of life yet so that probably wont happen which is pretty annoying tbh. I'm tired and I want to go home.

One more day to get through. IWNDWYT",6

I have lots and lots of shame. Public spectacles, obsessive drinking, throwing money around. Missing my flight. Running around off my face. Acting unprofessional. Gross.

My friends suspect this accident was because of drinking. I can’t even call on them to help me because I have used up so many favours and/or argued with them.

The lowlight of this whole bender was getting defensive with my friend’s mom who is a pastor’s  wife and I ADORE. 

This is the second big injury I have this year from drinking. I don’t even know what I am going to say to work. So so so bad. And I think the only thing that will help me heal is to rest my leg.


Fuckkkkk. I was doing so well. I didn’t even have one craving this time. I had no chance with alcohol or smoking once sleeping pills came into the mix though.

I feel like dying thinking about my actions and I know withdrawals haven’t even started properly yet.


I am going to write out what I go through this time though so I can come back and look at it.


I’m sorry if I’m making a nuisance of myself today. It is therapeutic to write it out. If anyone reading this has any insights please send me a shout out.

I went to an AA meeting it was weird to call myself an alcoholic. It didn’t feel like I was one but I’m tired of alcohol. Has anyone been able to quit from just a mediocre place?

But it’s complicated.","I’ve been putting off doing this. Don’t want to tell anyone because maybe I’ll want to enjoy a beer or two down the road (but if we’re being honest it’s the shame). But it’s time to cut this shit out. However, things are complicated.

For context, I’ve been drinking regularly and steadily (I’m guessing 15-20ish a day, varied, mostly whiskey and beer, throughout the day). About a month ago I chilled on the drinks and went through my first real couple of withdrawal days. Then 2(ish) weeks ago, it happened again. That’s when I researched and learned about “kindling” and the dangers of withdrawals. I need to stop this cycle. Spent the last few days of this holiday season literally drinking to stave off the now-encroaching third round of withdrawals and I’m terrified. Because this shit is complicated.

I’m a new dad. Our (super adorable) boy is 12 weeks yesterday. We can’t afford any amount of childcare, and only have one “grandma” in the picture to help out every now and then. So she works morning shifts, I work night shifts (at a restaurant where I serve and, you guessed it, bartend).

I can’t take time off from baby/work to do some sort of in-patient detox (paying for that is also a joke). I can’t leave my job because it pays well and also accommodates my needy schedule. I can’t tell my partner or my family because I don’t want to QUIT drinking (maybe I should) I want to not drink so much and I don’t want them to think less of me.

I don’t know what to do. All day today I’ve felt the weird, early signs of withdrawals, tried to nap but could only manage that weird half-sleep. Whole body is tingly and hot. I work for the next few nights, and I’m up with baby every morning because mom does mornings.

I need to figure this out. Any tips or tricks for coming down on the DL would be hugely appreciated.

Side note here’s my insanely cute son that is the reason I want to figure this out: https://i.imgur.com/Au9r7rF.jpg",4

I started drinking in high school and I’ve  been a pretty heavy drinker for most of my twenties. I didn’t drink everyday but I would go out to the bars at least 3-5 nights a week. The problem I’ve always had was not being able to control how much I drink once I started drinking. I can’t count how many times I’ve woken up with a horrible hangover and no memory of how I got home or what I did the night before. I would lose my phone, credit card, send super embarrassing text to ex boyfriends, hook up with people I didn’t mean to and have no idea where I left my car. My friends would tell me stories about how drunk I was the night before. I felt so much guilt and anxiety all of the time. It was like I was living in a nightmare. 

About six months ago I finally decided I needed to quit. I stuck with it for a while but recently I started slipping up. I convinced myself that maybe I could be a normal drinker. It started with a few drinks here and there but pretty soon I was back to blacking out and embarrassing myself again. 

I haven’t drank in 10 days and I plan on sticking with it this time. I really love who I am when I’m sober, I’m a much happier and healthier person. I’m just having a hard time forgiving myself for the stuff I’ve done and said when drunk. I need advice for how to move past this and also how to form a better plan so I don’t end up going back to my old habits.",20

(TL; DR I'm an idiot, but still sober! 😁👍)","A coworker asked me to pick up a bottle of wine for her at the end of my shift since the store would be closed when she got off work.  This liquor store is the one I always went to. I thought I would be fine since I'm normally fine passing wine at the grocery store.

I was not fine.

I made the purchase for her, but not without wanting to get something for myself. The store was a trigger that I didn't expect (even though it is obvious in hind sight)

I learned this: first, old watering holes and liquor stores I frequented will trigger me, so I cannot go in them. Second, I beat it, (so,yay? I guess?) but it is not a situation I ever need to be in again. I have no desire to ""test"" myself. That just seems like a great way to relapse. I also learned that despite that being incredibly stupid thing to do,  I stayed sober and will not be hung over or resetting my sober date tomorrow. However, a lesson was learned, to be sure. I don't need any self-inflicted close calls. Life is hard enough as it is.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!


Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!


I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.


It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!


This pledge is a statement of intent.


Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!


What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.


What this is:


A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.


What this isn’t:


A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.


This post goes up at:


US—Night/Early Morning


Europe—Morning


Asia and Australia—Evening/Night


A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.


Hosting the check in, sorting by new on the main page and replying to posts, answering questions and sharing my story are all ways I have found to not only stay sober but also remove the mental obsession of alcohol from my life.

In the beginning of the famous 12 step program one of the founders realized that in order for *him* to stay sober he needed to go try and help someone else. Before the big book, the 12 steps, meetings and sponsors and medallions, there was just one alcoholic looking for another alcoholic to help.

Almost 85 years later I believe this subreddit community perpetuates that successful concept. Your stories, experiences, failures and hopeful beginnings all help me and countless others stay sober.

If you want to host the checkin, all you need is 30 days sober and the ability to copy and paste a template :) let me know if you're interested!

Happy Friday! I won't drink with you today!",70

I was able to get into an unemployment training program where I collected my unemployment for going to school to finish my bachelor of science degree in geography, which I did last week.

Unfortunately, now that I'm finished, my unemployment is gone abruptly and I need to find work immediately.

Also, I really want to stop drinking again because I'm exhausted and it's not helping my motivation.

So I've set a date for January 1, which is how I quit smoking 15 years ago.

I've been kind of isolated, so I thought it would help to join this community and get some good feedback from other people who've decided to stop drinking.

Recently I put together a string of sober weeks, and *this time* also hit the gym, ate really well, made myself go to bed at a natural hour.  And although this isn't rocket science - I was amazed! I had days, where I felt....  Happy!  In a good mood.  Driving down the road, cranking tunes, not wallowing in my self created valley of darkness.  

And it hit me.  Happiness isn't a state, it isn't an issue of luck, it's a result.  A result of making good decisions.  Like losing weight is a result of burning more calories than you take in.  Like getting fit is a result of exercising.  So too happiness is a result.  And I can chase happiness, and better yet - I. Can. Be. Happy. Again! 

So my journey begins!  Not only must I stay sober, I also must chase that feeling being fit creates within me. Chase that pride I can feel again when I look in the mirror and no longer see that big fat fucking gut that I put on.  Chase that fulfilled feeling I get when my house is all organized and clean.  

It's a journey, and there will be bumps.  I'm begging *present me* to stop screwing over *future me*.

&#x200B;

It's the day after Christmas. Life is good. So good. My life doesn't feel hollow or empty. I don't wake up anxious or passively suicidal. I smile for real and I no longer look at my day as a begrudging task. I'm actually interested in things to come. I'm not trying to force my life, my emotions, and recovery into a box or to look and feel the way I think it ""should"" - and sometimes it is shit. Doesn't mean I have to be stuck with and eat that shit sandwich, so I don't. I made the decision early on that I was going to value my life and genuinely liking how I live above all else - relationships, jobs, status, whatever.

I ended up leaving the guy mentioned in that post for good. I also went broke and had to move again. I met someone shortly after, and he's wonderful and so interested in life and supportive. I have a career now. I have no credit card debt anymore, I have savings, my student loan is being paid off steadily and easily. I don't have a 6 pack by any means but I've lost weight and gotten fitter (I can do 25 pushups in a row :D)

I've rebuilt relationships with old friends (and made genuine connections with new ones) and family. I call my immediate family multiple times a week now,, before they were lucky to hear from me once a month. My mom's voice isnt scared or insecure when we talk anymore - she isnt afraid I'm going to cut her off or disappear (I'm working on guilt around this.) I thought I knew how to communicate, turns out I was barely scraping it. I've gone from being someone who jokes about how I hate everyone (and myself) and being filled with bitterness and jealousy to being genuinely interested in people from all walks and eager to listen. I learned to stand up for myself and set boundaries - it keeps getting easier.

Probably the best thing - I like my life. I'm having some freaking fun, real fun, real enjoyment. I'm not just going from drink to drink hoping that somewhere along the line I'll catch a wave of euphoria and then drink my bank account away chasing it again. My life is no longer planned out around alcohol. I have real hobbies now and I follow those on a whim - turns out I have real talent and interests.

It would be easy to do because you just want some relief from the shit storm. 

I “only” (those quotes are so you know I’m not being judge-y about other people’s levels of consumption) drank about a 1/2 bottle of wine a night, about 5/6 nights a week. Out on the town, it could be more. So I’m really surprised how much this PAWS crap is hitting me.

I’m sick of my own excuses for drinking - I’ve justified my actions by telling myself that because i don’t drink every day, I don’t have a problem.  The truth is that every time I do drink, I drink everything I can get my hands on. I drink in search of numbness and an excuse to turn off the worry. I’ve done this for years, and alcohol has become such a huge, awful part of my life.

Admittedly I had stayed up super late and only got three hours sleep, but still. I remember feeling shaky, wobbly, my blood sugar tanking, huge anxiety, and dread at the upcoming hangover. I almost posted here, but one of the rules is don't post while drunk. So I didn't, and I waited, and now my resolve to quit drinking is wavering because now I feel fine. I actually got out without too many repercussions, I managed to sleep through the worst of it, but that isn't a reason to say this is okay. It's not okay, and I want a better life. I want to quit. And I'm asking very humbly, for your help.

I don't drink every day, I'm a binge drinker. Usually once a weekend or every other weekend, but usually every Friday night. My problem is not drinking every day, but that once I start, I have trouble stopping; I tend to just drink til I pass out. I realized, sitting under a blanket on Christmas Day feeling my body temperature fluctuate wildly because hangover, wondering if I could eat anything without barfing, that I'm doing it because I'm trying to hide from my life.

I'm in a job I low-key hate, no real prospects, and the dream I wanted I had to give up for... long reasons I won't get into here. Giving up that dream career meant giving up a piece of my identity, too, but I had been failing at realizing that dream for too many years and eventually it became too painful, so I decided to make a healthy change and become employed, instead of self-employed. And for a time, that worked. Felt like I was getting some rewards for my hard work and being useful. But now I'm ultra-sensitive to failure and it's a problem. I'm afraid to pick up any creative pursuits any more because I can't stomach the thought of more failure. My boss instigated a new proof-reader at work and I'm routinely biting her head off because she's pulling me up for bullshit reasons, so I feel like a failure all day at a job I thought I was excelling at, and I'm right on the verge of getting written up for it. I have creative ideas, but I let them stay ideas and daydreams and don't touch them, because if I make them real, I risk failure again. And I can't stand the idea. It fucking terrifies me.

So I don't have any hobbies any more, I'm miserable at work, I don't create anything, haven't picked up a paintbrush in more than three years (despite being a professional illustrator for a decade), don't knit, don't even video game because I just can't. What I do instead is drink. Because when I'm drunk I don't think about failure, I just enjoy myself; ideas come easily and the thought of failing is impossible. Of course everything I create or do while drunk is shit, but at the same time I get to disengage from the reality of: I am a failure in my life, I hate my job and it demands too much of me, I have no idea what direction to go in next, I've interviewed but can only get equally shitty jobs, school at nearly 40 is a terrifying prospect to say nothing of what I want to do (no idea), and all the things I knew I wanted, that I feel like I was made for, I had to give up because it was making me depressed because fucking FAILURE.

I can't go on like this. I'm fucking miserable. I think step one is stop drinking, because then I can address... maybe one or two of the other things in my life. Baby steps, but I can't even take step one if I'm busy hiding in a bottle. So I have to take away my unhealthy comfort blanket.

And I'm scared shitless. Tomorrow is Friday night. Please help me be strong, and not drink with you tonight, or tomorrow night, or ever again.",32

Please talk to your doctor about any possible underlying issues.","Please do not rule out the possibility that substance use patterns may be the result of an undiagnosed mental illness or disorder. 

After multiple hospitalizations, and a long history of on/off substance use issues, I finally received a bipolar diagnosis this summer. After starting treatment my desire to drink basically disappeared. After 15 years struggling with substance use issues, this was a VERY strange feeling. 

Looking back, the pattern of self-medication/poor mania-induced choices is glaringly obvious, but at the time I had no idea, nor was the possibility ever raised by any medical professional. And I bumped into a lot....

Although substance abuse issues will always be treated before anyone attempts to identify any possible mental health issues, this catch 22 situation can be mitigated a bit.

Raise the possibility with a medical professional. Look back at your own history or patterns. Ask someone you are comfortable with who is aware of your issues if they have seen any patterns you may have missed. Research a lot, but be careful of self-diagnosing. Write things down, track your moods and patterns and take these with you to any appointments. It's surprising how much we can overlook.

You really do have to work to get people to listen to you. Advocating for yourself is hard, especially when you're in a dark place and you're exhausted from life in general, but you are still your best asset. In the end it was me who finally suggested the bipolar diagnosis to my psych. 

It wasn't necessarily his fault for overlooking it. I realised I hadn't been fully open, or even aware of, all of my symptoms. How could I, I hadn't been actively trying to track them. Unfortunately, (or very fortunately!) other people still cannot see inside our heads, so the more info you can provide the better.",14

For nearly two decades, my job, my vocation and a huge part of my self-identity was being a professional brewer. It is hard to overstate how much of a role beer played in the better part of my adult life. From job interviews conducted over a pint, to the daily shift beers, to the countless festivals, tastings and trade events, beer is consumed and consumed prodigiously. After twenty years in the biz, I was a professional drinker, as much as I was a professional brewer.

By the end of my time at the last brewery I worked for, I began to feel like I was teetering on having a very unhealthy relationship with alcohol, with beer making up about 99.5% of my consumption. I could easily drink a couple liters or 8-10 High Lifes in the course of a night. 

I never missed work because I was hungover or still drunk. I've never had a DUI. I think I've blacked out a total of maybe three  times in my life. Like I said, I was a professional drinker! But man, my system just started feeling tired. I felt run down and gross, bloated and mentally shot. Over the past several years, I would recharge with a r/dryjanuary, vow to make long-term changes, and yet I'd be right back to my old habits within weeks. 

January 2019 marked a turning point for me. I finally left the industry at the end of 2017, spent a LONG, brutal year-and-change in career change mode. When this year started, I started my usual Dry January and decided to make it a Dry 100. Throughout, I kept a journal and loved the physical and mental changes I experienced. I made it through snowstorms, went to sporting events and hung out with friends who were drinking. I learned a ton about myself and vowed that when my 100 days were up, I would keep my drinking on a very short leash.

I did. In early September, I decided it was time. 

Reading countless posts here, I knew being a non-drinker would affect my friendships, especially with my old colleagues and drinking buddies. My phone doesn't ring as much on Fridays. But, I'm reading more. I've developed new hobbies, I've lost weight and I made it through the holidays stone cold sober for the first time in as long as I can remember.

I absolutely love this new chapter and this clean slate that awaits me. And, while I know I'm tooting my own horn, it's mainly a thank you to all of you, whose stories I've been reading for a couple years. You gave me confidence that I was doing the right thing and that this ""no drinking"" thing can be done. You have helped me anticipate the pitfalls and have reminded me what it's like to deal with the disappointment of falling and the triumph of getting back up again. 

So, thank you all and Happy 2020!

3 months ago I was homeless and living in the domestic violence shelter, drinking a 5th of vodka a day. 

3 months ago I had no job, and no prospects for one. I had just lost my spot in a competitive program to bridge from my LPN to RN because I couldn't get my shit together enough to meet basic deadlines. 

3 months ago I was facing the agonizing choice of surrendering my cats because I had nowhere for them to go and no way to afford their care. This would have likely been a death sentence for my one cat with special needs. I have been separated from them both since July. 

3 months ago my daughter wouldn't even take my calls and I was worried I was on the verge of losing her forever. 

3 months ago my life was hopeless. An endless cycle of drinking to numb myself from the emotional pain- of a traumatic childhood, and 7 years with a violent narcissistic abuser who made me feel worthless and broken, and convinced me I could never survive without him. And 3 months ago it seemed like maybe he was right- after I left him my life went to shambles. I literally lost everything, had nothing and no one. Alcohol was the only friend and comfort I had left and I clung on to it for dear life.

My life today is so much different

 I don't wake up with shakes, nausea, mental fog or splitting headaches.

I don't wake up with crippling anxiety, frantically trying to remember what I did or said the night before, checking my phone to make sure I didn't send any drunk texts or make any embarrassing Facebook posts. 

I wake up, take a shower, brush my teeth, take my meds and go to work. So simple and boring, right? But for me it feels monumental. I can exist without the need for constant distractions and crutches. I can live like a normal person and practice self care.

 I don't stare at the clock waiting for my shift to end so I can chug down poison anymore. I don't have to think of excuses to run to the store, or hide bottles in my purse, or plan my life around alcohol period. 

I don't need alcohol to escape from my life anymore because I'm actually happy with the life I created- I don't want to be anywhere but here, in the moment. I feel safe in my own home now. I don't have to walk on eggshells. And I don't have to drink to make those eggshells feel softer beneath my feet. 

Today I enrolled in school, and will be taking this forced gap year to work on my bachelors degree courses. I have a job I love. I have friends I've met in my recovery and through the fellowship of AA and they are the kind of friendships I never thought I could have- honest, supportive, open and fun! I'm repairing the relationships I hurt in my active addiction- with my friends, my family, and most of all my amazing soon to be 13 year old daughter who inspires and motivates me to keep going, and to become the kind of parent she needs and deserves. 

And today after 6 months of being homeless, staying in shelters, renting rooms and crashing on couches, I picked up the keys to my new apartment and moved in. Sooner than expected, and coincidentally at exactly 90 days sober. A late Chrismas present, and the best one I could have ever asked for. 

I have no furniture other than a leaking air mattress. The only food I have is leftover Chinese takeout. But I have never felt so rich in my life. I'm filled with so much gratitude and hope just knowing I have a place to call my own. Finally. 

My cats were just brought to me by the lovely rescue group who cared for them when I wasn't able to. My special needs baby was depressed and needs some TLC, which I'm so grateful to be able to give him! He got a bath, which he didn't like very much, but I was able to get the matts out of his fur and he is now cuddling with his brother after being separated for months as a bonded pair. It's bringing me so much joy to see them together again, up to their old antics and exploring their new home.


My daughter is out of state with her dad/my family for the holidays, and when I pick her up next week I'm going to surprise her- she thought we were months away from being reunited, I can't wait to see her reaction when I tell her she's coming home with mom! 

Slowly but surely I am getting back everything I lost. Things aren't perfect and it has NOT been easy, but nothing that is truly worth it is. And my worst day sober is still a million times better than my best day as a drunk.

I have my LIFE back.

I have my SANITY back.

I have NINETY MOTHERFUCKING DAYS SOBER YOU GUYS! 

I will most definately NOT be drinking with you all today! 

Obligatory cat tax- Remy and Lucky, reunited at last!

Hope you're all enjoying a clear headed sober Christmas. I am too, but I'm still a bit glum. Yesterday I got a Facebook memory of a Facebook post I made two years ago when my ex got me a present for Christmas. She broke up with me back in May and she has me blocked on everything but for some reason I was able to see the comment she put on the post two years ago. It also included her updated profile picture with her new boyfriend and it hit me like a brick wall.

I still massively care for this woman and I suppose I'm just a bit shocked by it so I said I would vent here.

My drinking is at the worst that it's ever been and I'm fully aware that I have a problem. I've been an alcoholic since I was 17, making this my 12th year with this disease. The longest I've ever been without booze was 2 weeks about 9 years ago. I'm functional. I have a good job, social circle, and a healthy family life. I'm not problematic when I drink. I don't start fights or create drama. I don't typically pass out or throw up. I think this is one of the reasons that I always justify not making any attempts to stop drinking. I drink anywhere from a half bottle to a bottle and a half of red wine each night. Good nights for me are half bottle, typical nights are one bottle, bad nights are 1 1/2 bottles.  
  
But I'm so tired of feeling hungover every single morning. I'm tired of feeling unmotivated. I'm tired of telling myself that I'm not going to drink tonight and then getting off work and heading to the store to buy wine. I want my mental clarity and my health back. I always tell myself I want to set small goals such as not drinking for a week, or maybe two, but I *never* commit to them. They're simply just thoughts. I blacked out the last two nights in a row and I'm going to commit to my first goal.  
  
I'm not going to drink for two weeks. Today is day 1. I already know that it's going to be *extremely* hard for me, but I'm going to do it. I've never got this far along in the processes. I always make up an excuse as to why I can't commit to a certain amount of time, but not this time. Any tips to help with triggers and staying off the bottle are greatly appreciated. Sorry if this was an incoherent ramble, but this community seems so supportive and I wanted to share here.",19

The only way I can liken it is Luke skywalker seeing his own face in Darth Vader's mask in TESB.  And the worst part is I am having trouble feeling anything but pain.

I thought I was handling it, I thought I was in control, I thought I could figure it out on my own. Now I see that it was in control and controlling everything in my life. Being in my mid 30's I realized that I haven't had a period of time longer than 30 days where I didn't have at least a drink ever since my college days. That thought alone was a bit of a shocker to me and I wondered how my body was fairing.

With the support from my wife I started out on the journey at the beginning of October to go 60 days without a drink. I haven't felt that good and motivated in a very long time. There were plenty of cravings and thoughts of cutting to just 30 days and that I would be OK. However I just kept pushing through. 

Then on day 58 was Thanksgiving and I ended up having a few drinks. I had been proud that I made it that far and with family I wanted to enjoy and have fun. I figured I can handle it now and I've made it this far. That was not the case.

So here I am, an anxious mess and feeling incredibly down, disgusted, and disappointed in myself at the past 30 days. So here's Day 1 again...",6

Me: thank you, but I don't drink anymore. 

Mother in law: husband, I told you she quit drinking.

FIL: I know, but I wanted to see if she really quit drinking or if that's just something she's telling people.


I wish I could say I was shocked by his cruel ""test"", but unfortunately FIL is a Raging alcoholic who's said cruel shit to me numerous times, just usually when no one else is around to hear it.

And today I am super cold. Changing just like my moods. It’s like all the progress I made on working through my insecurities, hurt and anxieties was eliminated. So in addition to physical symptoms, I feel horrendous about myself. The happiness I feel about having an immensely supportive SO is drowned out by a feeling of dread that he secretly wishes I was his ex, that he wants to leave me, that I should never get too comfortable etc. I thought I had spent the past few months intensely building up the tools to deal with traumas when they come, and to be fair I did a lot, but I realize now I was just too drunk to feel anything. 
The good news is that I slept. It was mostly resigning myself to a nightmare, waking up, staying awake for a while, resigning myself to another nightmare, so on and so forth. 
I had a “marginal/needs improvement” performance evaluation today at work. That nearly broke me too. 
Oh and of course since it’s New Years everyone wants to make plans to go to bars. Ever notice how alcohol is EVERYWHERE? If I was a conspiracy theorist, I would argue it was a plan created by the government to keep the population passive.

""I bet I can handle a social drink here and there.""  ""Maybe I'll only sip on my drink.""  For 5 years, I made it through every type of situation that would normally provoke relapse - being alone, frustrated with work, marriage problems, etc.  Sailed through it all.  But back in September, I gave in to the lies addiction had been whispering.  For a little over 3 months, I've binged every night if I didn't have work the next day.  Sometimes I'd sneak a few drinks in on work nights.  

Last night, super drunk, I woke up my wife because I couldn't find the bathroom...  Thankfully, she was incredibly kind.  She could have lost her temper.  I promised her this time would be different.  All the promises...  Last night was a blinding example of my addiction.  She even took a video of my stupor.

Didn’t I earn this? This is a huge life milestone and I deserve to celebrate! It’s been almost a whole year, surely I’d be ok with some bubbly. Why are I robbing myself of this experience? Come onn.

But I refuse to see alcohol as a reward I’m depriving myself of. It never was that, and I know it won’t feel like that if I cave.

The reward is this beautiful house that I never could dream of owning before. That I have a huge yard for my dog to run in and room to grow vegetables and foster cats and live in peace. This is the reward of sobriety and all the focus, discipline, and joy it brings.

I’m giving the bottle to my parents, who seldom drink, but to whom I owe so much, and I think they will appreciate the gesture.

And I worry about his health (in particular, I know he sleeps horribly, and I'm 99% sure it's the booze). He's gained a bunch of weight and looks ragged. 

I want to have a conversation with him about it, but I'm scared. (Not even totally sure what I'm scared of—rocking the boat, I guess? Making him feel ashamed/embarrassed? His defensive reaction?) I'm also really aware that my own sobriety is brand-new, so I guess I'm worried that I'm projecting or in a pink cloud or something else. He knows I'm sober now, and I guess I hoped he'd just sort of be inspired by me and stop himself, but now I see maybe that was naive.

2019-12-26 12:26:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/efy5m9/how_do_you_do_it/,How do you do it?,"I tend to drink in order to feel good and escape from negative feelings like not feeling loved/intimacy issues, feeling directionless in life, boredom/lack of motivation, and negative perceptions of myself and self-worth. I hate laying awake in bed at night with my own thoughts which is another reason why in the past I have subconsciously chosen to drink.

I think that the negative perceptions of my self-worth are a foundation for my past drinking habits, because if I value myself (& even how my actions impact others), then I am less likely to go into destructive-mode. By valuing myself and others, then I will actually address, work on, and heal the secondary issues of my life like intimacy, self-image, and purpose rather than run to alcohol.

I know that another (possibly the primary) foundation for my drinking is emotion-driven. I know that I need/want to displace this energy somewhere better, or get a handle on my emotions. I believe that I can do this, however I know that doing this won't always make me feel ""good"".

I'm afraid of getting to the place where I forget about what my higher values and purpose are or just not caring about them and myself/the potential to hurt others. How do I remember again that I do care or remember what my higher values and purpose are? I don't think I know what my specific purpose is, but I do know that vaguely it includes others..helping others, being kind & compassionate, helping others see the good that can come out of seemingly bad things...promoting kindness & compassion, emotional healing and emotional responsibility, and for everyone to be the best version of themselves as part of larger communities. And I will be better at helping others that are seeking help once I am better at helping myself.

So I have some questions for this community and feel free to answer any or none of them...: What do you do when you have urges to drink, when they are strong and when they are mild? What are your thoughts? What strategies/systems do you have in place to overcome these feelings? Do you approach it differently depending on the severity of the urge or trigger? What questions or statements do you say to yourself to remind you of what's better for you? How do you emotionally heal or take emotional responsibility and not drink? Why do you care whether you drink or not?

I wasn’t a super heavy drinker, but definitely had a problem. I deluded myself for years thinking I was ok. Looking back the signs were clear, and I realize how much this addiction was tearing my life apart:

Developing a habit of hiding how much I was drinking drove a wedge between my wife and I. Being dishonest about anything allows you to be dishonest about everything.

Waiting for her to go upstairs so I could chug another beer while cleaning the kitchen; getting irritated that she’s wanting to spend time with me and help.

Telling her to relax and watch TV while I make dinner so I could drink while cooking.

Secluding myself in my home office ‘working’ while nursing a secret bottle.

Getting excited for her to leave the house and spend time with her parents so I could stay home and drink.

Skipping out on gatherings but encouraging my wife to go ‘so she could go have fun’ when really I just wanted to stay home and drink.

Making excuses when she wants to be intimate because I’m trying to avoid admitting it’s hard to perform buzzed.

5 days without this numbing agent I’m beginning to realize how horrible it’s been for my marriage and life. My wonderful wife has stood by my side all along and deserves the best I can be - the sober me. I only drank a couple beers per day, but that didn’t mean I wasn’t an alcoholic; didn’t mean I didn’t have a problem; didn’t mean I wasn’t destroying my life. Even now, it’s easy to think that the 1-3 beers / night weren’t that big of a deal and I don’t have to do this permanently, so I’m reminding myself of the major consequences of my addiction.

Yesterday I had a wonderful day with my wife. We spent the whole day together sober. We made meals together, cleaned the house together, played games together, and sat by the fire confiding in each other. For the first time in years we connected in a truly meaningful way, and just enjoyed time together. The reward for sobriety is so great, how could I ever go back?

My work life isn't pleasant and when I get home I love to have a drink - or four. White wine goes really well with spicy food, red wine goes really well with steak, red sauce Italian, etc. Even a shot of Fireball very now and then. I enjoy having a drink in my hand from when I get home to when I go to bed - there's empty glasses by the bed table. 

When I drink I tend not to focus on all the things that stress me out. However, I pay for that by not sleeping well and all the stress comes roaring back in the middle of the night. And my heart is pounding. I know I'm hurting my liver, I'm overweight. Sometimes I can will myself to stop for a night or two but that's it. Then I say, it's not so bad you only live once, etc.

I know this needs to change. Do I just go cold turkey? That seems so absolute. What if I set a goal of only so much during the week so eventually it becomes natural to me? How do I get to either of these goals from where I am? Should I gradually cut back or go the cold turkey route? Any good ideas to just cut down and stick to it?",6

We had an amazing love affair once I fell under its spell.   Booze gave me courage to come out of my shell and more importantly made me forget things I did not want to remember starting at 14 years old.  We had some amazing times together, the laughs, the friends it helped me make, the whirlwind romance. Our time together was magical. Then somewhere along the way things changed.  I needed to remember things in order to grow as a person, the laughs became fewer and I just felt sad and could not figure out why.  My relationships suffered because I put no work into them.  My brother died by suicide last November after years of heavy drinking to cope with his depression.  I drank twice after he died, once I ended up crying in my 17 year old daughters arms, the second time I was sick lying on the bathroom floor.  I finally realized it was not doing me much good anymore.

I woke up last Christmas day and somehow the nickel finally dropped and the spell that was cast so long ago was finally broken. I saw it for what it was, how it took so much away from me, poisoned my relationships and its legacy of destruction throughout my family tree.  I lived a lie for a long time, was not the person I was meant to be and lost touch with my core self.  It's only been a year and it's certainly had its ups and downs but I am happy with the progress I have made this year and look forward to my continued personal growth that not drinking allows me to do.  I wonder where I will be next year at this time in my sober journey.

2019-12-26 11:21:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/efxcbb/starting_over_day_1/,Starting Over - Day 1,"Hi everyone, 

Today I’m starting over. 2 years ago decided to become sober. That lasted about 7-8 months, until my birthday. I had a cabin weekend coming up with some friends that I hadn’t yet told the news too; that I had become sober. In my mind, it was easier to drink on my birthday to “practice” and work on my tolerance, than face my last friend group that wasn’t aware of my choice. That’s how I justified it in my head. That night I didn’t black out, but did have about 8 drinks which is more than a normal person should have. 

Fast forward to that cabin weekend. I ended up passing out from drinking, twice and throwing up one night. That should’ve been enough to prove to myself that the sober life was for me, but instead I’ve continued to drink here and there. Have all drinking sessions ended up in blackout, drinking, or throwing up? No. However, the nights where I’ve kept it to 1-3 drinks can only be counted on 1 hand. Most times I’m bit with the bug to drink and cannot stop. I’ve been essentially waiting for something catastrophic to happen to find another excuse to stop. 

Last night the world didn’t end, but this morning I’ve just woken up and said “I’m done”. It’s not for me. Physically I am not built for alcohol. Whatever it does for some people, it doesn’t for me. I’m powerless under the influence. I cannot control the want to stop. All inhibitions go away, it’s quite unbelievable really. 

Here’s to day 1.",12

I quit to get back on my wife's good side. Unfortunately I had done s much damage over the years, nothing could heal her pain. 
Eventually started drinking again and once again Christmas comes around and I have a few beers. Start an argument with the wife that my whole extended family could hear including my children.

I'm the sort of drinker that by lunchtime at work, i'm having 8 shots before going back. Then every other day after work, drinking until i'm not really there any longer. Maybe a couple days between those moments if I could handle it. My favorite thing to do is sit down and play an mmorpg while drinking a bottle of whiskey. It's really great except most of the time, after an hour or two I have to fall asleep. I love drinking but I was at the point that I was sick everyday and would only remain sober to get over the current ill feelings I was experiencing. 28 days ago, I took a couple weeks off work and managed to stay sober for 10 of them. First 8 or 9 of which I was sick and just laying on the couch. I picked up drinking soda/pop to handle the sugar cravings which I've dropped again for the past 7 days. About every other day I find myself with strong urges to drink again. During those times, my hands tend to shake and they do so a little randomly as well. My hands are shaking as I write this actually - kind of annoying. A positive is that I started seeing this girl and I think it is going well. At the same time, lot of self doubt and wondering when she is going to ditch. Another positive is that I find myself slowly wanting to do more things during the day. Still a terrible employee at work I think, but hopeful that I will improve. I'm eating a lot more so I think my weight has increased which is a problem for me. I don't really exercise at all but it is in the back of my mind to start doing. Not sure what exercise I can do that I'll actually enjoy and stick to. My sleep is much better without alcohol. That is probably my favorite change as I would have some really bad days at work where I couldn't keep my eyes open. Overall, just happy to not be sick all the time anymore. Not sure if I will stay sober forever, but this is a decent vacation.",53

Show me someone who has no drinking problem at all, and I'll show you a person who is probably comfortable in their own skin and has reliable friendships and relationships in their life, as well as work or hobbies that keep them busy.

I have learned that treating and working on issues like depression, anxiety, loneliness, and boredom are a very big part of recovery. 

Some people on here have said things to the effect of: ""I'll focus on my sobriety first, then I'll deal with my depression or anxiety later, because it's too much to deal with all at once.""

In my own experience, the opposite is true. I HAVE to actively work on depression, anxiety and loneliness as part of recovery from alcohol, because often times it's that depression, loneliness, or anxiety that pushes me to drink in the first place. At least for my sake, I cannot and should not treat them as separate problems. I have definitely noticed that it's much easier for me to stay sober when I am not depressed, calm, and have true friends to hang out with.

So when I stay active, eat healthy foods, socialize in positive ways, spend time outside, practice yoga, and take good care of my mind and body, it doesn't just treat my emotional or physical problems; it also treats my drinking problems. If I feel good and have healthy activities to keep me busy, there's no longer a good reason to get drunk.",18

And the author reminded the readers that there was, for all of us, a time when we would just absolutely cut up with our friends and have an amazing time without the help of any kind of drug or alcohol (except maybe caffeine). 

I remember slumber parties with my best friends when I was a teenager, before I discovered alcohol, when we were powered purely by Mountain Dew and hormones and we would stay up all night just laughing our asses off at the dumbest stuff.

I'm rediscovering that now. Spending time with my siblings this holiday season (who are, thankfully, also moderate or non-drinkers) we've had these moments where we end up howling with laughter over a game we're playing or a joke somebody made. It feels so good to do this sober - I don't worry if I'm actually the only one laughing, or if I'm laughing too loud or obnoxiously. I don't miss the jokes that others make, and I'm funny again myself. My laughter feels so much more authentic and real, plus I'll actually remember the jokes in the morning.

They had a puzzle table set up in a corner of the main room.  I didn't have to anxiously mingle while recently sober.  I didn't have to stand around and look at my phone in the corner looking and feeling awkward.  For the most part - I don't think drunk people like to do puzzles.  A few sober people came up and helped and it was a friendly little atmosphere with some relaxing small talk.

The next day at Christmas we had immediate family over which include a decent amount of drinkers.  I went ahead and set up a puzzle of my own to do.  Same results - I feel like I could be social enough, but when that ""social awkwardness"" hits - I could jump in and focus on puzzling away.

Fast forward I’m in my late twenties and I have been abusing alcohol the past few years. I’ve recognized it’s a problem and have been working on staying sober but now I’m struggling with the fact that I don’t ever feel happy sober. Without alcohol I just feel bleh. I pretty much never feel like doing anything, when me and my wife hang out with friends I literally don’t talk or even feel like talking. I’ve become a complete introvert with out alcohol. I just wish I could become the younger version of myself that could enjoy life without needing anything to help. I’m basically just wondering if anyone else has felt similarly and if so how did they get past it.",10

The vehicle caught fire. Multiple children dead and mutilated. It was a ghastly site for even the most seasoned veterans. The patient that I was given was very young and very badly broken. My heart goes out to this family who has lost so much. I don’t care what day it is it’s a loss that no one should have to bare. When I got off shift, I went home and held my family just a little tighter. In my past this would have been more than a Sufficient reason to throw back some booze. Yet I didn’t. I’m learning to cope with the tragedies of humanity with out relying on alcohol. This is something that I’ve never done before. I’m proud of the progress I’m making.

I have marriage problems and I was diagnosed with depression 2 weeks ago.

But through it all, I haven't had a single drink. I batted off naysayers, friends questioning my motives, accusations and rude comments. I battled with the idea of downplaying my drinking or being honest about how it was a problem.

Exactly 1 year ago today I made the decision to never touch a drink again. I got lucky, it's been a pretty easy non drinking year, but hard in every other way.

Void of anxiety, motivated, accomplished. You deserve every positive thing you are feeling right now. Arguably the hardest time of the year for a lot of us has passed, and you did it. You accomplished another day in your journey, but not just any day. It's important to reflect on this time and appreciate what you've done for yourself and your family. Be proud.


To those of you who have woken up today, ashamed, depressed, regretful and embarrassed. Disappointed in yourself alone and/or facing your close one's disappointment. Remember this feeling, let it be a lesson and not a regret. Remember that sobriety isn't far away, it was a only few days ago, there's no reason why it can't be only a few days ahead, just around the corner. 

This time of year holds copious amounts of pressure in which the likes of non-drinkers even feel it. A slip now does not discount everything you have achieved already, your ability and strength to survive what you've been through. You have NOT lost the war, you have NOT given up. This is part of the fight. A fight you CAN win. 

It's a cliche but damn, shit happens. We have more control than we are lead to believe over this horrible drug.

I've done good this holiday season so far despite being tempted by a fridge full to the brim of booze at my boyfriend's place. He doesn't really drink, but his roommate's seem to horde booze and then barely touch it.

(I mean come on. One roommate bought a bottle of vodka, a six pack of Smirnoff as well as a tall boy of Smirnoff ice. He took a few sips of the tall boy and put it back in the fridge and went to bed at a reasonable time and that's all he touched. Wtf)

Anyway, I just got back home and the house smells so familiar. My roommates are picking up the paint job in the kitchen they put on hold many months ago. The smell reminds me of the night I moved in. I had a bottle of 90 proof rum and I organized my room until I passed out with the tv on mid-show.

Right now I'm feeling extra triggered. I have an insanely stressful phone call to make in a couple hours, too. This smell just brings me back to that cozy night. Sure I woke up dazed and a little ashamed, but nothing bad happened that particular night.

2019-12-26 06:07:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/efu8vb/day_2/,Day 2 :),"I never really thought I had a problem. I was never an everyday drinker, just ""socially"" most weekends.

I joined this subreddit about 2 years ago and have been quietly stalking and reading, always thinking that I don't drink everyday so it must not be an issue. That could be farther from the truth. I am on day 2 of an alcohol-free life and I am ready to admit that I have an issue with alcohol.

I started drinking when I was 15 and from the very beginning it was always binging. I have so so so sooooo many memories that bring me pain/shame/anger/embarrassment that all involve alcohol. Every choice I ever made that I regret now was under the influence.

As the new year approaches (and as does my 28th birthday), I am ready to break free from these chains. I do not know how to drink and I probably never will. When I drink I'm either a) drinking to get drunk, chasing that feeling because it makes me happier/less insecure or b) I am so painfully aware of every sip because I'm so afraid of getting wasted again that I just feel ashamed, and then slowly but surely the ""good"" feelings start to take over and I am back to a.

I had Christmas Eve dinner with some friends where I drunkenly overshared (and woke up feeling ashamed/anxious about what I said). I then came home and still wanted to drink so I opened up a bottle of wine, drank some more, smoked and then threw up. I woke up Christmas morning and just felt like ENOUGH. I've been feeling this way for a looooong time now. I got arrested 3 years ago for drinking. I spent 26 hours in jail but that still wasn't enough for me to see I had a real problem. I've made a fool of myself at countless gatherings, I've hurt people and have been abusive towards those I love, I've put myself in dangerous situations because of my drinking.

I AM DONE.

I told my therapist last Friday that I had a problem with alcohol and then I proceeded to go and drink with some friends. Christmas Eve 2019 is the last drink I had and will have. I will continue to talk to my therapist about this and begin healing the parts of me that ""need"" alcohol to feel fun/sexy/happy in social situations. 

I don't know what the future looks like. It's scary to think ""I'll never drink again."" That feels daunting and impossible but I'm just going to take it one day at a time.

It feels so good to admit I have an issue and to OWN IT instead of letting it control my life. I'm excited for the future! I want fo find joy again, to know who I am confidently in all contexts. I want to go dancing without needing alcohol! I want to celebrate with friends without feeling like I can't have fun unless I drink. I want to enjoy sex without alcohol!! I want to know my life in all its ways without alcohol!!

I know I’ve told him I’m not drinking anymore but on our birthday he left a case of delicious beer with my wife for me.  I totally forgot about getting drunk for our birthday!  

I ran to the store and bought him a bottle of his favorite whiskey, gave it to him later that day.  He invited me in for a drink and I made up an excuse why not.  Then took the case of beer to a Christmas party just to get rid of it.  Drank water and coffee instead. 

My point here is even though the opportunity presented itself to me I stuck to what’s more important. I won’t lie and say it wasn’t tempting to let myself go for the day, then to go on thinking about letting myself go for the holiday season, then before you know it...

No.  I’ve worked too hard and come too far.  I went from hating myself daily to being much kinder to myself. Went from stress and anxiety to calmness and acceptance.  I got through the holidays, the social gatherings, the “work meetings”, the birthdays, the big vacation, all without alcohol and ALL OF IT WAS BETTER!

Anyone considering sobriety, just try it.  Try it for a day.  Go for a week.  Challenge yourself to a month or maybe more.  You might learn something about yourself. And if it doesn’t work for you, there’s still plenty of liquor stores out there. 

I never thought life could be so great and it is, it keeps getting better and better.",22

On Jan. 2, 2019, I decided to stop drinking for a couple months and did not drink for about two months. Then, of course to celebrate, I drank for two weekends. I had decided I would not drink during the week, but still over drank the couple of times I did.

Then, I found out I was pregnant in early March 2019! And I had not drank until I had 2 beers on Christmas. After the two not really enjoyable beers we had to bottle feed the Baby and I had to wait for what seemed like forever to breastfeed her again. It was totally not worth it. 

I have to say, without the drinking, God blessed me immensely this year. I got a great early career job, my husband and I moved to a tropical place, we got a puppy and had a Baby. I also ate pretty healthy, walked a lot, did a bit of yoga and was able to maintain my weight well. It has been a magical year. 

12 hours later and I can still taste and feel those 2 beers... and the dread drinking brings to my life. I will not lie, my mind has fantasized about alcohol and getting to drink again often this year. I feel like those two beers are a slippery slope back to a miserable existence, and I just can't go back. Life is so incredibly better without alcohol. I just need to get over this hump and make sure I dont talk myself into otherwise now that I am not as physically restrained from drinking.

There is more I could say, but I cannot put into words how much those two beers make me feel like I am now fighting for my life. I cannot bring that old person into this new life. This is not a drill, I need to be on high alert! I do not count this as day one. I will just say that I drank three times this year instead of two. 

My life is not perfect, but it has been amazing this year, and it would not have been possible without quitting drinking. 
Stand strong, there is an amazing life waiting for you on the other side of alcohol.

Just for today, I will not drink with you.",17

Made it through hours of playing cards without drinking.

Because I was sober, even though it was the wee hours of the morning, I cleaned up. Not everything, but enough that tomorrow won’t be so bad.

No one drank ridiculously this year, so that was a plus. I was tempted a couple of times but then remembered the amount of days I have been sober. I generally don’t care about the amount of days, but in these moments, I find it really useful to know how many it has been, because it really helps keep me in check. The longer I stay sober, the longer it would take for me to ‘catch up’ to that number. It generally quickly dissolves any temptation.

I wish everyone a wonderful remainder of 2019. I hope you get to rest and do things that truly make you happy.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!


Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!


I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.


It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!


This pledge is a statement of intent.


Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!


What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.


What this is:


A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.


What this isn’t:


A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Here is a ""One day at a time"" scenario I like to consider when I start getting sucked into the future me's problems.


I need to get my hair cut, so I make an appointment to do so. It's in two weeks so between now and then my hair will keep growing and I might consider different options for how to get it cut, but the actual act of going in and getting it cut won't happen for two weeks. I can't go in today, I have to go in two weeks, but when I do go in, it will be today.


I also know that I can't drink in two weeks. Between today and that same day I go get my haircut lots of things will happen. I might have a bad day at work, my nation might win a junior hockey championship, New year's Eve 2020 will come and go, I might have more car problems, health concerns, arguments with my partner… each one of those things will or will not happen but no matter what, I won't be able to drink in two weeks because of them. The only time I can drink, or not drink, is right now. Today.


I expect certain things to happen in my life, and I hope other things don't, but whatever happens will happen and none of those things require me to drink. The only thing I can be assured of (based on extensive personal research) is that *if* I drink, whatever is happening to me *will* get worse. The last 375 days have taught me that if I don't drink today, I will have another opportunity to not drink tomorrow and each time I do that, the chances of good things happening in my life improve.


Happy boxing day SD! IWNDWYT

(Day 9 of ""This Sucks"")","I had woken up today saying to myself that I won't drink today.  That I can enjoy my time with people without a drink.  I was asked constantly and I just kept saying, ""No, I'm good. Thank you.""  What helped was thinking of how being drunk made me feel and what it's done to me and my life.  I also looked at it as not ""I am not going to drink today"" but rather ""I'm going to have fun without a drink"".  Thinking in the positive instead of the negative, allowed me to not just do it anyways, like I normally do.  I always do what I'm not supposed to do-programmed from childhood.

For those of you who made it through today without a drink, I am so proud of you.  For those of you who did drink today, I say you are loved and you are not a bad person.  

If it helps anyone to get through another day, tomorrow is NOT Christmas.  Know that.

Sending love throughout.",7

This community has been so instrumental for me and I’m so grateful for it. Especially in moments like this behind a closed door when an entire Christmas party continues without me. I’m having a moment. A pity party and I know that, but damn does it hurt. I’m 32. Single. Live in 150 sq foot apartment by myself. 

My older sister is married and we’re at her house as we do every year. My little sister just got engaged to a wonderful man and I’m thrilled for her. I’ve spent the last week hearing about weddings and how happy people are and I felt a little invisible which makes me feel a little selfish. Another embarrassing thing is I have the palette of a 10 year old. Tonight for Christmas dinner my sister made two dishes and forgot to tell me that they were both things I don’t eat. I know that it seems really ridiculous but it made me feel like I was a freak for not just eating like a normal person and I was embarrassed I didn’t want any. My mom then made a comment to someone about how high school boss at the bagel shop I worked at told her I had “emotional problems”. It was in front of relatives I didn’t know very well for whatever reason it was the straw that broke the floodgates. I couldn’t help but think, am I still that girl? 

I am hiding in a room crying as they play a white elephant game. I’m proud of myself and know how hard I’ve worked but when you’re sober you feel EVERYTHING and moments like this is the closest I’ve ever come to  being envious of all of the other adults here for well everything. Their spouses. Driveways. Ability to eat like an adult. I know this sounds so selfish, but the holidays have left me feeling very fragile and the one thing that made me calm down is knowing there may be someone in this community that understands me. 
Being a non drinker means you get somewhat used to being outsiders. Some days it’s a badge of honor. Others it feels like a scarlet letter. Tonight was a perfect culmination of sadness and reality. But I know there is hope somewhere in there too. Yes it’s hard to feel it all but I know I’m not settling for anything less than what I WANT. No longer searching for a former form of clarity.  I’ve found that in sobriety. And I’ve found belonging in all of you. Thanks for listening.

Then I decided I deserved to try it out. I’d have one beer, and reeeeeLy test how I felt. 

20 minutes later I’m sucking down beers in the garage, sneaking pulls of scotch, slipping shots of vodka into my ginger ale. 

No one has said anything, but I can see everything in my parents eyes.

This second Christmas I’m more settled and content. I spent the day with my mom, watching old movies and eating appetizers and finger foods.  We laughed so much and talked about how lucky we were to be having such a low key Christmas. My mom is in her seventies now and I sobered up in time to spend hopefully many more holidays together.

It tore me apart inside and was the worst thing I’ve ever gone through. (Detailed story is somewhere in my history if you’re into that kind of thing.)

I haven’t flown since we terminated our son and my mind is just reliving all the memories. I’ve cried all night. I’m scared to get on that plane and come back without this baby too.

It's 1.30am in Boxing Day here in Blighty and I'm as fresh as when I woke up without a hangover on Christmas morning. Thank you for the amazing support yesterday with so many messages of support and solidarity and 950 odd updoots!

Went into today totally *there* as we opened stocking presents as a family of four sat in one bed together at 8am. My wife is a take it or leave it drinker but I could tell she was working through the pain of the night before. I was drinking my tea and having a lovely time interacting with my son and daughter and laughing and enjoying the unwrapping.

Got up and worked through all of the lunch preparations for feeding and watering the other eleven family members staying all over the house! Bro in law asked 'are you really not going to have a glass of something bubbly with the family presents?' And I just said 'nah, or that's not giving up is it?'. End of conversation without any difficulty on either side.

I'm the wine expert in the family. Of course I am, I'm the alcoholic. So I brought out five bottles of red, uncorked them, sniff tested them and then poured five large glasses for the table. And made a ginger beer, lime and sparkling water for me. 

Yeah, I did put myself right next to the stuff, in a room on my own with it as a matter of fact, and muttered 'hah, fuck you alcohol' at the five bottles in front of me. Not because it was easy, but because I was so determined you could have hit me with a truck today and I wouldn't have moved a goddamned inch. 

We had a day of good food, good company, laughter and games. I am a lucky man to have been right there all day and that I will remember it tomorrow.

Thank you for your support. It means and meant the world. If you are going to restart tomorrow or soon, please see any one of my ten thousand plus days of not making it in context to this time of making it. We all fail to succeed many times, that's why we are here in SD. Yet with the right passion or, yes, even fury in our hearts, there comes a time when it is just *on*.

He died two years ago from an overdose. M and I have been struggling with self medicating for years. He is 5 years younger than me. I’ve been working on my sobriety after being a problem drinker for half my life. My brothers would party together all the time. They were only a year apart. 

Our tradition has been to pack a blanket, get a pack of smokes and a bottle of whiskey and meet at the spot to cry our eyes out. 

There have been several conversations and tears around M’s choices and habits. I couldn’t bear the thought of being a hypocrite and decided alongside to analyze my relationship with alcohol. I can’t just have one, I’ve got a big ego and lots of pain inside that I’m slowly dealing with.

The whole solo 45 minute drive was anxiety-ridden. Would my brother offer me the bottle? I knew I wasn’t strong enough to decline. After some back and forth with, “no one would know but us and cmon this is a good reason to have a drink for old times sake...” and “This is a good reason to have a drink...” I came to the conclusion that it wouldn’t feel good and the typical shit would come up. I would regret it and still feel shitty for the loss and fear of us losing control into the night and I would probably not want to stop. I needed that internal dialogue. I allowed my moment and decided that this can be different. The pain won’t go away with a drink anyway so I grabbed a pack of rolling tobacco before I got there...drinking and smokes go hand in hand. Without drinking, I don’t need the other...but that’s for another day. He brought two tall boys and didn’t offer me a sip, thank goodness. He drank one, started the other and dumped the full 2nd one out.

My dad is a rehab counselor. This, after being an alcoholic since before I was born. He helped get my brother a spot for a 30 day in-patient rehab. He leaves in 2 days.

I’ve been an anxious wreck for almost two weeks hoping he follows through. 

I didn’t drink today, that’s all that matters. I’m feeling more hopeful with each day.

I made it through most of the day and night and the meltdown from my daughter after fighting with my wife was what made me say fuck it one glass of wine won't hurt. 

You can guess what happened next. After a couple of more I ended up taking 3/4 of a bottle of bourbon. I blacked out and am pretty sure I woke up still drunk this morning. 

My wife said I was obnoxious and just annoying but nothing horribly bad happened. There doesn't need to be, that was enough to make me feel shitty all day. I even was miserable enough to try another glass of wine which tasted disgusting and I poured it out.

I let things get the best of me which I shouldn't have done. Everyone has been drinking all day but I've been keeping my water bottle next to me instead. And making frequent walks out of the room.

I'm really trying not to beat myself up but it's hard. I was also planning on a full day to myself tomorrow but it looks like that's not happening either. I will not drink with you for the rest of today.",27

This morning my mom decided to make French 75s (the drink that I relapsed on last time) and she asked me every 5 minutes if I was having one or if I wanted to just taste it. Then I went to my MIL’s house and she gifted us a bottle of champagne for NYE. My SO did a “thanks but it’ll just be me drinking it” and MIL replied “oh you can have a glass.” 

But that was the problem. It was never just a sip or one glass. It’s the first glass that leads to a second that leads to a blackout. Just very very very annoying.",12

Finally decided to cut down and that was doable and a good start. Went from 3-4 x week to 2 x week and slightly less in quantity- 2-3 glasses instead of 3-4. Then decided I wanted to go a whole week. At day 7 decided I wanted to go to double digits. On day 10, I decided I wanted to go two weeks. Get that goal and decided I wanted to go until Christmas which was 4 weeks. I think for me slowly extending the goal seems to have worked much better than that paralyzing never again. So my next goal is 30 days and then I suspect it'll be New year's and then Martin Luther King weekend because I'm driving that weekend to Virginia to see my daughter and so on and so forth and so on and so forth.

I was always a happy drunk and people gravitated to me, I was the connector and social lubricant  for others, and we all had fun. But, alcohol masked my anxiety. Now I'm unable to converse with people and find myself wandering around parties/gatherings trying to fit in, but feeling like I just don't want to be there and I'm sure it shows.  My husband and mum especially have noticed. I don't want to be a sad recluse, but I'm struggling with how to be me - I think I'm struggling with how to have fun.

2019-12-25 18:04:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/efn7e2/moving_past_my_past/,Moving past my past.,"This is going to be an embarrassing post, as are a lot of the posts on this sub. But that's part of the process right? Confronting the shame of our actions and learning how to move forward. 

Since kicking the sauce at the end of July 2018, I have moved into a new place and started a new job. So I have no memories in my current house associated with being drunk. And I have no shame tied to my current job associated with showing up hung-over, calling out ""sick"", or sleeping like the dead through my alarm because of booze. It's nice. Almost like a clean break. Almost.

The thing that has shadowed me since then (aside from my reputation with friends, which I'm slowly changing), is my bed. 

I was one of those drinkers who would get smashed real quick, black out for a while, and then pass out. And there were an embarrassing number of times that resulted in me pissing myself in my sleep. Needless to say, my mattress tells the story through it's stains. 

Since becoming sober, every time I'd take the sheets off to wash them I'd have to look at those stains and relive the shame that came with those mornings. It was a constant reminder of the unhealthy version of myself I'm working away from. Not a good reminder, not a motivator, a stain on me myself, a stain on my self worth. 

So for Christmas this year, I bought a new bed. My old bed was the last physical representation of a chapter of my life I've moved past. And it feels great to replace it. It feels great to know that I can be free of those real and metaphorical stains. 

So, I guess my message to you is: get rid of the stains in your life that are holding you back from moving on. Whatever that may be; debt to a friend, an overdue apology to a loved one, a toxic relationship, your 'drinking' shirt, that vast collection of shot glasses you intend to never use again. Don't let things from your past keep you from feeling hopeful about your future. Don't let your stains make you feel disappointed in what you've accomplished, whatever part of your journey you're on, if you're here in this subreddit, you are taking steps in a better direction for yourself, and you should feel good about that.

I was always a partier in college and it's only now that it has become a problem. (It has a been a problem, but it's 4 years coming that it has been a PROBLEM and I need help).

To be clear, I think that being the one who gets black out at every single party in college was a problem. But it was excused over and over again. I'm small, and model-pretty. I hope to not isolate people by saying that, it's just background. I think that people excuse my behavior because I'm pretty and it's ""cute"" when I get black out drunk.

The thing is, I'm at the point of physical health problems with drinking. I'm a severe alcoholic and I don't think anyone knows, but it's become bad enough that my family and friends and coworkers have said ""are you okay?"" when I go on a bender. I have serious issues with anxiety, and drinking, and it's pretty much excused because I'm able to still look good even when I'm mentally not there.

I don't know how to explain to them what a nightmare alcoholism is. In the past it was fun: now, it is literally two glasses of wine in the AM on the weekend (I have a high-stress 9-5 job), so I have started keeping it secret.) It's having a full night of insomnia when I try to stop. It's shakes when I don't have booze - It's being terrible at hosting social get togethers so that I can really ""let loose"" once everyone's gone, and then getting wasted after the fact. It's wrecking my self esteem. Everything about alcoholism is destroying me. I am smart, and creative, and a good person (I think?) And I feel that falling away. It is destroying my life and health, and my relationships, and it's destroying my memory.

I don't want this disease to fucking kill me, or continue ruining my life.

I feel angry and confused. My parents gave me sips of beer when I was small, and I knew I came from a drinking family, but I NEVER thought this was going to be the trial of my life. Which it IS. My whole family on both sides are alcoholics and my mom is a low key one. It got concentrated in my genetics and I'm bitter and sad. I feel like I am a sad drunk and I am non-functioning to the point that everyone thinks it's ""cute"". My BF woke me up this morning and told me I got drunk last night and knocked over a candle and in the same breath told me that he loved me. It's an endless nightmare. I'm so sick of having this illness. I feel like a shell of a person.

My boyfriend knows and continually helps me with being understanding and not dumping my ass (which he should, because I'm terrible). I am trying to get help. I am getting a therapist in 2020. My question is: what was everyone's plan for stopping drinking? Due to my job and my boyfriend/family alcohol itself is not going to go away. I don't know how to be sober, everything in my life revolves around drinking in a way. Everyone keeps telling me ""Just have a beer, and make sue to eat"" and I keep trying to do that, but I fail. I would like to know the first steps to recovery. I want to be better. I'm so tired of this consuming my life.

&#x200B;

A: Therapist

B: What next? How do I even start???

&#x200B;

Edited: I did not in any way want to describe or tout myself as ""model pretty"" - That is what other people describe me as, and I feel like it is context to the situation. My behavior has been excused over and over again because I'm ""attractive"" or whatever. I don't feel attractive as a person, so please don't attack my inbox saying saying I'm vain.

My biggest issue was having 2 liter sodas in the house. The act of putting ice and only soda in a glass felt weird. I actually was worried drinking out of a glass vs bottle or can, everyone would think I had sneakily mixed a drink. It was a dumb thought though because I do have accountability. I would never hide anything. Why was I scared people would think I was hiding alcohol? I don't understand why I had that thought? Can anyone relate to that? Yes at 2 points I wanted to make a drink but within 5 mins the thought/craving went away. Next hurdler new years eve, this would be the biggest one yet, so I made a plan.

I knew there would be alcohol involved at some point, but was surprised to see everyone there having wine and cocktails at 10:00 AM. The thing is, my favorite time to drink was during the day. It felt like a treat and something that was rebellious. I looked forward to waking up so I could reward myself with a drink after getting myself ready for my day. The temptation was incredibly strong for the first hour or so at this brunch gathering. I thought, my friends are the last people who would judge me if I broke my sobriety and it would be really fun. Plus it’s Christmas and I totally deserve it. Instead of focusing on the feelings of deprivation I shifted my thinking to the reality. What would my day look like if I allowed myself to have that glass of wine or cocktail? Here’s what I concluded: I’m going to have at least 2 drinks here since it’s never one drink. I’m going to start dominating the conversation and acting annoying. There was a guy there that I’m interested in, and I’m going to risk showing him a side of me that is not attractive. Once we part ways after the brunch I’m going to go to a bar by myself and have 2 or 3 more cocktails. I’ll probably get forced into a conversation with one of the barflies about Trump or football...or some other pointless subject that I’m not interested in discussing. When I leave the bar I’ll have a strong buzz and drive to whatever store I can find open. This is risky since I’m driving drunk...on a holiday when cops are everywhere. I’m going to get to the store and spend way more money than I should with the money I’ve got on hold for rent. I’m going to take the alcohol home, have one and pass out since I’ll be drunk and tired at this point. I will wake up from my drunken nap and immediately begin drinking again. I’ll drink all night and possibly drive again or I’ll be home by myself poisoning my body with booze until I fall asleep again. I’ll wake up and feel like absolute shit and go buy more alcohol to feel better. All this just so I could have that brunch drink with my friends. All this and I destroyed my 75 days of abstinence. It’s really terrifying to think that I even considered going back to that endless cycle of depression and self sabotage. No thanks! I’m happier now than I’ve ever been and there is no social gathering that will be so tempting that I’ll throw this all away for. I’m now at my awesome apartment that I can afford by not wasting my money on partying. I’m chilling with my ice water and my kittie, watching Chopped, and feeling in control. I feel strong and my self esteem is high. My friends still respect me and I have a feeling I’m going to get a date with the guy from the party. Why wouldn’t he want to date me?

A huge thank you to this subreddit and to the #stopdrinking chat.,"A year ago today I was waking up in the hospital, after having spiraled so far into alcoholism that I couldn't physically stop drinking. I'd called my parents, who'd dropped their Christmas plans and driven multiple hours to come rescue their adult daughter and get her to the hospital.

It's been a year since then, and this Christmas I'm spending with family, sober as can be, and in an *immeasurably* better place. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ajqbm5/one_month_sober/) is the post I made after one month sober, and I'm so happy to say that all of those positives have only multiplied over the eleven months since. It hasn't all been easy, but I am so happy to be sober, and so excited to start another year of sobriety. I don't do AA anymore so I don't have a chip to pick up, but I bought a [necklace](https://imgur.com/hbTC5Qp) to commemorate the day.

I'm so grateful to the support I've found in this subreddit, and especially in the [\#stopdrinking chat](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.snoonet.org:+6697/stopdrinking)—it's amazing to have so many folks who know what this is like, to talk to and to lean on and to celebrate with. I found the chat a day or two after leaving the hospital where I detoxed, and I have spent time there every single day since. It has become for me the kind of support that others have found in AA, or SMART, or other recovery groups, and for me it is absolutely irreplaceable. The folks there are some of the kindest, wisest people I've been lucky enough to meet and call my friends.

Happy holidays, and IWNDWYT.",134

She is coming home, back to me, back into my life. I have come to realize in the last year how much I truly love her, and how much it hurt to be apart from her. I drank constantly while she was away, a steady drip to keep the fear and sadness at bay. 

It was a lot at first, handles of hard alcohol would get only last me a day or two. As my body has worn down and aged, even a few strong beers is enough to ensure hours or even a whole day of torment. I am 34 years old, far too young to be feeling this tired and frail. My mind is slipping away, too. I have become forgetful, irritable, and generally dull and unpleasant to be around. Any kind of social interaction feels like a chore to me now. My friends and family don't call much.

As I slowly sipped the one holiday beer I allowed myself to have over dinner last night, in full view of my girlfriend who is well aware of my problems with alcohol and has discussed with me my desire to quit alcohol many, many times over, I thought ""how can something that tastes so good and makes me feel so happy, bring me so much pain and destroy every other facet of my life? This stuff is PURE EVIL.""

I've had many toxic relationships over the years, but none more than my relationship with alcohol. As they say, ""you are the company you keep"". Well, I am tired of feeling like I've been poisoned. Today is the day. No more tomorrows.

It's my cross to bear. It is, however, never made easier when I place myself in a position where alcohol is abundantly pursued/consumed in ""celebration"" of ....  (insert celebratory event here).  Birth of Jesus Christ? Let's get drunk! Little Emily graduated 8th grade? I'll drink to that!

  My father recently passed away. We honored his memory and raised a toast in celebration of his life. And then we continued drinking until an argument broke out. My door was slammed open into a wall resulting in a damaged trim board and broken glass. Accusations of inappropriate behavior were hurled. Some guests were crying while others were enraged.  Friendships were strained or compromised.  Relationships were tested close to their breaking points.  A true division of family and or friends.  All of this while ""celebrating"" the life of one man, my father.  Alcohol kills more than just brain cells. It has destroyed more than I can ever really know.  This event was just one of many fleeting moments in time. It didn't define my father's life or the love and respect I have for him. But, it has defined mine.  As we spend these holidays with friends and family,   dont allow yourself to be deceived by the promise that alcohol so subtly makes, to lead your addicted brain into believing that life's more fun if you just have one. It's a lie. Alcohol gives to you nothing but bad and takes from you everything that is good.  Iwndwyt",5

Everything was immediately ""less then"". It was like a veil had dropped around my life. Mental sharpness went next. Then the compulsion to have another and another set in, while simultaneously thinking I should quit now. This continued for the rest of the night. Luckily, nothing bad happened beyond being severely disconnected and not enjoying it. I also didn't sleep well and woke up feeling shitty. Lesson learned - back to sobriety.",8

(Long),"This is long and not really specific but I thought maybe typing out how I feel right now would help.

I am 25 and I drink everyday. It was just beer at night and I never got crazy and I still don’t. I met a girl and found out she had huge addiction problems. She was/is a mess. She has kids and her parenting scares me. I one day joked about sneaking in a little booze into the carnival and thought I would be judged but she jokingly agreed and suggested the little airplane shots. We grab a few and I bought a lemonade to mix it with and she just shot them straight. I later find out that it wasn’t just a spontaneous thing and that she bought them (2 at a time) before going anywhere. Sometimes she will stop and get two on the way to drop off her kids and then get two on the way back. Why not just buy four? I liked her logic that buying mini shots keeps the drinking controlled instead of having a bottle. So I started doing the same . A couple shots in the after noon and two at night with my normal beer. Fast forward a year ... I woke up and bought a whole sleeve (12 shots) and I have had 3 and it’s 10 30 am. I don’t even drink beer anymore (which I love the taste ) because it doesn’t do anything. I now drink alcohol in a similar way people pop pills . One down the hatch. The problem is I don’t want to quit but I know I have a problem because I also know that I can’t quit. It’s hard for me because I don’t have the same story as others. I don’t get angry, I don’t wake up in pee, I have a job and I love to love. I overly care about people and their feelings and a lot of people come to me for help. I value relationships, I have an amazing family, and I have a very blessed life. I drink all the time... and I probably act more “normal” and sympathetic then the sober person in front of me in the grocery store line. I don’t have really any motivation to quit. The only thing I can self diagnose is I have high anxiety and been told I think to much. I disect everything. And I care way to much what people think. I have been told I’m an “empath” which basically is just a person who is empathetic and absorbs other peoples feelings which I find to be true and weirdly specific to my life. Without sounding narcissistic I always think of robin williams and how he always was making people happy but was really sad. I guess I sometimes feel that way. But I have nothing to be sad about. I’m blessed. My addict partner is destroying me because her addiction is a huge spiral of craziness and it destroys me because my favorite thing is a relationship and she just can’t feel. This morning my gift I got her from last year was in the bathroom trash. How can people be okay going out of there way to hurt? I guess what I’m saying it her addiction makes me hate alcohol and substances so why would I partake even though I don’t do those awful things. Health is an obvious reason but I never been able to let that sway my choices. I smoke cigarettes, I don’t eat a lot, and not much water intake or exercise.( super skinny kid) . I love life , I love humans, I love doing nice things, I love to love, and I also am in alcoholic .",3

I stopped drinking on Halloween and it's been going mostly great, but today instead of proud, I just feel isolated. My kids all live far away, and my people here are all just so lost in their own realities.

We hosted a thing at my house yesterday and I'm sitting here, still shell shocked this morning. A few little interactions set the stage for a really rough night in my head. 

My mom died in March of 18 and I was her only kid. My family where I live now doesn't know much about my life with her, but my stepmother manages to drive in the knife in weird little ways, including as a response to good news about work that I was trying to tell her. Let's just say that pointing out how alone somebody must feel, then listing off all the ways, isn't any way to reduce that feeling. She used to be my ally, now she's just... Strange. Like, diagnosis pending. There is much caffeine and wine involved. 

My dad is noticeably older, and suddenly in pain, unable to walk. This is scary for everybody. Hopefully not permanent but he's the rock and the engine for his clan. He really wants us to be close now, but his religion, his self absorbed manner and his wife all prevent that going much further. 

My step sister has been my philosophy buddy, my fitness friend and my venting partner, also my confidante about a lot of stuff in life, including not drinking, and all the ups and downs. She started my day with angry texts about anxiety meds and having been up all night, then ""so I heard you gave up alcohol. Should I bring some for tonight?"" knowing full well I was going on two months, and already nervous about the day ahead. 

She looked and acted awful. Not drunk but obnoxious as hell. Changing the subject of multiple conversations I was  having with other people to be about her favorite craft beer or pub crawl I "" would totally love "". Like, in my face! Where's my good friend now?!?

I didn't mean to write this much. 
I knew this time of year would be tough but I didn't expect all the clarity. Depending on what you're looking at, it can be quite unpleasant. 

In this case, some people I've been struggling to understand are about to be let go, for both of our sakes . I'm just  hoping for the strength to do it lovingly. 

If the win from this joyous festivus season is less entanglement and the simple fact I didn't take a drink, I'll gladly pay the price of losing these complicated half assed connections. I'm sure the record will show I tried. 

I really need to make some more non drinking friends in real life. 

Onward and upward. Thanks for letting me feel like somebody gets it.",2

2019-12-25 09:31:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/efh3ac/a_bingemas_carol/,A Bingemas Carol,"Lately, I've been reflecting on past Christmases where I drank myself into oblivion, or alcohol affected my ability to be with my family. As I was reading the sub this morning, it hit me that the metaphors and lessons in Dickens' novella (had to look that up) can also be applied to alcoholism and sobriety.

**The Ghost(s) of Bingemas(es) Past**

In the first visitation of the long night, we see such things as young Ebenezer Booge blacking out at a large family gathering, and waking up with a family member tending to his bleeding wrist, having tried to push open a window after wandering outside. We also see Booge as a young man wandering through the mall on Christmas Eve, hung over, and finally getting a start on the gift-buying for his family, and then showing up and remaining hung over or drunk for the remainder of the holiday. Ah, such innocent times!

**The Ghost of Bingemas Present (well, maybe last year)**

This ghost shows Booge all of the people enjoying Christmas with or without alcohol, and if with, drinking socially, and everyone having a great time enjoying each other's company. Booge, meanwhile, sits home alone or quietly with family, drinking from late morning/early afternoon, and likes posts on Facebook, especially Wine Mom or similar posts. Got to get into that Christmas spirit, after all.

**The Ghost of Christmas Future**

The scariest ghost of them all is saved for last, and shows Booge the horrifying future, after his early demise from liver disease (or cancer, or falling face down in the gutter and freezing to death -- use your imagination!). His widow or ex is crying and cursing his name because he lost his life insurance, which was provided by his job. She needs the money to pay for Tiny Tim's inpatient treatment for substance abuse, which also is not covered, because Booge's health insurance lapsed as well. Without the treatment, Tiny Tim will follow in his father's footsteps, except 30 years earlier in age.

**Denouement**

Booge awakens on Christmas Day, and realizes it was a dream, and realizes that the only scenes that he can change are the present and future. He logs on to r/stopdrinking and pledges not to drink on this wonderful Christmas Day, doing it for Tiny Tim, for the rest of his family, and most especially, for himself and his long, healthy future. At the Christmas feast, he cracks open a chilled sparkling cider, and expresses his gratitude for his family and friends. Tiny Tim watches silently, not knowing what to think of this new behavior by his father. They talk later about Booge's reasons for quitting drinking.",8

Cons of no alcohol:  brain is now working at full capacity and complains constantly.

the only thing i do to alter my brain is caffeine, via unsweetened coffee and tea.  i don't do drugs, use tobacco, vape, take anti-depressants, etc.  oh, i do have orgasms sometimes, though.  my brain approves of that.  but it's not enough.  it needs more.....something.  exercising helps it, kinda.  but it needs more.  so i've been experimenting with unpatentable substances:  st. john's wort, ginseng, ginkgo biloba, rhodiola, ashwagandha, lotsa fresh fruits & veggies.  and still, my brain cries out for....something.

so i guess all i can do is try to ignore it.  i guess what i'm trying to say is that sobriety is definitely worthwhile....but it does bring into hyper-focus existential dread.",17

I thought I was ok. I got to the airport and I’m alone and having a ton of anxiety about going to the saddest place I can imagine heading to while I’ve been trying to kick alcohol.

Everyone looks at each other. “She’s somewhere guzzling.” Brother in Law finally says.","I used to be Kate’s Holiday Drinking Buddy. Is this how they talked about the 2 of us when we disappeared into ourselves, drinking? The last holiday I drank it was 2012. I am aware Kate’s drinking has escalated over these past years as I talk to her quite a bit & see her at least 3 times a year. This past summer at our beach vacation, with the entire family, she was not good at all. YET, she asked my immediate family members several times how I was doing with my sobriety, did they think I was still drinking a little here and there. There was no way to address this with her because I know there is always some level of alcohol in her system. So I stayed quiet. And I stayed sober and happy. But I am sad for her. Kate finally turned up at my Mother In Laws home right before Christmas Eve dinner. My Daughter in Law & I made this dinner together as my wonderful MIL, at 87, is having a health crisis. Kate rolls in & says, “I just gotta take a shower before we have dinner.” DINNER WAS ON THE TABLE!!! I said, “Kate, there will be plenty of food left for you when you are ready to eat, but we are not waiting for you.” Everyone turned to look at me. There is a 6 year old child at our dinner table. It is my grand daughter. She is with our side of the family for the FIRST time at Christmas. Of course I want it to be perfect as I am hosting for my MIL, who was sitting right there taking all this in. The Patriarch of the family, my Husband, said nothing. Kate glared at me and left the room. I sat down, we said Grace and we had an incredible dinner! During Grace, I prayed silently to myself to not ever let me become *that* woman again. Kate came to the table near the end of dinner & ate about 5 bites of food. I knew she sort of felt the vibe in the room, as much as she could being drunk anyway. As my DIL, my SIL & I started to clear the table & sent everyone else to the Great Room in the basement, Kate announced that clean up was all on her! I said, “You got it baby!”. I went to the basement with my iced tea. I was happy and I was sad. Please may I keep the strength I have right now to keep this sober thing going the rest of my life.",69

There were other members of my family in recovery there and it was funny to laugh with them about stuff like aa meetings and what our “old selves” would be doing. As the night went on and other people got drunker it got stale. My socialization meter ran out, and my mother who drinks a lot was walking around with both a mixed drink AND a beer, totally being too much for the room with no self awareness of how that looked when most people were just sipping a wine or ipa. Really.. double fisting like she was at a college party. I’m also hosting my parents and my SO parents for Christmas dinner today and really stressing that she’ll drink too much and embarrass me. 

Then I got a message from a friend/coworker making fun of me joking around basically saying “oh I’m OP I don’t drink, check me out”. Granted she never knew me when I was in my worst drinking phase and doesn’t know I’m going to meetings and how much I’ve struggled, she thinks I just quit. This message really poked a sore spot for me. I stewed on it the rest of the evening and cried on my way home. How could someone be so mean and ugly to someone trying to navigate their first sober holiday surrounded by drinkers. It’s not like I think I’m better than anyone else, i think I’ve really been humble about it and not talked much about the struggles with her. She must think it’s easy. It sounds like an innocuous message but I knew the attitude it meant to convey and it really upset me. I’m very proud of myself for how far I’ve made it and it makes me sad that other people would put me down over something I’m working so hard on. 

Well my SO was so upset to see me so upset he actually texted her (they’re friendly) and told her to “f*cking apologize and that she doesn’t know what I’m going through* etc probably with a few more f bombs. I didn’t know he did that until I got like a five paragraph message from her saying how sorry she was and how she thinks I’m so kick ass for what I’m doing and that she feels like a jerk and also embarrassed herself at her family party being a drunk ass to her SIL. Y’all talk about drama. I told her it was fine and to go to bed. I then said to my SO, you know what at least it’s not me tonight texting people apologies and feeling like an idiot. And he said “ah look how a shitty situation has turned into an enlightening moment for you”

So I’m ready to strap in for Christmas Day. Wish me luck with my drunk mother. I asked my dad to try to stem the flow of mimosas before they come today and he said “she’ll behave”.. yeah ok. 

I will not be drinking with any of you. Merry Christmas.",9

I was 7 months in, was so difficult.  This one has been amazing.  It has truly been the best Christmas I can remember bc well, I can remember it.  I was present and engaged.  I had a few cravings as I watched people pour the brown liquor but they passed quickly and quietly.  The joy my nieces had opening gifts provided me with so much joy and hope, things I still struggle with in my sobriety.  

I feel like the last half of 2018 was just about hanging on.  It was about putting the pieces back together.  It was about learning to live a life more in line with my values. 

2019 gave me the chance to reflect on my life.  I was able to forgive myself, which was made easier by receiving grace and forgiveness from others.  Family became more important to me bc through their support and love I was able to finally identity what it means to be a family.  

I lost some friends, strengthened other friendships, and gained friends.  I’ve learned a lot about myself this year and I could not have grown as a person without recognizing my experiences, recognizing they did not make me a bad person, that they were really just holding me back from the being the person I wanted to be.  In those reflections I was able to find some peace and wisdom that I have been looking forward.  I told my brother in law that I have as much happiness and peace in my life that I’ve ever had.  But!  I have room for a lot more growth and improvement. 

My 2020 goals have the same basics that my 2019 goals had, such as:
   - spend time reflecting
   - practice self care which for me means periodic quiet times.  Walking away from stressful situations and being ok with that (have to thank my wife for her support on that). Working out and eating right.  Going to bed at reasonable hour   To name a few. 
   - live a life more in line with my values.  It took some time to figure out what my values were and I think that is a fluid practice. 

The new goals:
- quit vaping/tobacco on january 1 - I’ve already started weaning
- I lost 30 pounds last year and I’ve got about 7 pesky pounds left
- identify some fitness goals like run 30 miles a month.  Close out my exercise ring 10 times a month 
- read 20 books and 10 of them being non-fiction (any recommendations?)
- reflect and journal more.  Honestly, this post is a start in that regard
- give back to the community.  Maybe something with addiction.  
- be a better husband.  The past 19 months I have been a little selfish in worrying about getting my own life cleaned up that I feel like
I neglected some of her needs.  I need to help more around the house - bc I live there too.  Do more yardwork.  Become a better cook.  Be a better listener.  Be a better lover, lol.  
- learn to play some piano or ukulele 
- I play a ton of golf so next year I want to branch out and figure out some new hobbies.  I want to trail hike. Fish.  Paint.  Make it to the beach and mountains more often.  I live in central NC so getting to either is pretty easy.  
- increase my income by 15%.  I’m in sales but also look at getting a side hustle. So work harder and smarter - but not at the expense of my happiness. 
- lastly, work on my spirituality.  I feel like this is the missing piece at the moment   I’ve always been in tune with it but more as a recognition that my soul was not at peace. I’m interested in learning about different religions and taking bits and pieces from them and developing my own spiritually from it.  I want to read about the esoteric religions. 

I’m expecting a big year next year.  I wish all of you a merry Christmas and a happy new year. Sober life is truly the best life.  It is hard. It can be a bore. But it can be so rewarding.

1: I bought him the beer.

2: it's my problem, not his, as is the decision to drink. It's my decision to have something or not, no one's going to pin me down and out a funnel in my mouth and get me trollied.

3: the local shop shuts at 1pm, (he opens on Christmas day so that the pensioners near us can pop out, he might be the only person they see all day, and for disorganized parents needing AA batteries) so I haven't got to last long. 

I'll probably go for a run later, get some mental balance. But for now, iwndwyt.",2

I'm not really sure what the point of my writing thid is, other than that I feel pretty ashamed and want to take responsibility for myself for once...

This is long and I probably go into too much detail. I'll edit in the morning... Merry Christmas!

As the title suggests, I was raised in a mormon family in Riverton, Utah. I had a pretty normal Mormon upbringing, though my extended family has always been more conservative in their beliefs (one of which is complete abstinence from alcohol).

Me and my immediate family moved away from Utah to KY as I entered the 2nd grade (I am 22 now). We stayed with the church pretty consistently (although I always felt it a chore to go on Sundays) up until around my 7th grade, I would say.
Whether it was the birth of my youngest sister in a family of 5 or just the fact that time passed away from Utah, we began to fall out of practice.
Although pretty much all Mormons drink caffeine (another no-no), it wasn't until my Junior year of high school that I realized my Mom had began drinking.
Now I had gotten drunk at several parties and was occasionally smoking weed, but it was still shocking to find the bottle of vodka in my mom's closet.
She would drink, nightly, it seemed, an entire bottle of whipped cream Smirnoff as she sat in her and my father's closet floor streaming TV on her laptop.

I don't know what to say other than that it was heartbreaking.
Not the fact that she was drinking and that we ""weren't supposed to,"" but the fact that she was obviously struggling and didn't want anyone to find out...

Abstinence is a toxic method of teaching.
My Mother wouldn't dare talk openly about her impulse and desire to drink, because that would show that she was a bad mormon.

It makes me so sad and so frustrated. I could have used some advice and transparency.

 I will go as far as to say I have been an alcoholic from the moment I turned 21 (September 2018). Before this point, I was smoking weed pretty much daily before realizing that it in no way was helping my ADHD or anxiety.

I have showed up to countless classes, rehearsals, and performances tipsy or even drunk.  I have drank from many bottles of my girlfriend's parents mini bar early in the mornings. I've gained 50 pounds (I've also been lifting). I have laid in bed and lost jobs because I have been too drunk to show up or care.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fast forward to tonight. 
My parents moved back to Utah last summer.
My mom doesn't drink anymore (as far as I know)
I still go to college in Northern Kentucky, and am graduating come May.
Vsiting until January 7th.

I decided this break would be the perfect time to start over. On the 20th, I flew in, got home, drank a bottle of wine, and started my sobriety.

At our christmas eve party, I gave in to my sister's boyfriend, offering me his rum and coke (I also noticed my mom drinking a bit of champagne). I drank it, he texted later asking if I'd split beers with him. ""Why not? I drank already.""
Cue him falling asleep early and me sneaking to drink half the six pack.


I told myself I would start when I got here, that I wouldn't drink and that I would be strong to take care of myself, my future, and my sisters and parents. I know that I have greatness in me and a lot of potential, but I feel like I keep getting in the way of myself... I want to set a good example and share happiness.

I'm disappointed in myself. I felt great at the party. I didn't need to drink. I was confident and having fun.",6

So I want to share some of my experience on the subject. I read a couple of books that helped me understand and fight the addiction much better. 
One of them was David Linden's Compass of Pleasure. It describes the pleasure circuit around some of today's major temptations, alcohol being one of them.

Second was Allen Carr's Easyway to stop drinking. This book really helps change the perspective on your relationship with alcohol. A must read.
In the right mental state, quitting alcohol can be much easier than expected.

I have to wonder if the years of drinking damaged my mental health or if these issues were always there and why I drank to begin with.

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!


I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.


It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!


This pledge is a statement of intent.


Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!


What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.


What this is:


A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.


What this isn’t:


A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.


This post goes up at:


US—Night/Early Morning


Europe—Morning


Asia and Australia—Evening/Night


A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

No matter what happens today, remember that it's only 24 hours from beginning to end just like all the rest. The sun came up this morning and later today it will dip back down below the horizon. No matter if you are on day 1, nursing a crippling hangover and full of regret, or day 10,000 trying desperately to remember why you quit in the first place when all these other people can drink with impunity, just ask yourself: if I drink today, will I be happy about it tomorrow? Will I regret waking up sober on boxing day?

I love Matt Haig, so here is a slightly paraphrased quote by him to set you on your way:

*""Stay sober for your other selves, the people you will become. You're more than a bad week, or month, or Christmas. You are a future of multifarious possibility. You are another self at a point in future time, looking back in gratitude that this former you held on.""*

I will not drink with you today. 

Blessings,

I don’t know if it’s holiday stress, working customer service, the onslaught of parties, drinking and alcohol advertisements literally everywhere I turn or if sometimes it’s just harder than others. 

I want to share some insights I’ve found to help me get and stay sober this long. I know many of you have 20 years and some have 20 hours. I still think learning from each other is the beauty of recovery. 

Here’s a list of some of the things I’ve learned so far.... 

1. I was afraid to go to AA because I don’t believe in god. I then listened to someone speak at a meeting who said, you don’t have to believe in god, only a power greater than you, something that can do something you can’t. He said my first higher power was a hay truck because it could move a shitload of hay across the country and I couldn’t. 

Dumb analogy or not, it worked for me to begin to understand. 

2. AA is not the only way to get sober, but it helps to have people who know what you’re going through, even if you don’t want to jump in full force. 

3. Sometimes you’re still going to make bad choices. Try to make the “better” choice instead of always worrying about making the best. We aren’t trying to be perfect, just sober. 

Example; I was in line at the drugstore where they have liquor and cigarettes behind the counter. I was having an awful day and had pretty much made up my mind to just grab an airplane bottle. I got to the counter and bought a pack of cigs instead. Was it the best choice? Nope. But I stayed sober that day. It was the better choice. 

4. Reach out if you need help 

5. Follow through with your commitments 

6. Eliminate unnecessary negativity from your life, whether that’s getting out of a toxic relationship, a bad job, deleting your Facebook, staying out of politics... whatever that means to you. 

7. Count your blessings 

8. Take it one second at a time 

9. Don’t assume that no other alcoholic will understand your story because it is too unique. That’s the beauty of it, we may not understand your story, but we sure all hell understand your feelings. 

10. Do it for you. 

I’m no expert. I’m a fuck up like the next person. This is just what has helped me and if it helps one of y’all stay sober one more minute, I’m a happy camper. 

Thank you all for being a part of this group! This is hands down the most supportive subreddit I’ve come across. You’ve been monumental in my sobriety. 

Merry Christmas or anything else you’re celebrating. 

PS: If you need a place to go for Christmas, google and see if there are any Alcathons near you. There’s food, games, prizes, and a warm, safe place with cool ass people to spend the holiday sober. 

Much love!",20

I managed to get over a month under my belt at one point, but then relapsed. I've been hiding it from most people, but a few friends have gotten concerned and one of them finally said she needed to not see me for a while because of my alcohol-influenced erratic behavior. I feel awful but I understand.

I missed my initial flight home on Saturday (amazingly, not really alcohol related) and immediately felt a sense of relief because now I would have three days to myself to drink alone. And that's what I did. I finally woke up this morning feeling like absolute garbage and the complete insanity of my drinking on full display.

Alcohol is making my life smaller in so many ways. I need to go back to meetings, back to a sponsor, back to anything that will help me finally stop. I need to tell my loved ones that I'm no long drinking. My entire life hasn't fallen apart yet, but I can sense that it will if I don't change something soon. I need to do this for real.

Most immediately I'm struggling with how awful this hangover is on top of the guilt, just so anxious and nauseous. And tomorrow I'm flying out to see family, which means a day in airports (where I used to love to drink) and I'm super anxious about family stress. Oh, and my mom is an alcoholic too -- I held an intervention for her once but it didn't take. 

I tried to go to a meeting today but it was closed because of Christmas Eve. Right down the street? A bar. I wanted to go in. I thought about it. But I didn't, and I have been sober and miserable all day instead. I'm holding on to that win for now.

This is the longest I've gone sober in years so I'm pretty much in uncharted territory when it comes to how I'm reacting to all of this. I've told my family about my issues and that I'm not drinking. Yet they seem to not really care or don't take it too seriously. Which is fine i suppose, my mother is (probably) an alcoholic and so is my sister. We're spending time together these holidays and all they can think about doing is drinking. We go out to dinner, they have bottles of wine and spark drunken conversation and try to engage me. I don't have the urge to join them and drink, but I'm just sitting there white knuckling because I cannot stand the drunken questions and the complete disregard for what I'm trying to do. I'm extremely irritable and have zero interest in talking. Of course this makes me look like the weird one and I'm beginning to feel ostracized by my own family. I can't really help how my emotions are reacting to all this which is why I just prefer not to speak, yet they pry and pry which a person can only take so much. The only person I can really talk to is my dad who is not an alcoholic and also cannot stand them.

If my mom tries to further guilt trip me about leaving, I’m going to be upfront about not wanting to be around people trying to get drunk.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!


Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!


I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.


It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!


This pledge is a statement of intent.


Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!


What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.


What this is:


A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.


What this isn’t:


A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.


This post goes up at:


US—Night/Early Morning


Europe—Morning


Asia and Australia—Evening/Night


A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

No matter what happens today, remember that it's only 24 hours from beginning to end just like all the rest. The sun came up this morning and later today it will dip back down below the horizon. No matter if you are on day 1, nursing a crippling hangover and full of regret, or day 10,000 trying desperately to remember why you quit in the first place when all these other people can drink with impunity, just ask yourself: if I drink today, will I be happy about it tomorrow? Will I regret waking up sober on boxing day?

I love Matt Haig, so here is a slightly paraphrased quote by him to set you on your way:

*""Stay sober for your other selves, the people you will become. You're more than a bad week, or month, or Christmas. You are a future of multifarious possibility. You are another self at a point in future time, looking back in gratitude that this former you held on.""*

I will not drink with you today. 

Blessings,

2019-12-24 22:38:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/efbgea/whats_up_wednesday/,What’s Up Wednesday,"It’s that day again. Guess what day it is? Happy Hump Day, everybody! What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life, see how our SD family is doing, and support each other. Share your good, your bad, and your ugly (or your pretty, or your future, or whatever else is on your mind) with us below!

-----------------------------------------

**The Good:** I’m going back to England, where I lived when I was a young, slim non-drinker in my early twenties. Now that I’m sober, I no longer have to be ashamed of being the fat, bloated, and sloppy middle-aged drinker that I became in the years since—one who didn’t even want to show her face in public. Instead, I’m once again healthy, slender, and have got it (somewhat) together, and I can see old friends in England without having them wonder what the hell happened to me.

**The Bad:** Packing for a long trip is a real headache. I have to keep reminding myself that I’m not going to the dark side of the moon—I can buy things when I get to London if I’ve forgotten them.

**The Question:** It’s been so long since I’ve lived in England that I’ve forgotten tipping etiquette. To the British sobernauts: If I ask a skycap to take my bags at Gatwick to the nearby, in-terminal hotel (accessible by a covered walkway), what’s an appropriate tip? (I found a five-pound note in my purse—will that be correct?) 

---------------------------------------

**A note about the holiday (for those sobernauts who celebrate Christmas):** This year, I am opting out of festivities. For me, quitting drinking meant learning radical self-care, and as part of that I now indulge myself when I’d rather be at home with a good book instead of forcing myself to be social. So this year I have (graciously) declined several invites and instead am planning to take a long walk on the beach (I’m in Florida), enjoy some delicious leftovers, and of course check in here several times to see how my SD friends are doing. 

However you choose to spend your day, I hope it is a delightful one that is spent in the company of loved ones or—like me—in happy and contented solitude, with all the joys of sobriety and no regrets tomorrow. I know that a far more valuable gift than anything I could ever buy my family is what I’m giving them this year—the peace of mind of knowing that I’m sober.

**Merry Christmas!**",22

It’s fine, because I didn’t drink, but tomorrow I am going to try and be a bit more aware of my thoughts and actively choose sobriety. If I ‘accidentally’ stay sober, I could also ‘accidentally’ have a drink.

I went for counselling, got help and stayed off for 3 months. I had weekly counselling, which was fantastic.  but I think I presented as being on top of things??I think I may sabotage myself like that! 

  then she said I could go to volunteering, and play games with the disabled instead of counselling. thats great and I love helping, but it doesnt address anything in my sick mind. she cut it back to once a month.

  I have told her about my major ptsd and childhood sexual abuse, that needs to be dealt with.  I feel have been brushed off and my counsellor has cancelled many appointments with me, I feel lost and horribly alone. after being cancelled and cancelled again when I have serious Christmas issues, I have started drinking, and no I have no friends and no family support.

Then I had a damn nice coffee and a good conversation in another room. 

Today, Christmas day, I am going to do exactly the same. So, jog on alcohol, you can go and do one you twat. I'm reclaiming this Christmas and all of my days.

Merry Christmas to you all.",954

With my wife and two young kids. Such a profoundly different experience than last year, when I spent a good majority of the trip hungover, disenchanted, and generally mad at the world. It’s not all roses this year (the holidays never feel anything like they look in those bullshit Hallmark movies.) 

All of the external circumstances are more or less the same. My wife is emoting all over the place because she’s stressed out. The kids are loose cannons because they’re out of their routine. My mom is being judgmental and passive aggressive about the whole thing. I’m exhausted and noting the constant low level stress of feeling like I need to be the peacemaker, as is my tendency. 

But there’s one thing different. Very different. This year I can step back and gain some perspective. I can see how all of these things (and many more) became excuses for me to drink. Escapism at its finest. Except, of course, it never fucking worked. Eventually, I’d wake up with a raging hangover and have to deal with that on top of all other stresses that had only compounded through my neglect. 

So now, I’m sitting with an espresso. Whistling a Christmas tune amidst the chaos. Comfortable. Content in the knowledge that no one gets to choose my mood but me. And I choose to take it in stride. To enjoy myself. And to be grateful for my family and my freedom from the prison of alcohol.",211

I'm finding that over this christmas break that i am struggling to socialise without alcohol. I feel like i'm not engaged with people around me and i am easily distracted by all of the other conversations happening around me. Tonight i was really making an effort to have good one on one conversations with people but i feel like i wasn't my usual drunk chatty self. I even appologised to my cousin who told me i was more engaging than i ever had been... but i felt like my heart wasn't in it.

Does socialising get easier the longer i am socialising without alcohol.

Maybe i am just an introvert who used alchohol to trick myself into socialising.

I get home from work and decide to go to bed early, but start feeling clammy and the pain is now radiating through the middle of my chest as well. I decide to jump in the car and head to the ER. They quickly took me back and hooked me up to the EKG, which came back normal. Then drew blood, also normal. Chest Xray, checked out normal. After talking with the doctor, due to a family history of Aortic Dissection, he wanted to have a cat scan done. Guess what? Comes back normal. I'm sitting here getting ready to head home for Christmas eve and the slow day at the office has allowed me to think. I've decided to make a lifestyle change, no more drinking, no more smoking.

Haven't had too much in the way of cravings, besides demolishing carton after carton of ice cream, lol. I've sat at the bar at pubs a dozen times since for lunch or dinner no problem.

But last night my fiancée got upset at me for something I said. And now the whole day today she's ignored me and hasn't said two words. It's not even a fight, there's been no arguing, just a cold stiff breeze.

I feel hurt, not about the non - argument, but that she could just turn off like that. What I said wasn't a very big deal, it's actually pretty benign, but rather than come from a place of compassion, inquiry and love, she simply called me selfish.

This will be my first holiday sober, she knows how hard this is for me, and tomorrow we're going to an annual family Xmas party where everyone will be trashed, and it's weighing on me heavily.

For her to just check out emotionally NOW is making it really hard. Through thick and thin I'm always emotionally supportive of her, but I think she is incapable of returning the favor.

I can hear this little passive aggressive voice in my head saying ""fuck it, have a drink."" but I won't. I will not give the drinky brain what he wants. Not today, and not tomorrow either. 

She's at a party now, drinking. I was supposed to go but she left without me. There's a meeting starting shortly - I think I'm going to hit that and then stop by this party for a bit.

And I ruined it with ""just a few"", that turned I to a multi day drunk fest. 

Now I'm feeling like crap, anxiety and sadness NOT do a dumb thing sad, just bummed.  

I guess the silver lining is that I'm getting it, I'm seeing myself happy, and sad, all within a few days.  And both the happy days and the unhappy days are direct results of my choices, and my own behavior.

2019-12-24 17:03:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ef7ssk/im_lucky_that_i_made_it_back/,I’m lucky that I made it back.,"Hi everyone!

I was just starting to get a little stuck in my own head so I thought that I’d check in. I absolutely *love* getting the hamster wheel going in my brain, but it doesn’t actually get me anywhere or do anything, it just wastes my time and energy and attention and gets me upset.

So I’m doing something different, I’m breaking the pattern. And actually I have wanted to post here the past couple of days, life just got busy, as it tends to do this time of year.

I quit my old job without anything else lined up. The timing just finally seemed right. I’ve been pretty worn out from work and such, and I realized that there was just no way that I was going to be able to actively look for something else while I was still punching the clock there. 

A couple of days after I put in my notice I was offered something else. I didn’t even have to interview for it. It’s for a different business that’s owned by the same company, so I am very glad that I didn’t burn any bridges where I’m at and that I’ve basically done my best to be a good employee and gracefully exit. The new position has better pay, a better work environment, and a lot of professional development and advancement opportunities, so I am excited to make the switch.

...

I’m in AA, and part of being active in AA is that sometimes people will ask you to speak at a meeting. I’ve shared my story at about half a dozen meetings now. It’s the same story, but every time when I share it’s a bit different. I’m often surprised myself by what comes out. I guess it just depends on where I’m at in my recovery and what I’m thinking about at the time.

At the meetings that I’ve shared at there have been comments from members of the group afterwards, and one of the things that I’ve noticed is that people who have long term sobriety tend to comment on the fact that I’m lucky I made it back. 

How I tell my story and what I emphasize or talk about in detail might change, but the facts don’t. My story includes relapse. It took me *years* to get from the point where I recognized that I have a drinking problem to the point where I was ready to quit, and even after I reached that point, it took me *multiple* tries to get sober and stay sober.

The last time that I got sober I had a pretty good run of it. I started strong and then I coasted. I stopped doing what had worked to keep me sober. Eventually life kicked in and my alcoholism kicked into my thinking and I couldn’t deal with facing life sober anymore, and I relapsed and it was bad.

I *am* lucky that I made it back to recovery and sobriety, but there is a part of me that’s a little... well, I don’t know if *miffed* is the right word, but I’m a sensitive alcoholic, so it probably is, *miffed* at being told that I’m lucky I made it back. Every time I started back up again after quitting, I think on some level I just thought that I would quit for real later. The longer I stay in recovery, the more that I understand what a dangerous game I played.

I was at a meeting on Sunday where someone mentioned that they had been to a meeting at a local sober living home earlier where they had heard that four people who were regulars at meetings there had relapsed and died in the previous week. Four people in one week, out of maybe a couple hundred people.

I heard about a month ago that a guy I knew had also relapsed and died as a result. We weren’t close, we just ran into each other at meetings, but he was so incredibly kind, he made a real point to say hello to everyone and to remember people. He and I got sober at around the same time, and while we never attended the same meeting regularly, I happened on him often enough that it’s clear that he was going to meetings regularly, at least in the beginning.

He had a memorable face, and his face haunts me a bit. I don’t know what was going on with him when he relapsed, and I don’t know how he died except that it happened as a direct result of his drinking. I do know that I’m starting to understand the gravity of the oldtimers who have told me that I’m lucky that I made it back. 

It’s not even been a year and a half that I’ve been back, and while I’m around a lot of incredible recovery and seeing people who are getting sober and staying sober and growing and glowing, I’m also seeing how many people don’t make it. Drinking problems are brutal. The statistics on long-term recovery are not good. I can only imagine what it’s like to be active in recovery for twenty or thirty years and to see how many people go back to drinking and die before they can make it back to recovery.

My own experience, and what I have heard people talk about and seen happen in people’s lives, is that every time I relapsed, I very quickly got to a place that was worse than it was when I quit. My time in sobriety didn’t “reset” my relationship with alcohol at all. Alcoholism is progressive, and it seems to progress whether I’m drinking or not.

Anyway, I’m so grateful for my sobriety today. It’s the greatest gift that I have. I’m grateful for the support that I have in my life and for all of the wonderful people who I’ve had the opportunity to get to know in recovery, both on here and in real life. I hope that everyone is having an enjoyable and safe holiday. 

(And for all of our Jewish friends out there, I just want to say that Hanukkah has a far superior color scheme and I hope you’re enjoying your eight days of celebration. I am jealous, yes.)

I never ever, in my life, found it so important until about 9 months ago. It made a big impact on my life.  
Some know & some don't, that I am an alcoholic.  I have known that I have loved booze for a really long time.  
The term alcoholism or alcoholic was to me, a different world, something I was not. I have always payed my bills and that made everything ok. But I was fucken wrong.  Alcohol is destructive.  Alcohol is a fun little enemy.   It can be your friend, it can help you have fun in bad times and it can help you believe you are a people person. Believe me I used alcohol to get everything I could out of it!  Alcohol also changes who you are as a person.   It rearranges how you think and slowly I lost who I was and I hope to never be that person again! 
Now let’s think about that. In the beginning stages of the alcoholic mode, I lost Zachary Livingston the kid & person I was before drinking and then slowly became a drunk ""Zack.""  It didn't happen over night, it was slowly & progressively changing me and I had little to no idea it was happening except I knew in the back of my mind and it was like I was liking the crazy and I wanted to push it and see how crazy it could get and still be ok and I did!  I pushed hard for years and years and my life became unmanagable, probably like some crazy movie with stupid twists, lows,  ups & downs.  In the process I was slowly loosing my abilities to feel and express true emotions and by the end, it was a world of FEAR that I lived in!   FEAR all the time!  Fear of loosing everything, fear of withdrawals, fear of feelings, fear of driving, fear of being in public, fear of going anywhere, fear of dying, and the small amounts of sober I had, hurt so bad.  I definitely felt depressed and confused.  I knew booze was bad, I knew I needed to stop, but there was no fucken way I was gonna do it.  All the ""Horrible stuff"" stopped completely within the first half of the first drink! I found it crazy.  I believed ""I"" was crazy!  I had come to terms that booze was going to kill me and there was nothing I could do to stop it!  I became comfortable with that and lived like that for a long time. By this time I had children and just to think about them and how I was teaching them to be people, when I knew in my mind, booze was going to take me out because I was unable to be sober & feel!  It was completely crazy!  I tried and tried to be sober and failed and failed and tried and failed again but kept trying! I look at it like the world had the tools for me to use to find sobriety, I just needed to not only find the tools but use them in the right order like a kind of puzzle to freedom! 
Then by some miracle it happened!!!  I was trying to stop drinking so I put an interlock in my car so at least I would not drive drunk. But fuck that!  Drunk Zack was smart too.  He got that bitch to start and he was off, on his way home to sleep the drunk away!  He didn't make it.   The police woke him up.  He was sleeping in his car at a red light!  Yep I was busted with a 40oz in my lap half empty and many empty ones through out the car.  I was out of jail the next morning and I lost myself!!! 100% full fledge self destruction!  3 days later I was served divorce papers.  2 weeks after that, I was staying with someone that drank more then I did. 
 I was charged with a DUI & I was assigned a caseworker and was put on U/As.  I hadn’t been in trouble, for over 10 years I think, and at that time they could only test for alcohol within 24 hrs!  Science had discovered a way to test for 5 fucken days now and..... Bam! Bam! Bam!!   Dirty!  Dirty! and Dirty!!  My caseworker told me to try to medically detox.  I tried but that was a joke.  Lol!   I was drunk the next day after detox.  My caseworker suggested that I try to get a red card.  I was shocked!  I didn’t really smoke pot because it super fucked me up when I was drinking.  Dirty after dirty U/As kept happening.  One day I went to court and didn’t have too  many dirty U/As but was told, people were concerned for the safety of the public, as during this time I was found sleeping drunk in my car by the police and told to get a cab out of there.  When I went to court, I was sent to jail that day!   Get this, they have an under ground tunnel to the jail from the courthouse!   It was crazy.  They released me the next morning.  I drove straight to the booze shop and got two 40s and immediately drank them to stop the shivers and sweating and not 5 minutes later my caseworker called and said I had till 5pm to go to this place where they were going to strap this thing to my ankle and it would sniff me every 20 minutes to see if I drank! Wow!   Science is crazy!  I went to get my red card that same day as maybe a back up plan.  I really didn’t know if I was going to even try to stop drinking.  I got to the place 10 minutes before they closed and strapped up my leg. That evening I went home to a super drunk friend.  It was one week till Christmas and I knew in my heart that I needed to be around for Christmas & not in jail or missing or something. My kids needed me to be around for Christmas! 
That was ONE YEAR AGO! 
 I don’t know if you know but the first day without alcohol isnt that bad but by day 3,  Holy Fuck!!!  I tried to cover it with a lot of THC edibles.  It helped a lot, but rendered me very useless.  I was still staying with that drunk person.  On day one, we were on the same level and every day that went by I felt different and they stayed the same, stuck where I was,  just a few days before. By the time Christmas hit I was a full fledged wreck.  Thats when I found out, I forgot how to feel feelings.  It was like getting hit by a train right after being beaten with a shovel! Shaking, sweating, cold, confused full of anxiety and super scared!  But a real scared!  A different fear from the fear I had when I was drinking! I realized that this scared feeling I felt was REAL & was not caused by alcohol. I sat there that night and thought, maybe I could make it till New Years, not drinking and then I will drink and go back to my path of destruction. A few days later, the person I was staying with moved thousands of miles away and was still stuck right where I was on December 19th . I’m glad I saw them every day during my first part of detoxification to look at and see what I was and see the sickness of alcoholism in its pure raw form as my mind started to clear itself of alcohol.  New Years came and I spent alot of  time with my children, started to figure out where I was going to live & kept working.  I smoked some pot to calm panic attacks. (I started getting panic attacks a few years ago every time I tryed to stop drinking.)  I made a commitment to get an apartment with a old friend and worked out my budget. Well look at that!   Sober me was making plans and goals now!!! And you know what?  They started to work out!  My divorce was finalized,  plans were made that worked out for everyone! 
I started to identify new feelings on a daily basis. I remember looking at a calendar and was so surprised I hadn't drank for 90 days!  Wow!  I looked on Facebook, of all places.  I looked at it and was... ok this is the moment!  This is it!  I’m going to be sober!  I’m really going to work for this and I knew I could do this!  
From that day forward, I have built a super strong support system.   I only keep the best people in my life! I also set lots of goals.  I have hour long goals,  day long goals,  week long goals, year long goals and even decade goals and I’m making them happen too!   Crazy right?  
I lost my drivers license and had to go to jail for 30 days.  6 months of not drinking only to get to go to jail & then work release!  I had to put a breathelizer in my car & got my drivers license back.   I started alcohol treatment/therapy & I make sure I get my moneys worth, every time I go.  I make them follow their plans.  I lost my shit on them when they didn’t let me finish an activity and demanded a refund and now they make sure I get my time and make use of all the material they provide.  They don't skip anything.  Not with me!  Fuckers, I pay for treatment,  you provide it! 
That brings us to today.   December 19th 2019 my one year sobriety date!!  
Looking back on this last year, I feel I have grown more than any of my 20 years as an adult. I feel FREE!  I have newly found feelings & understanding  for people that suffer from addiction and their potential to feel what I feel & felt.  I have hope they look for the tools that work for them because I could never buy this feeling or be given it!   I’m so happy I found it & I’m so excited to see what 2020 has to offer me & other addicts that also want to be free.

After all, that's where I did about 99% of my drinking.  But now I'm nervous/scared/anxious about heading to my parent's house to celebrate CHristmas with them, my wife and kids, my sister and her family, my other sister, etc.  My parents know I quit, sort-of.  My dad described it as ""needing a dry spell.""  Non of them struggle with alcohol (that I know of), but it's always a big part of Christmas eve and Christmas.  My sister makes wine and always brings a few cases (lots of leftovers to be taken home by all), someone always gifts my dad a couple bottles of scotch to be shared generously, normally I bring a large selection of beers catering to everyone's individual tastes (I used to brew it, but soon it was just easier to buy and get drunk than to craft something special).  

In my 36 days ""dry"", this will be the first time I have to be around other people drinking.  I'm afraid of giving in.  Of feeling left out, of skipping ""traditions.""  I'm trying to focus on how great it'll be to remember everything and be semi-alert for Christmas morning.  I'm trying to remember my BIL is also sober (and has been as long as we've known him) and it's not a big deal.  My drinky-brain is trying to convince me that it'd be OK to drink because it's a ""special occasion.""  My drinky-brain is even telling me that ""relapse is part of recovery"" and this would be the perfect excuse!  Shut up, drinky-brain.

I guess I just needed to vent before I head out.  Thank you all for providing a platform that allows me to do so.

I spent several days in the hospital, but, as I was there voluntarily, left before I should have.  My therapist, not surprisingly, took this very seriously and wanted me to not go on a trip that I had been planning for after school got out,  but against my better judgment I went anyway.  

Now I'm on vacation with two of my dearest friends and I feel bad.  We're having a blast,  but because they know what happened, they aren't drinking and are taking me to meetings daily;  I feel like I'm ruining some of their fun.  

I'm realizing that my coming on this trip is just another example of me running away from my problems.  I have so much I have to figure out when I get home, but I'm not doing any of it.  I'm two months behind on rent ( I'm not paying for this trip), I need to get IOP set up,  and I need to figure out how to do school with IOP. I know that I should take a break from school next term and focus on my mental health,  but I rely on financial aid to survive.  I'm not worried about finding another job; I couldn't keep bartending anyway for obvious reasons,  but lack of time is stressing me out. 

I can't do anything from here,  so I'm just trying to enjoy my vacation and to continue not drinking.  Not going to lie though,  if my friends weren't here to keep me sober,  I would probably be in a drunken stupor right now.  Real life is going to catch back up soon.",8

The last 7 months I have only drank a handful of times. Until the start of December then I said fuck it it’s the holidays and have drank multiple times a week. I forgot how great sobriety feels.

I’ve had maybe 10 cravings over the span of nearly 160 days. A bar doesn’t really effect me, nor does my roommate drinking wine or beer or even my drink of choice. The thought of a drink may pop into my head in these settings, but it is extremely easy to remove and doesn’t normally trigger cravings. 

Well, I started watching Mad Men last night, and for those of you who haven’t seen the show it’s just one big binge drinking and smoking episode after another. And funny enough, my cravings are out of this world. I just want to drink and smoke (I quit both) and it is definitely related  to or triggered by the show. Hell, I even notice how most of the characters leave full drinks behind and the alcoholic in me is screaming, “what wasteful and aloof fools, any intelligent person would never leave a full drink behind!”

It feels a little bit surreal.  I don't feel that I've missed out on anything.  In fact I was at a party and I drank flavored fizzy water, and didn't even announce that it was alcohol free.  Maybe everyone assumed I spiked it.  I don't know or care.  I didn't have a plan of what to say if asked, but I felt that I was going to stick to my guns even if challenged.  

Right now there's been alcohol brought here by family for the last week.  It feels a little more difficult, but still doable, to have to look at it.  It's a tolerable discomfort.  Luckily here, everyone knows that I don't drink.  After a split second, all I can think of when I see it is how sick and depressed I used to be after drinking episodes.  

As of now, I don't even need my medication anymore.  If I need it again, that's okay too.   But I never could have dreamed of having the mental and emotional stability I now enjoy.  I'm completely free.  I am also down 7 pounds without making any other change, and I've gotten through a book three times faster than I used to.   For every tough moment I have that alcohol used to soothe, I have ten better moments of clarity that booze would have stolen. I'm riding on the waves instead of sinking down below.  I only wish I'd had my epiphany sooner.  I'll be forever grateful to my son for questioning me that morning and giving me this chance to be present in each moment.",8

I am always so happy and proud of myself when I stop drinking, but somehow I get lulled back into drinking again after a few months pass. I keep on ending up feeling trapped in this vicious cycle of drinking, where I drink so that I can ignore my inner critic, but the booze ends up empowering that inner critic when I'm hungover the next morning and it drives me to drink again the next night.

I was going to wait until New Years to make a go at this, but screw it. This year for Christmas I am giving myself the gift of a clear head and a decision I can be proud of.

I was not hung over or shaking so bad that I couldn't enjoy spending time with this precious 1 yr old baby boy!  I enjoyed every minute of it.

It mostly stems from loneliness/social isolation and just general anger and depression I experience from time to time. I avoid so many situations that I otherwise would have loved to attend, because I would drink.

But this is a work in progress. I have been calling this time the detox of a toxic lifestyle. Sure, my life wasn’t in complete disarray, but it was interrupted. I was trying to drown my anxiety and was so convinced drinking was the source of fun. I was attracted to mayhem and chaos. And that’s what many times my nights drinking turned into. And now I can look back and know that, what may have started fun, quickly turned into a night of shame and regret, and it was dangerous.

Drinking is not for me. I am someone who binges and was always a light weight. I view drinking as a drug that my body (and mind) cannot handle. But because drinking is so popular I forced myself to be apart of it for a very long time. 

Sometimes I feel boring being sober. I know this is silly but like I have mentioned, i associated drinking=fun for over ten years. So now it’s my time to be better with my time and find joy in other hobbies. I feel like I am emerging from hermit mode and I’m ready to be apart of society again. Something like that :)

I’m damn proud of myself. I really fought through so many feelings and justifications my mind tried to make for me to drink. There’s much more to accomplish outside of being sober. But I feel like the willpower to say no too booze will give me much needed discipline in other areas of my life.

Although the allure of alcohol makes this decision difficult I know it’s the best one I can make for myself. Some days it’s harder to see that than others. But experiencing life with no hangovers, no shame, and mental clarity is deeply beautiful in a way I can’t fully describe.

This subreddit keeps me diligent. I post and comment often. You all keep me inspired and remind me to keep going. So to people who don’t post/comment, please do. It’s not always the victorious posts that help. It’s knowing the real feelings that make me feel less alone. For me and for everyone, and especially for you, please share.

I stopped drinking back in October and figured that having a couple of drinks with dinner would not be a huge deal. I had obviously proved that I didn’t rely on it and what would be the harm in partaking just a little bit? Here’s the thing - it wasn’t a huge deal. I did stop drinking after having two beers and I didn’t do or say anything I regretted. HOWEVER... here are the negatives from that experience:

- As soon as I got home, I started trying to come up with reasons why it wouldn’t matter if I kept drinking for the remainder of the night. I was home now and not near anyone who I could embarrass myself around. I had already had a couple, so what’s the harm in having a few more in the comfort of my home? I didn’t end up indulging, but the cravings distracted me for quite a while. The mental tug of war is awful. 

- Once the buzz of a couple drinks wore off, I was stuck with a headache and lethargy. While I usually love staying up late and watching movies on Saturday’s, I struggled to keep my eyes open at 8:00pm. 

- I have never been a huge sweets person (probably because I have been drinking my fair share of sugar all of these years), but lately I had been enjoying desserts in the evening. I have been losing weight from the lack of alcohol and adding in some late night sweets has not slowed that down. However, on this night, I knew that the two IPAs I had at dinner were loaded with empty calories and I didn’t enjoy my sweets as much knowing that I would feel guilty about  my calorie intake (this is most likely stemming from another insecurities, but I digress).

I know these repercussions seem minimal, especially compared to what may have come from continuing drinking, but they are all going in my back pocket as solid reasons why I will not be partaking in any alcoholic beverages over the next few days with friends and family. I realized I didn’t just stop drinking because of those huge regretful instances - of which there were many - but also because I truly feel better without it.",152

I recall it like it was yesterday even though it was well over a decade ago. This is difficult to admit yet I need to be as open about it as I will to...,"I did not resist... and here is the crazy part: I felt bad for the officer that put the cuffs on me and took me in.

I could tell he was uncomfortable with it and I was kind & not trying to make his job harder. Something clicked in me that I needed to fix my life in that moment...

I followed the procedures as best I could and was released after a night in jail. I was described as low risk by my PO and turned my life around. I am, by objective measures, successful.

I like law enforcement quite a bit as they helped me set my life in order. They help people every day. I have a high respect for them. Sure, everyone does bad and bad apples are our there, yet that is true of any profession. 

I carry a firearm (legally), know how to use it well, and hope I never will need to.

Today is my birthday, I’m now 27. On Saturday I celebrated my first sober birthday since I was 16. It was really hard but a lot of fun, my friends still drank, which was weird for me and for them! But I made it through. 

Today however I have noticed how many people I’ve lost connection with over the years as I’ve started cutting out drinking. I started a few years ago, going to less parties putting myself in a better position to stay sober. And explaining that to my old “friends” But today it is making me a little sad, all of those connections forged in drunken shenanigans were just that. Only connections forged in drunken states. We hung-out and got drunk, partied our asses off and said it was because we were such good friends.

I feel lucky to have other newly formed friendships and old ones that understand why I’m sober and how much better it is for me. But I can’t lie and say I’m sadden a bit by the fact that some connections I had were fake. I can’t say it’s all sad feelings when I look back on who I lost though, because who would want connections that shallow! 

Anyway sorry this is long but this is the only place I felt I could share these complicated feelings. Thanks for listening and reading. Here’s so a sober 27th year! I will not drink with you today 💕",9

2019-12-24 06:41:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ef0ca7/why_do_i_stay_sober/,Why do I stay sober?,"Sitting on the back seat of a bus, somewhere in Sri Lanka, waiting for the rest of the passengers to return from the off-license and it made me think what has kept me sober all this time?

It is Christmas time which promotes excessive drinking to either celebrate one's life or block it out, either way, it is overlooked. Christmas was a gift to me as an active alcoholic. I could pass off excess as festivities and get lost in the crowds for a few weeks. In January, the crowds went back to living and I would carry on, alone.

It would be easy to focus on the two weeks of inclusivity at Christmas and pretend that was a reflection of life. It would be easy to fall into the dream and let the romanticised memory sweep me off my feet but it cannot. The memory of me drunk, crying and being lonely and lost still hangs in my mind. It is the reminder of the potential outcome for any urges to test my resolve with controlled drinking. I can't I tried.

So fear keeps me sober. Fear kept me, prisoner, for a long time. Irrational fears that would hold me back and stop me from quitting drinking; ""What will people say?"", ""What will people think?"" ""How will I do XYZ?"" All nonsense. The fear I have around alcohol is very real but very rational.

I have worked so hard to get to where I am and I no longer see the benefits of alcohol. Before, I NEEDED it. Now I don't need it. I actually think that the negatives outway the positives. The only positive I can think of is that it would make me feel included in social settings with heavy drinkers. Social drinkers don't give a fuck what I am drinking.

Would I throw away everything I have worked for to gain the respect of people whose respect I no longer need? Of course not.

In the direst of situations, a little voice somewhere in the recesses of my mind suggests that a drink would smooth it over but I know that to be false. It is just escapism. I learned that suffering is part of life and learning to accept that is a gift. Avoiding suffering is desirable but also detrimental.

""A man who conquers himself is greater than one who conquers a thousand men in battle""

Buddha

Being open and honest with people keeps me well. Sometimes this means doing things I don't want to.

There is a saying that goes ""You won't find the answers to your problems in the bottom of a glass!"" I did. My problem was in the glass.

When I stopped drinking many of my problems vanished and many more become manageable. Some were daunting but sobriety gave me the strength I never knew I had and the rest is history. I have had some of the best times in life, in sobriety. It is the greatest gift I ever gave myself and something so beautiful cannot be given away frivolously.

At the back of the bus, I wait patiently. I am not missing out. I have a life beyond my wildest dreams and it is simply because I accept that I have no self-control. I don't trust myself with alcohol but that doesn't matter because I love the person I am without it.

This is my fifth sober Christmas. They get easier.

Merry Christmas,

Charlie.",85

Today I had been up nearly 24 hours and every few minutes I tried to lay down they would text me over and over what a huge mistake it was. It was brutal.

I don't know how I'm going to handle things ahead. How I will get to work or ever be able to save enough money to dig myself out of this hole.

We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!


Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!


I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.


It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!


This pledge is a statement of intent.


Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!


What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.


What this is:


A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.


What this isn’t:


A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Here we go! December 24, the Eve of Christmas if you're into the whole brevity thing. 

When I was drinking all the time, I was always locked up in my head. I couldn't even really put up a fight, and I didn't, when my brain said 'go to the liquor store' off I went even though hours earlier I fully intended not too.

I resisted the ""spiritual solution"" on principle rather than realizing that there might be something helpful even for me, buried in the concept.

Now I think back on my early tries at sobriety, when people tried to help me and I scoffed at them, or tried to out think them and I think of this quote from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy:

“He was staring at the instruments with the air of one who is trying to convert Fahrenheit to centigrade in his head while his house is burning down.”

I hope you all have an absolutely wonderful day today!

And I guess I just kinda want to talk about it.","More and more often, my dominant thoughts are, ""See? The *only* reason you are experiencing all these great things is because you're sober now."" I got sober and realized how unhappy I am at work. Living in a state where we'll never get ahead. We had retirement goals but all the sudden it clicked: why wait? Why wait for retirement to start living the life we want? Fast forward 3 months and now we are two weeks away from selling the house, packing up everything we own, and following a great job offer to Chicago. 

Got the call today that we got a very strong offer on the house. This is incredibly good news because we didn't expect to sell so quickly. It's all falling into place. And for the first time in months...I had a genuine desire to drink. Not fleeting. This overwhelming feeling that if this awesome experience isn't celebrated with beer added, I'm missing an opportunity for some heightened peak experience. So weird. Such an addict thought, you know? ""Catch this wave quick and add to it. Keep it going as long as possible. Don't let it die."" 

I didn't drink. I remember just how much genuine excitement and joy I've felt lately over very simple things. And I remember how long it's been that I've had natural highs like these. So, I made the effort to allow the thought to drift away. 

I don't really know why I'm stuck on this. Maybe mourning the loss of the high? Those were awful fun in the beginning. 

I guess it took me 10 yrs to get this deep. Seems reasonable that it may take another 10 to undo it all.",8

By Christmas I was done, although I would drink a lot and then need to recover from everything after. 

Except, I never would recover. It was just an endless loop of feeling bad; physically, mentally and emotionally. This year is so different, and I am looking forward to it.

I wanted to thank everyone here at r/stopdrinking for the amazing support in the comments of my first posts, and from all the posts from others that I've read, you guys are amazing and I genuinely don't think I would've stopped drinking without you. So, from the bottom of my heart, thanks so much

There have been so many times that I've almost picked up again, but somehow found the strength not to, and, as hard as it is for me to say this, and despite how wrong it feels to say, I am PROUD of myself. This is a big deal and I am proud of what I have accomplished. 

Whether you've been sober for an hour, a day, a week, a month, a year, etc. I genuinely believe you deserve to be proud of yourself as well. Sobriety is HARD, so so hard, and I am proud of every one of you who tries their best to be sober. There will always be bumps in the road, that's a part of not only recovery, also just life. But if you keep trying, you'll be able to handle those bumps better and better each time.

It first manifested with paralyzing postpartum anxiety. Always worrying about the enormous responsibility of raising a child, all the big decisions, all the little decisions, what was not getting done around the house / my life / my marriage / my job, and the complete and utter exhaustion of a newborn. 

I was so overwhelmed - and this is when I can first remember beginning to use alcohol to cope. I Immediately began to associated it as form of permission to relax, something that I was unable to give to myself when sober. I just felt so  guilty for taking time to do nothing when I should be accomplishing something - some chore or task or unrealistic mom expectation I set for myself. In addition to giving permission alcohol numbed the guilt too.

My strongest cravings are not at bars or parties, but when I sit down to relax, when the day is over, when the kids are out and about or in their rooms, and I can shut off my brain. But, I’m learning how to do it alcohol free.

I've been drinking daily, 6-7 drinks a day, for the last five years minus two sober Octobers a few years back. 

It started as a ""hobby"", buying and trying all the bourbons i could, but it turned into an easy way to self medicate for latent anxiety issues. In 5 years, I've seen my anxiety skyrocket, gained back 100 pounds that i had lost, and saw my parts of my life start to revolve around making sure i had something to drink at the end of the day. 

I've spent the last year telling myself i needed to quit, but too scared to do it.  The two times before that i stopped, I had severe anxiety issues, insomnia, etc. and i was terrified that this time would be worse. About six months ago i started seeing a therapist and working through healthy ways to cope with anxiety, and working my way towards control over my mental health. Finally, a couple of months ago i decided i was finally ready to be done. I talked with my therapist, talked with my wife, and talked with my doctor about what to do. My doctor prescribed me a small dose of ativan to help through the first few days, and I took a couple of days off work under the guise of a birthday weekend celebration.

The first few days weren't great, but weren't nearly as bad as I had expected. Unlike the last two times, I went into it with a plan - I felt kind of shitty and i couldn't sleep well, but it was nothing compared to what i had built it up as in my head. 

12 days in, i still have some issues with insomnia, but the fatigue and physical symptoms of the first few days are mostly gone. I've been around alcohol a fair bit because of the holidays and some pre planned outings with friends, and Ive found I can have fun sober, even if im still craving. One of the most helpful things for me has been my list - my therapist suggested i make a list of all the reasons I wanted to quit drinking, and every time i've had cravings, i just pull out my phone and read through it. It's helped me keep perspective on how i felt before, and fight through the cravings. I plan to keep that list and keep adding reasons to stay sober as I find them.

I've been lucky to not have had to fight any major triggers so far, and i know theyre coming, but just being able to get this far is honestly more than i had really hoped for this time last year. I know my situation is different than a lot of other folks, and that I've honestly had it pretty easy, but i still wanted to share. Reading posts on this sub both as i was trying to convince myself to quit and over the last couple of weeks has helped me feel like i wasn't alone in a situation that has felt really lonely over the past few years.

It started with having one beer after work each day. I told myself it was ok since it wasn't much, but over the years I started relying on it to take the edge off of my stressful life (red flag #1). Eventually it turned into two beers per day, and I kept it there because I didn't want my wonderful wife, who doesn't drink, to think I was developing a problem (red flag #2). Pretty soon two beers wasn't good enough so I started buying stronger beer. I told myself I liked IPAs and Stouts for the flavor, but it was really just the ABV.

I'm glad I never started binge drinking, but in a way that helped me hide the problem for far too long. 9 years of alcohol dependence. 9 years of drinking instead of facing my problems.

I'm not saying its going to be easy, because it is not easy, and for you all to be still sat sober today after all the pain and suffering you've been put through, every single god damn second I promise you it is going to be worth it. Take a second out and actually think of what you've achieved. Take a second and pat yourself on the god damn back and smile in the mirror because what you've achieved so far is phenomenal. I am talking to you personally here, got up early? washed yourself? tidied the house? passed an exam? done something new today? tried to improve yourself? pushed yourself at something? promotion at work? got a job? the list goes on... everything you've done so far no matter how small it might feel, is huge. Most importantly, you've gotten through today, your sober today, outsiders don't think that's a big deal, I am telling you now that is a huge deal. That alone you should be so proud of yourself. 

For every day its tried to drag you down, preying on you at your most vulnerable, whispering in your ear and lying to you. You have stood strong and you have fought this un-fair battle every day, and you will keep fighting until the very end, because no matter how dark the night may get, your light will never burn out. I know your tired, your exhausted, recovery is every single second of every single day, it doesn't have a day off, but keep going, never stop fighting. You owe this to yourself, you are 100% worth it. You deserve this. 

Recovery is not a race, stop comparing yourself to other peoples recovery, they are all different, do not feel guilty if it takes you longer than you thought. It does not matter how slowly you go, as long as you never stop.

You are changing your life every day, working towards a better future for yourself. The pay-off is coming, I promise, you've just gotta keep pushing through all the shit and it'll be there waiting for you and my god you deserve that.

The transformation that has occurred is undeniable. I have found AA to be an essential part of my recovery - for supporting me to get under my own skin, to make visible patterns of behaviour - to link together seemingly unrelated incidents, which all come together to demonstrate, clearly, to myself, the nature of my own alcoholism. I am in the process of doing Step 5 and it is the most amazing mental transformative thing I have ever done. I have some issues with AA - surely any club anyone belongs to has some negative aspects - but I take what I need and leave the rest. Having a sponsor and various groups (online and f2f) have been so important. Being able to text people whenever I needed a word of encouragement got me through those early days. 

I was not a 'typical' alcoholic. I have a good job, a good family, good friends... I was never in trouble with the law, never alienated my friends, never lost my reputation, never cheated on my husband. BUT. But it was probably only a matter of time. I was on a slope sliding down to some pit. I may have had 10, 20 years left before I did loose everything, but I was heading that way. I made a decision to stop the slide now.

To anyone who is wondering if you are an alcoholic? Sorry to say, but you probably are. Normal people don't wonder that. You don't have to be drinking huge amounts to be an alcoholic. You don't have to have lost everything. You DONT have to hit rock bottom. 

I was a 'social overdrinker'. I could easily have just one glass of wine at home and no more. But when I went out, and started to drink, I could never anticipate how the night would end. For me, that was part of the excitement, part of the fun of drinking. But I would drive drunk. I would overshare. I would forget confidences people had shared with me. I would miss appointments. I would buy pot when drunk, and smoke it the next day to try and alleviate the hangover. I had hangovers that were so bad I just turned the cartoons on for my children and ordered delivery as I couldn't be the kind of parent I wanted to be. 

Quitting itself wasn't that difficult for me - I mean, I did't have withdrawals, but what was SO HARD was STAYING sober. I needed was a community to help me stay sober, and to uncover some of the reasons WHY I drank. For me, illuminating these reasons have helped ground me in reasons not to drink, and have removed some of the pressures for drinking in the first place. 

This has not been easy, but it has been amazing. I have spent roughly an hour a day reading literature, writing, meditating, thinking.... about my sobriety. I have bought new mugs and a range of herbal teas. I have filled my fridge with sparkling water, bought fizzy juice to take to parties, cut up veggies and made dip to have after work when the hangry craving for wine can be helped my eating something.

I have escaped social situations to sit in the toilet and read this sub, or text my sponsor. I have said 'no' to things, left early, practiced what I would say of someone asked me why I wasn't drinking. 

Basically, I prepared for success and have given myself the best chance of sobriety I can. 

Here is to a very Merry Christmas and a fantastic New Year.

I’m more than anyone how hard the holidays can be, coming from a long line of mentally ill alcoholics. I was sober for 9 months, relapsed for 2, and ended up with only my car to live in during winter in a northern state. Temperatures here often dip below zero with heavy wind chill, so it is simply too cold to safely live in my car.


I spend my nights in a warehouse packed tightly with other homeless people, and police are there multiple times for ODs, physical violence, screaming, etc. I also live in one of the most dangerous city’s in America (wout disclosing too much). But despite this, I’m happy.


I’m grateful that I don’t have to suffer another day of sickness, using all my spare time to spend either finding vodka or recovering from it. I’m grateful to have a warm place to sleep, a bathroom to brush my teeth in. I’m grateful I got my first full time job even if it’s cleaning hotel rooms. Despite everything seeming to go wrong, i know I can get through it bc I’m SOBER.


Much love to you all ❤️",1297

To be honest, I drink on and off and struggle to do a better job of not drinking. I’m not a happy person when I drink and I’m pretty sure there’s a link between my productivity, mental health and drinking. 

One hard point I’ve had with this is that my SO still drinks and I find that his drinking enables mine and vice verse.

We had a bit of a breaking point this weekend. We’ve been engaged for 2 months now (dating for 6.5 years) and my sister came to visit for the first time since we got engaged.  My fiancé and I went out for drinks with friends, opted to drive home and drop off our cars at home and Lyft back out with my sister for more drinks. Once we arrived, I realized some stomach pain I was having was not getting better, so I went right back home after maybe 15 minutes. I went to bed at 10 and at 2am I woke up and found my fiancé in just his boxers in our guest bed with my sister wrapped around him. 

The story’s in my post history if you’re interested. 

We talked and I asked him if he has a fidelity problem or a drinking problem. He said (multiple times) that he has a drinking problem. However when we discussed how he wanted to address that problem, he plans to “reduce.” I would like us to take a break from drinking in the new year as part of a healthier lifestyle (i.e. working out, cooking at home, and not drinking).

I know that I can’t make him stop drinking with me and it makes me so sad that he may end up choosing the booze over me. 

Has anyone else been where I am now?

Anyway, I guess what I really should have started with and what I’ll definitely end with is that IWNDWYT. Cheers to the holidays.",10

Some of us get hypersensitive around this time, having to deal with loss, regret, expectations, loneliness, you name it. Whatever sinks your boat. Not to mention, for those of us who are fresh at this sober thing, times like these have a lot of firsts: The first Christmas dinner without drinking, the first meetup with the guys without drinking, the first surviving the inlaws without drinking - you get the drift.

For me, diving into my second sober Christmas, planning is key. I learned the importance of this this last year. I’m aware of the issues I’ll be facing, and I’m already dealing with them. I know what to drink when (I’ll even bring some NA goodies for the hosts), what I’ll say and where I’ll go when I need a break.

The best part: I know this is doable. I did it last year, so you bet I’ll do it again this year. And last year I did it even without this experience! The *very* best part? You can do it too. I believe in you.

Oh, and the PSA: If you should need us, we’re right here, 24/7, straight through all the mess that may come, well into the new year.

2019-12-23 17:29:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eerpjb/2_years_cleared_thoughts_and_gratitude/,2 Years Cleared - Thoughts and Gratitude,"Hey all,

A few days shy of my official two year mark but since I likely won’t be able to post on the big day, I’d like to check-in and just give my recurring thanks to the folks here in this community.

Two years have passed since I fucked up (see previous posts for the low down) and this group became my refuge. 

I never thought it possible to be rid of drinking from my life for good, now I can’t imagine my life with it. Not even in the least bit.

I want to share the most valuable things I learned:

1. It’s not a perfect road. Not even close. It’s extremely messy and WILL include ugly times and it won’t look like the version of the road you expected it to. I learned to be patient with myself, to be forgiving, and to be humble in the process every day. That’s not to say I didn’t need to kick my own ass when necessary, but I had to understand that I could only pound this pavement with grace toward myself.
2. You don’t quit drinking over here in Square A and then get to square Z and magically have rainbows coming out of your ass. The sun doesn’t shine every single day and you don’t suddenly wake up with a body like Zeus. Not downing cheap bottles of vodka in your car won’t suddenly make you millions and your pets still won’t be immortal (that was a tough one for me). Life is what it is and as it always has been and will be. When I was drinking, I couldn’t feel shit and so I was close to subhuman.  And now the lows are still low but the highs - the REAL highs and being completely present for them, that’s worth everything. You might be astounded to feel a REAL authentic high again from life because you may have forgotten what it feels like.
3. I worked hard to build a life worth living beyond the one I’d made that centered around drinking. I literally tried so many different things in terms of hobbies, crafts, exercises that made me feel embarrassed or stupid,  even new languages. At the beginning with more time sober and finally clear minded, I was REAL fucking bored when I wasn’t sobbing and depressed and overcome with all the emotions I had repressed for so long. And so I let myself become intensely curious about anything and everything. I tried it all to see what I liked and what I didn’t like and most importantly, I had the pleasant surprise of finding things that ignited real passion in me. I worked on all of these things that ignited that passion, EVERY DAY. I carved a new life that would be worth too much to give up in exchange for another drink again.


So in conclusion, I hope that you never give up on yourself. I hope you open yourself up to the mystery that life is and to the best, healthy version of you that has always been worthy of all the magic that exists that this world has to offer.


2 years have passed since I decided to change my life and put down the bottle of booze for good. 2 years since I stopped hiding in fear behind an insidious substance that deceived me into thinking I needed it to live. 2 years since I stopped living life below the surface of the potential I possessed. 2 years since I gave up the shrouded thrill of a beer and a shot special at happy hour that would turn into many, that would in turn make me stagger and fall on the ground blacked out and lobotomize me. The demon that weaseled it’s way into the cracks of my psyche to feed on me and drain me of my fire and my will to survive. 

At the 2 year mark I find myself immersed in humility and gratitude. Sobriety is certain lucidity in the raw pain of life but also in the beauty and wonder of it all. 

I’ll take it all without hesitation. I’ll swallow it whole. The jagged edges of one season to the blooming mouth of another. I embrace all that is life. 

Thank you guys for continuous support!!",44

I can find a tiny bit of comfort knowing if I don’t drink again then I won’t have any more black out anxiety to deal with. But I am struggling so much to accept the danger and embarrassment I put myself through. It’s all teleportation in flashes. It’s horrifying.

Had my longest sober streak this year, actually. And even though I regret my failure to continue it, I still take pride in it. It's quite a strange thing to realize that this month, despite of it being a very tough and lonely one for me, was the month where I had more sober days than drunk days. Overall I think I'm making progress, little by little.

I know many people here have amazing (several) year(s) long streaks, but I'm just starting up, and not drinking at all for 14 days was really something I haven't done in a long, long time. 

After my insomnia refused to cease and I ran out of sleeping pills, I struggled for a few days before caving in and relying on my ""self-medication"" which means getting drunk enough to be able to fall asleep. I didn't enjoy it. I didn't have fun getting drunk, but I felt lost and hopeless and very, very tired. I just wanted to sleep. I kept drinking for six days or so, but now I'm ready to quit again. I'm not drinking tonight, and it feels quite great, even though I worry I will have another night with zero hours of sleep and end up spending the holidays with my family nodding off. 

Luckily for me, my alcohol addiction is 100% about drinking alone. I find it very easy to decline alcohol in a social setting. My parents also have a lot of respect for sobriety, and even though my mother's boyfriend is quite a drunkard, he is always happy to go ""well, there is more for me, then"" and just hoard rest of the wine during dinner. I'm also excited about the holidays because the stores are closed here, so even if I had the temptation to drink, there would be nowhere to buy alcohol. There is none in my house, either. 

My girlfriend is finally returning from her month long trip to her home country in a week. She motivates and supports me a lot, which makes it even easier for me to have more and more sober days. The lack of her presence was the reason why I worried about this month for me, and why I'm quite proud of surviving most of it without screwing up terribly. Maybe my next streak will be three weeks long, or even longer.

Merry Christmas, everyone. I know the holidays are a very, very tough time for many. If this is your first sober Christmas in years, I hope it will be a great one.",3

It’s my biggest challenge in this whole sobriety gig because I constantly feel like I’m letting people down by not joining in on the ‘fun’ or adhering to the social contract. And they let me *know* that I’m letting them down. Subtly or not so subtly. It really makes me feel ostracised and isolated because I haven’t found a group of people to hang with that aren’t functioning alcoholics yet.

But - no one else is going to make my needs priority #1, so I have to deal with that discomfort and do it myself. Consistently. Constantly. With no exceptions. It’s hard but absolutely necessary to be selfish and put ourselves first. Especially challenging at this time of year but really always. I imagine though that it gets easier over time as people’s expectations of us change. Disappointment is driven by expectations not being met after all.

I don't want to. If I'm drinking I'm drinking all the way. Having 1 or 2 is very close to having none... and so I think I have to pick between none or too much. 

I don't think a lot of people are very moderate drinkers that I know. I don't think it's uncommon to struggle with being moderate. I think there's either drinkers or not. The non drinkers might have 1. Or they might have none. There isn't a difference to them. 

Me, I love to drink. I'll always have 3 or more. I'm ""worse"" than most people I know at this point of my life, but they don't really moderate either. If I'm having one, I might as well just have none. There's no difference between the 2 things, except the none option can't turn into 3+ where the just 1 can. 

I think that's why moderation isn't possible or desirable for a lot of people. I think that's why it's something I'm not good at.

So for now, just today, I'll settle for none. I don't need a label or a goal. None is as close to moderation as I will get at this stage of my life, and that's fine for me today.

I was sweating profusely, had the shakes and couldn't sleep through the entire night. At 7am on Friday the 6th I cracked a beer to just try and calm it a bit. I had a weekend away where I tried to keep my drinking down. 

I had my last drink on the 8th. I continued to go through lesser withdrawals over the next few days. 

This afternoon, after 15 days straight and clean, I went to the gym. I hadn't been for many months because alcohol rubbed out all the energy and ambition to do so. I'm also a 'pound packer' in that although I'm very English, somewhere I have Welsh genes that store any calories they can get their hands on. Show me a pint of beer and its going on me. So what I'm saying is I'm not some regular fit gym goer (although I do know what I'm doing) and I am way overweight due to my drink addiction despite an otherwise pretty healthy diet. 

I did fifteen Km on a stationary bike, 2 sets of 10 reps on three different upper body weight exercises, then swam 400m and had a steam to finish off. 

And I feel bloody fantastic. Just another thing alcohol robbed me of. Well, screw that, get out my way booze, I've got a world to interact with!

At first, I was like, this book is weird but I decided to stick with it. Some of you may like it as well. It is all about this woman's attempt at overcoming addiction (alcohol, drugs and bulimia). 

What it spurred me to (on the way to work today of all places) was to really try to take an honest, soul searching look at what it was in me (besides a genetic predisposition) that made numbing myself into oblivion in any number of ways beginning as a teenager an attractive alternative to not doing those things. 

What I started to let myself remember was painful - to the point where I felt both nauseous and like crying. I was an unwanted child. I was bullied and not popular in school. In high school, I found that the kids who acted out and used substances seemed to accept me - although to be honest, looking back, I don't think they really liked me, I was just outrageous enough to be part of the group. I built up a hardcore wall that let no-one see my hurt. I believe that it goes back to understanding on some level that my dad never loved me - or any of us really. He stayed, he supported us well financially, but he wasn't there on any meaningful level. When he got sober, when I was in my 30s, I think he tried. For some years, it was like getting a new father. But, he started drinking again, reverted to the asshole he was, and it eventually killed him - leaving me crushed with guilt because I couldn't fix him. 

At 7 weeks sober, I think I am, for the first time, opening doors and seeing the little girl that was unloved, bullied, maybe unlovable, and scared. Nobody knows the real me. It's frightening and hurtful, but it seems like it's time. Thanks for listening. IWNDWYT",11

I had an incredible experience at a Phish concert back in October 2018 that showed me that I was a full blown alcoholic, and that I had let the drug take over my life and alter my worldview. I pledged to stop.

I listened to the audiobook version of This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. I was blown away by her point of view and the science behind alcohol and what it really does to us.

I began to see the world of drinking for what it really was. I considered how in 1920 we signed the Volstead Act prohibiting the sale of alcohol because we saw what it was doing to our society. I began to understand how now, in America, we have unchecked advertisements of alcohol because it is a drug that keeps the public happy and somewhat content. We dress it up in pretty bottles and place them in dimly lit rooms, and it practically sells itself. It takes away a person’s ability to process emotions properly. It also takes away their emotional pain in a rigged system where not everyone can succeed no matter how hard you try. I see now that big tobacco, the hospitals, banks, insurance companies, everyone wants you to drink, because our entire economy depends on it. We pay to destroy our bodies so we can pay insurance for doctors to then save our lives. We then drink at home watching Netflix or playing video games while taking in the latest Bud Light commercials.

Our film, music, and television all depict glorified and idealized versions of what we want America to be. However real life is never like the pictures. It is only what we wish it was. It is because of this normalization that people who become alcoholics feel like they are some kind of outlier.

Let me be perfectly clear:

THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ANY OF YOU

We all are here because we have been sold a lie. We all got addicted to a highly potent and toxic drug. No wonder so many people have problems with it. We should never drink again, yes, but from the bottom of my heart, I truly believe no one here is broken or diseased in any way. It is our culture that is sick. The people in power who are diseased.

I believe that a higher level of thinking can be attained through breathwork and meditation, and from this it becomes easier to see the world for what it is. I implore you all, friends, unplug and look within. See what it is you can find.

Even though we have never met, I love all of you.

I find that my body craves something to replace those calories. Yesterday I drank a quart of chocolate milk in like 10 minutes. This wasn't the best decision and if I could go back in time I might consider balancing it out with actual food, but you get the idea.

Also on the bright side, the fucking TASTE of the food when you are craving it and haven't been drinking. Even regular boring dinners become way more flavorful.

I worked out that each month, on average, I was spending around 120$ on booze. Furthermore, nearly every 2 months I got so drunk I had to call in sick because of the hangover, which cost me 100$ in income each time.

Its crazy to think in a year I lost $2,000 a year on alcohol.

Been over 3 weeks since my last drink and everything has been going very well so far. Last night, I started getting anxiety about this family Christmas Eve party my wife and I always attend. I’ve always drank there and usually drink quite a few beers. Anyways, I couldn’t get this out of my mind so I tried going around for a drive but that didn’t help since I also had to put air in my tires so I wound up at the gas station. I bought a can of hard seltzer but didn’t drink it. I told myself if I can make it through 30 minutes then I could drink it and I kept repeating that process until it was bed time. It actually helped me knowing it was there and I *could* have it. I feel silly and guilty even buying it but I never intended on actually drinking it. Has anyone done anything like this before? It’s currently in my recycling bin but I don’t plan on dumping it down the drain until after Christmas Eve when hopefully my anxiety goes back down.",3

It feels kind of like time travel.,"It’s been about six months and pre-meditated slip at a wedding since I’ve had any drank. I’m visiting my family for holidays and staying at my moms house for the first time in a few years. Three years ago, I moved to NYC and started a new life. Kind of like an how did I get here? Moment. Honestly weird to recognize achievements I made while so lost. 

I was sitting in my mother’s living room and I felt like myself prior to becoming entrenched in my narrow perspective as a result of alcohol abuse; and I felt like “myself.” It’s interesting because sometimes I felt like I had lost connection with my younger self—which for many years I rejected shaped by insecurity, traumatic events as well as perceived failure and disappointment. Finally arriving at a place with the clarity to accept what I’ve been dealt and finding the beauty in things around me, being kind to myself and recognizing my own strength is the greatest gift I could ask for, and I gave it to myself.

it’s good to be back, feeling like me. 

The holidays are tough, especially for us who are in the wee moments of sobriety. Standing by my resolution to forgo alcohol has been the catalyst for metamorphosis into a more compassionate, elevated, receptive sense of self and everyone deserves this as we enter a new decade in a world that needs so much karmic TLC on a personal and social level. 

Happy holidays, sobernauts! I will not drink with you today.",2

I went to this girl's house, who I met in rehab lol, and she offered to get all the alcohol out of her house and everything but i knew i wanted to drink so i told her it was no big deal and i wouldn't drink even if it was there blah blah lying. So a few hours after I got there I was drunk again, on fucking hard seltzer, and even though it was a fun night I just feel like I can't do it now. I stayed over 2 nights and got drunk both times, even though she did stop me from getting drunk immediately after waking up when that's all I wanted to do. Then I stopped at a friend's house on the way home and we got drunk too. I wasn't drinking like I used to, like there was no liquor and I definitely didn't black out but still. And I'm controlling it right now I'm sober this morning and I reset the counter on my app and I'm gonna try again. But now I'm worried because I got drunk and the world didn't end. It doesn't seem like a huge deal even though I know it is. 3 months ago I was drinking a handle of vodka every day, all day, waking up covered in vomit and piss and blood and never remembering where I had been or what was happening. I lost my job and house and everything else. Scared away my girlfriend at the time.

And now after an expensive rehab, a month in sober living which I should have never left, and all the support someone could have - I couldn't even make it 3 months. I feel way less confident about avoiding the next drink. I know how I'll inevitably get. Shaking and dying. But the allure of alcohol is so great. It remains my favorite thing to do.

I made it through the afternoon and we watched a movie in the early evening and then 8 pm rolled around and I felt like I can’t take it anymore.

She asked WHY!? So told her, I just want one before going to bed. I thought I have been doing great so far and a single beer before bed won’t be any big deal...BTW, I still have three beers in my mini refrigerator in my office from the time I stopped. I haven’t got rid of them cause my wife likes to have one beer with her chicken wings when we make them which is like  once a month. Yeah, so I told her again, just going to have one. She took a deep breath and said, you do whatever you want, dude! She continued by saying, it’s not my choice, it’s yours. You want to break your sobriety and have a beer, then go right ahead. At the end of the day (literary) you’re your own man, do what you want. 

I went in telling my wife that I was going to have one beer feeling very strong and vindicated that I “deserved” one..... to getting her approval... to feeling stupid that I even brought it up. I suddenly got turned off immediately of having the one beer and so I didn’t. I took my dumbass to the couch and soon after to bed where a got a great nights sleep to now waking up happy as can be!

Cops were called, smelled alcohol on me and took me down to the station where I somehow managed to blow a .21, obviously getting me charged with a DUI. They told me I’d get some papers in the mail eventually.

Thing is, this is my second DUI where I blew a .21 in the past five months and I’m only 20 years old. You would think that the first DUI would’ve taught me a lesson, but it only sent me into a spiral of the ugliest relapse you can imagine. My attorney was working to get me into a program to get the DUI wiped from my record within six months, the trial for my acceptance into the program being in March. I haven’t seen him face-to-face yet, but he told me over the phone that I probably won’t be able to get into the program with this new DUI.

I don’t want to turn this into a pity party, because I’ve fucked up so badly and need to obviously face the consequences, but I’m so scared. I feel so unbelievably guilty and hopeless and am pretty seriously contemplating just ending it all. I know that this isn’t the end of the world, no one was hurt, but I can’t help the feeling that this is all my life will ever be. A defeatist attitude, but I’ve honestly never felt so low before.

What should I expect from all of this and what are your experiences with multiple DUIs? I’m mostly anxious about jail time, I’m certain that I can handle anything other than that.

Started a new job Monday (thanks for all the support and well wishes SD!) and had an intense, amazing, stressful, exhausting, awesome week.  

Supposed to do the 10 hour drive to visit my parents tomorrow for the holiday, and repeat that as a return trip on Saturday so that I can get to work on Monday.  Thing is, I don't want to go.  At all.  I got sick mid-week and by Friday definitely had the upper respiratory tract infection stuff happening.  My hesitation to go isn't the risk of drinking with family - it's the depression and anxiety that will be generated by the visit, and the potential bender that will happen when I return.  I feel it.

This morning when I work up after a good (sober!) nights sleep, I decided that I'm not going.  I feel horrible deciding not to go, but at this point I want to stay here, be healthy (*not drink!!!)*, rest, read, listen to podcasts, hit some meetings with my sober friends, and get ready for my week.  I'm going to raincheck this trip for when I'm feeling better, with more emotional bandwidth, etc.  But I still feel like a horrible son for deciding last minute to not go, to use ""I'm sick, can't drive"" as an excuse when really the reason I don't want to go is that I can't handle the emotional load right now.  I have a long way to go (therapy helps) but damn, man.  So, I picked up a few audio books on recommends from people here and this week I just want to sit on the couch with my dog, eat chicken soup, listen to audio books, and unfuck my life.  Thanks SD.",46

So everyone heads to the bar to start drinking while they wait for her. I was hungry, mad at this person for making us all wait, anxious about the situation, and now standing in the waiting area alone. I told my boss I wasn’t feeling well, and needed to leave. I know I don’t have to justify my choices, and leaving was the best thing for me to do at the time, but I can’t help feeling embarrassed about it. Like I let people down or something.

drink or not to drink that is the question 
My head was making all sorts of ifs and buts.
if they have my favorite wine  I will drink.
I brought vodka so I would be less tempted.
If I drink one nonalcoholic  seltzer than I will decide if I should switch to wine.
I will be the designated driver so I can’t be tempted to drink
But if I have wine I won’t have more than two so I can drive.
I’ll start the first hour of seltzer and then take it hour by hour.
Etc
about an hour into the party we hear a loud crash and go outside and there is a vehicle upside down. The man was stuck in his car and my friends( off duty cops, firemen and nurse)  had to climb In to cut  his seatbelt and pry the driver  out before the police and fire department arrived.
The car had hit my friends truck which slammed into my rear. My car slammed into the car in front of me. The drivers car  flipped over and landed on my car. It ended up being a four car accident although there was only one driver and one person in the car.
We were all so lucky. the driver was able to walk after we got him out of the  car and none of us are hurt. even though moments before we were in the road arriving to the party. 
 it feels very ironic...my biggest dilemma the hour before was deciding whether I should drink or not that night. turns out that the driver blew twice limit. he spent his night in jail his car was totaled. my car is probably totaled too but  but it’s all material things.  I did not drink that night.
 I will not drink tonight with you all 
because of this sub Reddit the support has gotten me to three weeks and I plan to keep going

Long 1st post here

day 2

This past weekend I snuck home to do shot while at work. I completely blew playing a set of music with my band at a local venue we really want to keep playing because i was wasted. I slept through half my families christmas party because i was half drunk and half wasted. I held back shameful tears while driving home after chugging a few strong beers to try to feel a little better physically. Then I layed down in bed and had a complete breakdown. My wife can be somewhat innocently oblivious so she wasn't sure what was going on. i turned to her and said i had to breakdown for a few minutes and had to talk. The most vulnerable i had ever been in my life i admitted everything. Not just from this weekend but that i could not control my drinking, had experienced withdraw symptoms and felt so gross about it, that i have been sneaking shots and replacing our liquors without telling her. I admitted it was a problem and i didn't thinking i had the choice but to stop altogether. I admitted this terrifies me because of how much drinking revolves around my social life and general life that i was used to. I admitted to idea of people walking eggshells or being nervous to drink around me once they found out felt terrible. I told her it was hard to admit and face because we are generally both successful and very happily married, i have recently gotten a raise, great reviews at work and encouraged to keep it up. People always talk about needing to hit bottom to change, and it just wasn't happening for me. She was super supportive and non judgemental the whole time and thanked me for telling her. she is also very emotionally blunt and plan oriented so we talked about steps and plans on whats next. I told her i was thinking new years, she called me on bargaining (her bluntness is one of the things i love about her, shes not mean but very honest.) I told her i was nervous about withdrawing and having a seizure or a heart issue. She told me if it comes to that talk to her and we can figure that out together. It was one of the hardest conversations iv ever had but was so incredibly liberating and took so much weight off my shoulders. Most of all now i feel accountable. I am excited for the future instead of living day by day. This brings me here. Have been lurking for a long time. I wanted to share again, if only to keep myself feeling accountable to. I didnt drink at all yesterday (sunday) had some shakes and sweats over night but generally felt/feel ok. I know work will probably be hard to get through, but i remind myself it was hard when i was faking through hangovers too. Thanks for listening, and being so supportive, whether directly or indirectly.",11

I had done pretty well earlier this year. Over three months of sobriety. Daily check ins, daily AA meetings, working hard on our land, staying as active as I could, and rediscovering hobbies I had long lost interest in. Most importantly, I was there for my family in the ways I had promised.

And then I stopped the first two, thinking since I had made it “that long,” I’d be fine on my own. And all of the other progress I had made, I lost overnight. Tried to put on a front that I was still fine, lying and hiding to my family and myself about my relapse.

I had told myself that somehow, in three months, I understood a few of the Twelve Steps. I know now that I have finally just hit step one.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK which have touched us this past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about secondhand or through the media. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

So, I have this cat who I adopted at the tail end of my drinking, right before the *last* time that I got sober. (Which is... almost five years ago now? Something like that. Happy anniversary, buddy.) He was about seven or eight when I got him. I don’t know anything about his past, because the cat rescue that I got him from  got him from the city’s animal care and control holding center.

But I can draw some likely conclusions about how he ended up in there after living with him. He’s a cat, so he is the embodiment of self-will run riot. And he firmly believes that he’s an indoor-outdoor cat. We’ve reached a sort of compromise where I agree to let him out the back every once in a while so he can go check things out, and he agrees not to make a break for it every time I go out the door.

This has mostly worked out well, but last week he decided to go on a walkabout and got himself stuck in a neighboring building’s fenced in, *yard* is a strong word for it, outdoor space. I could hear him through the fence, but it’s a pretty serious fence. I couldn’t see any way for me to get him back through it, so I walked around the block to see if there was any way to get back there from the sidewalk without being buzzed into the building (there wasn’t.) By the time I got back around he was gone.

So, that happened Monday night. It was fairly cold out so, even though he’s got a fur coat and fancies himself an urban outdoorsman, I was a little concerned. I called off work on Tuesday and did the whole *staple-gunning fliers to trees, contacting local shelters, placing a Craigslist ad, etc.* thing. 

The AoK was from everyone who I encountered in this process. People stopped to talk with me as I was putting fliers up. I got several texts from strangers with tips of places to look and also just general sympathy and well wishes. One of the rescue organizations did a Facebook post for him, and I had people contacting me through that with various tips and well wishes.

He was found by a young couple on Tuesday morning, and *they* spent the day getting supplies for him so he’d have a litter box and some food, and then they took him to a local vet to get scanned for a microchip. I got a call from the microchip registry and was able to get in contact with the people who had him through the vet’s office. The vet’s office was lovely. The people who had him were lovely, and they wouldn’t take any money, even just for the cost of what they bought.

After I got him back I took down the Craigslist post, had the Facebook post updated, and walked around and took all my fliers down. Or so I thought. But I actually missed one of the fliers, and yesterday morning I got a text from someone who had seen a cat fitting my cat’s description in one of the adoption cages at PetSmart. So I thanked them and found the flier and took it down. 

I was really touched by all of the kindness and support that I got from total strangers. People who could help offered their help freely, and people who couldn’t offered support. There are a lot of good people out there in the world who want to help.

Anyway, that’s me for the week. How about yourselves, any AoK you’d like to share?",29
2019-12-23 07:12:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eejvgb/can_feel_myself_slipping/,Can feel myself slipping,"Hi Friends,

In less than a week I will be 6 months sober.  When I decided to get sober if felt like such a scary leap but I knew deep down in my soul it was right for me. Even if others couldn’t understand. 

I don’t consider myself an alcoholic. I didn’t drink every day. I wasn’t someone who didn’t know when to stop. But I definitely didn’t use it in a good way. It was a crutch and helped numb my  sensitive self from all of my emotions.

I have noticed myself thinking about drinking again lately. I have thought about it for the last 4 days. I was telling myself it had to do with this time of year and work ends and just wanting to relax. But really there are feelings I am wanting to avoid. Stress I would rather forget about. Things I would rather not feel. The thought of “well it really wasn’t that bad” “I have come so far I could just enjoy one” “I am not an alcoholic so I should be fine” start popping up. I thought it would be a good idea to remind myself of the bad memories of what my drinking was actually like.

- I have tried for years to moderate. Gave myself a limit of 2 times a week I could drink but often broke that. It would just be a couple of wines. I remember a point though when I got promoted in my job to a position that wasn’t right for me. I had such anxiety and stress and I was drinking a whole bottle of champagne to myself multiple times a week and smoking a million cigs.
- A few years back I was dating a guy. I had a stressful night at work so I was getting drunk at home after my shift and invited him over. I woke up the next morning in bed with no recollection of how I got in bed and why I was naked. He has also gone home. I knew we kissed but I have no idea what else happened. It’s a horrible feeling not to remember what you did. 
- I remember there was one time I had a few vodkas at home after work during the week. I went to bed and my head was spinning and I got up and threw up. I was like shit! How am I this drunk on a work night?!
- I would have a couple of wines at night and then eat shit as I didn’t care after that. I would wake up at 3am and have heaps of water as everything was dry. My stomach would churnnnnn. This would happen every week. 
- I was dating a guy. Seeing him on and off for ages and was terrified to see him when I was sober. Every time I saw him I would have had a drink or would be drinking. I had known him for so long and yet this fear was so big. I was afraid if he saw me when I am sober and much shyer and quieter and more introverted he wouldn’t want me. He would think I am completely different. 

I can clearly see how my emotions have a direct affect of weather I want a smoke, a drink or chocolate. 

Almost 8 months off the cigs and almost 6 months off alcohol. It would be a shame if I slipped now.

2019-12-23 06:56:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eejq3u/feeling_the_pressure_to_drink_from_my_new_boss/,Feeling the pressure to drink from my new boss,"I’m in a new job about 6 weeks.  It’s an open plan office and I sit in between 3 people who drink tons and who love talking about it.  One of them in my new boss.

He seems to have his own drinking issue, but besides that I get the impression he doesn’t understand the concept that you can have fun without drink.  That you can entertain clients without booze.  He is very very booze focused in his life.  I’ve overheard him talking about how he doesn’t see the value of doing  Dry January, he boasts about thing that would be many people’s rock bottoms.  He is not going to change.

I’m very stressed about him finding out that I don’t drink.  His way of engaging with the team is to make fun of people.  He thinks he is creating a light and fun atmosphere but I hate it.  However I do believe that if I pulled him aside and told him I don’t appreciate something that he would take it seriously.  

I just don’t want him to ever know I don’t drink.  I think it would change how he feels about sharing his stories with his team.   I’m afraid he will say things like ‘oh sorry, I shouldn’t say that in front of you’.  I think he will perceive me differently and not consider me for the usual social events.  I also think he will make fun of me unless I tell him I won’t tolerate that.  And I don’t even want to have that conversation.  

Actually, just writing this out has helped me.  It seems I just don’t want to be the odd one out.  I don’t want to share this part of my life with this boss.  I don’t want to be known as the non-drinker.  Maybe I don’t see myself as a non-drinker.  Not sure if that’s a problem for long term sobriety or not.  

I have already ‘fake drank’ with him.  I poured water into a beer bottle and drank that.  I am constantly considering what it would be like to be a person who just nurses one alcoholic drink all night.  Like just to not make a scene.  I’m trying to envision what I thought of non drinkers when I drank a lot.  Is this what relapse looks like?  

I can fake a drunk when I can order myself and he is not right beside me but sometimes we take clients out and I’m asked at the table what I want to drink.  So it’s those situations where he knows I’m not drinking.  So far I have not explained myself when he asked ‘are you feeling ok’.  I just said ‘yes I’m fine thanks’.  But maybe I need to tell him I have a stomach ulcer or something.  

Writing think I know I just need to grow a pair as they say.  But it really stresses me out.  I don’t want to be that non-drinker.  I don’t want to share this with someone who will not appreciate it and will make fun of me.  

Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks for reading this far!",2

I've come to the point in my life where I need to take serious measures to curb my alcoholism and my gp referred me to a specialist who performs the naltrexone capsule insert operation which is meant to last for around 6 months, and apparently cravings for alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis are pretty much permanently gone thereafter.

I've done a cursory search for ""naltrexone"" on SD and I see one person has mentioned that they've lost appetite and sense of taste for food and bvverage.

People who use naltrexone, what are your experiences regarding this and to what degree does it affect?

Also, are there perhaps any further side effects that one should be aware of, bearing in mind that this capsule dissolves over a period of 6 months and I cannot ""just stop taking it"" if it makes me feel sick.

Christmas and New Year is a time that's often associated with loads of drinking. I'd make a solid wager that most of you reading this message used to use the holiday period as another excuse to get completely wasted. I certainly did. 

If you're just starting out at this time, you might find yourself extremely tempted. 

I'm here to herald some promising news by sharing my story. 

This is the third year in a row that I've had a period of sobriety. 

The first year, I thought there was no way I could do it. I drank non-alcoholic beer every night and copious amounts of junk food. Usually people lose weight when they stop drinking as much as I did, but I got fatter. I did about 3 months with a few drinks here and there. I immediately started drinking after that period. 

The second year I did 3 months with only one or two drinks. I dropped 13kg and got lean and strong. I was super happy and positive. Around Xmas I started convincing myself that I ""deserved to drink at this time because I've done so well"". I told myself narratives to make it easier to drink such as ""There's no chance of giving it up at Christmas"". I was back to the same old drunk by January. 

The third year (this year) I did another 4 month block without a single drink. I was happier than I'd ever been. Working out, writing, working and spending time with family. I ended up drinking for a couple or weeks. 

The start contrast between how happy I was previously, to how anxious, depressed and self-loathing I became in a matter of weeks was the last straw. 

Fuck alcohol and fuck moderation. 

Sobriety is too good to pass up and I've made th final decision to quit drinking for good. 

The reason I'm sharing this with you all is because I want anyone struggling to know, that no day sober is a waste of time. Learning how to experience life without numbing yourself, even for short periods is all immensely valuable. Every time you string together a few days or more sober, you're working out your sober muscle. It's all data and it all helps. 

If you told me I would give up drinking a few days before Xmas and new years 3 years ago I would have told you you were crazy. 

But here I am. I'm hosting my whole extended family for Xmas Eve dinner and I literally just bought all the booze for people without batting an eyelid. I've got a few soda cans and some non alcoholic beers for me. 

I feel extremely confident and happy, even though my counter is about 4 days officially. But it's really more than that, it's over 9 months in the last 3 years. 

I've been binge drinking and doing drugs since I was 13 years old and I'm not in my 30s. I never imagined I'd be sober, but I'm so grateful for my life and experiences. 

So my friends, keep giving it your best shot. If you're anything like me, you may fail over and over. But be kind to yourself and treat it all as a journey. 

Merry Christmas 🎄🎅☃️

This may be a little long. Sorry in advance but I’m trying to make it as short as possible. 

Maybe if I just wrote out my story and tell people I can get better...
Im pretty sure the longest I’ve gone without drinking in the last 9 years is 9 days. I’m 25 and I’ve been drinking since I was 13. I started drinking to cope through multiple traumas. A few months ago I finally realized that I was an alcoholic. Not in the sense of I drink every single day, but Im a binge drink until I pass out or blackout alcoholic.
I thought I was doing good since my last bad blackout in July. I stopped drinking hard liquor and enjoyed wine about 2 days a week. I thought that was great. Then I got down to only drinking on my Fridays, I’d drink a bottle of wine. I was proud of myself. I’ve been going through my S.A.D. 
Without even consciously thinking I wanted to get drunk, 2 weeks ago I went into autopilot mode for 3 days. The 3rd day I invited coworkers over after having a bottle of wine to myself. They brought vodka and I was drinking that. An hour in I blacked out. I’m not gonna go into detail what happened but because of my blackout I made a horrible mistake which in turn, made me suffer a trauma and I’ve been dealing with that since. It’s been 11 days. I don’t know the person that I am when I am blackout drunk. I’m not that person, I know I’m not. 😞 Today I’m very sad but I’m getting over it. I guess.

I know how to “healthily” cope but I never healthily cope...
Anyways, over the past 3 years, My blackouts have gotten increasingly worse, along with my hangovers. I’ve ruined my health and a lot of relationships... 
I’ve been trying to replace “Drink” with different activities. I’ve came to God, I try to read, listen to podcasts & sermons. Healthy stuff you know ? 
BUT then alcohol strikes again, and I find myself having the idea to have ONE drink. That turns into at least 4. 
I’m going to a meeting on Monday. Hopefully that helps but I’m still struggling with maybe I’ll have one drink for Christmas, one drink for New Years even though I know I shouldn’t because it probably won’t just be one. I want to stop. I need to but
I’m at war with my mind.

I have an amazing individual who sponsors me.  They are a billboard of what I want to mirror my sobriety.  Attraction rather then promotion, I saw the balance between a program of recovery, in which after 26 years they actively participate by attending meetings, work with a sponsor, reach out to other alcoholics , is in service, as well as has balance in all other areas of their life family, work, play etc.  My sponsor has the ability to understand ""How it Works"", we use the BB as the guide.

I have never had a more intimate relationship built out of trust and respect.  

One of the characteristics that attracted me to my sponsor was that they continued to work their program of recovery because of the""ism"".  Progress not perfection.

Background, I am dual diagnosed, 1.5 years old, rebuilding my life, working step 4 ... and overwhelmed most days with how busy it is actively participating in my recovery, being a productive member of society, rebuilding my life and family, dealing with courts etc.

My sponsor openly admits he has his own challenges (human).  They took on a service commitment that they knew was going to be a challenge for them personally with ""control"" issues, working with others ie. AA business mtgs.  They were generally pissy at the whole thing, I also participate and further pissed my sponsor off by questioning some irrelevant point (and it was, but I fixate, and obsess on things, restraint is a huge obstacle for me).

Long story short My sponsor fired me (told me I should find another sponsor), the scenario brought up things for them that there reaction to is to separate from ie they were angry with me not having their back, they got insulting and disrespectful etc.  I was out of line to an extent as we're they, but nothing in any way that couldn't be used as a teachable moment

One of the main reasons I chose this person was because of the fact that I am able to open up to them, I trust them, and I knew going in they were not ""perfect "" but they knew how to use the tools set before us outlined in the BB to work through difficulties and grow.  I just assumed if ever there was a conflict that we would be able to do that.  To run or quit cause of a little misunderstanding seems silly.  

To those of you who sponsor and have time here is the question.  So things come up from your past ie anger that are deep rooted, unresolved etc that merit ""firing"" a sponsee?  To me the situation on the outside wasn't that big of a deal, but it was for them  I would like to keep my sponsor but not at a hinderence to them I want it to be a positive experience for both.

Reading through some posts, a lot of things ring extremely true. I can definitely accept that I have an issue with alcohol. Although, I disregard that acceptance far too often.

What I’m hopefully looking for, is a little advice. I’ve struggled for a long time - with both alcohol and other substances. 

The partying and drugs have taken the back seat over the last few years. I’ve been in a relationship for 5 years - we did a little partying for a while... but our lives and careers have taken us to place that this is not a common occurrence any more. 

Having said that, my career is very drink focused. I work in the hospitality industry. My partner did as well, but moved into a different industry a couple of years back.

To say I’m interested in alcohol is an understatement. I love flavour profiles, the history, the craft, the stories - learning about it all. I get to create cocktails, try wine for a new menus, constantly have reps bring new products to get on our lists. I guess this can be tied back to finding any excuse??

I’ve taken a huge step back. I no longer binge every day (10-20 drinks a day + other substances) But I still drink every day (today has been a slow 6 - beer, beer, cocktail, whisky, whisky, whisky). I’ve just recently quit smoking... 3 weeks this Thursday just gone. I’m 32 and have smoked since 16. I’ve tried to stop so many  times, but this time it just seems to stick. There has been no rhyme or reason to this. Just cold turkey. It’s made me start to think about the rest of this.. My partner has always hated me smoking, and maybe that had played an underlying part in this? She also hates how much I drink. She hates the blackouts. Coming home and passing out. Not remembering conversations. Spending the day hungover. Have been a bit of a smart ass dick at times as well. 

My drinking is a lot more “controlled”, but it’s still there. It’s always been there. 

I guess I’m just hoping to find out what you all have used for tools to combat this. What’s helped. Anyone who works the industry and stays sober?

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!


I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.


It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!


This pledge is a statement of intent.


Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!


What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.


What this is:


A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.


What this isn’t:


A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

You were absolutely on fire yesterday SD! What a great bunch of check ins :)

One concept I hear about in recovery is *rigorous honesty*. I've heard lots of opinions on what this means, and how to apply it to life in an effort to stay sober. I drank for years after having a ""slip"" nearly 9 months into my first real good stretch of sobriety, and when I finally put the plug in the jug last December I needed to be honest with myself about *what* the problem was, if there was a solution, and how to gain it.

That rigorous honesty with myself has helped me realize that alcohol was both a problem and a solution, but that there were better solutions for the problems alcohol solved for me (confidence, quieting my anxiety, shame and guilt, boredom) and there was also a solution to the problem of alcohol itself and my inability to stay away from it.

Most of those solutions lie in connecting with what I adoringly refer to as the greater spirit or sometimes universal divinity, but what is really just a cute way of saying *getting out of my own head* and also connecting with other people who have the same struggles as me. Every time I talk to someone on here, it's another brick in my sober super structure.

Thanks for checking in, and keeping me sober! IWNDWYT!",76

I feel like my anxiety is on shrooms.,"I don’t even know where to begin with this post or what to include. My father was a serious alcoholic who has no one and no contact with any of his kids, my mother allegedly had a drinking problem before I was born, and it’s just everywhere in my family. I guess that’s what I get for being of Slavic descent. I used to moderately drink, and I never felt an addictive pull before so I figured I lucked out in terms of that hereditary addiction. Until now. 

It snuck up on me in a way I really did not expect. I always did my best to avoid drinking when I was sad or anxious or angry because I figured that’s where you saw the seeds of addiction. As using it as an escape. I think I was using it as an escape and didn’t realize it. I do have some trauma like everyone else. But I figured I had a good handle on it via therapy and just my own personal work.

The past few months I’ve been socially drinking A LOT. Since it was fun and with good company, I didn’t really think much of it or saw it as a problem. If anything, I really liked that I was learning more about beer and actually starting to taste the difference between different ones. And then a few months ago, I didn’t drink for day. My anxiety, like it is right now, went insane. Worse than it has been in years. I didn’t catch on what the cause might be in until I thought to myself without any prompting,”God I really need a drink...”. But still, I didn’t want to fully admit to myself what was going on. I figured the anxiety was mostly due to some relationship miscommunications at the time, and much of that anxiety went away once I had that conversation with my boyfriend. “See? No alcoholism here!” I thought to myself. “Just relationship things! You’re fine keep partying!” 

And so the partying and drinking continued, with hangover jokes where applicable. The past few weeks, I’ve been having strong cravings. Never had that before. Friday at a party drank a LOT and did DMT for the first time. Woke up Saturday feeling like my brain was ripping apart. What did I do? Yep. Drink more beer! 

So today I decided to not drink at all. And my anxiety is back. Other than that one stint mentioned above, my anxiety hasn’t been this bad in years. I’m in practical tears. I’m Getting sick. I need water but I can’t drink for some reason. I looked in the mirror last week and saw my father staring at me. And not because I have always been his spitting image. But because my cheeks had that drunken redness his always had, my face just so hungover and done like his was.

Just putting two and two together the past few months and while I am fairly certain I have a drinking problem, I am 100% certain that I rarely have problems unless I am drinking. If I am not a high functioning alcoholic, I am definitely very close to becoming one. It just is so fun. I am more sociable. Everyone is so affectionate and loving. Beer is like potato chips for me: I cannot stop at just one. And I used to hate beer!!!! Always a vodka person. Now it just makes me too emotional.

I have to put a stop to this now, and not listen to the voice in my head that tells me I am being too dramatic. I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I am very grateful for my life and consider myself very lucky. But the creepy, violent, alcoholic dad part? That SUCKED, haha. 0/10 would not recommend. 

I don’t know why I am writing this. Maybe because I just need to get it out. Thank you for reading.",6

I am a little excited as well because I was getting tired of living with my parents (I'm 24) but I did realize that it did provide me a place of comfort. It also allowed me to avoid alcohol ever since I have stopped drinking.

So long story short, I am in a doctoral program and since I got tired of driving the long commute, I felt it would be much more convenient if I lived in the surrounding campus area. The issue is that my classmates, especially the ones who live in the college town, are HEAVY drinkers. Like really heavy, borderline binge drinking (in my opinion). The two roommates that I will be living with also drink too but not as heavy compared to the other classmates. 

What I have been doing ever since I stopped drinking is avoiding these hangouts because I know that all they do is drink. Hell, even one of my classmates told me that ""there's nothing to do here except to drink"". The odd thing is that some of my classmates thinks I'm going through some ""crisis"" because I stopped hanging out with them, which did kind of annoyed me because they all know that I stopped drinking (I made it public in class) and I don't want to be tempted, especially this early in my sobriety. 

Well, now that I will be living there, I feel that it'll harder for me to navigate. Not only that but there is someone in my program who I have gotten into a horrific disagreement with who lives in the area too. She gives me major anxiety.

Half of me is mad that I stopped drinking at this time because this is the perfect opportunity to use alcohol as a crutch and to spend time with my classmates. However, the other half of me is happy that I stopped because I knew that drinking with them would only exacerbate my problems.

I was thinking of going to the AA meetings for the first time in the area. I was thinking that maybe that could help me. Sorry for this long post by the way everyone, IWNDWYT!",2

I was up at 730 with my daughter, fed her breakfast, got in the shower and headed to church. One of my wife’s friends invited me so I thought I’d give it a shot. Anything to help me change up my life and make it easier to stop drinking, right? I haven’t been to church on my own in probably 20 years, and it was pretty great. The sermon today was about how we are all imperfect, and while I’m not 100% on board with the God and Jesus thing, there were plenty of points made that really hit home and that I’m going to try to apply to my life to aide in my decision to be alcohol free. After church I got home, picked up my wife and daughter and went Christmas shopping at the mall. After the mall we dropped the baby off with my wife’s parents and my wife and I actually went on a date where I didn’t drink!! In the almost 8 years we’ve been together, I don’t know that that has ever happened. She is still very upset with me because of my drinking, and rightfully so. The only thing that will keep me a part of her life as her husband is that I completely stop drinking. But now I’m at home, the baby is asleep, and hopefully my wife and I will relax and watch a movie and try to connect and bond and rebuild this marriage that I let my alcoholism destroy.

I had a lot of issues with my parents growing up and alcohol definitely played an increasing role in my lice related to these anxieties. 

Fast forward several decades, parents retired and brother and I into 30s. Im not sure how or why this happened, but they now love alcohol and all they want to do is drink during holidays. 
Im floored how this happened. Maybe they saw that my brother and I turned out relatively ok and now they can “let loose”. Im terrified to tell them that I have a problem because I feel like I will worry and upset tthem.

(in bullet points),"I know there are many of you who have much longer term sobriety- and I'm also interested in hearing about that, but as someone who struggles with making it past 3 months of sobriety- I'm just wondering what your process was- in making it to a year? 

&nbsp;

I like the idea of never drinking ever again. But in my beginning stages of desiring to quit- I find smaller goals more tangible and rewarding mentally. Like a year sober is impressive to me. And I find solace in the thought that- the more sober days- the better, each day counts for something. 

&nbsp;

I used to not like drinking, and when I started I didn't even like it- but I did it- to cope with the fact that I had a stroke at age 24 that caused permanent brain damage, which changed my life in a big way, and is still difficult to deal with and come to terms with. I'm almost 28 now and have been drinking around 8-10 5.5% beers a night in a row (98% of the time) ever since (with ups and downs).

&nbsp;

Currently the biggest rewarding element for me- that is immediate- is getting a good nights sleep and waking up the next day with no regret; and being aware of that ahead of time when I have the urge, which is primarily at night.",4

2019-12-22 18:38:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eec7bn/well_i_drank/,"Well, I drank","So. In the last year I’ve had 11 beers, over four days. My sober date *was* 1/7/19. Then three weeks ago my new coworkers invited me to go out with them for the first time, I wanted to feel included and get to know them so I went. I was peer pressured into ordering a beer. I could have said no, but I thought fuck it I’ll have one, why not, and I want to fit in. 

This last week at work was really rough. Tonight on the way home I stopped at my local bar for dinner and I had three beers. I pass this bar every time I go anywhere, it’s very close to my house.

This time last year I was still in rehab. I probably didn’t really need to go to rehab. Well, if I had been mentally healthy I wouldn’t have needed to. But the severity of my mental illness was driving my drug and alcohol use so I couldn’t stop on my own. Technically, I still didn’t fully stop when I got out, I had 7 beers between getting out and January 7th.

I feel the effects. The euphoria. But it really doesn’t feel that euphoric. I’m not sure if it’s because of the associated guilt or how depressed I’ve been for the last few weeks, but it just doesn’t feel great. I honestly feel more euphoric when I eat chocolate and ice cream. I wanted to be able to drink healthily but for me I don’t think there even is such a thing, and I don’t think the stress of trying to maintain that balance is even worth it at all!

I still want my sober date to be 1/7/19... Or is it actually 11/26/18? That’s the day I stopped drinking daily. If that was the date it’s already been over a year. I don’t know. What even counts as a relapse? As a slip? Do you reset the clock every time you have a single sip or only when you return to old patterns?

Anyways, I don’t think I’ll drink again. I definitely won’t be drinking after the holidays. I’m taking a break from my diet (down 34/40 pounds already!) this month but after Christmas I’m hopping back on the diet wagon... And I suppose back on the sober wagon too.",6

I decided in the end that I will attend as a sign of progress to myself regarding my PTSD.

I had a massive panic attack before going and knew that I was going to drink. My brain had already convinced me it would be impossible to do it sober, which is actually true at this point due to the fact I find everyday situations incredibly frightening anyway. It was an excuse, but also aided me in doing something I havent done in over 2 years.

The night was a success, it was amazing seeing how many people missed me and told me that they were proud of me for getting to where I'm at now in terms of my mental illness. I had great catch ups, I met new faces, the music was good, the energy was nice, but obviously, I was drunk. And the longer I was drunk, the more the real drunk me was coming back fast, I started feeling incredibly sensitive and depressed. I felt totally alone in a room full of people.

I've woken up today with a proud SO and proud friends, telling me how amazing it is that I could even attend a party drunk or not. But the hangover, fuck. Honestly, at this stage I can't even appreciate the leap I took yesterday and it feels like it is the last thing I'd want to do again. Yeah it was 'fun', but today all I can think about is every interaction I had. Over thinking every emotional conversation, I feel absolute shame for basically no reason. I'm fighting off panic attacks from the hangover in general, but the thoughts at this point are overwhelming and I feel unstable.

I have to stop drinking. I want it now more than ever. I don't know how I'm going to achieve it, I don't know a life without substances. I have to break the cycle in my family, I have to be healthy, I have to be a good partner and build a future with the love of my life. I'm terrified, but I know it needs to be done. The fact I can't even think positively about yesterday and instead feel utterly shite about everything shows the gig is up. Alcohol doesn't even help me escape anymore. It doesn't make me forget, it doesn't make me accept. It's literally down to breaking the habitual nature of it. I know I don't WANT it anymore.

At least I had the sense to stay the night. 

Drove home this morning home still drunk. 

Don't remember how the evening ended. 

Threw up when I got home. 

Slept the sleep of the anxiety ridden. 

It's so weird I still look healthy from not drinking for nearly three months but feel like utter shit physically and mentally. 

Trying not to hate myself too much. Is difficult. 

I really think my friend gifting me some weed, then running out of it, sent me down this path. After spending the week stoned and then being out of it, had me searching for mind altering substances and the fuck its.

It is so awful to be hungover.  YUCK

I know it hasn’t been even 48 hours but I’m trying to be optimistic. I’d been drinking heavily, daily for the past decade or more. A six pack turned into 9, turned into 12, turned into a fifth of gin a day. Recently I’d been drinking 16oz of Jack everyday, sipping on it from the time I got up till I passed out 8 hours later. I was constantly angry & paranoid. My face puffy, my hair dull & falling out. Digestive system in shambles. All of that is still there but my face is less puffy & while my sleep is crap, I’ve taken my 3 day weekend to try & get on a schedule without work or social obligations getting in the way. 

I’ve started cleaning house & organizing my desk. My husband hadn’t said anything to me about it until this afternoon. He gushed about how much work I’d gotten done in the last 2 days & that I look happier. He asked if I’d been drinking less. When I told him I hadn’t had a drink since we went to bed Friday morning he hugged me & said how proud he is of me. 

In the past few months I’d tell myself I’m not going to drink today but then I’d find myself in the drive through. Frikkin autopilot. But Thursday after work I went the way where there are no liquor stores or even gas stations along the way & just drank the 3 beers that were in the fridge. Went to bed for a few hours then got up & started cleaning house, now here I am; about to go shopping for things to organize my garage. 

Wish me luck.",47

My life has completely changed from being depressed all the time, racked with anxiety, angry at the world and isolated from friends and family into one where I look forward to the future and the amazing things I can achieve and accomplish.

Since my last drink I've knocked down sources of my anxiety, be it friends that fell out of touch, family I've ignored or disconnected from, being lost in my career and its future and even friendships that could have been but I procrastinated on developing because I'd rather fulfill the short term gain of escape rather than make an effort. 

I've committed to improving myself physically and mentally and made strides toward both. And with the conquering of each thing that made me anxious and drove me to escape into a drunk semi-reality I get more confident and take more risks socially to make lasting and close friendships. 

I'm making this post only because last night I was stressed out enough that I wanted to escape to that alcohol-induced reality again. My normal coping method of meditation or visualization didn't work and I was close to breaking until two friends reached out to me, one to whom I vented my stress to and she listened and told me it was going to be okay. The other because she was interested in learning more about music and wanted my recommendations for types of trance and psytrance artists. Between speaking with both of them in the middle of the night and getting my mind of the current stressor did I realize that this was the result of all the work I've put in thus far - I've tried to be a caring, always-willing-to-listen friend who helps people through tough times and stressful times in their lives I was blessed to be on the receiving end.

I taste things so much more! I didn't realize how much alcohol affected my taste buds. I can't believe how yummy everything is! I'm really enjoying good food and desserts, and yummy nonalcoholic drinks.

My anxiety is so much better. I didn't realize how much worse alcohol made my anxiety. I don't get heart palpitations anymore, I don't feel the anxiety in my body, my chest, my neck and jaw anymore like I used to all of the time. It became my new normal. I can deal with stress now and I don't need a drink. I was so used to it I didn't even realize how bad it was.

My whole body feels so much healthier! My skin is so healthy, my digestion, my periods are actually lighter and my cramps aren't as bad, my hair is healthier, I'm losing weight yet eating whatever I crave and enjoying it so much with my new improved taste buds. And exercising is so much easier so my body is getting stronger everyday. I'm turning back the clock. I feel amazing. Like I have super powers! 

I realize I'm way more of an introvert than I ever realized. I knew alcohol helped with my social anxiety, but pretty much my entire social persona was created by alcohol. I've been drinking pretty regularly since I was 15 and I'm 39 now. Without alcohol I'm very anti-social. I like to be alone. People drive me crazy. I don't know if that's good or bad but that's one thing I really noticed. Without alcohol I can't handle people that much. I have a sweet little family though so they are all I need. It's like that episode of South Park when they need the serum just to deal with people and the serum is Jameson LOL! 

I'm a much better mother. My relationship with my children and husband has improved tremendously. I just have this warm fuzzy feeling in my heart, everything is so great right now. We are all so happy. 😁🤗

I never want to drink again. I feel amazing! Alcohol was the cause of pretty much all of my problems. It was making everything much worse. I'm so thankful for my sobriety. 

Good luck out there everybody! It's so worth it. Thank you so much for all of the support so many of you have given me. 😘 IWNDWYT",47

Not that smell when it's a fresh poured glass of wine but that smell when it's metabolising and you're dehydrated and have a headache and anxiety and are dreading the morning. 

So I feel confident I can go a couple more days and the next challenge is Christmas day itself.

Being sober I've been able to rekindle my love of Sci-fi, and kick serious ass operating my small business. I landed a big contract for us, and things are really looking brighter with each day.

Today I was walking out of the grocery store and my brain went “you know what sucks?? Not having wine” just completely out of nowhere. 

This has been happening a lot more lately and I know it’s likely due to the upcoming holiday festivities. I made it through sober last year with no problems, but this year it’s like my brain is working extra hard to get me to drink again. 

Whenever I relapse, I do it without a second thought. I act quickly so that I can’t change my mind. I’m just a bit worried that whenever I start to have these “I wasn’t THAT bad” thoughts that I’ll relapse very soon.

The first two years of sobriety were OK. I mean, my anxiety was gone, my marriage was on the mend, I felt like I'd been pulled from a rip current; but upon getting pulled into the life boat and catching my breath; I came to see my life for where it really was and it fucking sucked.

 I was piss poor, I had no clue what even defined me anymore. I spent my 20's and half of my 30's investing my identity into my occupation and my income. It was a decent plan, I could have a life of general shit, but if I was doing well at work, I could bury the reality of my 'state of reality' by the fact I was 'successful'...solid plan, until I started to suck at work...then, even though I had some great things in my life - kids were becoming productive young pre teens, my wife was getting promoted at her work, finally getting her own identity (that could be a whole other post, fuck, a whole other sub - the shitty life of the addicts spouse, where they're forced to be a part of the addicts entourage..I digress)...

 But, since work sucked (and money was tight) I couldn't enjoy any of it. It was the most torturous part of my addiction. Booze only provided a break in my anger, no longer a joy, or even a respite. People say they drank to forget, but when I drank all I could do was remember what a failure I had become, and the bigger storm brewing. Something felt wrong, but I had no idea how bad it was..

A year ago I sat and thought to myself how some things were so much better, but I still had so many unaddressed things, and I still felt my worth through my literal worth, and my literal worth was $0+/-. I remember being like, why do we celebrate sobriety. I don't celebrate the amount of time since I last shoplifted, or last killed someone (never happened!) , or last had a smoothie. Why do we celebrate or even give a shit. Life isn't to be remembered for what we quit, but rather what we did, and what we left.. I decided I'd have one more  'monitored' year, where I'd care about the length of my sobriety,but at the end of the year, all I wanted to care about was the quality of the sobriety. What did I do that was better really than being a drunk (yes, anything is better, but I was in a bitter place..it'd been 2 years, where's my fucking yellow brick road!!?, I was a regular AJ Soprano..)

But, to my pissy surprise, things happened different this year. I really forgot about all of the landmarks of success that my ego had created. I stopped keeping track of where I was relative to my colleagues. I stopped even looking at my year to date income. I genuinely only cared about where I felt I was, compared to my general disposition (which honestly, as a sober person was fairly sunny. I get bitter sure, but in general I'm calm and looking forward to what's ahead, when that is off, time to figure out why..). Keeping tabs of myself relative to my emotional baseline, and just only allowing myself to be surrounded by the things of realized were truly important to me, had finally become a part of me. It was like ""fake it til you make it"" met a William James essay.

Slowly..ever so slowly, it changes. It's worth it, I'm worth it. I get it. 

So, yesterday I said goodbye to my 3rd full year of sobriety. I don't care to celebrate it or even track it anymore.

I hope to be a returning member of this sub.

I've been drinking for two years now, it never actually was a habit untill I turned legal. It's consistant availability and the low up front cost drove me to get more and more. I never saw my self as an alcoholic or a heavy drinker, I just chalked it up to being young, in college, and not used to drinking. Before long I got into a relationship with a girl who I love very much, and she turned 21 a couple months into dating. We both went to the bar weekly, and drank regularly. Some nights ending in me getting sick and passing out in various places. She eventually stopped because it wasn't for her, and hasn't drank but maybe a glass of wine since. I however kept drinking. More frequently she'd come home to me passed out naked, or belligerently drunk and being an ass. I came to find I get angry when drunk, which I am never sober, I'm calm and shy as a person. I had two incidents, one last night where I was drunk and angry and destroyed some items in my room, right in front of my girlfriend. It was so bad she drove an hour to stay with her mom. Over time alcohol has started to control me, and make me a monster who barely represents who I am. Ive been saying I'm going to get sober for some time, but now I actually WANT too, and not for anyone but myself. This morning I woke up and poured the remainder of liqour down the drain. It was hard, especially with being top shelf and costing me so much. Im making a pledge to stay sober, starting with today. And hopefully the next, and then the next. I know it may not happen tonight, but today marks the start. I will not drink today.",19

2019-12-22 11:59:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ee765f/i_finally_hit_rock_bottom_literally/,I finally hit rock bottom (literally),"I am on my 5th day sober (4th day if you count initial hangover) but here’s a cautionary tale for you all. TLDR at the end 

It was the Tuesday after classes (the 17th - 5 days ago) and I went out to my local spot and had drinks with friends to celebrate the end of a semester. I had only had about two margaritas (like next to nothing for me normally) and I went down stairs to pee as I had done hundreds of times before. And then I tripped. I wasn’t really that drunk my shoe just caught it weird or it was icy I’m not sure. But down I went. I managed to catch myself fairly well - I have only a few small bruises but I have a pretty big bash on my left eyebrow. I didn’t lose consciousness or anything but was promptly ordered to pay my tab and made to leave since they thought I was too drunk (despite seeing me consume much more alcohol and be more competent many times before). My friends confirmed to me that pre fall I was quite fine. 

So I went home and did what most of us used to do - polished off the rest of what I had at home. On Wednesday I remember next to nothing other than that my boyfriend said goodbye to leave for the weekend and I think I drank more and my best friend tried to take care of me but she also had to leave. Thursday I felt probably the worst I’ve ever felt. I felt like I was swimming in a fish tank despite not drinking. Thursday night into Friday I was terrified to sleep. I fell asleep initially but woke up feeling so awful. I could barely move I had to focus on breathing and I stayed awake from 1am until 7am because I was so scared that if I fell back asleep I might actually really die. But I couldn’t do anything about it. 

Now for some of you this may sound like a really bad bender - but some of you may have guessed what comes next. 

Friday I slept most of the day (shocker) and my bosses boss called me around 3. I had not answered emails or calls since I had told them about my fall on Wednesday. He told me I should go to the doctor and that they would see me after the holiday (thank god I didn’t also lose my job). After that I fell back asleep for a while before finally rallying the energy to shower and ask my dad to find a place that was covered by our insurance (I’m 22) for urgent care. I stupidly decided I felt okay enough to drive myself instead of take an Uber (I live in America and thus can’t afford an ambulance). I made it there and after waiting around and being seen I was told I had a concussion, luckily no long term brain damage seemingly but to come back if it wasn’t getting better. I was told not to look at screens for at least 24 hours and to basically sit in a dark room and do nothing or sleep. I have since done that. Still don’t feel great but I’m getting better slowly. Basically just sleeping all day 

The reason I’m writing this is that sometimes your worst doesn’t come when you expect it. I’ve drank tons more many times sometimes days in a row but this is my low. So if someone out there is thinking well I wanna stop but I haven’t hit my low point let me tell you it doesn’t always come when you are at your worst. 

TLDR went out for drinks with friends after finals, 2 drinks in I tripped on stairs and hit my head - drank afterwards for 12ish hours, almost died, went to the doctor 2+ days later and have a concussion

I know I cant control others - hell, I dont even want to control others. But I'm finding that when I'm around people who are drinking / doing drugs / whatever, I feel so alone. And left out. 



And I know I have to get over that left out feeling but it nags at me. 


My partner doesn't drink much but is a big smoker/ likes mushrooms, party drugs / ketamine. 


Im having trouble with these two questions- 
1) can I call myself sober if I still use recreational substances time to time? 
2) my partner's uses of those things and me



Tbh recreational drugs arent really my jam; I far prefer alcohol to manage my anxiety and mental illness. But it became a problem so I had to stop.. my fear with doing these other drugs with my partner is that they will just become a new vice to distract and numb out. For my partner, he uses them to have a good time and sometimes i feel jealous about that - how he can use substances and not regret what he has done the next day. He doesnt have a personal or family history of drug addiction (I do) so our perspectives on these things are very different. I feel left out when people can do these things and not have it destroy their life. And it's a crappy, confusing way to feel. 


Anyway - last night we had plans to attend a party. And I asked if I could do a small amount of molly with him. He was into the idea and got some. Tbh I didnt really want to do it but I wanted to ""fit in""/ not be left out / have a good time with him. 



I fell asleep in the car before the party and told him I'll be in 30 min. During that time, he took some mushrooms and I was pissed because I thought we made a plan to do molly together and he was supposed to drive us home.... so it wasnt looking possible anymore. And I'm surprised by my reaction. I felt very hurt and left out. And this conflict just illuminated that I dont even want to be high / on substances anymore; I actually want to enjoy life being sober. But I want to experience that with other sober people and at least some of the time. 



Last night, I started feeling like being sober doesn't even matter when I dont have any sober peers to surround myself with. I was very close to getting a drink and going to back to the party & feeling like ""okay if I drink, then I wont feel alone and I'll have fun"". 



But instead I slept in the car and basically cried myself to sleep because I knew I couldnt throw away 37 days of sobriety for a stupid fight. 



I'm just wondering how people navigate these issues? Where you partner isnt sober and you dont have a sober community & you feel alone. Thank you.",2

Now it's watching my child grow..I went to his first Christmas program on Friday and saw him sing with other kiddos on stage. He's amazing. 

It hasn't been all good and I've had those pesky thoughts creep in from time to time, but I've never caved. I just need to remember those all day hangovers, the digestive hell, the shame, loss of dignity, there's so many things that keep me away from it. But the biggest one is not being present for my son. We have a bond that no one can compare to. when there's a problem he wants me and only me, and I want to be totally coherent at all times to make sure I'm there when he needs me.

So I haven’t posted in a few days but I have been reading and commenting pretty much every day. Last night I had drinking contemplations. I really wanted that allusive “one drink”. I feel like I schemed it up pretty easily and could have sold myself on it but thankfully did not. 

At the height of desire, I decided to go for a run. 6 miles later and I would say the desire was gone but the thoughts about it remained. 

At the time it popped up I was listening to This Naked Mind Podcast and the guest was talking about how her husband drinks NA beer and will occasionally have a real beer. My brain was like “you drink NA beer, you could totally do that.” 

Later on, I was grabbing dinner and saw a friend’s car parked outside of a bar and was really tempted to go in and have one. Since I had my dinner in the car, it was pretty easy to resist the temptation but it was still there. 

I guess all this to say, I navigated this craving and series of thoughts and feelings without feeling too close to relapse. I would say if relapsing is 100% on the scale of temptation, I was probably only ever at 20%. But it still scares me that I entertained it for several hours, off and on. Like what happens if I get those thoughts on a day when I’m stressed out?",4

The next morning the cravings were gone and it's been fairly simple since.

I'm still having issues with remembering embarrassing things I did.  I think this is one significant factor that kept me drinking.  I've been trying to deal with it and not let the emotions the memories bring about take over.  Luckily I am not craving, I just think about booze now and then.

Our past is filled with stories that I can't believe we made it through.  I guess I was just too drunk to realize how fucking tired of me she was.   


When I was at the height of my addiction, I was never drinking for the reason I stated, or in the quantity I stated.  It wasn't about the football game.  Or the party.  Or the night out with the boys.  Or the stress at work.  Or any thing else under the sun.  It was only about the alcohol.  I was constantly chasing oblivion - never even satisfied when I drank myself unconscious.    


Thinking about that now is interesting.   I'm coming up on 11 months sober next week, and it's only because I quit buying what I was selling, and sometimes that means not buying what your own mind is selling you.  Addiction is brutal because it lies to you in your own voice.  


I don't want just one drink at a Christmas party.  I don't want just one drink as a reward.  I don't really want to moderate.  It's about the alcohol.  It was then, and it is now.  Relapse starts in the mind.  When the temptation of using pulls at you, do yourself a favor, and don't buy what you're trying to sell yourself.

It was a large part of me flirting with the idea of stopping what I was doing. I don't think I'd be at almost 5 months dry w/out y'all. I've since spent 140+ days coming here sometimes for motivation and sometimes for comfort. I've been reading a lot of cues to add my own bits to the conversation, so here goes.
I never had a problem with drinking until I really, really did. I had a (what I now think was at least partly alcohol-fueled) panic attack in March and that kinda threw me for a loop. I never saw myself or my experience of reality as being so fragile. After that I took a couple weeks off to reset, but figured it was a fluke and went back to my old ways of enjoying socializing like I always have. But my hangovers and full blown paralyzing anxiety attacks became the same thing. I finally had a morning after where I was convinced my heart was going to explode / I was forgetting how to breathe / I was losing my mind. I had to take a serious break. A plan to stop for 30 turned into 60 and then 90. Now with some perspective I can look back on how strange my life was. It was normal for me to accost a stranger with awkward conversation. It was normal for me to eat 6 ibuprofen in a day. It was normal for me to fall asleep and then wake up in a hamper of dirty clothes. It was normal for me to sweat through my sheets. It was normal for me to have no idea how I got home. It was normal for me to sneak shots by myself while actively hanging out with a group of friends. It was normal for me to provoke and tease people bigger than me because I felt small. It was normal for me spend my last $75 on a bar tab. It was normal for my life to be a disaster.
I don't think I realized how exhausting poisoning myself as a pastime had become. I worry I've done permanent damage to my brain, and absolutely believe I've experienced some of the worst symptoms of PAWS (0/10 recommend). I have to remind myself that my worst days today are 1 million times better than my best days 140 days ago. I live in a town where drinking can disguise itself as an innocent community building activity, and that's sometimes annoying. But now that my days are 72 hours long now, I'm discovering new activities all the time. I've been forced to spend a lot of that time with myself, and therapy has helped with that. Since quitting booze, I've also quit weed and nicotine and dating apps. I feel like I'm growing and moving forward in a way that I haven't since perhaps high school. This short stretch of sobriety has been some of the hardest work I've ever done, but easily the most rewarding too. I can't thank this community enough for helping me see just how possible all of this was. If you're having a hard time, take a second and remind yourself that there are a lot of people out there struggling in a lot of the same ways. Happy holidays.",7

He comes into the bedroom to drunkenly loom over me. This is him being affectionate. He gets pissed when I tell him “if you’re going to call in sick to drink, go do it and let me sleep.” A few more days of this pattern, then he will decide to be sober, apologize very briefly, and complain that I’m “distant”.

I question whether I’m enabling him by not changing the locks. Clearly, he has a safe place to drink here in our home. I wonder whether I should be documenting every instance of this pattern — if I show him a calendar with all the “bad” days (weeks, months) blacked out, will he finally get it?

I now know with 100% clarity that I cannot drink, at all. Drinking and smoking counters have been reset. Prior to this mistake I had 29 days under my belt and felt really really good! My general physical health and mental well-being had improved greatly, most noticeably my cardio and ability to run, even though it may only be to the bus stop. Incredible.

It still felt awful to feel my partner was partly blaming me for my own misery.

Unfortunately, my sickness has had a resurgence and I’m feeling significantly crappy again today. HOWEVER, I’m looking forward to receiving the pity from my hubby today that I truly deserve 😝... especially since, with the holidays upon us, there are exactly 1 million things to do!

I have a moped and i go to all the parties on it so i can't drink. This weekend we had two gigs. And i didn't have that much fun. I think its more to that i have been feeling dumb lately than it is due to not drinking. Mostly when i go somewhere sober i have a great time. 

If you're sober and everyone around you is drunk you then see how stupid drinking is. A couple years ago none of my friends drank, and i encouraged them to do it, because i was the only one who did. (I started drinking when is was 12-13). Now most of them are drinking more and more with time. And it digusts me to see them drunk and so on. Some of them even did some harddrugs like pep. 

A lot of the time i hate society. I feel like kids are drinking more and more because they dont know how to be vulnerable and communicate anymore. If they cant hide behind a screen they need alcohol or other  drugs to feel comfortable again. But paradoxically i am now writing this behind a screen because i think noone gets me in this way.

Also, sometimes i feel like i would never meet someone i could be with. Most of the people that i had some kind of involvement with i met when i was black-out drunk on some kind of event. I'm gay and it's already pretty hard to date, im not afraid to approach someone but it is definitely harder. You always are thinking about if they wont be mad if you hit on them or call you names, find you disgusting etc. 

Lately i have been feeling a lack of connection with most of my friends. They all party and get drunk and that's it. While i get much more fulfilled by a good conversation. But when i try to have that they say they dont think about stuff so deeply. Next year im going to college and i think it will be even worse. Becaus the drinking culture is even more prominent in university.

I work on myself a lot. I try to eat healthy ( im the only one in my entire school that takes a salad or other veggies to school instead of bread and cookies) i workout 3-7 times a week and i have a lot of good friends i will do anything for. 

My parents however, are big drinkers and thats the main reason i can't stand them. 

Im trying to live like a good person, and im not nowhere near being that. But at least im trying. A lot of the times i feel like im the only one doing that. And eventhough i have so many friends i feel lonely from time to time.

This is kinda a rant, but if you guys have some good advice for me, i would greatly appreciate that. Thanks for reading the whole thing",1

2019-12-22 05:29:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ee3iml/finally_admitting_to_myself/,Finally admitting to myself.,"To introduce myself, I am 22 years old and my family has a history of alcoholism. I have gone through phases / blips in the past of drinking everyday and have used alcohol to forget my problems. Though it always ends up making things much worse. I wouldn’t say I’m addicted to alcohol as I rarely crave it the day after but the thing is, when I drink, 9 times out of 10 I become out of control, black out and throw up during my sleep which I know is so dangerous. 

From the age of 18, I started binge drinking and found I wasn’t able to ever stop after a few drinks. It would rarely ever not lead to ruining friendships or doing the most stupid things and I have even been taken home by the police before. My mental health was much worse back then so I think that made the drinking problem worse. 

For the past couple of years I started to drink less often due to the dangers of my behaviour and lack of control. By drinking only on ‘special occasions’, I have found I am ending up in a state less but that I am still not in control of my consumption as half of the times I have ended up in a very bad way. 

On Friday night, I went out to just have a good time but I really upset my friend and embarrassed myself to the extreme. I think I have myself alcohol poisoning which I have had many times before. I could not stop buying more drinks even though I was already paralytic. I’ve not eaten in over 24 hours because I had made myself so unwell. Now that I’m managing to keep water down, I just feel riddled with anxiety. I have apologised for my behaviour where known, but I feel like this shame spiral is never going to end. I actually was feeling suicidal yesterday and now I’m scared to leave the house as I feel like everyone is going to judge me and know how I acted. I live in a small town. 

I know this isn’t normal and I don’t know how I keep ending up harming myself with alcohol. I feel like I have a drinking problem but can’t be an alcoholic as I can leave it months before getting in this kind of state again. 

I’m not sure what I’m looking for here but I’m wondering if I should quit alcohol altogether, as I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve unintentionally ended up hating myself and almost killing myself by vomiting in my sleep. 

The intense guilt, shame and harm I cause is unbearable and I’d do anything to take it back. I’ve gotten through this before but I really thought I was in a better place. I think I want to stop drinking as I am finally admitting to myself that if I have more than a couple of drinks, alcohol totally takes control of me and I can’t stop.

My thing was drinking 3-4 drinks per night and smoking a joint before bed. I went through a lot because of my habit. I felt like I needed it to be creative and interesting..

I thought: I’m a good person, a hard worker, this is not the life I was meant to live. I can do better than this.

How I quit:

I made a promise to God that I would sacrifice my desire to get drunk or high for the rest of my life in exchange for a stable and successful life. I decided that I would trade my pleasure for hard work and achievement. I just wanted to be as far away from jail as humanly possible. 

7 months later:

I am working non-stop. I discovered many kinds of great beverages that are healthy and interesting. I don’t party anymore. I live a more quiet but busy life.

Just a note at two weeks clean to say thank you again for the inspiration and the stories of coping techniques. I went to a dinner party last night with wine for the other guests (they buy the food) and non alcoholic ginger beer for me.

I had visualised the scene a few times over the previous two days and confidentially just said to my hosts my rehearsed line: ""oh I'm not drinking at the moment. Thought I'd take some time out. Yes, it seems like a strange time of the year to do it, but you know there's never a good time because someone is always going to say ""oh just have a couple"" and then you never really get away from it. So, no, not drinking tonight. Been doing it for a couple of weeks already. ""

Slightly surprised hosts but no big deal and we had a great evening. I didn't feel pressured as the visualisations I had done of my speech and sitting and being engaged in the conversation served as guides for the evening. I felt like I was travelling a planned route or playing the part I had already scripted. Pre-visualisation can really help because you just go through what you've already rehearsed and it takes the pressure off the 'there and then'. 

Which brings me awake and alert this morning at 14 days. (Weird side effect: I'm one of those people who packs on the pounds from drinking and completely thrashed my liver, keeping it occupied with processing booze all the time and so not working on breaking down fat. Now the booze is no longer there, the weight is tumbling off me: 14 pounds in two weeks. A fair bit would have been water retention but not all of it. As a result I have some back and stomach muscle pains as my body mechanics are shifting around with the weight loss. Anyone else experience that?) 

But it's a price I would pay a thousand times. Next milestone, one month. I'm already happier, more productive, awake earlier and a nicer person to be around. In two weeks. We can do this!",4

Why do I make these choices?!  Don’t I care? How can booze be more important to me? How much do I hate them to do this to them…?

And like anyone else, I try to explain it’s not a choice to which I get that look. I must be a psychopath to blatantly lie right to their face. Of course it’s a choice!

Let me tell you about choices. In my world, people make choices about drinking frequently. They choose to drink to relax. To forget, unwind, cry at times to get over life’s shit storm. Sometimes to excess where they endanger others by driving, skipping out on work and family responsibilities, yelling insults at those close to them. Countless horrible things that for some reason are all forgiven. Because they did it when they were drinking and it is thought to be a short term problem that can be avoided in the future. If one chooses.

Now to the non-choice. I did not choose to be an addict. I didn’t alter my genetics, decide a handle of rum sounded like a meal replacement or that withdrawals severe enough for an ambulance to show up were going to be events in my life. I didn’t choose to embarrass and scare my family. Or to try and end my life multiple times out of fear it was the only method to stop the insanity addiction results from. When someone jumps out of a burning building, those watching don’t often ask how they could make that decision and assume they must not care about those close to them. Only an asshole would ask that question while watching someone spiral to their death.

But the non-choice part of addiction is exactly what carries the life long, often lethal consequences. The one guilt and shame arise from. Addiction is what causes those close to us to ask that question. To a person falling from a burning building. Trying to find their rock bottom.",1

Essentially it's a guy who I guess is kinda famous in Britain, who drinks 100+ units per week, can't decide if he has a problem with alcohol, and consults friends, family, doctors, and recovery support on a quest to figure out what 'not drinking' is all about.  And he's super torn on how to live a life with or without booze.  

A friend of his who is 30 years sober recommends he continue to drink like he does.  His rationalization, the sober guy, is incredible.  It's like the sober guy so relishes his drunk past that he's cueing his friend in on 'if you never admit you have a problem you can be a normie... don't fuck up like I did and admit it!'

It's a bit of a rough documentary for me to watch but I relate to a lot of it, because so much of it is rationalization.  Like, I just want to scream at him and be like ""you filmed a documentary on your boozing problem... sorry I know it SUCKS to blow your own whistle, but your time is UP!""

I don't recommend watching this if you're new to sobriety (my badge meter is low but my 100-200 day stints are high).  The spectacle is addiction rationalization with just enough self awareness to make it acceptable, imho.  

If anyone watches this let me know your thoughts.  It kinda fucked my head up.  But, IWNDWYT.",10

TLDR at the end

Out of the past 15 years, except for 31 days in treatment, not one day was spent sober!!

Not one of those original 31 days was filled with any intention to actually stop drinking. I wasn't ready. I had more relationships to break, people to hurt and jobs to lose . More time to waste and money to spend paying stupid tax.

Fast forward a couple years.

With a job that paid well enough to keep a constant supply of booze around and drugs stashed for a rainy day, I had no idea I was about to wake up and decided I didn't want that anymore.

So I took the first trip, a harsh 2 day medical detox that left me spinning. That wasn't going to do it. The last 4 fingers in the 1.75 would be the answer. Enough to settle my nerves. Enough to think clear through the plan.

The plan- phone, wallet and lighter in my pockets, I needed to pack a backpack with essential items only. Clean clothes for 2 days, 2 packs of smokes, and a quart size bag carefully organized to fit as many shooters as possible. These would be essential; I needed to board a plane without raising any suspicion, not detoxing nor drunk.

The second trip would be a balancing act over 11 hours. Connecting flights, airport bars and a solid meal would lead me to a small church where the driver let me out to smoke. As I smoked a cigarette I took a shot of fireball and poured out my last shot of piss warm Jager.

TLDR

The last place was a FANTASTIC detox!!

20 days of in-patient treatment.

10 days on my own. 

This is the end of my first 30 days looking forward to a new future.

I'm so happy!!",5

We give a brief one-minute spiel at the end of our performance before we do a very open, candid Q&A in which anyone in the audience can ask us anything. Part of my spiel includes mentioning how r/stopdrinking played a part in saving my life. Though our troupe does not officially espouse things like AA, I know that's how many of my castmates stopped drinking. I want our audiences to know that there are other options, especially if they're curious, anxious, and/or introverted, as I was; in which case, an online community was a blessing.

Keep pushing it back but I know how that can go. Idea solidly squashed today. I do not need a drink. Not now, not ever.","So,, it’s day 207. I haven’t wanted a drink & I know it won’t help me, but.. as the title says, I keep catching myself thinking oh I can just have one here & there-it’s Christmas! I immediately remind myself that I can’t *do* that & stop the thought but it keeps coming back. Doubt it will after today. This is mostly a vent post but I gotta say it somewhere-it’s not for the faint of heart. Stop here if you’re squeamish or dislike long posts. 

My little brother (44) & my Mom are the only immediate family I have left. My Mom is out of town for the holiday. My brother is a junkie on subutex & whatever else he can get his hands on. He “functions”, as in has a job, company vehicle/phone, owns a home etc. He texted last night to say he may have to come to my house & to be prepared. His live in gf of 8 years is a paranoid schizophrenic & has stopped taken her meds properly-again. He sent a recording of her talking crazy loud about crazy angry things to absolutely no one. He wanted to call & have her committed but he didn’t want to do that to her at Christmas time. I replied that she didn’t even know it was Christmas & for him to make the call or please come to my place before she tried to kill him. He said he would call, but he didn’t. I got his next text at 7am. She tried to kill him-even told the cops so. Siri called 911 for him bc every time he let her go, she hurt him. Cops came & took her to a psych ward, medics tended my brothers bleeding head. He lives an hour away & I sped the whole way here. He was shaking uncontrollably, dried blood all over his face, hair, clothes & all over the house. She hit him on the forehead with a Pyrex baking dish so hard it broke. He bent over to hide the shards so she wouldn’t pick one up & she jumped on his back pushing his ribs into his knees. He said he heard a pop & it hurts but not too bad. He never hit her. He didn’t want to hurt her. Medic told him he’d be ok but I think he should still see a doctor. He just says they can’t help him & he’s probably right. Nobody can really help him but himself but he just can’t seem to get it together. 

I brought food, supplies, cleaned his bloody face & listened to him for a while & he stopped shivering. He finally took a shower bc he was freezing. It’s not cold. He has vomited, barely ate but did eat a little & has mostly been sleeping. Probably has a mild concussion. Ive got ice on the egg on his head. He doesn’t want to come home with me as the trip will be miserable, doesn’t want me to leave but I made no arrangements to stay. He is finally scared. He says he is really fucked up bc of the drugs, doesn’t know what to do & the medical community doesn’t care about him as a junkie, which sadly, is true. So, my little sober self is sitting in his house (in a drug infested neighborhood) watching him sleep off & on. His needles & bloody towels from shooting up are all over the place. I’ve cleaned, but there are some things it’s obviously dangerous to touch. He has/had? Hep C from sharing spoons but then was miraculously cured by nothing. Tested negative,, supposedly. Again my disdain for medical community but how can I blame them for not wanting to help someone killing themselves. He was even concerned about me cleaning his face but I told him I had no open wounds on my hands & to sit still. So... I might end up sitting here with him all night. Anyway, we’ve been talking about the drugs. His family doc has kindly assured him that *nobody* has ever gotten off subutex. I call bullshit! I told him that he was the only person who could fix himself. He can do it, if he will. He knows I’ve stopped drinking but he never knew how bad I was. He doesn’t believe in himself anymore & is so sick, scared & hopeless. I need to go home but he says plz stay. So,, I guess I’ll sit here all night. My critters at home will likely be ill but oh well.  I’m not about to leave my only brother here alone to shiver, sweat, vomit & possibly die alone. He has always said  “I am fine” but now he is saying “please don’t leave”.  That alone tells me to stay. 

I hate drugs. I hate alcohol-same thing. I’m just torn & would like to go home but I can’t leave him like this. He is 6’2” & maybe 150lbs. He has 12 teeth. He’s been in prison twice for manufacturing meth. And now he is injured badly. Physically & emotionally. That’s about all I’ve got. I’m sure someone will direct me to a support group for family of drug abusers but I just wanted to post here bc I am a newly recovering alcoholic. I’m trying so hard to give him hope. I say look at me, I quit drinking, but he didn’t know what I was like. I doubt the idea of drinking just one here & there will cross my mind again over the holiday. I will celebrate being better & doing better for myself instead. This is awful. I can’t really even sleep bc he needs to know I’m here. Maybe I just need someone to tell me I can do this. I know I can, but I am pretty stuck here. IWNDWYT though. That. Is for damn sure. Thx for reading if you did.",21

In spite of those issues, or because of them, life is 1 million times better today, sober,than it was 5 months ago. 

I’m no longer crippled by anxiety, social or otherwise and my baseline levels continue to improve on a nearly daily basis. I also noticed major improvements in my ability to think on my feet and speak in public, essentially no more brain fog. I’m also generally calmer and more able to be productive through the day, rather than watching tv or stuck to my bed hungover. 

And finally, and most importantly, I no longer hate myself. This is a major one. I don’t love myself yet, but I sure don’t hate myself either! 

Something I am still dealing with, that I am guessing you all can relate to, is that I do get caught up in regret a little bit. It can be about the damage I did to my health (ultimately not too serious), stuff about my job or just the time I wasted, relationships I that I bruised or the likely numerous lost opportunities I’ve had. 

To help me get past this regret, or guilt,  I try and positively focus on the following: 1. I have improved a ton over 5 months of sobriety and will only continue to do so, 2. I have learned a lot about myself that I otherwise wouldn’t have been able to if I did not go through these trials and tribulations, 3. For things like my career, completely rebounding and reaching or surpassing all of my goals is still within my reach if I put in the work and stay sober.

I’ve tried previously to stop drinking altogether, but have failed within a day or two. I’d always tell myself that I’ll try again later, or that I’ll be fine with a day or two of drinking. But it wasn’t ok. I kept disappointing myself and I kept feeling like shit about it. 

I have cut back on drinking quite dramatically than what it used to be. I’ve now started drinking maybe once a week and I’ll only have a few beers. 

But my drinking has always led to bad choices. Nothing violent or criminal, more just bad life decisions that have left me in a tough spot. 

Last week I decided to change for the better. I told myself no drinking or gambling from here on out. Those are two things I would be very happy to no longer have in my life. 

I’m happy to say I’ve made it a full 7 days without either of those two things and I plan on making it more! 

I’ve realized I need to change my life. I’ve made too many bad decisions that have left me where I am, but that won’t hold me back. I want to have a life worth living and a life I’m proud of.  

I know it’s gonna be a long road ahead of me but if you want something bad enough, you gotta work hard for it!!",14

I have an app that tracks it (Nomo) and I’ve restarted that counter more times than I can admit.
But last night something happened that told me I am on the right path.
I went to my work Christmas party, sober, and fended off the free drinks, and the offers of “I’ll grab you one too” with excuses that I’m driving or I’m picking up my hubby who’s been drinking later so I can’t drink etc.

For context, my reason for giving up drinking is not that I drink often- it was usually 2-3 times a month. But when I did, I drank straight vodka, no chaser and blacked out so regularly I genuinely don’t remember close to two years of my life. It got to the point where a glass of wine was all it took for me to blackout. 

I got sick of apologizing. I got sick of waking up somewhere and not knowing how or why I got there. I got sick of replacing rugs and clothes and I got sick of hurting people with the things I said, and not remembering why I said them.

So- back to last night.
Hubby never drinks- he will have maybe one drink on his birthday and a few more on Christmas or New Years, that’s it.
Last night, he and the boys got into it- red wine, beer, cocktails at dinner, coffee liqueur, vodka shots, white wine chased with whiskey - the whole lot.
I was at my work dinner for 4 hours, and in that 4 hours he went from tipsy to completely incoherent and legless.
I finally saw what I was like all those times. The curse of a blackout is also its beauty- you don’t remember the state you were in. 
But this was a stone cold kick in the face that I was not prepared for.
He was in the exact state you would imagine- not making sense when he spoke, unable to stand up, throwing up all over the living room floor.
I spent every 20-30 minutes last night making sure he was breathing, on his side in the recovery position, showering him, helping him throw up into a bucket, or sipping water.

My girlfriend and I practically slept in shifts, and alternated between cleaning floors, washing towels and sheets and keeping him alive.
A phone call to a nurse friend for some advice also helped. She stayed on call for us Incase he became worse, and talked us through what to expect, what to do and how to help him.

It was such a surreal experience. It also didn’t help that during a small argument last night my girlfriend came out with a accusatory  “this is what you were like when you blacked out.”

I guess I’m just venting to reddit because I’m on so little sleep, but it was almost like a peek behind the curtain. Like I was seeing myself for the first time, and after we knew he was safe and he got some sleep I really got to think about it, and it just seemed to cement my sobriety even more. I’ve given it a go so many times, but this really feels like this time will be more successful that the others. Even if it is because of someone else’s horrible hangover.

What was your realization that sobriety was the right path?",6

I'm don't believe in organized religion, and wad REALLY worried about the God word. Turns out most people in my group aren't religious. It's not about religion, it's about support by realizing you aren't in control.

I will be doing that once I get through this first 24 hrs. This is the first day this entire week that I didn't feel like vomiting first thing in the morning. I've needed to taper because every time I quit cold turkey has landed me in the hospital within 72 hrs with a grand Mal seizure. I've had a total of 4 seizures over the past few years from going cold, however it's only recently that I've applied what I've learned to a Part of this process. The other part of it I'm still in learning mode. The NOT PICKING UP AGAIN part!
My doctors have told me that each time I have a seizure, my seizure threshold is lowered. The chances that I will get one again increase each time I have one, so this taper has been necessary. I don't know if it will work, but I have to believe it will. I've spoken to my doctor and have short term prescriptions for sleep medication (life long insomnia/night time anxiety is a large part of why I started to drink regularly at night, and then and days over the weekends etc etc, you get the picture.. ), and gabapentin for seizure control.
Once you have a grand mal seizure, you're considered a risk on the road for up to three months after, so if I'm feeling out of sorts during the initial days of this weekend, I will be calling an ambulance to get to emergency so that I don't seize at home. 
This addiction has become no joke now. I've lost a crap load of stuff in my life - my long term love and fiance, my dog, large sums of money - all for the illustrious taste of oblivion. As a person of logic this makes absolutely no sense to me, and in the past when I've sobered up, I get so low on myself for all that I've lost, that it's often easier to escape to oblivion again to forget it all. I deeply want a success story from this all. I deeply want to inspire. I deeply want to be happy, trustable, honest, motivational, healthy, organized, driven. All the things I used to be yet I've traded them all for what?
I guess this is part journal entry, part sharing, and part warning. For anyone trying to go cold turkey after a long period of heavy drinking, please please be wary of withdrawal symptoms and take them seriously. Take it easy on yourself, speak to a professional, and/or someone who can follow up on you frequently or monitor you. Your life is worth it.
I've seen a therapist and addiction counselor in the past, been to numerous AA meetings but confidence always got the better of me. I'm trying to let humility be my guide now.

My heart was racing and my body was having hot flash sensations. I was on the verge of vomiting and thought of taking a couple of shot of whiskey to calm my nerves.

I survived Thanksgiving and my birthday and ready to survive christmas. My husband had a few drinks and I handled it very well. I used to not bother drinking at all if there wasn't enough to drink (10+ beers for myself, I was never able to have just a couple drinks it was all I could drink before passing out or nothing, I had no medium) so my husband getting a 6 pack was easier than I thought. I dont know if it was a victory or if I have the same ""thats not enough, so why bother"" mentality. My biggest problem is my house is a mess, I barely cook, I stopped doing all the things I enjoyed. Beer was like coffee to me, it got me going, you know like pumped for any activity. Around 5 or 6 I would start drinking and getting dinner ready. If I played video games I would drink, crochet drink, go anywhere for recreation I would drink (movies, bowling, mini golf, arcades, concerts, zoo, crafts ect. ) I haven't learned to enjoy anything without alcohol yet.  Actually once I quit drinking for 4 months years ago. I didn't enjoy anything in that 4 months. So it is a weird question. How do you get over this? How do I make myself care again? I mean I cared enough to quit drinking, but everything else I dont care about. Like I have been trying to clean my kitchen all day and end up saying screw it, sit around bored and try again, then came here. I picked up a video game yesterday I was playing before the decision not to drink and could only play for 20 mins. I have 3 unfinished crochet projects.

I'm starting to feel like counting sober days is like counting calories...that it's going to work, but drive me mad one day and I'll just binge.  Again, I'm not saying this intentionally to make anyone's journey anything less but amazing or heroic, it's just how I feel today.  So, I will focus on my 1st Saturday Share post.

I don't think I can write my entire story today...I don't feel up to it but I can write a trailer, if you will.  

Of course I binge drank as a teenager.  I didn't drink for several years during university.  Then, my fiance cheated on me and I went ballistic.  I was so hurt I wanted to give up everything...I didn't know what to do next-I didn't care.  I just wanted to get the hell out of the country and start fresh.

So I got a job teaching in Asia.  That's, I think where it really started (besides the fact that I already have an addictive and compulsive nature-we can get into that later).  The drinking culture there was intense.  Your boss would take you and everyone else out for a night of slamming soju bottles back till your karaoke voice gave out and then some.  THEN, go to work the next day.  Then repeat.  We, as expats, found comfort in the cheap drinks and all nighters.  It was a thing and even one of my best friends who I met there, has recovered from that insanity.  

That was basically 7 years of my early to late twenties. 

Then, I moved back to N. America to start a family with a man I met in Asia.  I was clean.  Super clean.  Like naturopathically clean.  But, I lost uncountable pregnancies, went to the ER for several emergency surgeries, and at the same time my man found out his mother had cancer.  Among other tastes of trauma, this was all too much.  I went into a depression/anger and he, he left me during another pregnancy loss.  I used to say that he was a good man-that it was too much for us.  But, now I say he was weak.  

He wouldn't come back.  I was stuck in a place where I knew no one and felt so guilty, my family didn't support me, in fact they blamed me for everything, so I started to drink.  Drink heavily.  I would attract people into my world, because they thought I was sassy and fun, but eventually, people, friends, etc. started to call me out on it.  Actually, talk to other people about how awful my behaviour was in front of me while they also drank. 

I would then stop drinking.  I thought yoga would help me.  I gave it a shot for months.  But it wasn't enough.  It actually caused me anxiety, because I wasn't good enough-my mind wasn't in it. 

So, I started to drink again.  Heavily. Let's fast forward this a bit, to like, recently.  I started a relationship with someone new and for some reason (I know why but that's for later), I started to drink heavily again, with him.  During this whole time, I finished another difficult program at college and I was ""functional"".  

Let's fast forward again.  To a more recent, recent.  

I had another relationship which was causing me anxiety, jobs were causing me stress, my family didn't support me, I was isolating myself, beating myself up for everything I've ever done.  I began to drink everywhere, anything, any time.  I started to gain so much weight, my stomach hated me so much I couldn't sleep because of the pain, I couldn't think straight.  Me, a very educated and socially intelligent person who was a public speaker and a teacher couldn't put sentences together as easily, I was slurring even when I wasn't drinking.  Yeah....as I'm writing this, I am disgusted with myself and my actions.

I woke up one morning after having a whole bottle of whiskey to myself, a smaller bottle but still a bottle, and I realized I didn't feel drunk.  And that scared me right off.  That this is my normal now?  That my worries that I have brain cancer or that I'm going to have a heart attack three times a day is all due to my lack of self-respect?  Hell yeah.  I did that.  I did this to myself.  Once a beautifully strong and adventurous woman, has now turned into a bloated shell of herself.  

So, I'm on Day 5 today.  I want there to be a Day 6, 7, 8, and infinity.  I want to count my sober calories.  I want to care enough to post another Saturday Share where I say that I respected myself enough to still be sober.  

Thank you for this forum.  It makes my ""Day ____ of This Sucks"" so much more tolerable.",8

After he had enjoyed his party and headed off home, my brother, a few friends and I headed to the pub. We sat for two or three hours talking and laughing. The others drank but I just stuck to the soft stuff.   
I've always struggled with giving up drinking due, in part, to feeling like I'm giving up a big social part of my life -or that was the justification I used. It was nice to find today that I can still go out and socialise without the booze.   
I realise this wouldn't be for everyone and it might be the worst situation other people here could put themselves in to in terms of danger of relapsing, but it felt liberating for me.

I've been sipping wine (not my drink of choice) all day just trying to drink a little less than I did the day before since I am really afraid of DT again. 

My brother is in town for the holidays and I am in no mood to do the family thing but I have a dinner to go to. My mom is prescribed gabapentin and is going to bring me some to help with the anxiety. I'm hoping it will be a little easier with the gaba and am really tempted to chug the wine to be tolerable at the dinner.

I haven’t posted here in forever, but I’ve recently had really big revelations in my recovery process and I wanted to share what I’ve found.

I’m coming up quickly on my 10 months soon, 293 days if we wanna be exact.  Ten months ago I was the human embodiment of pain.  I hated myself, I hated my surroundings, I hated being alive, I hated everyone around me.  I posted here some in the beginning of my journey, but even then I was in deep, deep denial of just how bad I was.  I was almost 260 pounds, I was so inflamed from all the drugs, alcohol, and shit food I was funneling into myself I could barely climb a flight of stairs.  My entire physical and mental existence could just be described as one big “owwwwww”.  I had given up to the point of not even actively wanting to kill myself anymore, I just hoped that it would be over soon, slowly killing myself everyday with all the shit I was using to plug up all the empty holes in my life.

I was a savage binge drinker.  I would consume massive quantities of alcohol multiple times a week, with drugs thrown into that mix, and had been existing this way for 12 YEARS.  At some points in my life it had even been worse than it was at the end, my body could not keep up with the level of self abuse anymore.

I was hiding how much I was drinking, I was lying about the drugs, about the food binges, I was lying to everyone including myself.  I woke up on March 3rd 2019 and I finally saw that if I kept this shit up I had zero chance of making it past the next couple of years.  I quit it all.  I quit alcohol, drugs, sugar, cigarettes, and processed food all within a 24 hour period.  

I wallowed in denial for a few months, told myself “my problems weren’t that bad”, told myself I wasn’t an alcoholic or an addict.  It took time, but I finally accepted those things about myself, and the acceptance of those things about me are what led me to the real meat of my issues.

I had such a fucked way of looking at the world and my place in it, was out to place and pin blame wherever I could.  It hit me like a fuckin’ truck about a week ago, I had been living in a shit reality because it’s the reality I chose to exist in.  I loved the wallow, the self destruction.  I almost felt pride at how good I was at it. However I may have been an expert at the utter and complete demolition of myself and my self worth, I could also choose to NOT do those things anymore, and it was less about just staying sober and more about radically unfucking the way I felt about the world and how I was gonna live in it.

I was going down the road of just morphing into an old miserable dry drunk who didn’t do jack fuck shit to work on the modes of thinking that led me to abusing substances in the first place.  I am forever fucking grateful to myself and to the ones around me who helped me see that this way of life was in no way something I had to accept.  Quitting the alcohol and drugs was the easy part, absolutely rerouting a lifetimes worth of negative thoughts and outlooks,that shit was fucking HARD.

If you’re struggling, believe people when they tell you that it gets better.  It fucking gets better.  You have the power to make decisions that are going to benefit you and your state of mind and the way you chose to exist.  However, you have to come to those conclusions on your own and in your own way.  

I was a complete skeptic about any sort of spirituality my entire life.  Sobriety has quite literally rocked my shit, and now I see divinity in everything around me, how could I not?  The path of pulling myself out of that hole I had dug so deep was a goddamn spiritual experience.

I had never ever chosen to live, but I wake up everyday with a fucking smile on my face and I am so deeply grateful and blessed and genuinely happy to be alive, and I never ever thought that this would be a life that I could live, I just had to make the choice to do it.",1206

I have stopped drinking now for close to 5 weeks, everything is good, feel great, energy is back, walking and getting back to the gym etc, HOWEVER, about 3 days into being sober I started seeing a drop off in the ability to perform in the bed room. The want is there but the ability to get and maintain an erection (sorry ladies!) has been progressively getting worse. I had no issues prior to stopping, mornings were like clock work, night time sometime an issue due to drinking.

I thought for sure that once I stopped  all those issue would go away and I would be able to rock my wifes world. NOT SO.

I am 60, have been getting testosterone shots for years, take daily Cialis for years, and all WAS good.

I have done some research and it seems that this is somewhat common, caused by your body getting used to the new you after drinking for 40 years.

I am curious if anyone has experienced this, and if so PLEASE tell me it goes away and you get back to normal after a while!

I've struggled with drinking heavily on and off since I was about 16 (24 now) and I've 'quit' several times over the years for a month or so at a time and ended up going right back. I never really understood why I went back, because I would always do it after finally starting to feel *slightly* better.  


Slightly being the keyword after looking back on those failed attempts. I ended up not treating my body right. I NEEDED another vice. Whether that was eating excessively, randomly picking up cigarettes or gaming my life away. I wasn't, at that time, treating myself the best that I could after I put the bottle down.  


That was until I started researching Ketosis and what the Keto diet was all about. I had had a friend telling me for over a year that I need to lose my beer gut and Keto is a wonderful way to do it. I blew him off and continued drinking heavily while he kept losing and losing weight.   


After I hit THAT point where I didn't even feel the effects of alcohol anymore and every drink was essentially just keeping me from entering withdrawal, I knew I had had enough and I needed to AT LEAST take a tolerance break.  


I remembered his badgering and decided to shoot him a message that said,  ""Alright. I'll bite.""  


A few informative videos later, the concept of keto at least had my attention. I continued to do research on the topic and a few days later came to the conclusion that, for me personally, I was a pretty enamored by the science behind the diet/lifestyle change and decided to start looking at recipes and form a basic grocery list.  


I started/am still using my fitness pal to track my calories (for optimal weight loss on keto in the beginning, you want 75% of your calories to come from fat, 20% from protein and 5% from carbs) and was on the path to trying out keto.  


The first week was a little chaotic meal plan wise, because I learned very quickly that the best way to do keto is by cooking everything yourself. The second week was definitely structured a little better, but I managed to keep my macros in check that week and on the first. Hey, I'm pretty proud of that!  


This helped me keep my mind off of alcohol so well. I was fascinated by keto and now spending all of my free time researching how to get in the best shape and feel the best overall in general. I was actually so distracted, that I didn't even weigh myself until I hit the end of the second week. I had lost 9lbs in just two weeks! Definitely a morale boost.  


This gave me the motivation to start going to the gym, meal prepping extensively for the week and start implementing intermittent fasting into my diet as well. I have NEVER done any of those things prior to this diet. That's for sure.  


Nearing the end of my 3rd week now and I feel awesome. Usually the first month or two of quitting I felt groggy and tired all the time, anxiety was still bad and I couldn't think worth a crap. I'm not sure if its just the diet or the combination of everything I listed above, but I feel full of energy, sleep well every night now, rarely experience anxiety anymore and feel razor sharp when it comes to focusing on the task at hand at that given moment.  


I've also noticed that my mood overall is a lot more stable and tends to lean more towards feeling 'generally upbeat'. Polar opposite to when I was drinking heavily/just quit without a diet change.  


I'm not suggesting that everyone go out and jump on the keto diet after reading this post. There are definitely people that its for and people that shouldn't do keto. I just want to say that, for anyone out there struggling in the very beginning of quitting, you should look into your diet and possibly add exercising to your daily routine. It has made a world of difference for me and I hope it does for you too!

&#x200B;

For anyone interested in Keto, I'd be happy to answer questions to the best of my ability and share the videos that got me really interested in the concept as a whole too!   


P.S. One thing that has REALLY helped with withdrawal symptoms, especially in the beginning, was CBD flower. If you're unfamiliar with CBD, its the cannabinoid in marijuana that contains the majority of the medicinal properties and not the psychoactive parts (THC). Its essentially medical grade hemp that contains astronomically low levels of THC (This is legal in almost every state in the US and considered a dietary supplement) and a very high concentration of CBD. For people like myself that dislike the feeling of being high or just don't want THC in there bodies in general, CBD flower is a wonderful, natural aid in dealing with the aches and shakes. :)",7

With all the holiday get togethers coming up, it can be helpful to pretend you are an anthropologist in a society where everybody wants you to drink this magic, harmful, and ultimately meaningless liquid. Take mental notes on the direct and indirect ways people in the society want you to drink the liquid. Pretend you will be writing up your findings later. Pay careful attention to the subtle and not-so-subtle ways the liquid changes them once they start drinking it.

My girlfriend almost left me 10 days ago because I got black out drunk and had to work the next day. I didn’t even set an alarm. I was so drunk she couldn’t wake me up. And I had done the same thing a week prior. Because of this, she went to her sisters and told her family everything bad that I have done while drunk. There are a lot of cringe inducing stories that her parents know about now. 

The next day she told my parents. Now, she said she was going to do this the day before. She hadn’t and I was going to tell her that I wanted to tell them. But she beat me to it. That honestly didn’t sit very well to me and it still doesn’t. I’m not super bothered by it but I do feel like my privacy has been violated or something. 

The thing is, everyone knows I have a problem. One day, I was getting drunk and the next, everyone knew I had a problem. I had no time to come to terms with it. It just smacked me in the face. I had plans to go visit my family for Christmas, but now I won’t. My dad thought that it might’ve been better for me to stay here because him and my brother will be drinking. I hate to say it, but I agreed with him. I don’t want to visit my girlfriends parents because I am so embarrassed by what they know about me. Everyone here has done some super embarrassing stuff when drunk. Now her parents know everything and I was powerless as to how everything went about.

I believe that this is the only way I could’ve stopped though. If it wasn’t for her, I wouldn’t be  going to to gym everyday and eating healthy. If it wasn’t for her, I wouldn’t be enjoying all these mornings of feeing good. My sobriety has saved our relationship. I don’t even want to know how much money I have saved so far in ten days of not drinking. 

But I also feel like everything got blown way out of proportion. Yes, I do abuse alcohol and love getting drunk. It’s a crutch for my boredom. And yes, I have made some terrible decisions while intoxicated. I do believe that I have a mental dependency on it. I have been wanting to cut back and control it and I know that I can because I have done it before. All it takes is some discipline on my part. I also really didn’t want everyone to know at once that I have a problem. I just feel so powerless about the whole situation. I had no say at all. My girlfriend took the reigns the whole time and I was along for the ride. 

I was normally drinking about 6 beers a night. Some days were more with a tall can thrown in the mix. I would say that 10% of the time I was getting super drunk. 2% of the time I was getting blackout drunk with the exception of the past month where it was happening more frequently. The rest of the time I was getting at that level in between buzzed and drunk. Hell, there were some nights where I didn’t drink at all. The times where I have been out of control were uncommon. 

There’s also a massive experience gap between me and my gf. She’s 20 and I’m 26. She’s not even old enough to drink yet and doesn’t really know what it’s like to be able to buy some after work. I, on the other hand, have been there done that. 

I just don’t even know where to begin to to think about all this. I’d love to hear some of your thoughts on my situation. Sorry for the rant but I had to get it off of my chest. IWNDWYT",3

Long time anonymous lurker, first time poster. Four days sober.

Today is my family holiday party - the first social engagement I'll attend sober since my month-long sobriety while in an outpatient IOP program in October. Typically, I would have ""a few drinks"" to loosen up, speak to distant family ""more easily,"" etc.

Well, historically, two beers turns into four vodka-sodas. Four vodka sodas leads to sneaking gulps of straight vodka from the bottle when no one is looking. Gulping secret vodka leads to more wine at dinner. 

More wine at dinner leads to speaking 10x louder than necessary, slurring. My mother calling me out for the change in my speech at the table. Crying to my sister-in-law about some high school boyfriend I hadn't thought about in a decade (?!). Ranting to my 90-year-old grandmother about some nonsense I don't even recall. Always being the drunk one, when no one else is.

Waking up to open the immediate family gifts feeling like absolute shit. All of them looking at me knowingly but too polite to say anything.

**I can't have those two beers anymore**. Huge thank you to this community for helping me remember that. IWNDWYT.",22

I was measuring in days (if not hours) and even weeks seemed to be too ambitious. I may my way past several temptations (business travel, holidays, Christmas, receptions, dinners, parties) and each one was less difficult than the last. I drink way too much Diet Coke now, but I figure that at least my liver is safe. All blood work is fine. I haven't lost any significant amount of weight, but haven't gained either. No one cares at all that I don't drink any more - if anyone does ask why, I always respond by saying ""I feel better when I don't"" and leave it at that. I can honestly say that I really don't think of it too much any more, and the only gripe I have is that we non-drinkers have a pathetic selection of possible beverages at receptions.

I am not on here much any more, but had to come back on my one year anniversary - I drank way too much for 25-30 years (I am almost 59 now) and I am very pleased to be done with it. Not sure what my next milestone will be - I still take it day by day...

We'd drink a little bit and be drunk and having a great time all night. Now, now it's different. I keep wishing it could be like that again, but it probably never, ever will be.

Nowadays it's drink after drink just to stay in the ""feeling good"" zone, which is expensive to both my wallet and my health. As many people here have said, waking up sober is a lot more fun than spending the evening drunk. I think I'm gonna get off of it for good. IWNDWYT!",1

So, this is for all of you terrified that you may be doing permanent physical damage!","I ended up in the hospital twice because of my drinking. Once in 2017 which was actually an attempted suicide. Again in October, after falling off the wagon, and attempting to quit cold turkey. 

First of all, if you are a heavy drinker like I was (6 to 8 airplane sized bottles of vodka per day), do NOT go cold turkey. Do NOT listen to people who tell you to ""tough it out"", and get through the withdrawal. I seriously could have had a seizure or a stroke. Every other time I quit, I tapered down to nothing. Very methodically. 1 less drink per day, stretching out the time between drinks longer each day until I was no longer drinking. 

This time, I tried cold turkey because i was terrified my fiance' would leave me otherwise. Well, I almost ""left him"" -- permanently. 

To the original title of this post -- my liver enzymes were literally off the charts. I'm talking about seriously scary amounts. I've had blood tests in the past that indicated 10x normal, and I have been god damned lucky to have them come back down. 

The post I read last night referenced pretty high numbers as well. The poster's doc told him/her to ""cut back"". I call bullshit on that doctor if he/she knows you are an alcoholic. While our bodies (and especially our livers) can be resilient, they DON'T have a lifetime guarantee!

The last 2 weeks have been hell!,"So, I won't go back into all of the details about what happened, but I will say, watch what you say at work -- it can really get you into trouble! 

At last check in, some of you will remember that after a week of torture, they ended up ""writing me up"", and telling me I had to take a sexual harassment course. I was also warned that any further trouble at work would result in termination. I came home, hopped on this sub, to express my relief! 

Here's the catch: 

I changed my legal name about a year ago, and the write up still had my old name. I brought it to HR's attention while in the meeting, and they didn't have me sign it. I work from home, so she told me she would fix the paperwork, email it to me, and have me sign it electronically. She also told me she would send me to the link to sign up for sexual harassment training. 

Monday came, and nothing. Tuesday came, and nothing. Being the anxiety junkie that I am, I was convinced that they either changed their minds, or found out something else that I did wrong (I can't imagine what!) and were going to fire me on Friday! 

Friday arrives, and I have my regular scheduled 1 on 1 meeting with my boss via video conference. I fully expected to enter that video call and see the HR chick sitting there with my boss! Nope -- just my boss, working from home in her fuzzy, comfy sweatshirt. We talked about work stuff, and she gave me a big assignment for next week. 

I still don't know what in the actual fuck happened (HR too busy with end of year stuff and forgot?), but I survived, anxious as fuck, and I DID NOT DRINK! 

I wish I could say that I would not have picked up the bottle if the worst had actually happened, but I know that after only 2 months, I'm still vulnerable.

Alcohol was the only one that crept back in. I was still unsure if I wanted it gone. I had a friend that was questioning the same things. His reasons to keep going was to answer the question, ""Does it bring you joy?""

I think with alcohol it's not so clear. When I quit it had become clear. For months I had what I thought was unwarranted unreasonable anxiety. I had only had this feeling of anxiety in my past when giving speeches or performing in a play or sports. It made no sense, I thought it was a food allergy, lifestyle etc.

Alcohol it was alcohol. A week ago I overdid the drinks on Friday. I woke up at 4am with sweats, high heart rate, and unreasonable fear and dread about everything that could go wrong in my life.

The next day I was fine. I decided to just have one drink in the middle of the day. 3 hours later the dread set in. That settled it for me, I'm done. I don't need random stress brought on by a substance as I have things to do.

I did mention to her I was worried the pain might be related to my drinking and after some talking she congratulated me for quitting, saying it’s a really good idea. She said to come back if the pain isn’t gone in two weeks , but oh boy am I relieved. Not gonna lie, when I walked out the building I started making plans to ‘celebrate’ discovering I haven’t yet fucked up my body with drinking. I even started thinking of buying the more expensive brand of alcohol instead of the cheapest store brand I always get. Then it kinda hit me what I was doing and I had to take a few breaths to stop the thoughts. I decided then to instead focus on being grateful that nothing was wrong and seeing it as me being lucky, not as a sign that ‘ay I guess I can continue drinking now that ‘nothing is wrong’’. It wasn’t easy and today is especially hard, but I’m glad I’m still trying.

Last night while drinking with some buddies I did something I haven't been able to do in years, I stopped right in the middle.  I realized the book was teaching me that I don't even like drinking and it has no benefit.

My conversations were why I was having fun and drinking will only make you louder and slur and come off like am idiot.

He tells you not to stop drinking during the book so you can really ask yourself why you enjoy drinking as you read it.

I don't know long term of this will solve my issue but I'm seeing things so clear and not worrying about if drinks will be around when I go somewhere.

It's like he said, he loves golf, but he doesn't panic if he goes on vacation and golfing isn't available. 

If you haven't read or listened to the audiobook I have to say so far it's worth a read.",8

But every time I quit I find myself completely bored to tears. I have nothing to do in the day and it forces me back to hard drinking.

My area is rural and there's nothing here. I only moved here for work, and I'm out of a job right now. I've seen everything I could see in the nearby city. I don't have any friends or family here or any community. I used to have many interests and hobbies but they're completely exhausted. The only thing I do is play a tedious time-wasting computer game and I'm so tired of computer games.

For meeting others, the only thing on the table is social groups and they rarely suitable. Most are out of my age range. I can never find others who have things in common with me. Travel is difficult here without a vehicle. And just because a group is advertised doesn't mean it exists, I tried one yesterday (took 3 hours of travel) and the building was condemned, like what the fuck.

Whatever I do or wherever I go, it's alone. It's complete shit and I need to get over it. But I don't know what to do with myself. It's seriously hard to stay sober in this situation, it's like being homeless or in prison. Even now I'm desperate for a drink even though I keep pledging to stop. This isn't the way a responsible adult should live. How do I get through the next few hours without drinking??",7

My sister, two stepsisters, their husbands and all the kids were there.

Through the day I watched my husband, stepmum, stepsister and her husband polish off bottle after bottle of champagne, wine, cider and rum. They probably had 2 bottles of wine each, plus other drinks. This was over 8 hours.

It didn’t get crazy or anything. I could tell they were a bit drunk but no-one was annoying or stupid.

I kept remembering how tired/thirsty/restless/crappy I used to feel by 4pm when I drank at events like this. But I still wanted more! And it made me feel dreadful! Instead, I had two desserts and another coffee then drove us home at 8pm.

I don’t think there’s anything I miss about drinking. I still get waves, but really, it’s okay.

Early on in the day someone mentioned my not drinking and I thought “fuck it” and called over to them - so the *entire* gathering heard it - “I don’t drink anymore. I stopped a few months ago.” I was separately cornered by three family members after that, curious to know why I’d stopped. Really? Not at all? Yup. Why? Drank my quota already. My tab ran out.

At least I knocked it all off in one go! Now everyone knows. I’m sure they’re all still curious because I definitely didn’t go into the full story, but I like a bit of mystery. 😉",129

This place is filled with so many old haunts. So many good bars. So many fun memories. I’m still early in sobriety, so the craving to drink occasionally has not been lifted.

Just after a little advice. I'm attending one of my first Christmas 'get togethers' later and presents will be exchanged. Now, everyone knows I've stopped drinking (coming up to 9 months, surreal!), but I've got a couple of weirdly spiteful relatives who I *think* are the type to buy me booze just to be a-holes (under the guise of being nice/giving me a gift, or ""didn't realise I was still not drinking"" etc.). It's all very passive aggressive, haha.

What would you say to them if this turns out to be the case? Just say thank you and take the gift? Politely decline it? Impolitely decline it?

I might be worrying for nothing, but just want to prepare. Also, would really hate to give them the satisfaction of making me look/feel uncomfortable in front of everyone..

Update: They did not gift me alcohol 👍 I feel a bit bad for thinking they would (not completely, I imagine they might have thought about it, haha). Thanks for your suggestions about how to handle it! Happy (sober) holidays! 💚",2

When he finally came to, he was mortified, of course. He had never behaved that way, and we were both shocked; he was humiliated. Even though I had broken up with him already, he seemed to not understand that I still was serious about it. He assumed it would all go away, because he ""never did that before"". I explained that the breakup was already happening, but now things were just awkward. I've asked him to get out this week. I know that puts him in a bind with the holiday, but I want to start the new year fresh, and I want to protect my sobriety. I don't need that around me. We care about each other, and no that one night was not who he is as a person, but I know all too well what alcohol can do to someone. I was that person in my last relationship, but I love myself so much more now. Making good choices for myself won't always come easy, but they will be worth it. 

I posted recently that I had not been drinking, was feeling great, and had broken up with my SO. In a nut shell, when we first began dating, it was fun and friendship, nothing serious in mind, neither of us wanted marriage. We've been living together the last few months out of situation really and didn't plan for it to be long term, and I started to realize that I would eventually want marriage. I changed, he did not, among other things like lack of communication, etc. I was also not drinking, and he had been drinking a lot more. I wanted to make certain steps toward my future, so I explained that to him. 

With it being a week from Christmas and pretty much out of nowhere, I didnt expect him to move out right away. We still care about and respect each other, no big fights or drama, he's never been violent or disrespectful to me or lost his temper. But tonight he came in at 2 a.m., completely shit-faced, pounding on the window as I guess he didnt have his key. He barged through the door when I unlocked it, stumbling through the house. He fell multiple times trying to get undressed and in bed, knocking shit over everywhere. I helped him up and into bed when he started flailing about, sort of heavy petting for lack of a better word and hogging the entire bed. I moved his arm aside and kind of down, so he would stop and I could try to go back to sleep, but he suddenly reached out and grabbed a fistful of my hair. I yelped and smacked his arm away, to which he responded with lashing out, hitting me right across the eye. 

Definitely not regretting my decisions now. Sick of alcohol playing a role in my life, sick of it destroying people. We had the potential to end this and move on in a respectful, loving manner like adults, and alcohol runs everything again. I know he didn't mean to do that, but I also won't tolerate it. 4 days before Christmas. Guess I'll be asking him to leave early, I suppose....at a loss. ??",2

And yesterday we were just on another ""non-date"" like we have been doing for so long and he was dog tired so we only had a short time together. I felt so disappointed, I had been aching to hang with him and after I left I couldn't control it. I drank. I wanted to run and hide and drink and be away from everyone. I still have no idea what it was really all about. No, I do. It was fear of rejection and not being loved and it was a very triggered response.

When I drink I’m loud and annoying, I say whatever is on my mind. He likes to mess with my head when I drink, or afterward I guess. 3 weekends ago he had his brothers and cousin over and we were all drinking and I made everyone dinner and thought I was being really nice to everyone. After they all left we got in a big fight and he told me that I was being such a bitch and no one likes me. We insulted each other and he threw his wedding ring out the window. The next day he told me he confirmed with everyone that I was being an annoying bitch. The day after that, he apologized and said that no one said that. Things never really got better after that, we just kept fighting. Kept drinking - even if we weren’t getting wasted, we were drinking with bad mindsets and grumpy attitudes, which led to more fighting. We say awful things to each other when we are mad and drinking, break things, and sometimes get physical with shoving. Anyway things hadn’t been going well and I had been pretty run down from other things going on in my life. Anyway 2 weekends ago I drank way too much and everything just sort of came to a head. The word divorce has been thrown around so much that I finally just decided maybe it’s time? I haven’t stayed at our house since the 9th and have been sober since the 8th. He’s been drinking the whole time. I even went to the house to talk about our divorce papers since we are doing uncontested and have to agree on debt and property, and he had been drinking. He brought up the initial weekend I was talking about at the beginning of this post and said ACTUALLY everyone DID say you’re annoying a bitch, or whatever. Just shit like that - messing with my head constantly. It makes me feel insane and question everything. It makes me unable to remember reality. It’s maddening. I’m not saying I’m a good drunk, I’m not. I have a problem. But he just constantly messed with my head, but then would call me a manipulator. He makes me so angry. He makes me so sad. And it’s sad, I just know he won’t get sober with me and I don’t want or need to be around it/him drinking. It’s too toxic. And I can’t make him do it either because he will just resent me when he gets tired/bored of being sober. We have a 15 month little girl too and she doesn’t deserve to grow up with us behaving that way. I won’t make her have a childhood she has to heal from.

I’m just getting blamed entirely for “breaking up” the family, but he has told me he wants a divorce too. He has said he hates me, called me terrible names, said I’m an unloyal bad wife, but then will say “how could you?” in regards to ending our marriage. I know he is probably just going through the motions and emotions that come with that, but I feel like I have been dealing with all of this sober and actually really grieving and feeling pain and he’s just drinking and being so harsh. I just don’t know what to do. I feel so miserable and here it is one am and all I want to do is drink. 

He has admitted to having a problem before, guess he doesn’t think he does this go around. But he has done some messed up things to me before because of alcohol and has promised to quit. He has never even tried. I have gone to AA. I have gone to therapy. I have tried. I can’t do all of this on my own, that’s not marriage. So here I am at my parents house trying to keep it together. While he just fucking parties. I know I am doing the right thing and I know I have to do this sober. I know it’s not worth losing even my 11 days. It’s not worth it ever again.

I need to vent to people who will understand somewhat how hard the past few weeks have been for me and any advice you can give. Christmas Day marks 7 months since my last drink, its not my first stint of sobriety but its the longest as I found a way to be able to social and enjoy myself even in settings with plenty of alcohol around. I had got over the social anxiety around becoming a teetotaller, till the past few weeks. I'm an Irish lad on a working holiday in New Zealand and last month moved to a resort town called Queenstown, a notorious party animal spot. I'm 24, working for free accomodation in one of the local hostels on top of my main job till I can save up for my own room soon. Its a beautiful spot, with plenty of healthy activities and adventure sports to do to keep myself busy, but this weekend I've felt close to either relapsing or breaking in anger against a couple of my roommate/colleagues here for their activities.

In the 6 months previous I had built some solid friendships with guys who are supportive of my choices to not drink in my last spot (Auckland). Now that I'm in a new spot it's like starting all over again and the drinking/drugs culture among the other internationals here is beyond anything I've seen before. I've had to deal with the usuallly innocent comments like 'huh you don't drink?!' which generally don't bother me at all anymore, but it goes beyond that here. Last night was a leaving do for one of the staff and about 15 people piled into our 8-share dorm, drinking, blasting tunes till 4am and snorting coke. Reception dude came up a couple of times to tell them to leave/turn the tunes off but they flat out ignored him. I let them tear away not wanting to cause any arguments but I was visibly pissed off and couldn't hide it, so some of the more drunk or high ones called me out and said I was a boring cunt and the like, one lit a cigarette in our non smoking room with the balcony door closed, one of my roommates instead of backing me up when I told her to get out  was undermining me in front of the others for a laugh, , the list goes on.

So that's basically the straw that's broken the back, I hope I get a room soon but this week has been awful. I don't have my support network down here, Christmas is next week and my head is getting wound up in circles between the anger, sadness, paranoia and I'm doubting myself.

Tons of kids and parents.  It was a blast - a really successful gathering.  I socialized,  which I'm terrible at.  I mingled and laughed and told jokes.  I hugged a dozen kids. I spoke in front of the whole group of them. 

After they all left,  four hours later,  I realized that I hadn't once thought about drinking or wished I'd had some.  In the past, I'd have probably had a sippy of wine in my room to sneak pulls from. 

One of the things that frustrated me most in earlier sobriety was how I just constantly thought about alcohol.  I would get so tired of thinking about it! And now I'm finally at a place where that just isn't the case anymore.  It does go away,  or at least diminish significantly.  To those of you super frustrated because it feels like alcohol is always in the forefront of your thoughts... that does end,  eventually.  ♥️",8

I found a love for whisky about three years ago. I was interested in the process, and how each bottle could have a burst of different flavors. I began to collect them, and picking a different whisky for certain occasions. In the three years, I  had collected over 100 bottles of different whiskies. And tried all of them.  I promised myself that I would only drink on the weekends. And I did...for awhile. 

But within the last year, several people at my job left. And the workload tripled for me, and my remaining co-workers. I would come home exhausted. I began to pour myself a glass to “unwind” 

But soon, one glass became two. Then two became four. On weekends it would be even more. I’d finish half a bottle in a single weekend. I would wake up hungover and miserable, and denying everything I said in my stupor when my girlfriend confronted me about it. It was no longer a hobby. It was a vice. 

I was given an ultimatum. Either put down the bottle, or we were done...so I did. I love this women more than anyone on this earth, and I never realized the damage I was causing to her, and to myself. 

So, I bought two massive storage boxes and put all the whisky up. Slowly giving them away to friends. All but 12 bottles are gone now. And I never felt so good. It’s amazing to wake up not hungover, or over a toilet. 

I now use the “skills” I picked up tasting whisky to make my own coffee blends. And I love it even more than whisky.  Six months down. Forever to go!

I had well over a year sober. And then, I don't know, it just took one to slip back into old habits of binge drinking. Here are some absolutes that I've learned about myself since I started to drink again:

-I hate who I am when I'm drunk. 

-I cannot just have one.

-I will not stop drinking until I make myself sick no matter how hard I try to moderate. 

-I become a burden to those around me. 

-At first drinking feels like I'm making real social connections but later it feels like looking for love with a prostitute.

-The hangovers severely limit my ability to function and complete simple tasks.

-I'm throwing away money. 

-Consumption of alcohol is poisoning my body. 

-I hate not having the freedom to leave a situation and drive myself home when I please. 

-It causes problems in my relationship (my boyfriend doesn't drink)

-I lose control of my emotions and become impulsive. 

-It makes me seek out other drugs.

-It fucks with my gut and causes stomach problems. 


I cannot list one positive thing about drinking. I must stop. I've come so far and never before had I made as much progress in life and school as I did when I was sober. I miss my sober self. She was kind, levelheaded, sharp witted, pragmatic, confident and got shit done. In time I will regain these qualities but until I quit drinking, I'll never be myself again.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

  
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**  
I'm   pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)  and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a  long  time and want to inspire others.

It   doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day.  For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

  
**This pledge is a statement of intent.**  
Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!  What happens if we can't keep to our pledge?  We give up or try   again? Since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) , we're not ready to give up.

  
**What this is:**   

 A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

  
**What this isn’t:**    

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**This post goes up at:**  
US—Night/Early Morning  
Europe—Morning  
Asia and Australia—Evening/Night  

A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

**If  you would like to host the ""Check In"" please let me know.  All you need  is a computer, a willingness, and 30 days sober.**  
I am going to end this week of hosting on a more upbeat quote.

I haven't been social in the last 3 years due to mental health difficulties resulting in a severe emotional dependency on alcohol. I'm really nervous to say the least as most of these people feel so distant from me now, and I know for a fact my anxiety is going to be through the roof there. 2020 is the year I'm convinced I will flip this habit on it's head, but I can't help but feel tomorrow will be impossible without a drink.

I know it seems like an excuse to say 'just get this out of the way', but I really want to make an effort, enjoy time with my friends and don't think I can partake in a situation like that sober yet, hell I'm still stuggling cutting down on the binge drinking I do alone.

Is this stupid? Should I just go and attempt to do it sober and possibly have multiple panic attacks? do I not go at all, feel sorry for myself and possibly binge alone instead? Do I do what I can to take the steps in the right direction but see tomorrow as too big a challenge to attempt just yet?

My brain hurts. All I want to do is head over the shop now to ease the over thinking about tomorrow but that is my first challenge, I believe I can get through tonight without.

I went to a concert and had three beers and a margarita with friends. Feeling hungover today was unpleasant, but I’m actually surprised by how the experience has strengthened my resolve to continue choosing to live a sober life. Far from feeling derailed or disappointed in myself, I feel like I can finally see clearly: my life is better without alcohol. 

Last night, I didn’t drink because of an impulse; I went into the night knowing I would drink as sort of an experiment, to see how it would feel and to bring all the new insights I’ve gained in my weeks sober (recognition of the unconscious thoughts that create my desire to drink, a true understanding that I don’t actually *need* alcohol to relax or have fun, etc.) and to examine drinking from the inside out. I guess I was curious to see if I still like it anymore. And it was so interesting to see the world after a couple drinks with the new perspective I’ve gained. I was aware of how distracted I was, thinking about my next drink or about how much/fast I was drinking compared to other people around me. I was aware that my conversation skills were lacking, that I’m truly more interesting, smarter, funnier, and more fun when I’m sober. I recognized the way alcohol altered my thinking and made everything a little bit worse.

Factoring into my decision to try a few drinks was also the fact that I’d been struggling with seeing drinking as black and white, all or nothing. I don’t like that idea. I definitely don’t want to go back to drinking regularly, but I kept having the thought that maybe it’s okay every once in a while. And I’d also been resisting sobriety as defining my identity. I guess I didn’t really like the idea that being sober is who I am now, when for so long, “fun” drinking has been an integral part of my idea of myself. Those unconscious notions run deep. Anyway, despite this bump in the road and a hangover today, I feel like this experience helped me. I feel ready to embrace sobriety as a major part of who I am and to continue to move forward without alcohol in my life.",9

Little background about me. I have been drinking heavily for about 6 years(31yo). Was a daily drinker for a while, maybe 4-10 drinks. Then got scared of becoming dependent and for the last 4 years or so I have been a 3-4 time a week binge drinker. Anywhere from 10-20+ drinks in a night. Taking 3-5 day periods off every couple of weeks. 

Last year I was diagnosed with MS and they did blood work. My AST was 400 and ALT was 313. The doctor wasn’t that concerned though and basically said to cut back. 

I didn’t really and had another blood test 6 months ago and my AST was 225 and ALT was 215. So they dropped, that made me happy I guess. But now I have some pain in my right side. And I’m terrified I have cirrhosis. 

Anyone have levels this high and recovered?

For what it’s worth my Albumin, Bilirubin, etc.... was all normal. 

I also have horrible anxiety which is a plus in this case as it’s really given me the kick in the pants I need to be serious.

I got up at my normal 5am and headed into work. After my 45 minute commute, I was already thinking about and jonesing for a drink. By 9:00am I could feel my heart racing and my anxiety levels were through the roof. My company had our Christmas party at 1130 and I knew there was no way I would be able to enjoy the party and not drink. So I went home. I spent time with my baby. Took a good shower, dressed myself nicely for probably the first time in a month, and went with my wife and baby to the mall to see Santa. After Santa, we went out to eat...as soon as we walked in I could feel my anxiety building again. The restaurant we went to is a sports bar/grill and there were more than enough people drinking. So what did I do? I ordered a water, talked to my wife about my new lifestyle choice, and by the time we left I was at ease. I’m back home now, and while my marriage is still nowhere near what I want it to be (and deservedly so), I feel much better. I spoke with a personal trainer to get back into the gym on Monday and get rid of the years of beer belly. It’s not a lot, but it’s a start. Just wanted to let everyone know that not drinking is something that can most definitely be done! With the right mindset and beginning to establish new life goals, we can all kick the shitty habit of needing to drink. Stay strong everyone.",9

I’ve been visiting this sub since I quit cold turkey at the beginning of June - it’s been monumentally helpful and inspiring:) Over the time since I’ve quit sobriety has become my new norm and I haven’t really thought about drinks much and, in turn, haven’t been on here. However, over the past couple of months I’ve started having a lot of trouble dealing with anxiety and depression. I’m sure I’ve always had a problem with those, but now they seem super amplified. I feel like maybe my pink cloud (?) period is over and I’m now having to face these things head on, and it’s been a huge struggle. I have a doc who’s willing to give me antidepressants (although I don’t really want to) and a new therapist, so that’s helpful. I know working through these things will take some time so I have to be patient, but it’s hit me pretty heavy and I’m a little surprised. Is this normal? Have any of you experienced anything like this? Looking for any advice, understanding, etc. Many thanks in advance:)",3
2019-12-20 18:04:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/edhkix/progress_not_perfection/,Progress not perfection,"I woke up this morning completely disappointed in myself. Last night I decided a beer sounded good, so I went to the bar and ended up drinking 6 of them 🤦prior to last night I've been sober since October so this really took a blow to my ego and made me feel like complete garbage today.  Despite how low I feel I learned alot from this experience and wanted to document it so I could look back on it. 

-Life is about progress not perfection. 
I've had more sober days in the past two months than I've had in two years. I may have days like this where I slip up and drink excessively but I'm not nearly in the low place I once was. Celebrate how far you've come. 

-Take the lesson and grow from the experience.
I woke up this morning with a recommendation on YouTube from this naked mind. It was an eerie coincidence, after my drunken night, but I've been neglecting feeding my mind with alcohol related material and I've avoided looking at this sub. Changing a behavior takes time and never think you can change over night. Do the work and be consistent with it. 

-Dont dwell in the past or in your mistakes. 
I truly believe the universe will keep giving you the same lesson until you acknowledge, learn from it, and make progress towards choosing a different choice. Yesterday I was feeling a tad lonely and sad, which is why I use to drink daily; to numb the feelings and make ""friends"" at the bar. I need to be more diligent in recognizing my triggers and finding new and improved choices to cope with my feelings. 

Don't look backwards, look forward! Today's a new day and a new opportunity to be sober ❤️ we're just flawed humans trying to make better choices.",6

There were too many lessons I had to learn along the way, about my triggers, what alcohol meant to me, and how I can live my life without it.  The last time, this time, I almost didn't try, because I was so downtrodden by my failures.  ""I've tried 5 times!  Obviously it's just not possible for me.""  But now, as I live my life with my happiness multiplied, I see that I am navigating using all the lessons I had learned in my failures.  You don't just pick up a bike and ride it.  You fall off and scrape your knee a few times.

All this is to say, if you have tried and failed:  CONGRATULATIONS!  You are one step closer to winning.  Now get back on the bike and try again.

Go-go-going, working on my mind, and... drinking... kept me from going back down a dark path: no more drinking.

I am happy, yet the thoughts still come - the pain. I have pscyhology degrees now and know what to do. The pain would also come back with a vengence if I slow too much, so I do-do-do. I do not want to die.

I will take two weeks off I planned over the Summer. Tomorrow is the first day. I am targeting my mind with every tool in my inventory to assess, plan, and plan for planning. 

My attack plan to get to a year sober and beyond, continue to be happy, and start my non profit (it may be structured as a profit for the short term; I have business experience and quite a bit saved...) occurs on Jan 6th. I will share my heart even if it hurts. 

There is only one option and that option is life to the fullest.

Im looking for work, and most of my work experience is serving/bartending. I'm good at it, and it's the best money I am qualified to make. It's tourist season here in SWFL so business is hoppin.

How do I survive this? Being around drunks and alcohol gives me huge anxiety and a desire to drink. But I have to make money, the bills are piling up. I have to find a job asap and serving is my best bet. But I don't want to break sobriety either.

I've done alot of irresponsible things in the course of my life, but last night made the top of the list. I walked out of the bar and got in my vehicle cause I thought I was just fine. I made it half way home before pulling over to get sick after just about hitting another vehicle. I completely blacked out and with a dead phone I couldnt call anyone to bring me home.

2019-12-20 13:07:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eddomj/my_story_about_successful_control/,My story about successful control.,"I gave myself permission to attempt to drink in moderation.  After talking with my therapist, it became evident as to why I couldn’t control myself in social outings or at parties. So, having that advice in my back pocket, I decided to drink last night, but control it. 

While friends were already on their 3rd or 4th, I was casually sipping on my first. When the waitress came around, I declined when everyone else ordered. When the drink was gone, I ate the ice cubes. 

I wasn’t drunk. I wasn’t buzzed. I was tired, cold and not really interested in having anything more to drink. I looked into the bottles of people’s beers and thought to myself, I can’t imagine having to drink that down right now, it just looks like it tastes gross. 

I came home and instead of passing out or puking, as I usually would do, I had a nice long hot shower and it was luxurious. 

So how do I feel today?  Like shit. I think I’m tired from not having slept much last night (got home very late). I drank in moderation and with control, but it was still too much. I’m not hungover per se, but I feel the effects of alcohol.  I am lethargic and tired from just being out so late and being up so early. 

I am glad I did this. I am proud of myself for taking my therapists advice and adhering to it. But it also made me learn a lesson. Drinking alcohol is drinking alcohol. I get physical effects no matter if I have one or 20. Sometimes I’ll get symptoms of what feels like a head cold. I’ll bloat. I’ll crave unhealthy foods. 

So, I did it, I controlled and I moderated. But, even then, it wasn’t worth it.

I am 58 years old and have been an addict/alcoholic since I was 26.  I went to rehab and aa in the beginning.  I managed throughout the years to have long stretches of sobriety.  In 2006 I was diagnosed with Lupus.  In 2013 I went on disability and moved from the south to way up north to be closer to my aging mother.  In 2017 I had bariatric surgery and 2 knee replacement surgeries.  Obviously that meant being on opiates for several weeks.  When it was time to go off of them and I no longer had food to turn to it was obvious to me that the reasonable (seriously?) alternative was alcohol.  For the last 1 1\\2 yrs I have drank almost everyday.  My health is getting worse, it is getting harder and harder to hide the tremors and I have started to regain back some of the 150 lbs I have lost.  

I live in a very rural area in the mountains with limited ability to get around due to horrible road conditions.  The closet AA meeting is 30 miles away down the mountain.  I was never really totally convinced that AA is the only way to get and stay sober.  I have spent the last few days reading this sub, and devising a plan to stay on the road I started 38 hrs ago.

I am looking into finding an online therapist, staying busy to keep my mind occupied and spending time on this sub reading stories of inspiration and taking comfort in how kind and non-judgmental y'all are.  I am feeling better already today and I am looking forward to finding the desire to take up my old hobbies, enjoy exercising again, not having the tremors anymore, not waking up scared that I might have done something stupid or harmful last night, and most of all finding peace in life again.  Thank y'all for taking the time to read this.  IWNDWYT (I have really been looking forward to saying that!)",10

As I’m sure most of you notice, it seems that many people who ask this question tend to be hoping for an answer that gives them some way to justify or comfort themselves about their own drinking, or to make it seem like you were just some abnormal, raging alcoholic or something. For example, when I have responded by saying I want to be healthier or the likes, I have gotten back things like “well good for you - but for ME it just isn’t a PROBLEM” or the old “oh, it can be perfectly healthy if you just keep it to one or two” etc. etc. etc. Thus, my main goal is to basically try to shut down that sort of thing before it even begins.   

So. A couple of answers I have been tumbling around in my little head are:

“That’s a good question, but I like to take it back a little further and ask myself, ‘Why did I ever START drinking in the first place?’ And since I come up with no good answer to that, I figure, why continue?” 

“I finally realized that the benefits of drinking are illusory, so for me, there is nothing to justify its costs anymore.”  

“Because I find that everything is actually so much more fun without it”   

“For the same reason I don’t do meth. Not that I’ve ever tried meth, but why would I?”   

“Because it puts money in the pockets of [evil people] and I’m trying to boycott all products that do so.”   

“Because I don’t want to teach my kid to think that being a drinker is normal or necessary.”   

“Because all it does is give me a super awful case of the shits/diarrhea.” (This one’s my favorite LOL)   

Anyone have any other good ones to share? Again, I’m looking for responses that tend to pre-emptively shut down arguments in favor of drinking/commentary that makes us feel like outsiders or abnormal for not drinking.

Today marks one week since my last drink and I'm angry. I've been emerging myself in AA because I *know* that those around me who are able to maintain sobriety were only able to do so through AA, and they were successful in the program solely because they embraced a higher power. I know I have to find something/someone to have faith in which is pissing me off because I just can't wrap my mind around the idea of faith/higher power.

I am a control freak, I believe everyone has full autonomy and will to control their lives. No higher power is in control or is protecting us. I'll give the classic example that fuels my resentment of the higher power/god idea: war, poverty, suffering, hunger, abuse, greed, and overall evil. I was raised in a non-believing environment; no holidays, not even birthday celebrations, and no praying. Just logic and reason. When I was younger, I sometimes went to church/temple with friends after a sleepover. It drove me fucking insane, made me completely angry that people were using god as a scapegoat for their problems and also using it as a solution. I believe in science, all forms of therapy, philosophy, and even fucking yoga. Things with tangible reason/theory behind them, things I can use to personally better myself. And from experiencing/witnessing alcoholism and mental illness, I *do* believe nature and nurture form people. I don't think a creator just designed a flawed system, that seems counterproductive.

I am *really* fucking trying to believe and give in, it sounds freeing and healing and I want that for myself. But I can't stop thinking that I am fully responsible and accountable for myself, that I have to be the one to work for and through sobriety. 

I'm not sure if this post has a point. I'm just extremely frustrated and when I try to express this at step or discussion meetings no one seems to fully understand, they always had access to faith and they never experienced my doubt. Which only perpetuates feelings of isolation and frustration for me because it takes a lot for me to silence my ego and ask for help. Now I'm not receiving the guidance and empathy that AA supposedly provides in recovery.",3

* Come out and transitioned to being the woman I always knew I was
* Met the most amazing partner
* Completed dialectical behavioral therapy which was a HUGE deal
* Learned to sew and made my first halloween costume ever
* Learned how to rock climb
* Taken off all my antidepressants 
* Got a promotion at work and my boss urging me to apply for an even higher role
* Made some of the best friends of my life


Some days I'm _too_ happy to the point of exhaustion. No more of your poisoning depression alcohol!! You steal my time and money and happiness. Instead of doing all of these amazing things, I just drank to fill the void. No more, I say!!

For me, my taste in so many things changed.  I stopped abusing myself, am learning how to refuse to accept abuse from others and am working towards truly healthy relationships with myself and others, which is a part of the journey I didn't anticipate. It was like I woke up and could see clearly that I was changing, growing, and could see that many in my life were from an older part of myself that was stuck, not the new part of me that's slowly pushing through the earth up towards the sun. 

It's been eye-opening as I move on my journey to realize the relationships that just won't survive my own changes, and I hope to find new relationships that align with a more healthy life and sense of self.  I write this because honestly it's been super lonely in many ways and I have a lot of grief over the past that I'm working through.

I'm 32, and been hit with the ""if you drink again, we're over"" line for the second time in my life. I've been sober 5 days now since hearing that. 

Prior to this I've recently moved to Horsens (Denmark) from London after taking drastic steps to work on my recovery. I now feel disconnected and isolated from my recovery, so I'd love to make some new connections with you internet folks! 

The reason I mention my age and the title is because I'd like to hear more about what the road could be like for me. I spent 3 months on a recovery programme in London and at points felt like I needed to justify why I was there. The phrase, ""you're still young"" has been bandied about so much since I vocalised my realisations about this addiction.

I played a three hour show last night and this morning I'm headed out for a run. Didn't see this phase coming but I'm loving it.

As I packed up my gear, which has gotten gradually lighter, smaller and more compact, a pattern emerged. I'm contracting in all the ways.

Since I stopped drinking there have been ups and downs but overall I am consuming less, weighing less, and spending less.

I looked at my list of goals for the holiday break and they all involve having less - clean the garage, reorganize my home office, trim back all the plants outside. I have already purged my clothing and remodeled a bathroom that badly needed it. Everywhere I look there are things I want to get rid of.

On the work front I am taking major steps to simplify my business and responsibilities, even at a potential reduction of income. I just want less to do, less to distract me. 

More than anything, my focus is smaller. I realized just now, I haven't worried about the distant future in over a month. I'm working on myself instead of on my world, turning that energy inward, chopping a small, intentional path through a huge life full of things I cannot control. The smaller the path, the faster I go. It takes everything I've got, in a good way. Today is enough for today. 

My time is not only a limited resource, it's really all I have that's worth guarding. Habits, people, food, stuff all comes and goes but myself and I are getting to know each other again. This is born entirely out of removed distractions.

2019-12-20 06:36:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ed91jh/planning_a_work_christmas_party/,Planning a work Christmas party,"Hi guys. I haven’t posted here in such a long time but I’m having an uncharacteristically bad couple of days in the sobriety dept & I really am too embarrassed to talk to anyone I know in real life about it haha. Didn’t know where else to turn.

So I’ve been sober 3.5 years. Usually I’m pretty tough in drinking situations & white knuckle my way right through. I am also a hotel general manager stuck with the unfortunate task of planning my work Christmas party on a shoestring budget for the 3rd year in a row. I’m only 27, half my staff is older than me and probably critical of my every move, and despite being their boss I am paralyzed by caring what everyone thinks.

I also have a crippling fear of looking awkward or lame & for some odd reason thought purchasing a few handles of liquor would be a better idea than the usual wine and beer options. Figured all my employees could make their own drinks, get wasted, and entertain themselves instead of me uncomfortably attempting to organize cheesy games for a large group of mismatched adults & their significant others while stone cold sober.

I purchased the booze yesterday and after some thought about the fact the party is literally AT THE HOTEL in my conference room (so person working desk shift isn’t too left out) and that I don’t have a bartender (again budget, super casual event for my staff of 25 & their guests) that just throwing out a couple handles of captain, absolut, jack, etc. is honesty tacky as hell and a poor decision haha. I’m not sure what I was thinking and honestly my boss, the hotel owner, will question my judgement even buying liquor. I don’t think I can return it even unopened (never saw the need to return alcohol so not 100% sure) and so now I have over 150 bucks worth of booze to explain on my expense reports. 

Can somebody just reaffirm that I’m not a complete idiot and that any recovering alcoholic could be excused in not thinking most people won’t appreciate a frat house-esque set up of some bottles and solo cups? Also that a temporary lapse in judgement when your mouth is watering at the liquor store is totally understandable even if you can’t tell your boss that. Right? 

Ugh. The holidays are hard man. Anybody else a complete awkward mess in regardless to all things alcohol after quitting?",2

I started the year taking campral, but quit that in about March as it stopped working on me. I thought fuck it and went cold turkey.

 I have had a number of slips in the second half of the year and each one has hit quite hard , including one quite recently. This has had me down for a few weeks so I think it's good to remember that I went from April through August totally tee-total, and have only really had say three or four times where I relapsed. I could probably count the number of times since April when I drank. 

  Maybe just to cheer myself up, but I think overall that is pretty good progress. 

  What is perhaps better is that my resolve grows gradually stronger the longer I am sober. And my desire to drink is very very low. For example, stress is no.longer a trigger at all. 

  I feel like I am starting to really get used to just being sober. I can say it's definitely a new lifestyle with it's own set of skills so it takes time to learn it. 

 Next year the target is to be more social without drinking but keep up the non drinking .

 See you next year peeps. Have a good sober Xmas and New Year.",2

This is probably my 10th time quitting. This time is different though because I quit a day before I had my gallbladder removed. 
I told myself before I got it removed that getting it removed was the beginning of a new me.
I quit drinking and starting eating way healthier. I'm feeling so much better, although I think some of me feeling better is attributed to getting the gallbladder removed that had been giving problems for over 2 years. 
So now, I have problems sleeping or staying asleep.
I've always struggled with this whenever I've been sober.
I'm going on day four of getting five or less hours of sleep at night.
I took a melatonin last night. Fell asleep at 11pm woke up at 3:30am

It was a bit over 2 years ago when I woke up realizing what a complete mess I was. What used to feel like some harmless nights out (and in when killing time) was slowly turning into moments that I would greatly regret.

I would push shopping carts in the streets, pass out on public transportation, throw up at the end of the night and say the most regrettable things to my friends and loved ones (including my now ex) just to name a few. The worst part was that wall of anxiety I felt every morning. It would be overwhelming and turn me into a very toxic person. I would feel like my friends all turned against me because of my unknown behaviour after blacking out.

On October 1st, 2017, I woke up from a night where I mixed alcohol with benzos that was offered to me on the street. I supposedly blacked out, yelled at people, badmouthed a (thankfully very patient) bouncer, got touchy feely with everyone and cried to my now ex about how our relationship was coming to an end.

My head was absolutely pounding, I had THE worst anxiety I could ever imagine and I was given the most embarrassing lectures. One of which was from my friend who is currently doing her residency who informed me about the dangers of mixing benzos. That’s when I knew that something had to change.

It started with a month. I would stay sober at all costs and see how it feels. My mind was clear, I saved a lot of money, but I wasn’t sure how my anxiety would go eventually. Everything was smooth until a close friend committed suicide at the end of the month. It was incredibly hard to take. One less voice in my life that I knew wasn’t ever coming back. I had to make a decision. Do I fall off the wagon or do I soldier on for another month? So I decided to keep it up for another month.

At the end of month 2, I got dumped by my girlfriend of 3 years. I was a complete mess, but then realized just how much support I had from my friends. I realized just how lucky I was to have people in my life who are genuinely here for me and don’t just hang out with me for drinks. It was then when I realized that this wasn’t as hopeless as I thought.

By month 3, I lost the woman who took me under her wing when I moved to my current city 4 years ago. She was truly like a big sister to me. She would bring me lunch at work, invite me to some events to try and make me happy and we would always chat about things during our breaks at work. What she never spoke about (but I was very well aware of) was her growing struggle with drugs. One morning, I got a phone call and found out that she died of an overdose of similar effects to if I would have kept mixing benzos with other substances. It traumatized me enough to hold it off for another 6 months. At that point, I knew I could rely on my friends for their support.

Long story short, that 6 months turned into a lifelong goal that is becoming increasingly easier as urges have completely went away now. My anxiety isn’t anywhere near as bad as I know for a fact that I have my friends, family and my newfound relationship with God. While I did have some moments of weakness, I’m very glad that I just kept soldiering on and talked to some of the new sober friends that I made when it happened.

2 years later, I am now happily married to a woman I met in Japan, my nose is back in the book as I’m working on finding a better job and life couldn’t really be much better. I’m not by any means a successful guy, but I can say that it’s much easier to be happy with what I have and the people that surround me so it’s much more easy to focus on getting there all while keeping a smile. 

It’s been a solid year since I even craved a drop and I couldn’t be anymore grateful. I guess I could say that my life being back on track is the reason why I lost count.",10

I am hoping to get some advice/insight from others who have made it through the detox and withdrawal process and are on the other side.  

Background: I have 1 day of sobriety behind me, but all the articles that I've been reading have me scared to continue this process at home alone without tapering or going to the doctor for help. I have been drinking pretty much every single day for the last year or two, and I typically end up drinking between 1 and 1.5 bottles of wine per day. I didn't typically get drunk, but would consume the drinks over a period of 6 or so hours. I had about a week this month where I was only drinking 3 to 4 drinks per day, but then I recently had an awful binge where I had about 50 drinks in a 4 day period. It was after this binge that I finally was able to stop and get 28 hours of sobriety (thanks to this sub!). Man, that feels so good to say since I haven't been able to stay sober for more than a day in years.

Yesterday I felt hung over for the whole morning, but was feeling fairly normal in the afternoon. I'm feeling positive about staying sober today, but I'm kind of scared to go to sleep since the articles that I've read said that severe symptoms like seizures and hallucinations could come on suddenly. I don't have anyone here to watch me, and I'm wondering how likely this is to happen and whether I should decide to go back and taper in order to avoid dangerous/life threatening symptoms especially with no one here to help me.  I really don't want to lose my day of sobriety and start over, but I also don't want to die. I've never been through withdrawals before since I've never really tried to quit, so I'm very nervous with all the stuff I've read.

If anyone could share their experience, or could tell me if it was obvious to them when they needed to go to the hospital  I'd really appreciate it. You all have already helped me so much with your stories, thank you for helping me get through the day!",5

I would like to thank you guys n gals for sharing your stories, trials and victories here. Even though i rarely participate in sharing i do however read a lot here. Sometimes offering advice that helped me. Five years ago i had lost everything. My vehicle, my house and was living with my parents. With no prospects for the future and a long line of previous employers i had ultimately ended up getting fired from. So my future employment and prospects looked very shakey at best but when i got out of rehab i got a call from my best friend that i grew up with since the age of about 6, whom i had not talked to in years due to my isolation and shame from my addiction and current status. He asked me to come to his wedding. I agreed and went with a borrowed vehicle, gas and clothes bought by my parents. While i was there and we got reassociated he asked why i just ""fell off the face of the earth"". I came clean and explained what i did to my life. He offered me a job working with him right there, told me ""good thing you don't have a house, because you now live where ever we are working"" (he was a pipeline forman) My life came together at a rate i had never guessed could of happened, working around guys 6 days a week for years on end i came out of my isolation and slowly started to develop a sense of self worth. two years into the most transformative period in my life we had a spread wide shutdown (everyone goes home for 1-2 weeks). During that time my friend had driven a side by side to a local bar with one of his friends, then when driving home (he was in a rural area) he hit an approach at the end of his driveway and put a tire into a culvert flipping the side by side and it threw him from the vehicle, rolling over him and he lost his life. The fact he had been drinking is what killed him. The grief would of drove me to drink, had my friend been sober when he died i absolutely would have. Instead i got a furious haterid for the shit that took so much from me, and now took again. Anyway, i ended up buying his personal truck from his wife, and yesterday i landed in Calgary AB after working a 2 week shift in Fort McMurray, i stayed the night because my flight gets in so late and its dangerous to drive 6 hrs through mountain roads in winter let alone pitch blackness. In the morning, today (19th) i was leaving, and i spotted a company truck, one we both work for (very large company). Out of curiosity i checked the unit number. Yup, it was my best friends work truck he had been using for 6 years prior to his passing. There i am, sitting in his personal truck, following his work truck to go back home. The odds of that happening, on the exact day i hit my 5 years of sobriety is, unlikely to put it mildly. I honestly don't know where i am going anymore, but i do know IWNDWYT",91

I just feel like I will never have a halfway functional relationship with anyone.  I guess the good news is that I am sober today.  In the past, breakups have always been one of the many reasons I gave myself to drink. 

I know looking at Instagram isn't real - some of the most unhappy people I know have the most gorgeous Instagrams.  Here I am sitting in my ratty sweater & I'm looking at him doing fun stuff and I start to feel bad. At least I'm posting here rather than getting drunk. That's a huge accomplishment & I know I need to celebrate that.

As I write this, I guess the real pain isn't even the guy, it's the sense that I've worked so hard on myself over the past few years and sometimes feel like I have so little to show for it. 

I guess the other side of that is that if I hadn't done the work I've done so far I know my life would be that much worse.  Right now it just doesn't feel like it's very good at all & I know that there's no dude or one relationship that will solve all the problems.  I guess I just read sometimes about people with amazing partners & for once in my life I'd like to feel what it likes to have that.  \\

Today we were notified that he didn’t show up for work which is unusual for him, he didn’t answer his phone or respond to text messages.

It started with me saying I was dreading Christmas, because I have to come back to town a day before my wife and kids.  Normally, that's the time to really shine!  I'd buy a couple sixers of my favorite beer, a fifth of cheap whiskey, and just get obliterated by myself.  I LLOOOOVVVEDD being drunk alone.  Just me and my drunkenness, no one judging me, no reason to ""act sober.""  

She couldn't relate at all.  She drank in the afternoon after picking up her toddler from preschool to relieve the stress of motherhood, be in a better mood with her husband, just generally take the edge off of daily life.  She said she's always loved having sober alone time and hated being alone with even a buzz.  

For me, it was like a mental masturbation.  It was purely because I liked my buzz in my own head, and nothing more.  We both learned what a different type of addiction to the same substance can look like.  She's even an NP in Psychiatry and hadn't really run into the different motivations for why we do what we do.

I think it's some kind of boundary issue that thrives on acquiescing and giving my power away by playing the out of control drunk.  

2019 was a really rough year where I totaled my car drunk driving.  I don't remember the impact of whatever hit me (or whatever I hit -- not a car or person, thank god) because I was black out drunk and roofied.  I don't remember leaving the bar.  Somehow I was unharmed.  

I can't tell the rest of the story right now. It's too private.  But, I am going to write something just for me about it tonight. I will for sure up date you guys later. 

As for 11 days ago:  I thought I could moderate.  I went out with friends and had a few.  Now that you mention it, I had been drinking all day.  I thought I ate enough. Some people I had drunkenly judged ended up getting me home.  They fucking got me home and I didn't even know them.  They told the friend that I had been partying with that I was incoherent.  I do not remember anything past a karaoke song I was singing. I lost my bankcard.

I know and am aware of the risks and dangers of even looking down that rabbit hole. I'm taking my anxiety and depression meds like I always have and seeing my therapist regularly.

2019-12-19 22:37:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ed4gq3/need_some_input_on_my_current_situation/,Need some input on my current situation.,"I'll try to keep this as concise as possible, but I'd really love to here some input from you guys. I've had some serious substance abuse issues for a solid 7 year chuck of my life. I was partial to Opiates but I also abused alcohol and benzos heavily and used all other manner of drugs in between. This substance abuse was heavily tied to my crippling anxiety and depression (the result of heavy childhood trauma). 

Around this time last year I was in REALLY bad shape. I'd OD'd 7 times throughout 2018 and by the end of the year I had lost my job and was locked up in my apartment drinking a half gallon a day trying to work up the nerve to kill myself. Out of the blue a friend of mine who I hadn't talked to in a long time called me and eventually I filled him in on how bad my current predicament was. He was living on the other side of the country and seemed to be doing quiet well for himself since I last saw him and he ended up extending an invitation for me to come out and live with him. At this point I figured ""what the hell"", I might as well give it a shot.

Long story short; I headed out there a few weeks later, he set me up with a job and introduced me to his new circle of friends. A funny thing happened in the year I was out there.....My crippling depression cleared up entirely, my anxiety became infinitely more manageable, I cut out all the hard drugs and was eventually drinking casually like a normal person.....It wasn't even like I had to try I was just so focused on work, meeting new people, going to new places and having new experiences. I was (and still am) genuinely happy....something I hadn't experienced since early childhood. I gained a lot of confidence and actually started to believe in myself for once.

The problem was I had left home with a lot of unfinished business behind me. Financial issues, legal issues, family issues that would eventually need to be addressed. I recently moved back to handle all of this and plan on returning to my friends in about 8 months which is about the time I need to get everything squared away. I'm currently in sober housing and plan on staying completely abstinent for the time I am here. I honestly have no cravings or desire to drink/or use drugs because I'm so intensely focused on taking care of business here and returning to where I really belong, amongst true friends. 

The sober living program I'm in is very 12 step focused and I've all but given up trying to explain any of this to people in ""the program"" because they all pretty much just write me off as deluded and think I'm lying to myself. I'm not trying to push this on anyone but I just feel so isolated because I'm not drinking the AA/NA cool-aid. I'm going to therapy and have friends I can talk to on the phone but it's just difficult at times. There are part's of 12 step programs that I think are very beneficial and I'm certainly participating in those but as a whole it can just be so rigid. There's a lot of wonderful people in these programs but this idea that if I don't work the steps consistently and don't stay completely abstinent my life will inevitably spiral completely out of control ultimately ending in prison or death.....don't know.

I'd just really love some input from people who may have had somewhat of a similar experience. Did it work out? or not....or just any input at all would be greatly appreciated.",2

I used to drink to black out but haven't really been able to for the past few years and now just drink until I am totally ""f***** up"". I had above average intelligence as a child and adolescent and started to notice a decline about three years ago, starting with difficulty with my short-term memory and thinking of ""smart things"" to say. Now I'm at the point where I'm having difficulty forming sentences or talking without mumbling, and my memory is completely shot. I'm agitated and argumentative, unhappy, depressed and feel like my brain is a puddle. I'm not even 30 yet and am really worried that I've destroyed myself. I felt that because I only drank a few days a week instead of every day I wasn't an alcoholic, but I've recently come to realize that I do have a very real drinking problem. I really want to stop and feel like myself again!

I'm wondering if anyone has gone through similar symptoms and if they have noticed significant improvements since quitting? I haven't had a drink since Sunday and am hoping to stick with it!

Thanks in advance. 💙

It was probably about the third fully formed thought out of my rattled brain. Thankfully the rational part of me knew that would only make things much worse. 

So here's to all you guys out there, just like me, dealing with car accidents, shitty bosses, bills or whatever stresses you out. We dont need a crutch to lean on when things get hard. Again IWNDWYT",11

But my therapist keeps telling me I need to allow myself to celebrate myself. Fine. Second guessing and self doubt choked back. Here we go:

I reached three months sober today! In that time I have survived the following events which were historically blackout drunk widow-makers (or at least divorce-promoters):
- 3 manager offsite meetings/team building events
- 1 company Christmas party
- Halloween
- 2 Thanksgiving dinners

I have also successfully and soberly navigated:
- four team happy hours (on the corporate dime, an important distinction)
- my eleven year old daughter coming out as a lesbian (and I knew when it was going to happen, talk about pressure to perform as a father!)
- my eleven year old daughter experimenting with self harm
- raising a two year old (this is a big one 🤣)
- raising an infant (ok this one isn’t too hard, but I didn’t want her to feel left out 😂)
- an extremely stressful and high pressure new-ish job (the job is like two months old than my sobriety)
- a car accident
- anniversary of my father-in-law’s death (I loved that man so hard, maybe more than my own father)
- death of my grandpa
- and my wife walking away from her 15+ year career

While I am crazy proud of myself for everything that I have accomplished and all of the growth that I have experienced in the last ninety days, I remain keenly aware that I still have a lot of work to do to understand and fix myself. 

I believe my drinking behaviors are a manifestation of things going on under the surface. I tried so many times to address them with the drink. I am amazed at how much more effectively I have been able to do that without the drink. 

Thank all of you for helping me to realize that I am not alone and that I am not the first one to deal with the things I have to deal with.

If I take one more step, I'll be the farthest away from [the bottle] I've ever been.","""Come on, \[u/ndt1896\] Remember what Bilbo used to say: ""It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no telling where you might be swept off to."" - Frodo, Fellowship of the Ring.

Well, in the last two weeks and a day, I have been swept off into an adventure without leaving my doorstep.  It turns out, I  needed only to leave the bottle.   

\-> Workplace stress is just that: workplace stress that stays at work.  And I find most stress I found external before can actually be managed by simply eating lunch and walking in the sunshine.

\-> Wake up the same time of my wife.  Before, at minimum I needed those extra 20 minutes to navigate my hangover recovery options.  At maximum, I would easily sleep to 3 or 4 PM on my days off work shifts.  These last days -- these sober days, turning into weeks (plural!!) even on days I am not working, I can wake up early to drive my wife to the closest train station (non-US, train commute culture) -- a first in 2.5 years living in our current home.  I honestly did not think my lifestyle had time for that kind of gesture.  Now it seems effortless.  

 \-> I've got my kindle fire fired up again, reading books and enjoying them.  Working through Annie Grace's book as well, it really is such a positive and informative book.  Big shout out to the recommendations I've got here.

&#x200B;

I feel the need to be honest with myself: this feels different than a short, manic, break in habit.  I do not feel I am simply resisting drinking.  I feel I am changing my identity.  But there are definitely rough patches so far, let me share a typical example: 

\-> I don't miss drinking.  But, one evening my work ended at 10pm, it was a challenging day, and it was my usual custom to buy one or two 500ml 9% drinks and drink one on the train platform, one in the train, then buy more booze to hide in my briefcase, and one beer for the walk home once I arrived at my home station.  So, two days ago -- near two weeks into sobriety -- suddenly my mind formed vocalized words in my head that appeared to come from somewhere else: ""Well, obviously you're not \*NOT\* going to drink today...at least have a beer to unwind waiting for the train.."" where did that come from!?  My whole body was being forced into some kind of numb acceptance to this voice -- I was literally preparing to buy alcohol without having made that decision on my own.

But here is the victory: It wasn't the end of the world to squish that voice -- it did not take a huge internal battle.  It turns out, I just stopped walking, shook my head, and laughed at myself.  This isn't the only time I will be feeling perfectly normal, definitely healthy and rested, and out of what feels like \*nowhere\* my brain will present images or nearly verbal statements of a beer or drinking situation that I registered as positive.  It's silly because I can literally see my mind trying to dupe my own mind.  And you know what?  My drinking subconscious is a crappy con artist.  I've been through a decade of pain, the conflict, guilt, and terrible choices made in an instant that took months of consequences to recover -- the random urge to drink is expected, and, I'm ready for it.  Ready to laugh it into submission.  I'm on an adventure.  And here, I have found many companions joined in this fellowship to stop drinking.  I will not drink with you tonight.",15

It was my favorite hobby, my confidence boost, and my Achilles heel. My passion for beer pushed me to get a business degree in accounting, with the hopes of opening my own microbrewery. Without drinking, I’d never have had the confidence to approach my wife, and if I hadn’t quit I’d never have been able to keep her. It’s that duality that frames my complicated relationship to drinking. It was my identity, and I feel like I haven’t had one since quitting. 

Despite being sober for almost six years now, it has never felt easy. When I drank, I had a ton of friends. When I quit, I lost most of them. Now, aside from my wife, I only have two friends, and they routinely exclude me from hangouts — especially if they’re drinking. 

I don’t know if it’s the weather (upper-Midwest US), the fact that I quit a stressful, high-ish paying job a few months ago, or that I miss having a lot of friends, but I’m at a point where I am just feeling so shitty. I meet with a therapist every couple weeks, but it seems like I always meet with him on my “good days,” and therefore can’t really unload. I am working a shit job, and I don’t know what I want to do with the rest of my life. To make matters worse, my wife has been experiencing some sudden and puzzling health problems, and the thought of her being very ill brings me indescribable sadness.

I don’t even know what I expect out of this. I would normally never commit these types of thoughts to “paper,” especially here since the general tenor of this sub is understandably upbeat and optimistic, but Christ — I am just wore out lately.

Despite all this, and despite the fact that I have been thinking about drinking more today than I have in a *long* time, I won’t drink today. I just needed to tell someone that it hasn’t been easy lately, but that I am aware that drinking would only make things worse.",23

Some of them will have some drinks and it doesn't bother me. No one looks down on me for being a non-drinker like was I worried about when I first quit. In just 8 months, being a non-drinker has already become part of my identity.

I have learned a whole ton of stuff about myself, my behaviors/actions, my motives, relationships with family and loved ones, what I want out of life, goals and more in the past 6 months, and I owe most of it to these 3 things:

1. Treatment
2. AA and the/my program
3. Strong Sponsorship and my relationship with my HP

These things have kept me sober since I got out of inpatient treatment and moved towards IOP/continuing care/after care finally ending my treatment phase of recovery a couple months ago. I like to say treatment got me sober, and AA keeps me sober. When I came into the program, I had no idea what to expect. I knew I couldn't stop drinking on my own, I had tried numerous times, every day, second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour, my mind was consumed by alcohol. How am I going to sneak this drink at work? where am I going to go to get more because I can't go to the same place I did yesterday or they would know somethings up? I'll just buy the bigger bottle so I have ""reserve"" when I'd really just drink it all. I was beginning to loose my sanity, my health was severely affected, my life was on it's way out, my body was shutting down. I would of ended up in Jail, Institutionalized or Dead, and I know I wouldn't know how to live a life incarcerated, so it was basically end up in a loony bin forever, or death. Death was the answer then, I looked at myself in the mirror every morning and night, drunk/hungover/buzzed and couldn't bare what I was seeing. How, where and why did I end up like this? But as long as I can remember, since I first drank and used, I never actually enjoyed it, like normal folks sit and drink ONE glass of wine and read through a book. I always drank and used to get super fucked up, that was the only goal, to escape my life that was a miserable to live life.

6 months later, I have strong faith and sponsorship, my brother is in recovery again to, just behind me in sober time. My work life, home life, relationships with friends/family have dramatically improved for the better. I actually care about what's going on in peoples life's now. Sure I lost a couple friends, but I am not going to put my sobriety at risk for anything, even to keep a friend. My sponsor told me a couple things very early on that have always stuck with me,

* ""Don't be afraid to go out and live your life just because you don't drink. Isolation is no way to live, get out there and enjoy life, just don't drink.""
* ""We can do anything, I cannot.""

I was rittled with FEAR before I got sober, I had two options. **F**ace **E**verything **A**nd **R**ecover or **F**uck **E**verything **A**nd **R**un. I chose recovery and don't regret anything I have done so far up to this point. If you are struggling, I hope you find what I have found in sobriety in just the short time I have been sober. Your life is worth living and you are important, you don't have to do it alone.",7

But, I felt like I could control it, and although I started out slow, I ended up drinking again, and now I'm back to square one, drinking every night, and making bad choices as a result.

However, as the sole provider for my family, literally all my money goes to taking care of bills, and other needs. There is no way I can afford an in-patient rehab, but I feel like that is what I really need.

  I get a hug from her and she immediately tells me it's been 1.5 months since she had a drink.  I then get a hug from the waiter, a former buddy from the nearby bar we drank at...he hasn't had cigarette in 3 months.  
Both of them are so proud, both had to tell me about their accomplishments immediately, and both thanked me for the inspiration to start their respective abstinences.

I'm still figuring sober life out, but even so...it's night and day how much easier and more manageable life is when I'm not drunk for 12 hours every day and hungover whenever else I wasn't sleeping.

I quit cigarettes almost 3 months ago, as well. Also not easy, especially after 20 years of smoking. But I wouldn't have been able to do it if I hadn't sobered up first.

One interesting thing is how I've recognized how truly deep my addictive nature runs. It's absurdly self-destructive. I tried to manage my alcohol cravings by smoking a little pot at first, just a couple times a week. Within two weeks that had become all day every day and I realized...I can't do this. I'd just replaced one drug with another. So I just didn't touch it anymore and now recognize that I will never be able to recreationally use any drugs or alcohol in the future. A single use snowballs quickly for me into absurd levels of abuse.

Anyway. Thanks for listening. Y'all are the best.",290

Last Christmas was my first sober one and I passed with flying colors, so I really haven't been too worried this year. 

Then out of the blue last night it hit me.  I met up with friends for happy hour and I impulsively ordered a drink.  White wine.  Cheap white wine in a sports bar - so not even anything I particularly liked the taste of.  Only one friend there  knew anything (very little) about my issues with alcohol and she said, ""oh really?""  And my utterly ridiculous, non-truthful reply was, ""meh, one won't hurt.""

Luckily, the waiter took forever.  Luckily, my friend was there to question my choice.  Luckily, this sub has taught me to play the tape forward.  I don't stop when I drink white wine.  I just don't.  And I knew I would be hungover today and severely disappointed in myself.

This sub has also taught me to check in with myself when I want to drink to see if I'm hungry, angry, lonely, or tired.  I determined it was some variation of lonely.  Because I no longer drink, I find myself on the periphery in situations like this.  This group of friends goes out a lot.  To bars.  And I rarely join them anymore because hanging out all night in a bar is much less fun when you're not drinking.  

So, when the drink finally came, I passed it to my friend and ordered a pop.  I hung out for about an hour and left.  Today, I'm kind of freaked out that I came so close to drinking.  Wtf?  And I'm realizing I'm still feeling kind of lonely.",13

TLDR skip to second paragraph.

I stopped drinking in July and for the most part I have had an easy time managing my cravings. I did 90 days of complete sobriety before introducing NA beer back into my diet. I am constantly at work related happy hours and social events. I drink beer to fit in and I found a few NA I actually enjoy drinking. Football Season was rough for me because I would always drink beer and eat wings during the game. NA beer helps but left me missing beer sometimes. My worst football urge was nothing compared to today.

    Since I stopped drinking I have not really been to the movies and forgot how much things have changed. Everyone drinks now and movie theaters have bars spread out across the building. I used to love going to the movies and drink. I am seeing Star Wars tonight and I have that voice in my head telling me to drink. ""You have been good to stay sober this long, This is Star Wars... you won't be drinking everyday like I used to if you just drink during the movie.""

I know this is how it starts, the Brain in me wants to stay sober but my impulse to drink is fighting to take the wheel and wants to say, ""Its ok to have just one.""",6

Here's what I've experienced so far:

\-Better sleep. Even when I don't get a lot of sleep, it's loads better than drunken sleep. I always told myself I needed to drink to fall asleep. That was not true.

\-Less anxiety. I thought alcohol eased my anxiety but it only did in the moment. In the morning I was a shaky mess and everything was 10 times harder than it had to be.

\-Freedom in my thoughts. I thought quitting would lead to obsessing about alcohol all day, every day. Nope, turns out that's what I did when I was actively trying to moderate. When can I next drink, how much can I have, will my husband side-eye me if I have another glass, can I refill this with no one noticing...it was exhausting. When I was pregnant, I thought about how I could finally have wine again after I gave birth and looked forward to it so much. I still get pangs for a glass sometimes, but overall I think about alcohol SO much less.

\-Fun. This is another surprising thing. I didn't think my life would be fun without alcohol. What would I look forward to? Turns out, I'm having a really good time. I get down on the floor after work and play with my kids instead of counting down the minutes when I can get them to bed and have my wine. I'm goofier and more patient with them. 

\-GRATITUDE. Every night when I go to bed I am filled with gratitude that I didn't drink and that I will wake up not hungover. That I will get to be present in this life for my people. That my children, aged 1 and 3, will hopefully not have any memories of their mom being drunk.

This post will remind me of why I am doing this when I am tempted to stop at one of the many gas stations (that I frequent on alternating days to avoid shame) on my way home tonight. I am also sharing my story in the hopes that somebody can take something from my experience.  Either way, if it wasn't for this community, I would have never been brave enough to give this sobriety thing a go.

I'm a 21 year old male living in the US. I grew up in significant poverty as an only child in a single-parent household. I was always a good kid on the surface, but everybody knew I was pretty depressed. My mother was always working, and has a rocky relationship with alcohol herself. My bio-dad was absent, but is a high-functioning alcoholic, as am I. I have many other relatives who suffer from some degree of alcoholism, one so severe that he has developed Wernicke-Korsakoff's syndrome.

I started experimenting with alcohol when I was maybe 11. From there, things just got worse. I was binge drinking regularly (once or twice a week) by the time I was 14, and as often as I could (4-5 times a week) by the time I was 17. I ""partied"" constantly, which basically meant I got trashed to the point of vomiting with my friends several times a month. I would drink before school, at school, and late into nights before school.  

When I moved out to go to college, things got worse again.  Out of the 1095 days in the first 3 years of college, I was drunk or high on at least 1050 of them, if not more. Despite this, I continued to get by just fine in school, at work, and in my relationships. I've made lots of friends, have a good job, have a steady girlfriend of almost 3 years, a dog, and a great GPA. I'm also generally in good health, and am currently finishing a premed program with the intention of attending med school for psychiatry after.

But despite all the good things that have have come along in my life within the past few years, my addiction has gotten to the point where I can no longer manage it, or play it off as just typical college behavior.

My tolerance level is through the roof. I hardly feel anything after drinking a 6-pack of beer. When I go to parties, I get so intoxicated that I embarrass myself, or start an argument. I'm hardly athletic anymore, despite years of training through high school and the beginning of college. I spend an exorbitant amount of money on large quantities of alcohol that are never enough.  When I have a day off, I can't think of anything to do but get shitfaced and watch TV. My girlfriend and I are drifting apart as I fall further into this unique hell that is addiction.  

I need to get out. Now. Before it's too late. Thanks for reading, wish me the best of luck! Here's to day one, and I will not drink with you today!

The day was amazing and full of love, but I definitely sweat it when my friend pulled out the riesling. It's my favorite wine, and I'm one of those rare birds who genuinely loves the taste of some wines. I knew I'd be better sober, so I made myself drink water every time someone refilled. That helped me not wanna drink much else, since I'd just had so much water. When my craving got really bad, I excused myself and hit my juul a few times. Idk why but it focused me enough to get back in there. 
Anyway, I remember the whole night, was able to be the witty girl my friends love the whole time, didnt have a single anxiety attack, and slept like a baby when I went home. I know it was so much better because I didn't get drunk.

I am just so fuming mad because the owner of this company is a fucking moron. He says he has a cash flow problem because “we can’t get the work out fast enough” when in reality it’s because he allows customers up to 90 days to pay us while he pays for all building materials up front.

I understand a bonus shouldn’t be expected but this is a small company with most workers being the original workers when it started or at least have been there 10-15 years+.

I feel I've come to the point where drinking has lost it's meaning. It has become obsolete.  
I know I haven't travelled far on my sober path and I know that I've walked the path before. But this time the words have become a real feeling and a desire to choose life over alcohol.  


I really really don't want to drink anymore! I find myself liberated from the suffocating grip of alcohol. I feel free in body and soul.  


But why do I feel like I have to say ""Sorry"" to everyone for not drinking? It feels like saying ""I really don't want to drink anymore"" is an excuse for something? Not only to yourself but also to the people around you. Why do I feel that the struggle is not only within myself but also my surroundings.  


I'm not trying to whip up a storm or sound negative. I'm just curious.   


The other day a friend of mine, who drinks a lot and has always joked about him being a self proclaimed alcoholic, said to me ""I wish I had your will power to quit smoking like you did. But I really don't want the same with alcohol"". His words stuck to me ""Why wouldn't he want to stop? He knows he's an alcoholic and he knows it's bad for him to drink. But he still choose to continue. He want's to stop smoking because of the same reasons as there are to drinking"". Is our society really so, in lack of better words, *infiltrated* with alcohol that it easier to drink than not to?  


Is it really necessary to explain why we choose a sober path. I mean... I know that alcohol is everywhere and has always been, I just never saw it fill so much. It's like standing next to a tree all you life thinking it was a stick.

A few observations about my experience:

* I'm still good at picking out wine & beer (not a surprise, having drank for 20+ years)
* I'm better now at picking non-alcoholic beverages
* Those kind of stores are overwhelming, as a drinker, or as a non-drinker
* I can't believe there's that much alcohol under 1 roof!
* No wonder I had a problem - candy store type of allure of labels, advertising, etc.
* We are buying too much alcohol for this party
* Where to put the alcohol, what to do with excess... triggered memories of after house parties we threw, and I remember being both delighted by the surplus & scared by it, because I knew I'd tear through ALL of it over time.
* Alcohol is no longer my problem
* I've tested myself in this shopping situation, and I did ok, no cravings, and will probably just have my co-worker go next time without me
* I will not  drink at the party tomorrow!

I can’t remember the last time I was moved by music. I mean I’d hear things and like them, but I wouldn’t feel it. It occurred to me that not since my teens/early twenties (just about 30 currently) had I FELT music. I can remember grooving in my first car to CDs I’d ripped from friends stashes. Or the record stacks I’d relish going through when I did a late night alt rock show for local radio in high school. Or the dance parties that would spontaneously erupt in my living room with friends. Or the joy I’d feel at happening upon a genuinely good open mic performer. I haven’t enjoyed music like that in years.

I am going to spend the time reflecting on what I want from life. I will also plan my attack strategy to get back to a year sober and beyond.

I just bought my car two months ago, my first ever and I got it completely on my own. I felt so proud of myself. On the way to a work meeting I looked down to check my GPS and when I looked back up I was greeted with a red light. Couldn't stop in time, rolled into the intersection, and tboned someone.

We both got out of it okay and even though the outside damage isn't awful, the airbags deployed and it's considered totalled. I'm devistated. I absolutely love that car, it's everything I wanted and something I finally did for myself. It marks a huge turning point in my life (27, just got my license after years of anxiety and shame).

That one second of glancing away is all it took to royally fuck up my life. I want to drink so badly, to drown out this sadness and hopelessness. I'm not sure where I expected this post to go. I feel myself falling into that pit, the tar pit of depression that can swallow you whole if you let it.

That DUI was the beginning of the end.  It was real hard to deny I had a problem when my husband and then 5 year old daughter had to come to jail to pick me up at 11pm.  It was the lowest I had ever been - but it still took me a year to finally stop for good.  At the time, my DUI was devastating.  I was mortified and scared.  I had to have a breathalyzer installed in my car and breathe into it to start my car and while I was driving. It was humiliating.  Today - I am thankful for it. It was the big - wtf are you doing to your life?  WTF are you doing to your daughter???  My husband was disgusted - so was I. I knew I had to change or I would continue the cycle of alcoholism and shame.  I didn't want my daughter to grow up the way I did with my alcoholic father. I didn't kill myself or anyone else with my reckless behavior - I was being given a second chance. 

Today, my career has skyrocketed, I'm in the best shape of my life, my daughter always tells me she wants to grow up to be just like me - strong and a boss!  I'll take that! ;-)

I really don't think about drinking anymore - it was so hard in the beginning but with anything it gets easier.  This sub was biggest support and I credit it with really keeping me sober. I just loved seeing that flair go up daily and I never wanted to reset it.  So thank you to all of you who share your journey's and if you are struggling just know - LIFE IS SO MUCH EASIER AND BETTER SOBER.  YOU DESERVE TO FEEL GREAT!  IWNDWYT! xo",124

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!  What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in \[/r/stopdrinking\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**  A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at \[/r/stopdrinking\]([r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**  A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

 ***Dr. Meredith Grey:*** *""Maybe gratitude has nothing to do with joy.  Maybe being grateful means recognize what you have for what it is; appreciating small victories; admiring the struggle it takes simply to be human.  Maybe we're thankful for the familiar things we know.  And maybe we're thankful for the thing we'll never know.  At the end of the day, the fact we have courage to still be standing is reason enough to celebrate.""* 

 I will not drink with you today.",69

 Not long ago this would’ve put me on edge in a major way. I can’t watch my shows, can’t work on my project...this would’ve been a day killer for me awhile back. I don’t like my routine to change.

So today I am thankful that I am learning to adapt. Today I wrapped gifts, baked a cake, did a crossword puzzle (while doing a face mask!), and went for a walk- none of which I originally planned. 

As irritating as it is to have no control over this internet issue, I am simply practicing patience and readjusting my day. I am grateful that I am learning to adapt to stress and change. It’s a nice feeling!

Now don’t get me wrong, if internet isn’t back up soon I’ll be the first person posting on our Vent-o- Matic on Friday.

But for today I’m pleased to have the skills to adapt and acknowledge the annoyance and move on. Also thank goodness for cell phones!

A little about the last 24 hours.  i wanted to taper before my family  holiday gathering so im not  shaking like a leaf when xmas rolls around.  knowing i probably drink around 350 to 750 ml of whiskey a day.  my calculations alerted me to the fact that i dont have enough time before i leave on sunday to properly taper  so its time for a detox.  i had already began drinking when i researched my taper so i decided to make today day one, luckily found some old librium i had lying around, and finished my bottle of whiskey then onto some beers i had left over.  i blacked out somewhere around three am and restlessly tossed and turned until noon when i proceeded to vomit all the water i had been sipping throughout the night in order to  ease todays hangover, fat lot of good that  ending up helping.  i tell you, its weird some days i could drain a whole bottle of whiskey forget water, and wake up the next morning for class.  but other days, and they have recently become more frequent i have been having ungodly hangovers.  i always stick the the maxim liquor before beer your in the clear, i dont mix light and dark liquors, never drink wine, and try to have water next to the bed before i sleep for when i envitably wake up with dry mouth.  these usually worked in the past, but not so much recently.  i know this comes with age, i am not some young guy anymore.  over the next few hours, i proceded to split my time over the toilet and on reddit, trying to not get to antsy or anxious.  all i wanted to do today was to go down the block pick up my whiskey and drink so this aching, shaky, burning up body could just feel normal again.  so i stepped out the door, walked to the shop, and for once just bought two gatorade.  even the shop keeper, who knows me quite well, held up my usual bottle from behind the counter and it took all my strength not to say sure ill take that too.  i know if i drink tonight i wont get anything done tomorrow and be one more day behind getting everything done before i leave sunday.  so i walked out took a sip of gatorade, immediatly vomited it back up, and walked home.  now here is where there is a tiny snag in my day one, but im still counting it as such.  knowing that if i bought the whiskey, the bottle would be gone, and id be hung over again tomorrow, but i needed to get something in me so i dont die of dehydration.  so i cracked a beer, something i have done in the past to settle my stomach during hangovers, took maybe two decent sips and with all my might poured it down the toilet along with the other beer in my fridge.  gave it twenty min and once the alcohol was starting to be absorbed, i could feel my stomach becoming more and more open to the idea of at least some gatorade for sugar and electrolytes.  thats when the call came, it was my dad, i pretended to be sick and he hung up the  phone rather quickly.  as soon as he did, all the lies ive ever told while drunk, hungover, about my drinking, just kinda bubbled to the surface.  i started to feel anxious, so i put on my coat went out for a walk and called him back.  i just didnt want to lie anymore, so i fessed up that this was my day one, i am going into withdrawals, i failed one of my classes, ive been lying about certain aspects of my life recently, just came clean.  i wanted him to cry, be mad, be happy, anything than his response.  he let out a sigh and in that moment i know ive done this too many times to my parents and they have little hope anymore that i can quit and remain sober.  he went through the motions as any caring dad would, but i could tell he probably thinks this is just another failed attempt waiting to happen.  it was one of the sadder parts of my month let me tell you.  it broke my heart that he has so little hope in me.  idk maybe this time is going to be different.  i hope so, i cant live like this anymore.  its 756 currently my time, and in my area you cant buy any liquor after nine or beer after midnight.  i dont drive and my liquor store closes at 9 anyway so i just have to make it one more hour.  all i want to do is get up from this couch, walk the three blocks to the shop, pick up some nippers of whiskey and zone out.  thats all i want in the world right now.  758 now, 62 minutes till i cant do that.  all i have to do is stay strong for 62 min.  tomorrow is a new day, and day three is always the worst for me so im in for hell the next 48 hrs, but when i get through this last bought of AWS, i hopefully will never have to feel like this again.  im trying to start a journal too, this so when i think about drinking again i can read and remember these days.  fuck i hate withdrawls, and they have barely begun.

In need of some interaction with fellow sobernauts.

I couldn’t make it to a meeting tonight, so I just wanted to share some thoughts and try to find some inspiration from you brave, strong people.
Back on September 30th, after a weekend-long binge, my girlfriend gave me what I could tell would be the last of an endless number of “second chances”. The fire that lit under my ass made sobriety less of a struggle this time than ever before. I’ve been staying very busy with lots  responsibilities, I feel the healthiest I have in a decade, and my relationships have vastly improved. I’ve started to actually enjoy not drinking or doing drugs for the first time ever. As I expected though, As i approach the 3 month mark the addict voice is back and getting louder, trying to convince me I could get away with drinking again. I’m ashamed to say I’m a seasoned veteran when it comes to hiding my drinking (I was drunk at school for a large portion of high school, and never got caught) but my girlfriend is very perceptive and has a superhuman sense of smell, so the the odds would probably be 50/50. 
I’m scared because I’ve actually considered drinking despite the risk. If I start lying and drinking again and she finds out, I won’t just lose the most important person in my life, I’ll lose the most meaningful responsibility in my life, which is coaching a youth sports team with my girlfriend. The chain reaction of pain that would follow would certainly cause me to plunge right back in to the depths of my probably-terminal addictions. Yet I’ve still considered taking the chance. The negative consequences are feeling abstract in comparison to the cravings at the moment. Even as I type this out and think through the consequences, there’s a part of me that still thinks it would be worth the risk.  
Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this, I just needed to get these feelings out of my head and into the world.",2

I thought I could handle a beer here and there after ten years, but I was wrong. I’ve been sober a month and a half and came clean to my Mom about how bad I had gotten.  She gets it, and she’s the kind of mom that loves and supports unconditionally. Mom and I have know my brother has a problem for at least 2 years, however it has worsened in the last 6 months or so. 

Mom is visiting from halfway across the country and is staying with my brother for the first few nights. I called her tonight to ask about what food I should stock for her when she comes to my place. She mentioned that last night was “horrific” and almost left my brother’s house. She couldn’t speak freely at the time so we agreed to talk later after I asked if it was about his drinking. She confirmed and now I’m freaked out. 

My brother distanced himself emotionally and physically from us after high school and rarely calls us unless he needs something from us (and is most often drunk). He’s self absorbed, selfish, pretentious, and arrogant. I love the living shit out of him nonetheless. His nastiness comes out 10x harder when he’s drunk. He barely has a filter when he’s sober, but when he’s drunk, he’s volatile. 

I fear that any kind of confrontation about his alcoholism will drive him further away from us. I know it has to be done, but I’m scared.  For our relationship and for his wellbeing.

My neightbor (i live in an apartment) is an alcoholic. He's retired, quite old and assuming his problem. He can talk about it without shame anything. I doubt he will ever try to recover, he just seems to accept this as his fate. Long story short, I'm leaving soon for 2 weeks holiday. I know he is very lonely and I think right now he doesn't have anymore money for the month because when he doesn't drink he becomes a hermit and seem to disappear from the surface of the planet and sleep alot. I was just wondering what I could do for him so he has a decent christmas. And yes I thought about buying him a 12 case of his favorite beer as a xmas gift. The guy is not even thinking about stopping drinking ever, he's very old. Will I be an asshole and just enable him if I buy him a case? I just know he will feel really better and enjoy a little more the holiday if he drinks. Instead of falling in withdrawal because he's broke. I need your opinions guy. Just trying to help the guy a little. What would you do?

EDIT : Thank you all for your opinions. There were very good points on both side. I have decided to buy him a couche-tard gift card. Couche tard is the french version or Circle K in Quebec. It is a big convenience store so he'll be able to choose himself between food, snacks or beer. So this way, I'm not directly fueling his addiction. That will be his choice. He will also have to take a mini walk outside to use the card and that will help too.  Happy holidays from Québec everyone! Bizou Xxx",3

I was on the wagon for close to 4 months until 3 weeks back. I travelled to another city and ended up drinking. I made a post about everything this slip up taught me and how I was going to get back on the wagon.

Well, I didn't stop drinking. In the last 3 weeks I've drank nearly every night. I've had some massive fights with my wife. I've been struggling to get out of bed. I've stopped working out and cancelled my personal training sessions twice. I cancelled all my clients at work today because last night, I went out and drank and did drugs.

I started telling myself that it's Christmas, and I will get back on the wagon after all these upcoming events with family and friends.

I can't do this anymore. I hate drinking and it's clear as day that it's fucking me up.

It's scary how slipping up once can result in this.

I was re-reading some posts and personal journalling I had written only a few weeks back. I was the happiest I have ever been. I wrote to myself and told myself to please, never drink again.

When I was sober I was strong, confident, present, productive, happy.

In only a few weeks I've become weak, timid, distracted, lazy and miserable. All the negative self-talk and self-loathing has returned.

I am barely fitting into my shirts as I'm so bloated and have gained weight from binge eating along with all the alcohol.

This all sounds like I'm feeling very sorry for myself. I am. But now I have a lot of data points to make better long term decisions. It's quite simple:

Alcohol is devastating my life.

Sobriety allows me to be the man I always knew I could become.

I can't drink again. Ever.

It's a very hard time of year to say I'm going sober. It's Christmas. It's boiling hot here in Australia. Beers are everywhere and there are a lot of old family and friends coming to visit.

I'm going to try to take a tip away over New Year's to at least escape for a while.

It's hard going it alone. I'm so grateful for this sub.

If anyone has any words of encouragement or advice, I'd love to hear it.

Thank you so much. IWNDWYT.

Once I hit the right relationship, I planned to hurl my interestingness at it, like a final exam I'd spent my whole life studying for. This was it...

But we're *all* dependent people, literally all of us-anyone human. So what primes you for a particular chemical dependence?

You could say I'm made of need. You could say everyone is. You could say my dad's absence for stretches of my childhood created need, or else inspired a certain relationship to men that kept creating need. You could say my dad drank, and his sister drank, and their dad drank before they drank. You could point to the twenty-year study that found chromosomal patterns in more than 2,255 families ""densely affected by alcoholism"" and conclude that certain brains are more disposed to the neural adaptations that enable chemical dependence. You could say it all depends on how your neurons respond to the neuromodulators in your system; that it all depends on a complicated constellation of particularities in your genotype, and that how these responses are treated or punished depends on the money you have, and the color of your skin-and all of these explanations would be true, and none would be sufficient. What often seems truest is the confession of every explanation as partial and provisional, a possible shape to fill the empty space of *why?*

Whenever I was drunk, I could tell you exactly why I drank. The reason was rarely the same river twice: because I deserved relief from the burden of my own self-consciousness, the endless chatter of my inner monologues and self-appraisals; or else because there was something dark and broken at the core of me that I covered up with excess functionality, and getting drunk was the only way I could acknowledge it. Drinking was self-escape or else it was self-encounter, depending on the story I was telling myself.""

I went to a language Meetup last night, which was located at a local bar in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.  I held strong and spent the night drinking ginger beers, which I've developed as a great alternative to regular beer. 

During my discussions with some of the patrons, one couldn't help but notice my lack of alcohol. Rather than beat around the Bush, I decided to be transparent and fully admit to this stranger about my alcoholism. To my surprise, he was incredibly supportive! He related to my stories of blacking out on a common basis and admitted that he could have an issue as well. We said goodbye shortly and though I will never know this person again nor will I know his fate, I'm glad to know that I was able to be truthful and accountable for my past, present, and future.

I'm at the beginning stages of my recovery but am in good spirits. As long as I stay true to myself and others. So I raise my sparkling water to you all. Good luck and keep going strong! IWNDWYT!",13

I KNEW I should have because I’m trying to quiet my mind. Instead of focusing on the beautiful surroundings and the amazing views, I got stuck in my “teenage angst” over my failed relationship. I kept telling myself the relationship had been over for months before we separated. That we were toxic together. That he can’t love me the way I need to be loved and on and on u til I was one huge knot of anxiety and turmoil and angst. The town I’m staying in doesn’t have a store. The closest one is 4 miles away. As I came down the windy mountain road, I began to rationalize having a drink just to calm me down or maybe to let me cry or maybe to sleep away the afternoon. I sat at the crossroads that would either lead me home or to the beer store for like two minutes. Within those two minutes I had gone from just getting the two beers for this afternoon to help deal with emotions. But then I would need two more for sleeping tonight. I just sat there with my foot on the break. 
And I thought about all of you guys and how I could just talk to my accountability partner and how I didn’t want to do day 1 again and how disgusted I had been with my drinking JUST last week!
So I drive home and got on the internet and contacted my accountability partner who, thankfully was right there and talked me down. And then I read this subreddit for the next 45 minutes ate something and the desire went away and I was so relieved!  I was so pleased not to have let myself down, again. Thank you to all of you for your warm support. It sure made a difference knowing I had a community to turn to. 

Continue being kind to each other!",4

I don't typically get fall down drunk, but I consume alot. I can drink a 24 in a day, and still have conversations at the end of the day, with people not knowing ive been drinking (not proud of this) I recently got the world by the balls. I got a great wife (after 3 marriages) I got a new house, a new car, and new promotion at work, which was HUGE. And probably what looks like on the outside, a perfect life. 

 But I am struggling so badly right now. It's like, the better things get, the harder I try to sabotage them. Is this normal?  I have a counsellor arranged for the new year. So i'm hoping that will help. I have ADHD, and was born to two alcoholic and drug addicted parents. In fact, the Dr who birthed me didnt think I would even live. The beer has calmed the ADHD down, and I recently found out it was a crutch. So I am on meds for it, depression, and anxiety. I just did three weeks sober, and rode my bike, and excercised, and played guitar to keep myself busy. Then, the death of a family member, and the anxiety of people over the holidays got to me, so I started up again. 

 I guess, im not looking for anything through posting this. I don't even know if people read this, lol. But maybe I got it off my chest. If you were nice enough to read this....thank you.",33

I was on my deathbed and turned my life around! :-) Love you all!,"It took me 8 years to mention to the public that I struggle with addiction. I should have done it sooner, but I guess I just wasn’t ready. I’m writing this to let people know they are not alone. I released my first album *Lonely Traveler* back in 2004. There is then a long gap between records. Music is my world! I continued writing songs and performing shows to help spread the word in support of *Lonely Traveler*, but soon lost my way. I was in and out of behavioral health units and rehabs for 2 to 3 years. I had my last drink(God willing) on November 16th 2010. I’m lucky to be alive. I was diagnosed with depression and bi-polar disorder while in the behavioral health unit. I’ve had panic attacks and anxiety since I was 12 years old. Panic attacks that were so bad I ended up in the hospital. When they first started I had no idea what was happening to me. I thought I was dying, or having a heart attack. They were very scary. Over the years I’ve learned to deal with them much better. They aren’t as frequent or severe. From the outside looking in you’d never know I had any mental health ailments. I always greet people with a big smile and my dimples do a good job helping cover up my darker days.

That being said, I think all humans are depressed from time to time. Some definitely more than others. I also feel addiction and depression/anxiety are cut from the same cloth. I used alcohol to self medicate for years. It worked for a long time to help with the pain until it didn’t work anymore. The wheels eventually fell off the bus and the train derailed from the tracks. I write this to let those out there that are still suffering know that there is hope. There is also nothing to be ashamed of. Admitting that you are sad or depressed or have an addiction problem is hard. I can promise you though, that once you face your demons and accept them you’ll feel relief. When you do ask for help you’ll immediately feel relief. Once you surrender, you start winning.

There is definitely still a stigma in regards to mental illness in general. Mental illness isn’t treated the same as other ailments. People feel sorry for those with cancer, but not people with addiction problems. I think the general public has come around more in the last few years, but there is still a long way to go. Also, there are some that truly understand that addiction is a disease. The stigma isn’t categorical among all people.

Being a guy, people commonly say, “Ah get over it, toughen up” “You shouldn’t let this or that affect you”. “You have nothing to be depressed about”. Guess what? Depression, anxiety, and addiction doesn’t need a reason. Furthermore, showing your emotions is a sign of strength and not a weakness. It takes more strength to show your emotions and feelings than to hide them. In addition, men have been taught to hide their feelings and remain stoic. They don’t want to appear weak or less than. Sometimes I’ll wake up sad for no reason. Honestly, my life is absolutely wonderful and I have so much to be grateful for. I literally have zero reasons to feel sad or depressed. However, there are some days where my head feels heavy like a thick gray cloud. My thinking is muddled and the world feels like its caving in on me. I can’t explain it. Some days are just like that. I tell myself that this too shall pass and it always does. When I’m in that fog though, it feels like the world is ending. It is hard to function. I then get mad at myself for not having the energy to be productive. In these tough moments I need to remind myself that it’s okay.

I take paxil to help with anxiety and depression. There is nothing wrong with taking medication to help you feel normal. It doesn’t make you weak! I’ve also used meditation as another way to calm my mind. Another key ingredient to keeping myself in tip top mental shape is exercise. Exercise is the number one thing I can do in my life to help keep me healthy in general. It really is that simple. There’s a trickle down effect. Exercise releases the happy endorphins such as dopamine in the brain. I also use a lot of positive self talk to keep me in good spirits. The mind is very powerful and will believe everything you tell it.

If you’re feeling down or struggling with addiction, nobody is going to shame you and those that do aren’t worth knowing. The people that care about you most will support you. They will respect you, and they will be happy to see you happy. If you’re feeling low, please call a friend or family member to chat. Friends and family have saved me many times over the years. There is no shame in admitting you need help. We’re all human, and we all need help sometimes.",137

I was terribly hungover this morning and it utterly sucked. Now all I can think about is how stupid I am. I avoided the first drink for a week this time, but then yesterday I was bored around 2p.m. and decided to pass the time with a pint at the bar. Ended up staying out to 11. I didn't tell my dad or sister where I was and I ignored my phone all night, so they're very angry with me now because they were worried all night.

I don't even like drinking. I always end up doing things I would never do sober. I always embarrass myself and always regret everything afterwards. Last night is a good example and I feel like I can't tell anyone about what happened so I'll just vomit it all out here on reddit. 

I met this woman at the bar and she wanted me to go to her house. I didn't want to at first because I knew she was drunk, but then she kissed me and she was really pretty so I decided to go. When we got there we mostly talked, but we did cuddle a bit on the floor. She started crying about something and seemed like she wanted me to console her, but I'm not great at that kind of thing so I just kept hugging her.  

And then it turned out her kids were home which I didn't know about and she wanted me to talk to them for some reason. One of her kids was in his room playing a video game on his computer. So I sat there and watched him play for a bit and he explained the game to me. He was young and he reminded me of myself when I was his age so I enjoyed making conversation with him, but he was probably really weirded out about having some drunk stranger in his room. His mom came back after maybe 10 mins, and she took me back downstairs where her other son was who looked to be about my age. I figured she wanted me to talk to him too, so I tried but there wasn't much to say and it didn't really go that well. I guess at this point the woman had probably sobered up a bit because she wanted me to leave, so she took me to the door. As I was leaving she told me to call her sometime, but I think she was just trying to be nice. I didn't get her phone number so I can't call her anyway.

I'm really embarrassed about all of last night. I can't believe I put that lady and her kids through that. The whole situation was really kind of weird. I hope she's not embarrassed, and I hope her kids aren't mad at her. I know it was her idea but I'm still hugely responsible for it all. I really hope I didn't hurt anybody.

I don't have anyone to talk to about this kind of thing. I hate who I become when I get drunk. I wish I could apologize to everybody for everything but I feel like I've gotten drunk so many times I don't have the right to apologize anymore. I'm a terrible person and a complete idiot. I don't know why I think going to the bar is a good idea.

I'm going to try coming to this sub reddit everyday and see if it helps me avoid that first drink.",5

I feel uncomfortable, agitated, obsessed with many questions but most of all I feel tremendously lonely.
I can't talk to my family about this because they don't know I've been drinking again lately, even if rarely, and I don't want to upset them or being judged.
My husband works up to 70 hours a week this time of the year and we barely meet for 5 minutes a day.
He's a good person, he's patient, supportive, understanding, caring, loving, he shows me all this in acts and not just with words.
But at the same time he doesn't really understand what I'm going through, especially about my mental health condition(s) and drinking problem.
And he has never made much efforts to read and being very informed about it.
I know that I can't expect him to be my sponsor or my therapist! But I would have tried to know as much as possible about the situation if the roles were reversed.
He was there when I was drunk every day 12 years ago! How can he be so blind and shallow and saying that in his opinion I'm not really an alcoholic?
Maybe because I've always being right thinking that he's a problematic drinker himself, this would explain a lot.
But he strongly refuses to even consider this point of view even if he was drinking like me in the past.
He stopped bingeing when I stopped, he still drinks, he gets drunk rarely and always when we are around other heavy drinkers, during a dinner or parties. Never when it's just the two of us unless I decide I want to get wasted.
So basically now, when I ""decide"" that I want to drink I can be very persuasive and he doesn't stop me, he tries at first but I immediately become agitated when he does that and sometimes even aggressive. So in the end he lets it go and even joins me....and he gets drunk like me, with me.
Not all the time but it happens.
Maybe he's sick as well and he's weak, or he just doesn' know how to make me think clearly in order to overcome my craving and obsession and it's easier to let it go than fighting.
I really don't understand what's going on.
I see an evil pattern into this behaviour.
I know that you can't blame others for drinking, only you can choose to be sober and find the strength.
Anyway I still feel this feeling of betrayal when he doesn't stop me, when he says that he doesn't think I'm an alcoholic after all.
It's frustrating, and it's confusing.

There was a bad storm in the night (she's terrified of the thunder and shakes and breathes heavily so I think that over excites he heart and causes me bad anxiety in turn) and I ended up sitting and drinking with her for a few hours. But last night was different. For the first time in over two years I went to sleep sober. Thanks to this subReddit I learned your body craves alcohol because it's a sugar. I don't drink soda so instead of having a beer last night I had a coke. And i fell asleep about 1 AM (which is good for me I'm normally up until 3-4 drinking) so that's a start to controlling and moderating my alcohol intake. Thanks to all here.

I lost my job, destroyed relationships, was financially ruined, and spun a web of lies and deceit so dense to hide the true extent of my drinking that I was completely entangled. I was going to drink myself to death at 30, and I has almost resigned myself to being okay with that. It took close to a handle of vodka per day by that point just to stave off withdrawals and continue obliterating myself.

1. The hangover anxiety is fucking hell. Just remember how shitty it feels to feel like you're dying and your husband hates you. (See #5). 

2. It's expensive - remember when you relapsed with $200 in the bank and spent $160 of it on booze in a single night and couldn't put enough gas in the car to get to work?

3. you shouldn't need pills to sleep. Remember when you could sleep a solid 8 hrs without assistance? Wouldn't you like to be there again.

4. Pissing the bed is for babies and you're 35 years old. Grow the fuck up. 

5. That gut girl. Oh Jesus that gut. The bloat. The extra pounds. You can't suck it in anymore. Good thing he loves you the way you are. 

6. The, oh so embarrassing, shakes. Remember when you were in that work meeting, so hungover that you couldn't hold your coffee cup straight and everyone noticed? 

7. Coffee is delicious and it shouldn't make you so jumpy that you cannot function. 

8. Your skin should smell like flowers and rainbows, not Jameson and Miller lite. Come on, everyone can smell that eau de toilette. 

9. Remember when you were one of the quickest and wittiest people in the room? No so much dummy. You've drank yourself stupid and you wanna turn that around asap. 

10. Being level headed and able to handle life is the best. Remember when the waiter could bring you the wrong chips at the Mexican restaurant and you didn't start crying?! BECAUSE OF CHIPS. Man that was the life...

11. You don't smoke. You haven't smoked in years. Drinking is doubling down on an unhealthy lifestyle. 

12. You GET SHIT DONE when you're sober. Those 26 days you spent sober, remember how much you got done?! Shelves, hung. Gutters, cleaned. Bills, paid. Awesome. 

13. You absolutely feel better about yourself when your sober. Self esteem is no longer just an Offspring song, but actually something real and attainable.",103

I’m coming to this group for support and kind words. I recently got sober after years of binge drinking and blackouts and the inability to realize that I’ve been self medicating for half my life. I lost my youngest brother to a heroin overdose two years ago and my middle brother who used to abuse with him (who has been supportive of my sobriety) has been using again. Sight details haven’t been making sense and I had a gut feeling but stuffed it down. I woke up to a text today from his wife that said that he’s going crazy and probably using. He’s been gaslighting her and myself as he’s been dangling going to in patient rehab on 12/27 in our faces. My distanced dad (a counselor) set up this situation in which we are grateful. 10 days is a long ways away if he’s freaking out, medicating and causing scenes. I’ve come to find he threatened another parent while he was picking up my niece (5) and nephew (10) from the bus yesterday and slammed my moms car door on his wife’s several times out of frustration. 

I’m worried about my mom, niece, nephew and his wife who live with him.

How do you stay away from the drink while being helpful to the family?

TLDR: I’ve come to find that my brother relapsed a few times (assuming alcohol and pills) over the past few weeks. How do you not say “fuck it all”?",3

2019-12-18 09:07:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ecd2nj/first_day_first_post/,"First day, first post","Greetings. Like everyone here, I have a complex relationship with drinking. I took my first drink when I was 15, right before I did some yard work for a neighbor. Slammed two Coors banquets back to back. It made the work go by quick, and the euphoric feeling I got from the buzz was all I needed to know alcohol was a kick.

Over my high school years I would binge almost every weekend but never during the week. Not because I didn't want to but because my parents wouldn't really let me go out M - F and they kept limited amounts of alcohol in the house. I had no interest in the hard liquor, just beer, and they didn't really drink it.

Once I got to college it was a different story. I was binging 5 out of 7 nights a week, only taking a rest when I felt like absolutely and total shit. I never really thought I had a problem - it's what college kids did, was my excuse. Part of the experience.

I started realizing I might have an issue when I was 24. A longtime girlfriend broke up with me (unrelated to drinking - I actually didn't drink that much while with her) and I spiraled into a depression. I drank constantly.

It got worse when I moved out on my own a year later. I lived alone 2 hours from friends or family. I drank alone, almost every night. On the weekend I woudl come home to visit my then girlfriend and I would steal her father's beer and drink it out in the garage. One time I sneaked a Smithwick's into her parents bathroom and tried to open the bottle on the bathroom sink. The bottle exploded and broke. I had to clean it all up and *somehow* her family did not catch on. I can't remember how I got away with it, because I was completely in the bag at the time.

Fast-forward year after blurry year, and I meet my now wife, in 2011. I didn't tell her about my issue (mainly because I kept denying there was an issue), and I was good, real good, at hiding it. We married in 2013 and, since I got home from work an hour and a half earlier than she did and she picked my stepson up from child care, I continued to binge. By the time she got home I'd be drunk, and to her it would only look like I had a beer or two and was fine. Like I said, I could hide it. Every once in awhile, if I got into the hard liquor, she would ask ""are you drunk?"" I would deny it.

The last few years have been a constant haze of binging as soon as I got out of work - I'd pick up a hard cider from the mart, pound that, grab a few tallboys for when I got home, pound those, tell her I wwas going to the gym, get a few more tallboys, pound those in the car, repeat. I would ask her if she needed any errands ran just so I could get a drink at the gas station and pound it before getting what she needed.

Last friday I had a work Christmas party. I got super hammered. On the way home I grabbed a hard cider and filled an empty coffee thermos with it. I drank most of it on the way home. The coffee mug has remained in my car the last few days. Last night I was snowblowing the driveway and my wife went to move my car so I could more easily get rid of the snow. When i was done she confronted me with a small glass full of the cider. She had taken the mug out of my car because she thought it was empty and she wanted to wash it. When she opened it she smelled alcohol and poured it into the glass. She knew what it was. At first I tried to play dumb, but of course that failed. At that moment I spilled it all.

Anyway, sorry for the lengthy post. Today I start the first day of what I hope will be a sober rest of my life. I am 39 years old. I have spent most of the past two decades drinking alcohol not on a daily basis, but what would probably amount to a daily basis. I appreciate anyone who has read this, and any advice not already give on this board. Thank you.",1

Also I had to take my pet to the vet which put me another few hundred in the hole. I was broke before this. Forget about Christmas. Everyone talking about buying gifts and having dinner with family or friends man fuck them. I don't want to hear it. I can barely afford food.

2019-12-18 08:43:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eccsko/review_of_my_first_year_trying_and_succeeding_at/,Review of my first year trying and succeeding at sobriety,"At the start of this year, some stuff happened that made me realize some things in my life which I never really took seriously. However, since I didn't really take responsibility, blamed others and I didn't have a proper perspective, the way I dealt with this was by stowing away the bad feelings with alcohol. I started to work on personal development but this meant recognizing my problems but not really working on them. This caused my drinking to simply get worse.

One night in April I got way too drunk and texted particularly hurtful things which I still regret immensely to a friend (we're not friends anymore since that happened) and I don't even remember half of it.
I decided I had had enough of feeling terrible because of behaving so shitty, stuff I could only blame myself for. If I kept drinking it was just a matter of time before it would happen again; Moderation never worked in the past, it's so incredibly hard to stop drinking after having a few. So at the age of 27, I figured quitting completely was the best option. I found this sub and I think it played a big role in really making the definitive decision. It's one thing to toy with the idea of sobriety, as many people do when they have a hangover, but I don't think I know anyone who never drinks (it turned out later that I did know a recovering alcoholic). So the main power of this sub was in making sobriety seem more achievable by seeing all those posters with their own drinking troubles who had been sober for 100+ days and after reading a bunch of posts.

Telling other people was quite the hurdle. In the first weeks I would just order something without alcohol, and people might have thought I was hungover or something. Later on, when some people had already noticed I quit and reacted positively, I got enough confidence that telling people straight up wasn't a big problem. By now I'm not even bothered by whether people know I have/had a drinking problem.

I had no physical addiction, so the hardest thing to overcome was the habit of drinking whenever I felt sad/stressed/angry/etc. In fact the habit is still there somewhat: I had a long and stressful day recently and instead of going to bed sleeping after getting home late, I first drank 2 big cans of non-alcoholic beer, even though I had to get up pretty early as well. Of course drinking NA beer is not a problem, but I do recognize that the old habit is still there in some form.

Thus far it went very well; I did slip up a few times in the first few months but I make the rules of my sobriety and decided not to count those as an end of my sobriety streak, instead I used it as paradoxical encouragement to keep going, beating myself up a little bit.

The initial, main reason to quit drinking was to stop me from doing any more stupid things while drunk. I had lost one good friend already, and didn't want to lose any more. In hindsight, I realized that I had been using alcohol (for about a decade) to avoid having to think about my problems: ""Something went well? Celebrate with a drink!"", ""Something went bad? better have a drink."". This was probably a main reason I felt so ""stuck"" at life: like I made no progress or gained no maturity (whatever that's supposed to mean). To tackle problems they have to be acknowledged and then faced, I just stayed in my comfort zone instead. Some like to describe sobriety as some kind utopia, but in my experience it's not. Facing your problems is tough, and as an alcoholic you probably have a lot of them, but overcoming them is a better feeling than the best booze could ever provide. Sleeping goes much better now, though.

So this year I've started to work on my personal problems. For instance, right now I'm working on reducing my social anxiety. Knowing that alcohol can take some of that away, I'm starting to feel more temptations to drink than a while ago. A few days ago I even dreamed I had drank two beers, the main feeling was one of regret, though. I could kinda rationalize picking up drinking again with ""I have my problems under control, I will recognize it if I go downwards again."" but I know that I'm still poor with recognizing such things early. Additionally, overcoming fears while intoxicated would make no difference in my sober behavior, and social skills are not only useful for intoxicated situations.

Thanks for reading my ramblings, IWNDWYT!",8

I kinda can't believe I've made it this far. This is only the 3rd time in 13 years I've made it north of a week... once was almost a year when I was pregnant/had a newborn (several years ago)... and the other was January 1st-11th of this year (and outside of that only a handful of times that were more than three days....). This really feels kind of amazing!!  
  

It's starting to feel easier. It's starting to feel like the new normal. I still think about drinking daily, but not like I used to. And I don't debate whether or not I should drink... I merely have thoughts ABOUT alcohol.
  
  
The first few weeks were hard.... then it got relatively easy for a few weeks. The last couple weeks have been hard again. I've had some stressful things occur, which has been triggering.... and I think I'm finally having to start to deal with some big/real emotions (which I've mostly been suppressing with alcohol my whole adult life.). I came SERIOUSLY close to breaking last week (Friday)... and now, of course, I'm SOOOO GLAD that I didn't. I cried harder on Sunday than I have in a long fucking time... like just laid on my bed and SOBBED.

My life fell off the rails, depression came, bad decisions were made.... All while trying and failing to quit drinking. Quitting implied that I was in the process of stopping. ""I'm trying to quit.""

Now I just don't drink. I sometimes feel like drinking. I remember that I'm not being deprived of it, I simply don't drink. You don't have to forget that you ever had a problem, just rest assured it's over.  ""I don't do that.""",15
2019-12-18 08:09:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eccevb/effects_one_week_in/,Effects -- one week in!,"Actually, I'm about 6.5 days in, but there's no chance I'll drink this evening. Here are a few changes I've experienced (though some may be slightly anecdotal) after one week. I just post to hopefully get someone started and feeling better -- it may only take you 2-4 days to start getting motivated, just like I'm feeling -- it's like a new high, of sorts. Especially since it's been so long since I've felt so good!

\- My resting heart rate dropped from 73 to 56 as of this morning (!!)  
\- I lost a total of 2.9lbs  
\- I can clearly see and feel in my face the bloating (swelling?) is down *considerably*   
\- My face / skin is much smoother than it was   
\- I have a sleep tracking device and deep / REM sleep is considerably higher (I'll add the #s up someday and report back)  
\- My work days aren't dragging on -- just watching the clock tick  
\- With the above, my confidence has increased and my anxiety has plummeted dramatically -- the latter of which has been the catalyst to drinking more.   
\- I actually make it to the gym in the morning -- every morning. And waking up isn't physically or emotionally painful... imagine that?  
\- My appetite has come back and I have no more GI issues (have been dealing with those for months)

\-My BP is generally around 130/90, so I'll have to get an update on that when I stop in a drug store. 

I'm sure there are more, but again -- most are seemingly anecdotal and hard to quantify. However, if I'm feeling better, that's enough for me.

I've been taking B complex, multi-vitamin, & magnesium, so as much as I can tell, it may be helping. The first two nights were kind of rough -- I would wake up sweating, which seems to be a common, but that stopped night 3. I still feel a tiny bit jittery, but not nearly what it was before. My mental clarity is much better and I find I'm not procrastinating as much, which is has helped my work productivity tremendously. 

Thank you all for inspiring / motivating me to get here! I hope I can do the same",10

Today is Day 181. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to round it off and celebrate on day 180, or wait till about day 183... either way, it's been half a year since I had a drink. I never thought I could really do this.

It's crazy to think about what I've accomplished and what I've been through in the past six months, and without the crutch of alcohol to hold me up.

\*I made it through the 4th of July, a huge drinking holiday here. It was tough - my kid was a rodeo queen, and the stress from that is always enough to make me want to drink. I wanted to - but I didn't.

\*I made it through the county fair, where we always have some drinks at night after the kids have shown. 

\*I made it through countless horse shows, even one out of town show that would've been lovely to drink after.

\*I made it through the passing of my grandmother - saying goodbye to her in the hospital, and her funeral, and cleaning out her house. 

\*I made it through my birthday.

\*I made it through two camping trips.

\*I made it through a ten day trip to Iceland. (That one was hard to imagine, and honestly, I hardly missed alcohol at all on that trip.)

\*I made it through countless parenting moments, especially with the teen. Parenting without alcohol is so hard, but so rewarding. I'm much better at it when I have a clear head at all hours of the day and night.

\*I made it through Halloween - had an O'Douls at a party, won a costume contest, trick-or-treated sober. 

\*I made it through two girls' nights. I sipped Topo Chico. If they did notice, they didn't say anything. Turns out I can still hang out til midnight and talk and enjoy myself.

\*I made it through finding out my husband will be working out of town for three weeks out of every month, including over Thanksgiving and Christmas. His schedule has always been a reason to drink for me.

\*I made it through Thanksgiving without drinking an entire bottle of wine. This might be the first time in the last ten or so years that I can say that. 

\*I've made it through countless little stressful moments, moments that always would've been met with a glass of wine. I no longer think of wine first when a stressful thing happens. I'm actually learning to cope.

And now I'm about to go through Christmas and New Year's without drinking a drop. So many of these things, I couldn't even imagine doing sober back when I started this journey. Who doesn't drink on vacation? Or on their birthday? Or at every major holiday? I just knew I'd feel left out of the fun, and I'd be bored and just wishing I could drink. It turns out, that hasn't been the case at all. The worst cravings haven't come from those times. They've snuck up on me randomly, after a day in town running errands, or after a long day at home without the kids. But the big moments, the ones I always associated with drinking, those haven't been bad at all. And every time I make it through one, I get a little stronger, and a little more confident. Every event confirms what I'm learning - that alcohol really isn't necessary to relax after a stressful day, or to have a good time. 

It's not all been sunshine and rainbows. There've been awful days - tears and yelling and general misery. I've wanted to give up more times than I can count. But if you consider the sum of all 180 days, the majority have been days I've loved, days where I have no regrets and can honestly say I lived my fullest life that day. And really, what more can I ask for than to be living my best, most fulfilling life? 

This sub has been a huge part of my staying sober. I've checked in during difficult moments and y'all have talked me through them. And I read posts and reply here and there each night before bed. Every story of success, every story of mistakes, all of it helps keep me from drinking. I appreciate all of you.",16

I can never just have a couple of drinks and go home. My drinking has come to the stage where anytime I drink I will end up on a session for 2 days. The feeling of regret/ depression and anxiety that follows after my drinking are crippling along with spending far too much money.

I associate drinking with freedom.  

I was in a shitty relationship and I used alcohol to make myself feel better and escape from the relationship in general. 

I looked forward to going out on my own, or with friends, and loosening up. Temporarily forgetting what I had to go home too. 

When I get the opportunity to go out to an event or with friends, I’m still in that mindset. I still believe that this small piece of freedom is only temporary, and once the evening ends, I’m back to my miserable situation. But this isn’t true anymore. I am free. I am away from that toxic environment. I have oodles of opportunity to do things on my own now. 

Before the relationship I didn’t have a problem with alcohol. During and after, I do. Thankfully I’m working with a therapist to get past this.

I'm on night 2 of not drinking. This is the first time I've gone 2 consecutive nights without drinking anything in probably 2-3 months, I'm not really even sure. How I reminded myself that it was okay: ""Oh, I'm drinking light beer instead of liquor. It's not THAT bad!"" Until that wasn't all I was able to stick to, and things got bad ....again. Anyways, I'm starting small and hoping that if I can make it past a week, then I can make it 2 weeks, to a month, etc etc. 

However now this is the second night in a row and I absolutely cannot sleep. Before I drank myself to sleep, so I know that's playing a factor. Plus I work a weird 2nd-3rd ish shift so my body is all off schedule anyways. It's now 5 am I haven't slept at all. I have to be up in 2 hours. 

I know this post is mostly rambling but my house is quiet, I'm feeling quite alone, and I really just want to go to sleep. I don't mind going a few nights without sleeping very well because my desire to stop drinking is so high. My relationship is currently on rocks because my stupid drunken alter ego is a real bitch. I want to get rid of her. I also need some hope that it's going to get easier. Thank you for reading.",3

So bit of a backstory on me. Didn't drink much until I was about 18, although already abused many illegal drugs, went to Uni, came an actual alcoholic. Went through withdrawals and relapsed multiple times. I'm back with my parents now, my life is pretty in control, and I don't drink daily anymore, which is great! However, sometimes when I do have a drink, I go full blown relapse and go out of control, usually making a twat of myself and doing things I hugely regret. Two days ago was my work do, I ended up throwing a candle at my boss, getting us kicked out of multiple places. Work are laughing about it and are fine with me (luckily!), however I simply no longer want alcohol in my life. I'm fed up of waking up regretting my decisions and feeling like death for days. I swear it effects me more than everyone else, I think I may have damaged my stomach lining when I was drinking daily because the stomach pains the day after a heavy binge are horrible! I've been here a number of times, I try to quit, and those around me simply say 'yeah haha, until you fuck up again'. 

I would love any pieces of advice from people with experience. How do you say no when so much of your social life revolves around alcohol? It's worth noting its only alcohol I want to quit. I often have nights with some friends where we just take downers like valium and weed and I have a fine time without any trouble, I know my limits with other drugs, but alcohol I enter a dissociate state and lose all memory, critical thinking, and the things I have done in the past are horrible. I've fought my Muslim father while naked because I thought he wouldn't leave my bedroom, when in fact I was in the bathroom trashing it. I'm sure you've all got your own lists, but I'm haunted by these things I do while on alcohol, and need some advice never going back, I really don't want another relapse!",1

As for the next year and decade, I'm looking forward to an healthier me, someone who looks after her body and mind. I enjoyed being drunk, but if I had continued to drink as much as I did, I certainly would not have enjoyed the end result.

Ignore my day number - I've been doing the 3-4 day stretch before giving in for years now. I have managed to decrease the amount each binge, but even drinking just a bottle of wine sets me back mentally for days. I know this, yet still I do it - over and over and over again. It's the old story of do the same thing and expect a different result. 

I think it would really help me (and others) if people would be able to write some ways their lives have changed for the better. I've noticed no-one has come back here and gone ""guess what guys! I started up drinking again, and man it's worth it!"" lol.

I'd love it if anyone has time to write a few words; in many ways I'm at a crossroads, and I'm old enough now where 'fuck it, I'm too old to change, this is just my life until grave' is coming into play.

As it turns out I have some signs of alcoholism I didn't really notice. I usually have 3 rules to drinking and with reasons for each 

1. Only at night (day drinking isnt fun and actually makes me feel like a heavy alcoholic)

2. Only after work (I'm a pizza delivery driver and therefore it would be really fucking stupid to put someone else's life in danger over my apparent addiction)

3. Only alone (people bother me. Most of my friends I dont relate to and I fell more comfortable watching youtube videos of let's plays and podcasts while drinking. Not only that but every time I drink with friends they have to tell me how I got black out drunk and did a list of stupid/embarrassing things that either pissed off my friends or gave them a youtube compilation worth of lulz (I dont get black out drunk alone, just with friends))

Here's the thing I'm not drinking tonight which is the first time in a while. Last time I went sober for a night was I dont remember when. Now the reason I never saw it as an issue is because I know a lot of people who have a vice and indulge in it everyday/night (Mostly weed), So why cant I? I cant smoke weed, it makes me freak. I've had fun with some drugs in the past but none of them fun enough to keep doing. Drinking was the only vice I ever really had/liked. Not to mention it helps with my anxiety. (But now I usually just take some form of cbd for my anxiety). So now I'm just bored. I like to go out but again dont like to hang out with my friends as much as I use to. And I dont want to go do things on my own. So I kind of just sit at home and honestly look forward to having a couple beers alone in my room watching my shows or videos or whatever. I think that's the main thing about all of this, is it's just that I'm bored. I'm in school so it's not like I have other things to preoccupy my time. But hell it can't be the ONLY thing I do ya know? And of course I can already see people saying ""get a hobby man!"" Or something along those lines. But at this point in time. I'm a little broke and all the friends that I actually like hanging out with are my co workers. The problem with that is when I'm off, theire not. And when they get off they dont want to go out and do anything cause they just worked all day. (But then again I also dont like to leave my room much either. I mean hell I started just doing everything in my room. If it wasnt for the fact I still live at home, I could easily use my closet as a pantry, have a mini fridge and microwave in my room and would be totally contempt with not leaving my room unless i had to do any bathroom related stuff. But yea i started doing yoga and basic exercises in my room. I like my little cozy space with all my shit...sue me)

To me this honestly feels like I'm kind of being a little bitch about the situation (and honestly rambling on and on hitting multiple topics). I mean I wanted a drink and then I stuck through wanting a beer for about an hour and then that desire just went away. Unlike some people who clearly struggle with the addiction. Yet here I am claiming to be an alcoholic yet I was able to move onto something else and not drink. Do I currently want a beer? Kinda. Am I getting the shakes and losing sleep? Not really. (I mean i am up at 1 a.m. right now but I also had some coffee this morning and that keeps me up for like 24 hours straight anyways lol...anyway) 

Idk if this was really asking for help or advice. I feel like I can actually take care of this problem on my own, no 12 step program needed or anything. But then again it has been only one night so idk. And this isnt to sound like I'm belittling this problem (or anyone who is seriously going through this problem). I just figured I would post and see what happens. Part of this is therapeutic to just vent and another part is to maybe get some feedback on this post. Maybe some advice, maybe some opinions, maybe some criticism, who knows. But if you made it this far. Thanks for reading!",2

My drinking has gotten worse in retirement and I have become belligerent to my husband a couple times.     I am 9 days dry and doing ok.      I don’t want to change my gender as honestly it is just too much work and I’m a tall muscular dude and am too vain to be an ugly huge woman.     So I’ll stay being a man.   I have a supply of Antabuse and take some everyday which helps.    Sexual compulsion was a huge part of my effort to sooth anxiety.    However, I’ve been monogamous with my husband, but struggle.     

Sobriety has exacerbated my anxiety and I find myself worried about everything.    I take Lexapro 10mg, But was thinking of increasing it?     I’m also a physician but not a shrink.   

Is anyone else out there remotely in a similar situation?      I’d love to text with a kindred spirit.

Tonight at a meeting, someone need blankets for the weather. I remembered I had this blanket I carry in my car. I have actually carried it in my car for a few years. When I drank and knew I couldn't drive home, I would sleep in the back seat of my car, so I always kept blankets in my car. This particular blanket has moved cars and I actually used it the night of my last drink. I was so embarrassed when I got home drunk that last night, I slept in the back seat of my car while my family was staying at my apartment. I kept that blanket all these years. Tonight I was able to give it away to someone who needed it. I am able to recognize how far I have come and where I am at now. 

Tonight I also recognized that I am exactly  where I am supposed to be in life. I was meant to be at that meeting, so I can help someone else and they have help me let that part of me go. I am grateful that I had the blanket to give to him and I am grateful that I don't have to sleep in my car anymore because I am too drunk. I am grateful I am sober.

I don’t want a badge this time. It makes the days seem long to me - having a general awareness of how long it’s been since my last drink is working better for me. 

My longer term goal is to make it 108 days. I’m Jewish and the word for life in Hebrew is Chai (sounds like ‘hi’) and it has the numerical equivalent of 18 - so when you give money as a gift or to charity you do it in multiples of 18 because you are wishing the person / organization a long life. Anyway figured I’d go ahead and apply it to myself. 

108 seems manageable and I feel like it will give me a break long enough so when I get there I can decide my next step with a clear head.

I also work closely with Child Protective Services. I've held this job for 2.5 years. Had my last drink on Thanksgiving. 

I wanted to seek help for quite some time before now, honestly. But given my situation as a public employee, it's hard to seek the help. I have to assess and recommend services to my clients, many of whom have serious alcohol and drug problems. Some show up to AA meetings wearing ankle monitors. I've never considered AA an option because of the extremely high likelihood that I'd see a client there.

I looked into SMART recovery. One of them is a town over, but it's run by a supervisor from an agency that we work with who I'm close friends with. A sober fellow who has been clean from hard drugs and alcohol for over a decade. He actually helped me get my job. He reports to my immediate supervisor and I don't want to let him in on what I'm going through.

Luckily, my drinking has rarely affected how I do my job, aside from being five minutes late occasionally. I always planned out my benders to avoid screwing up my career. I came into work hung over on my birthday and my coworkers were surprised to know I even drank in the first place because of how I conduct myself and do my work. That, and I'm such an anxious and uptight person that I'm known as the guy who just can't relax. Alcoholism runs rampant in my office, it turns out. Not surprised given the nature of our jobs.

Luckily, I've found my own support and coping skills and I'm on the mend. I've realized that my drinking was coming from things in the past that I'd never given myself a chance to process and accept. My upcoming vacation will be a challenge, but I'm ready for it. I hope everyone has something great planned for the holidays.",6

 Nervous as hell, I went to a rapid access addiction clinic. 

Talked to a therapist who agreed that I have a problem and admitted me to see the RPN. 

RPN listened to me, I described my symptoms when I’m not drinking and what my consumption pattern was. It was all very professional, friendly and non judgmental. 

She prescribed some anti seizure medication and an opioid receiver blocker to reduce my desire to drink as well as 9 benzodiazepines to get me over the hump of the first few days. 
She also arranged an addiction counselling program that is fully covered by my government health plan. 

I can’t say that I don’t want a drink now and then but after 9 days sober, I definitely feel much better. 
Even managed to go to a pub with friends and did not have anything except tonic and lime. 

If you are struggling to get started, embarrassed to seek help I strongly recommend going to a rapid access clinic for assessment. 

I know I’m just a babe in the woods still, and I probably picked the worst time of the year to give it up.
But I had to start stopping some time soon or things would have gone down hill in a hurry. 

Best of luck to you all.",13

Over the past 11-12 years I have taken many ""breaks"", whether it be pregnancies or just getting healthier mentally and physically, lasting as long as 12 months or more. This time I really wasn't sure. Then, strangely, one morning I woke up half-sick, half-hungover. I stayed home, fully succumbed to a nasty stomach bug, and when I recovered, something had just snapped. I downloaded ""This Naked Mind"" and started reading. I changed the conversation in my head surrounding drinking. I got mock-tail ingredients. Alcohol did not, and still does not sound appealing. I'm not saying I'll never have a drink again, but this feels so much different. The other day, I had a particularly trying evening as I decided my relationship with my SO was no longer serving me in healthy ways nor moving forward, so I chose to put an end to it and focus on myself. I was upset. We were together for almost 2 years, and we still have some emotional processing before it is completely severed, but I've stuck to my guns. I feel confident and relieved. I'm excited to move forward. That night, though, I got in the car and drove toward the liquor store, but this time instead of the usual mental arguments for why a drink was okay this time, and why I not only needed one, I deserved one, it was actually the opposite. I was telling myself all the reasons I didn't want to drink...how I would feel in the morning; the terrible sleep I would have; the fight that might ensue with SO. I turned This Naked Mind on audio in the car, took a right, and made a block back to my house. And I woke up feeling great. IWNDWYT",23

**The Good:** My new client is a professional stand-up comedian. On our last phone call, I made her laugh—a lot. I’ve decided that if you can make even a pro laugh, then that’s saying something.

**The Bad:** My cell phone crapped out. Now, without a phone to guide me, I keep getting lost in my car when I try to go new places. I might have to start reading maps again.

**The Helpful:** I love reading advice columns, and “Dear Prudie” at Slate magazine is a favorite. Recently, Prudie was asked a question that I see frequently here at r/stopdrinking: “What do I say when people ask why I’m not drinking?” I thought Prudie’s answer was a good one:

>When it comes to a co-worker or someone you’re not especially close with, you can always offer the sort of vague response that prevents follow-up questions: “Oh, I’m not in the mood.” (Help this along by sounding pretty bored and uninterested.) Excuses like “I’m driving later” or pretending to be on antibiotics all have their place in escaping this tiresome conversation, but the best excuse is a whim because whims really can’t be argued with. 

>When it comes to your close friends, you can be a bit more forthcoming and say, “I’m not drinking right now, but I’d really appreciate it if we could talk about something that’s not drinking, or giving up drinking, or anything drinking-related. I’ve had to deal with a lot of different people’s reactions to this break, and I’m a little tired.”",26

The first time I quit was Dec 8, 2012. Making my way through to the end of the year was tough in spots, but I managed it, and it filled me with a sense of strength and optimism that was the greatest gift I could have given myself.  

My advice...have a plan in place to get out of any gathering, should it become uncomfortable. Gas in your car, with the tires inflated and the washer fluid topped up. If not, have cab fare or Uber money, no matter what.  

Be pleasant, and refuse to engage in drunken arguments. Let shit slide. If you are at a party, keep busy by helping your host tidy up and keep the chip bowls full. Wander about with a camouflage drink...a sparkling water with a slice of lime. My go-to was white grape juice in a wine glass.   

If you are in AA, line up some numbers, and let them know you might call if you're in a bind, or even ask them to text you and check in over the course of the evening.  

**Think it through**. Have a rough plan in place for any eventuality. Someone offers a drink? Have a selection of pre-formulated replies.  

You guys can do this. It's not impossible, and believe it or not, it's really enjoyable. Associating with friends and family with a clear head is really spectacular, so don't forget to have a good time. Keep the anxiety on the back burner, smile, and immerse yourself in the moment. Be grateful that you have this wonderful opportunity to appreciate the people and the surroundings.  

Now, if there are any of you with no place to go at Christmas, be aware that most every AA organization holds a Christmas Dinner. You don't need to be a member to attend. Reach out to your local AA and see if you can find out where it is. Isolation for a newly recovering alcoholic at this time of year is pretty risky. Don't be alone if you have any way to avoid it.  

Peace out, to all of you. Let's not drink for the rest of the year.",40

The past year I’ve been trying to drink less but only the past 2 months have I managed to cut it down to twice a week. But around a week ago I started feeling pain around my rib and because I felt it in my back I figured I strained a muscle at work or something. But after around 5 days of no change I started wondering if it’s something else. I think at the moment something is up with my body and somehow for the first time I realized I have to stop drinking. Not cut down, not drink less. I have to stop completely. I have a doctor’s appointment on friday and will share with them I think the pain might be related to my drinking, but really hoping it’s not. It’s currently 4am and I’ve been crying for feeling so scared, ashamed and guilty. I really hope my liver is okay and that it can heal. For some reason I never even thought about how alcohol damages your body. Sure you feel tired or you gain weight and lose stamina, but beyond that it never crossed my mind because drinking was very normalized growing up and I got used to my own too. But now tonight I feel like the reality hit me. It’s my 2nd day sober and I made a promise to myself not to drink anything anymore. Not during christmas and not during new years, not on my birthday, not when I’m overwhelmed or as a reward, I will not drink. I just hope so, so bad that my liver is okay. ☹️
Thank you everyone on this sub for sharing their experiences. I was able to cut down in the first place because I realized alcoholism shows up in many different ways.

As the title says, my boyfriend of just under a year broke up with me about an hour ago. Via text and completely out of the blue, and I don't even know what to think right now. I'm in shock and heartbroken at the same time, and just feeling overwhelmed.

And I don't want to feel any of it.

I'll have 28 days at midnight, and feel like I've been dealing with an emotional rollercoaster the last few weeks because of it. I just want a break from the emotional overload, and my alcoholic mind was already trying to figure out which liquor shops near me are still open pretty much right after reading his texts. That's always what I've done after a breakup; go on a bender until I'm too sick to keep it up.

But I can't do that. I can't throw away the last near-month of sobriety and hard work. It's the longest I've been sober in years, and realistically know that it will only make things worse. Not only will I have the guilt of drinking and having to reset my dry date, but I also know myself well enough to know there will be drunk texts and other things I'll just hate myself for in the morning.

So I'm going to run out the clock with writing this and browsing this sub until the liquor stores close, and just remind myself it won't change anything.

I do also have the slightest of silver linings that is helping me hold on, as well: the breakup had nothing to do with my drinking. It was personal issues on his own end, and as much as this sucks, I don't have the extra guilt of alcohol being to blame.

But this really, really fucking sucks.",93

Two weeks after quitting I bought some vodka for the first time in so many years. I drank basically a gallon of vodka in a week. Because of course I went back for more. Then I kept going back for more and more and more.   I then was told by my girlfriend at the time “you have a drinking problem” a month after I just went through hell of with withdrawal from heroin.  So of course I got upset saying I’m not addicted to this shit. This is child’s play.

I’ve been struggling with an issue and I’d like to get some insight from people who have experienced the same problems and can truly relate. 
I enjoy drinking. Obviously. In the past, I’ve been known to go overboard when I drink, which has caused problems in my relationships (friends, family, romantic). I do not crave alcohol daily, and can go weeks without drinking. However, once I begin drinking, I don’t want to stop. I like the feeling of drinking and becoming relaxed and being able to “let loose.” 
Sometimes I can pace myself accordingly and not get too wasted, but other times I get so drunk that I say and do things that I really regret once I’m sober. I also find that I completely forget doing these terrible things. 

I’d love to be able to get control over my ability to really pace myself and only drink a few drinks and stop before I get drunk. I’m finding this hard though. What should I do? Do I need to quit drinking altogether? Is my binge drinking a slippery slope to alcoholism, or am I already considered an alcoholic since I have control issues with it?

Any insights and advice are appreciated. 
Thank you!",2

It started off with him making promises he didn't keep to stop drinking while I was pregnant. Now I feel like I'm trying to get healthy, stop drinking and evolve as a person, for our now 5 month old son, and he doesn't want to. He's made some changes but he complains constantly about it. He's unhappy unless he's had some drinks. But he did go from drinking every night to having a couple drinks a week and only socially with work people. Tonight felt like the last straw though because when he walked in the door he was slurring his words a little and I could immediately tell he has been drinking. Things were actually starting to get better, even though he's been complaining constantly and being overall a huge bummer ( saying shit about missing getting drunk and smoking before baby...) He was still not drinking... I can't worry about him anymore; I feel like I do not have the emotional strength to care for our son, deal with my own emotional issues, and worry about him at the same time. Divorce will be a nightmare and I don't even know if I have the strength to even do that. I'm just stuck and tired of this.

EDIT: Because some are missing the part where he was drinking and driving: HE WAS DRINKING AND DRIVING. He came home a week ago after having some drinks with office folk and I said nothing; it didn't bother me because he wasnt slurring his words. TONIGHT he drove home then came in the front door and I could immediately tell he had been drinking because he was slurring his words.",2

2019-12-17 19:24:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ec4oxl/difficultly_with_letting_go/,Difficultly with letting go,"Hey r/stopdrinking,

I wanted to reach out to this community, because I have been a lurker for months now. I have commented, sharing my story in the past but never an actual post. I have come to a rather painful point in my sobriety and I wanted to hear from y’all.

I am an alcoholic, and I have known this since I was in my late teens, but I did not want to accept it. For me, drinking started off explosively, there was no starting off slow. That’s not to say that it was *all* bad, by and large I would say I was a fine drunk. For awhile.

When I started drinking liquor in my early 20’s, my tendency turned toward lethargy or anger. When I drank bourbon I was an angry drunk and it destroyed relationships. It got to the point I was out on my ass couch surfing. Fortunately, I started listening to my parents, my friends, and myself and admitted I was an alcoholic. I checked myself into a rehab voluntarily on March 30th, 2019 and I have been alcohol free since that point.

It has been nice, I really do enjoy not drinking. My life has improved in almost every aspect, I do have relationships that are permanently damaged or destroyed but that’s on me. 
I think my biggest areas of improvement have been in my productivity at work and rekindling my love of playing guitar.

Here’s my problem, I can’t let go of the things I said or did. As I’ve sobered up, the crushing weight of who I was and what I did at certain points in my drinking make me want to vomit. I don’t want to look myself in the mirror and it’s slowly creeping back into my work life. In short, I was vocal about my frustration at a time that was not appropriate and I feel like an ass. I reached out to the people I affected today and apologized, and while they have forgiven me the pit in my stomach is there. 

I talked with my dad, and he has said he totally forgives me as well but I can’t shake it. Mom says the same.  I’ve meditated on what I did and actively tried to forgive myself and it’s still there. I want to be clear, that it’s not that I have a violent past, I don’t. Many drunks are just shit talkers and that was what I was, and to an extent, apparently still am. 

So, r/stopdrinking, what would you do? I am open to trying AA again, had a rather bad experience and not too keen on the God thing (it’s cool if you are though) but I like the camaraderie. How did those of you who forgave yourself get to that point? I could try harder to get in touch with some people but I fear those relationships are too far gone.

Thank you, and despite everything, IWNDWYT",7

I finally understand those posts from people who say that long term sobriety isn't bringing them happiness, because I'm currently feeling that way as well. And it feels like a dangerous place to be. My cravings are feeling bigger then I can handle, and if it wasn't for my boyfriend I would have definitely given in and had a drink at two different social events this past month. I almost cried at a Christmas party this last week because he very firmly told me no, absolutely not, you are NOT drinking right now. He played it forward for me, but I just couldn't accept that reality. I was very much in a, I don't give a FUCK how I'll feel tomorrow, I want to do it RIGHT NOW.

This is my longest stretch of sobriety. When I started back in June, I knew my 6 month would be just before xmas, and I thought I would just be overwhelmed with gratitude for making it this far. I'm ashamed that I'm not feeling that way.

I'm very hard on myself. I can see that. That's probably a big factor in why I drank in the first place. I just can't figure out how to ease up on myself. How to be proud of what I've accomplished. Instead I'm focusing on what I haven't accomplished. What I feel like I ""should"" have done, and what I ""should"" be feeling at this point in my sobriety. And even when I do something that I could be proud of, I just brush it off like it's no big deal. I don't praise myself for doing the things that are hard for me to do.

My self talk just keeps listing all these things that ""should"" solve this problem (exercise, meditation, reading books on sobriety, eating healthier, focusing on art, making friends, trying AA, the list goes on), but the longer I go not doing these things, the more shame and frustration I feel with myself. And again, I can see how unhelpful this thought process is. I just can't figure out how to stop it. Is it a very slow tapering down? Will I start to be kinder to myself very slowly over time, with lots of practice? Maybe being able to recognize that I am being overly hard on myself is a very big first step, and I'm actually making more progress then I currently realize.

Anywho, I feel a little better getting that out of my noggin. I will not drink with you today.",17

\- I am a drunk and an addict. I tend to use those terms rather than alcoholic, because I think alcohol is an evil, shitty substance that doesn't deserve its own word. I am drug addicted, and that's that.

\-  The biggest lie alcohol ever told me was that it made me happy. As Allen Carr said, ""If alcohol truly made people happy, alcoholics would be the world's happiest people."" 

\-  My second biggest mistake was when I began drinking as a kid. My biggest mistake was when I started again after stopping for many years. I had sobriety under my belt, and then I was drinking again. I let my guard down, and I am still paying for it.

\- Anything I could say about my time of personal crisis when I started drinking again would just be noise. I won't waste your time trying to justify this mess.

\-  I won't offer any advice here for a long time other than to suggest that IMHO starting again, even in moderation, is not worth the gamble. I have  just one brain, and the one that says ""just one drink"" is the same one that is likely to say ""keep going.""  Source: Me.

\-  I consider myself to be very fortunate, but I don't need to hit bottom to know it's there. So I'm putting down my shovel, because my hole is deep enough.

\-  This won't be easy. I have work to do, but I am treating this opportunity as a blessing rather than a curse. I am already living in hell, and this is where I begin walking out of it.

I am drinking a fifth of Vodka every day.  Smirnoff with Sprite Zero.  I am in stuck in a very bad cycle.  I’m a single male in my late 30’s no kids, no spouse, self-employed. I look healthy to most people (probably because I sleep a lot, still have all my hair) but I am throwing up every morning and feeling horrible all the time (except when I’m drinking). For some reason I am able to stay sober on Saturdays and Sundays (pig out on food) but then I start it right back up during the week around 1:30pm every day and drink until I fall asleep around 6:30pm or 7:00pm. I usually wake up around 11pm and finish whatever is left in the vodka bottle in the freezer along with a 1mg Clonapin to fall asleep. Sometimes even a ½ an Ambien as well. I wake up around 10:00am and go back to sleep for 30 minutes increments until I crawl out of bed around 12:30pm.   I don’t drink and drive. I isolate and drink by myself in my house - working during the day on my computer while I'm drinking.  It's getting worse now, though.  I have spent the last 4 days in bed with my Vodka next to me. Only getting up to let me dogs outside and eat when I can.  I shower about twice a week.  Time is moving by me so fast sometimes I forget what day it is. 

I was sober for two months (Feb & March) but then I caved after experiencing major physical anxiety and I have been stuck in this miserable cycle since April of 2019. I suffer from ADD, Anxiety and Depression. I was doing the same thing with Whiskey for about a year and a half before I got sober in February 2019.  So I've now been drinking 750ml of alcohol 5-6 days a week for two and a half years with the exception of two months this year.

One year ago (Dec 2018) I discovered my Liver enzymes were elevated (ALT 140 u/L AST 90u/L). The normal range for AST and ALT are both 0 – 40u/L. I had this checked again in May of 2019 and I showed an (ALT 119 u/l AST 121u/l). I’m sure by now these numbers are much worse. I am literally killing myself. 

I found some of these this alcohol groups on Reddit to find truly anonymous support. I tried an AA Men’s group for a while but eventually that was causing me anxiety. They are a tremendous, caring group of guys but eventually I had 7 or 8 people texting and calling me all the time. You wouldn’t know it if you met me (I am outgoing and talk too much) but I don’t crave a lot of social contact. The pressure to go to meetings and constantly communicate was too much for me. I never wanted a sponsor because I didn’t want that pressure either. 

I did 1 hour therapy sessions on Saturdays with a substance abuse counselor (Licensed Clinical Social Worker) weekly when I was sober but eventually we kind of ran out of things to talk about. Especially after I relapsed. 

I cannot go to outpatient or inpatient treatment because of my business, my dogs and my responsibilities.   I am basically STUCK and seem to be unable to make any meaningful changes.  

I don’t want to give up Alcohol completely forever. When I drank again after being sober two months I felt ashamed and didn’t want to go back to AA.  Of course the guys I kept in touch with all lovingly said ""come back!"" but I didn't.  I told them to focus their energy on someone who would actually listen to them.  I told them I didn't deserve their time.  And I firmly believe that it's selfish for me to take their time if I'm not going to follow the program or desire to totally stop drinking. 

Eventually I decided it wasn’t right for me to go back to AA because I did not like the idea of total lifelong abstinence. However, what I’m doing clearly isn’t working. I am very stubborn, very sick and very desperate. I feel like something really bad is going to happen to me soon. Just reading this I sound like a complete idiot. I am not in denial whatsoever that I have a terrible drinking problem. I just can’t seem to put it down. I just want to drink once a month or socially. I know AA says that if you are an alcoholic you’ll find out that you simply cannot manage to do that like normal people. But I am stubbornly trying to find every way around this. ANY SUPPORT, SHARED EXPERIENCES OR ADVICE IS GREATLY NEEDED AND APPRECIATED.",94

I checked in at 10am. They slapped an Intake sticker on me and checked my vitals, asked me a series of questions. 

They just didn’t feel I needed to be there for detox based off my lack of withdrawal symptoms. I feel pretty great. Maybe a little fuzzy and feel thirsty but just keep on drinking water. 

Felt like the best thing I did was open up to my wife and son, told my friends I have a problem, told my work I have a problem. Helped me mentally not even consider having a drink for the over 48 hours now. 

My HR at work said she has some programs and counseling I can take through the company. The rehab center also has a 12 week intensive outpatient program I can do M, W, F from 6pm - 9pm. 

I’m glad I opened up finally. I’m glad my body isn’t as dependent as I initially thought. Now it’s  fighting the habits and triggers. Knowing I’m not dependent makes my choices feel stronger, I have the will and can choose not to act.",129

I know what This Naked Mind would say but it's almost as if I'm expecting to find my life direction (creatively - like, writing, or performing again) while drunk. Wtf? Now, worse for wear because I drank, I don't feel like doing much of anything, let alone chase whatever proposed epiphany I was expecting to come across.

I drink just enough to get a buzz and stop caring. My life has been riddled with trauma & it’s always been difficult for me to fall asleep. I’ve already been to an inpatient treatment center to help me overcome my traumas, and while it helped for a while, some things just never escape your mind. All in all, I really have no doubt that I’m teetering down a slippery slope. I didn’t drink at all yesterday & today at 1pm I went out & bought 2 drinks even though I didn’t really want them. I’m wasting my money. I want to limit it but I’m afraid to stop entirely and let my family in on my secret. I’ve always been the messed up child and this just feels like one more thing that would have everyone saying “go figure, she’s an alcoholic, too”. Can someone help? How can I get this under control? I don’t feel out of control but I also don’t have the motivation to stop & limit my drinking to social settings — and is that dangerous? To believe I can limit myself to social drinking only?

I felt great, then I started to feel super lonely. I felt like I had no release from the everyday activities of being a good parent and a sober human being. I started to feel like this is it? Is this how the rest of my life is going to be? Never going crazy and letting lose again. Never not caring about what I'm doing and having the time of my life for a night. I started to feel like i had no friends. Then I started to rationalize. I started to tell myself I could have one drink. It started at brunch with my mother in law. One mimosa isnt that bad right? 
Then I worked a girls night out party and had a punch with harder alcohol in it. I went home to my kids and went to bed but had the most fomo watching my friends go out and party. Then at work they spoke about how much fun the had and I felt left out. I started to think about drinking a lot!  Cue to this weekend. I went out of town with my mom, my kids and two of my kids friends. We went to see Christmas lights and booked a couple hotel rooms. All I could think about was having a drink with my mom in the bar downstairs. I had two glasses of wine and we went upstairs. I had no intention of going to bed. I went back downstairs ordered more drinks and drank with random people until 3 in the morning. Went back up to my room and went to bed, I woke up hungover as fuck, disappointed in myself and literally hating myself. I did t expect this to happen
 I am still dealing with the emotions of it all but I am confident I can get back on track and that I will start to feel good again. I am really trying to make sure that I recognize my triggers. This trigger was my friends going out without me and having a blast. Any advice on how to overcome these feelings of fomo? I need to stay on the right path for me and my children.",2

Today I had a long day, early I was already solving labor bureaucracy, plus the doctor, more to go to the workshop to get a garden machine, domestic things and now I have had to help a neighbor to take out some boxes to the garbage, in them went a book of alcoholics anonymous, his 41-year-old son died a week ago for his various addictions, I'll be back early tomorrow.

2019-12-17 13:28:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ebzoyd/day_1_im_finally_back/,Day 1. I'm finally back.,"I initially joined this subreddit around this time of year, back in 2017. It was late, I was sick, and all I wanted to do was make it stop. The anxiety. The racing heart. I was as miserable as I had ever been. I decided then, that I was ready for a change and needed some form of a support system to make that happen. I found you all. A welcoming, loving, and accountable community. I traded my whiskey for La Croix. Things were great. I made it just about 6 months before I made the mistake of convincing myself that I no longer had a problem, and could surely enjoy just one or two beers every now and again.

But eventually 1 or 2 turned into half pints of whiskey, and eventually full pints every couple of days. Within about 3 months, I was right back to where I started. 2018 rolled by and I had a few bouts of sobriety, off and on. Lately, I've been fighting it more and more. Each hangover has led to another commitment to sobriety. To never feeling that way again. And each time, I've failed. A few days or weeks pass and I manage to trick myself into thinking that I'm just fine. 

That ends today. I'm done playing this stupid game with myself. I'm done feeling like garbage and constantly worrying about what I've said or done, even if I recall the events of the previous night quite well. I can't moderate. It's no use convincing myself otherwise. I see now that I've tested that hypothesis time and time again, only to come up with the same negative result each time. I may not be dependent on alcohol, but I most certainly cannot control myself around it.

I'm back. And hopefully this time, I'm here to stay. Thank you to those of you that take the time to read this. Any additional support or messages are more than welcome.

To many, i'm the best person to have at a party but they don't see how I act to others or in private at times. 

&#x200B;

I seem to be able to drink at home and not get drunk. Maybe it's that the ""promise"" of alcohol lies outside of the home and not within so I never feel a need to get drunk. Either way, I'm not sure what my next step should be. I was thinking about limiting my drinking only to inside the house since I'm not a big drinker there anyway.

She's really active on a FB group that's essentially a secular, non-programmatic Al-Anon for parents and spouses of drunks. The way she talks about it, it sounds like she's one of the higher-ups there and often the one dropping the truthbombs to new members.

Anyway, so we're sitting on the couch last night talking about my most recent slip. I randomly got on the topic of the results of my MMPI ([Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory)) that I took a couple of years ago during my most recent stint of inpatient treatment. It listed my various ailments and diagnoses, which included 1) Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 2) Severe Alcohol Use Disorder, 3) Antisocial Personality Traits, and 4) Narcissistic Personality Traits.

When I brought the results back up, I asked her ""doesn't every millennial like me display some form of narcissism?""

\- *""No, definitely not. Sure, it's more prevalent, but it's definitely not normal.""*

\- ""And antisocial personality traits? What does that even mean?""

\- *""Well, you do drink destructively despite significant legal, professional and personal consequences. Don't you think that counts as being antisocial? You're literally going against authority every time you drink which has been often.""*

\- ""Fair. Well, can you remember a time as a child when I wasn't a narcissist or antisocial?""

\- *""Yes. All of it. It was the moment you started drinking that you started going down that path. You kept it going for years and it only got worse with time.""*

\- ""You think I drank myself into being an antisocial narcissist? How does that even compute?""

\- *""I think so. You still have that sweet, loving boy inside of you somewhere but it's drowning in alcohol. There's glimpses of it in some of the little things you do, I can see it.* ***I don't think alcoholics are born narcissists: I think the addiction makes them one, otherwise, how else would it survive?****""*

It was then that I realized she had just dropped one of her truthbombs on me.

\- ""I think you might be right. But who's to say I'm beyond saving? I mean, I drank alcoholically from the time I was 20 to the time I was 28, that's like peak executive functional brain development time. Aren't I fucked?""

\- *""Maybe. Then again maybe not. The rest of your story is up to you. Are you going to just give up because you think you're fucked or are you going to do something about it just in case there's an infinitesimal chance you can heal?""*

I answered her frankly and honestly. ""I don't know.""

And that's where I'm at today. Wondering if this whole recovery business will actually prove itself a fruitful endeavor. I'll do my best to stay sober, sure, but you know the old saying, ""once a cucumber becomes a pickle, it stays a pickle.""  I can read all the many hopeful treatises on neuroplasticity and pray I don't stay like this forever. But much like Pascal's wager, what if I'm wrong? What if there is a way out but I'm shutting the door on my own happiness before it can even get its head above water? I don't exactly have the rosiest prognosis. Anxious, alcoholic, antisocial narcissists don't tend to be very happy. They don't have happy marriages or raise happy kids. They are manipulative parasitic leeches of everyone around them, wreaking havoc and sowing the seeds of discontent wherever their feet can take them.

I just don't know what to think. But, I'll try to be better today. Not just for her, but for me.

Wow, proof that no matter how smart and how educated you are, you can still fall prey to alcohol. He's a doctor, for f\*&@ks sake! Dr. Plummer is the brother of a friend from my hometown. For years, I have been reading stories of his amazing accomplishments - he is an HIV researcher who spent 16 years in working in Kenya, he oversaw creation of a vaccine for Ebola, he was awarded the Order of Canada, etc. etc. etc.  I have felt so proud to know him so when I saw the picture, I was expecting some new discovery he had made in advancing the science of infectious diseases. Instead, I read about how he was what many call a 'functioning alcoholic' - drinking 20 ounces of whiskey a day, how he had a liver transplant after being diagnosed with cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease, and how he still could not stop drinking even though he did not qualify for a second transplant and would surely die.

I feel proud now of his bravery in coming forward with his story and am hopeful that, not only will this new treatment help him, but may become a 'cure' for addiction (and depression and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's!). There is just so much we don't know about the brain.

What is an assessment? How pushy are they going to be about inpatient? I think it may be best if I rely on my husband and this sub for two weeks then do the intensive outpatient, I am confident I can make that time but I am really bad at standing up for myself and am afraid of how hard they will push for inpatient.

Got LOADED, blacked out. Can still remember that warm, befuddled glow, building .. and liking it  


  Routinely got hammered in high school on weekends. It was the social glue at the gatherings I made friends thru. Won't lie, we had some fun times, and bonded. Still see some of that crew when in my hometown, and most only drink occasionally. Some not at all. A few are hardcore alcoholics. Like, make plans for a trip and then get too drunk to show up, type drinker. One could easily die before 40 if he keeps it up  


  Continued to drink all thru my 20's, except for 1 year going to school, in my mid-twenties. Was super focused on succeeding, as failure was not an option. Still tho, I honestly researched the cheapest way to make booze, and experimented with making wine in a milk jug, with a balloon on top poked with holes. Actually drank that shit :P  
   
  On Spring break of that year of college, I went camping with some of my old friends, got trashed on purchased wine, and barrel-rolled thru the fire for laughs. Burnt my one arm and almost missed a clinical at school because of the burn. Which would have fucked up my whole year of ""do or die"" school, all for one night   


  Only drank a handful of times that whole year tho, so I knew I was capable of it  


  But resumed as soon as I was done school, and working.   


   Still almost ALWAYS getting pretty, to full on seeing-three, stumbling, slurring, drunk. I remember my brother offered me a single ""weak"" (5%, not 8%) beer on a river tube once and I scoffed internally and thought ""Why the fuck would I bother with that? Won't even get a buzz, and all I'll want it at least 4 more, for now""  


  Was now starting to brown, or black out, most times I would drink. Getting increasingly bad hangovers, which for a time I would mitigate by regimented gatorade-mix and hydration.  


  Would wake up from getting blacked out on cheap sherry and pretend I was sophisticated or something because I didn't feel too bad. ""Hey, 2 bottles of 22%, and I feel pretty good! haha"". And then I'd eat a big greasy breakfast and not really do much the next day

  Had increasingly embarrassing stuff happen while drunk. Damaged a close friendship, lost the respect of a lover,  got stuck in a rut of routinely making embarrassing social media posts  


  As my 20's turned over into my 30's booze in some ways was integral to the fabric of my life. Met a new group of friends, and established myself as the ""friendly guy who brings a liter of wine in his nalgene"".. Would make sure I was only buzzed, around other people, and hold it together enough to come across as emotionally well. Told myself the booze made me more verbose and out-going (which was honestly probably somewhat true sometimes)  


  But then would go home after get togethers and drink another liter or 2 of wine, alone. Wake up feeling, inceasingly, like complete dogshit. Waking up a few hours after passing out with heart RACING, lurching to my computer curate my social media posts if there were any. Falling fitfully back to sleep  


  As I've started getting closer to 40 than 30, the racing heart phenomenon has only gotten stronger. The sleeps have gotten more fitful. CRUSHING rebound anxiety abounds.   


  My last drunk, I got off a nightshift. Went skating on a lake drinking wine. Was fun. Got home. Drank til black out.   
  Usual mid-night thumping heart. Worst ever rebound anxiety. Crippling. Feelings of shame and self-loathing. Next TWO days I still felt like shit  


  The last couple years I've been trying to cut alcohol out of my life. Had some runs of success. About a month and a half this past year. Tried moderation. Works til it doesn't  


  All of which is to say, very long-windedly, that all those efforts to stop poisoning myself have made a difference. I've learned tools. Last week, I got off the last nightshift of my set, and went skating on the same lake, without booze. Was still a blast. I actually took some neat pics, something I wouldn't have had the focus for the weak previous  


   My 2 days off after that day were productive. I spend part of them calculating how many extra calories I would ingest just from alcohol over the coming year if I continued at my present rate. 22 pounds of fat worth, just from the booze. And then another 10 or 15 from the extra shitty food I would eat while drunk or hungover. And I ""wonder"" why I'm still chubby after working out intensely 4 days a week, and watching what I eat much of the time  


  I don't look at past attempts to curb or stop my drinking as a waste. I see them as concerted rockings back and forth that will eventually pop me out of the stupid rut that I allowed myself to get stuck in. So much so that I was having days where I would promise myself ""not today"", and find myself loaded later that day  


Fuck the rut. IWNDWYT. I can still choose not to have that first drink, most days,  and I am going to reinforce that  


  And even if I arm flail and slide back into the rut-circle again temporarily, I'm confident it will be for less time, EACH time  


  The mounting evidence for feeling better without booze is strong. Knowing it is poison is reinforced by the ugly hangovers. I've drank enough, alone, to know it's not actually  a ""romantic"" or ""poetic"" venture. And been around drunk people enough times to know it doesn't make us nearly as sophisticated or quirky or funny as we think it does  


  I want something more. I want true vivacious health. True joy and cheer. To grow into my skin enough that I don't feel a compulsion to get buzzed before social gatherings ""to be my fun self"".   


More and more, booze has been taking away my chances of a happy, full life. Robbing me  


 I'm sick of it.  


  I quit smoking cigarettes 10 years ago, because it wasn't even pleasurable while I was doing it  


  Alcohol is fast approaching that place. What point is there in me giving in to a dumb compulsion, in the coming days or weeks? If I do I know what to expect. Nothing truly good  


  I've felt like ""This is finally the time I quit for good!"" quite a few times the last few years  


  But not gonna let that take the wind outta my sails, or use it to justify drinking. Booze is a sneaky, persistent fucker, but I'm growing bold at the limit of its tricks and traps

This has been a wonderful month. Hard as nails, but wonderful. And after more attempts to quit than I can count, for the first time I feel ready to treat this not as temporary abstinence, but a direction for the rest of my life. I wrote out some thoughts that I can revisit in times of vulnerability.

—

Because I want my health more than I want to drink. I want my career more than I want to drink. I want *my life* more than I want to drink.

I want to wake up in the morning feeling sharp and clear-minded instead of hazy, hungover, and in pain for the first half of the day.

I want to wake up knowing I didn’t make stupid decisions, embarrass myself, or worse.

I want to avoid fighting and drama and unnecessary pain inflicted on my loved ones.

I want to make my family proud. I want to make *myself* proud!

I want to remember my life.

Because I know, deep down, that the best version of myself doesn’t use. Doesn’t self-sabotage. Doesn’t willingly drink poison. Doesn’t settle for living numb. Doesn’t drink his life down the drain.

It’s not easy, but it certainly is simple. I will not drink with you today. Thank you, SD.",3

I have very severe depression and get suicidal thoughts. Sometimes, I get drunk. Sometimes, I black out. This has been going on for 2 years, maybe twice a month on average - by myself. It ends here.

I feel like drinking will make me forget and make it all stop for just a few hours and during my sleep, but it doesn't. It wrecks my brain and body and turns back time. And the thing is, sometimes it does help me with my feelings, but sometimes it makes it worse. And the day(s) after are ALWAYS worse and it takes time to mentally recover. 

I had a blackout that left me in bed for 2 days and made me miss New Years last year due to this sort of depressed binge drinking. I can't have that happen again, and I can't drink on New Years this year. I need to understand that the only thing this drug can do is hurt me. And just because it's socialized, doesn't mean I need to do it.

I picked up the phone and called a friend who had been sober for 25 years and that started the whole thing.

Now, a year later, I'm doing ok, which is a massive leap forward from where I was.  For anyone new, the best advice I can offer is do whatever it takes to get the ball rolling.  Tell a friend you need help, order the Big Book on Amazon.  Go to a movie one night to take yourself away from you temptations.  Get that Day 1 under your belt.  I didn't have to re-live Day 1s for 365 days to get to a 1 year.  It gets easier, but it's never easy and you have to work at it every day (like the horse says).

I hope that you can understand, though. I am different.

I do not dodge their first question toward I Am Powerless Over Myself. I am an alcoholic, and I am dying so fast for it. But I am an alcoholic with ... and I need a doctor to tell me what that ... is.

I love the hangover state. I love the hangover state. I love the hangover state. It is when I unfurl. It is the only time I really exist. It is every flexing extension of LSD and heroin, and none of the impairment. It is the Meissner expulsion into the superconductive state. It is an exemption from fear. It is the frightened look on the policeman's face. It is energy. It is sexuality. It is intelligence, and it's some goddamned good writing.

And have you ever? And have you ever?

Have you ever seen such an inclination in anyone? Because I haven't. I Google it and all they'll say is they like hangovers Because They Get To Act Like A Baby All Day but that's not it. No. There is a variable in my brain other than happiness, and my nameless variable is maximized in the hangover state.

And if I'm ever feeling down, all I've got to talk myself into is: one drink.

Because one drink becomes three four five, just enough, right?

I dodged my way between three Walmarts until I found a shady enough parking lot, and I downed a pint of Jack. I did this so that I could hangover myself for the doctor in the morning. The big-deal doctor, the biggest in the state.

I scared his receptionist into giving me an appointment. But that's okay, because it was a male receptionist.

There may be police lying in wait. But that's okay, he is very good at discarding the police, and everything else, for that matter.

And he needs the doctor to help him die slower.

It's why he's forced himself into existence for those few precious hours... before the ants come to pull him back.",2

My dad is in the hospital following emergency open-heart surgery, and my mom is in denial about how serious this is.  When my husband and I got the news, we dropped everything and flew across the country to be with them and help them. But even from his hospital bed, my dad dredges up ancient history, such as my husband’s personality flaws; my mom is chiming with vague criticisms about my personal defects, stuff like that. I know these situations can bring out the best or the worst in people... but this is far worse than I could have imagined.  Dealing with the medical crisis is stressful enough, and I know they are under a lot of strain, but I didn’t expect to be attacked.  Ugh.  

Needed to vent a bit and also looking for advice on getting through this, not only avoiding drinking, but avoiding blowing my stack or losing my composure — I need to be focused and competent.  What I want to do is crawl into a cave and hide.

I'm checking in just before I drift off for the night. On another thread, I posted a rather lengthy account of a particularly gruesome experience that I had in an underfunded and understaffed detox center. That was a doozy. So I'll try to keep this one brief. 

It took me a full two weeks to really flush all the noxious gases and fluids out of my system. Insomnia, sweats, anxiety attacks: all that fun stuff. Though I remained sober during that time, it was as though I was still held in alcohol's thrall, and there didn't seem to be any end in sight. 

But as a wise Beatle once said: all things must pass. And this week, at long last, I have finally started to feel myself returning to a state of relative normalcy. I can exercise again. I can binge read again. I'm still a bit too embarrassed to branch back out and reconnect with my friends, but that will come eventually: for the moment, I'm lavishing myself with tacos, afternoon naps, and snuggles with the catster. 

I had five months sober before I slipped up, and I now have three weeks sober. In a roundabout way, by the end of the year, I will have spent a solid 50% of that year in a state of stone sobriety -- which isn't all that bad, considering how the past decade went for me. But this time I know that there is no turning back. The sense of divine fucking relief that I experience whenever I wake up and find myself in total command of my senses is not something that I would trade away for a tallboy of PBR. 

In a weird way, today feels like day one. Finally, I am myself again. Perhaps *every* day should be treated like day one. I'm not sure. I'm kind of new to all this. In any case, there is not much at all in life that I am certain of, but I am certain that I will not drink with any of you yahoos today. 

Thank you all so very much for curating such an open-hearted and compassionate community. I'm off to have some weird-ass dreams about my teeth falling out for no apparent reason.

Cheers!",4

I've had patches of sobriety here and there -usually 30 days before a drink.   
After a month off of work with an underlying anxiety issues (during which time I did not drink at all) I got back to work, was doing well and then messed up.   
I had addressed the anxiety for the first time ever with therapy, medication and meditation and felt better in that aspect of my life than as far back as I can remember.  
Friday night I waited until 9pm to make my way to a birthday party 30-odd miles from my home, with the idea being that I could enjoy three or four drinks but no more because I would have to make my last train home. I was feeling very good.  
Four drinks later (probably more), I've taken up the offer to stay on someone's couch and we've started drinking heavily. Come Saturday morning, I'm drinking beer and wine before the pubs open, after which I drink until I can barely speak. I miss my therapist appointment and more shifts at work. I'm not surrounded by people who drink in this completely unhealthy way, it is only me who carries on like this.   
I've severely dented the self-respect I built while tackling my anxiety issues. I can't deny I had a really good time on the Friday night but the Saturday is mostly a blur and now I'm down and racked with regret.  
I feel like such a fool. It seems that my sobriety can be a very important thing to me for a short period of time and then I let the importance of it, and the consequences of not sticking with it, slip from my mind.   
I prefer to keep things short and sweet with posts, so apologies for such a rambling one.",4
2019-12-17 05:45:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ebuav4/in_need_of_support/,In need of support,"Hello Folks, I am a 26 year old male with a drinking problem. This is my story. 

  So, You know that feeling when somebody jumps out from around a corner at you? That short lived burst of tingling ? I woke up this morning with that feeling after getting wasted a third night in a row. Except this feeling wasn’t fleeing. It slowly intensified to the point where I couldn’t feel anything I had become so numb. I was starting to shake and having a hard time breathing. I debated whether to ask my step mom to drive me to an ER. I couldn’t find my phone so I couldn’t text or call anyone. There I was, curled up in bed shaking away having a legendary panic attack. 


     This sort of morning has become the risk of overindulging these days. I had never heard of a panic attack before having one in June 2018. The one this morning was quite terrible. Like a bad acid trip. 

    I don’t believe these physical sensations are actual withdrawals from alcohol. Since they seem to fade away once I calm down. 


So I should be good to stop. Things were pretty good when I was last sober. Which lasted 4 months. There were some things i could’ve dealt with better though. It ended up being a relief to start drinking again. 

 But here I am back to having panic attacks. I’m not normally anxious. If i had found my phone I would have likely called for an ambulance. I can’t do that to myself.

     So, Now I’ve got some choices. 

I believe that starting with a short term goal of one month is an appropriate prelude. I might go rent a cabin or air bnb in Hocking Hills, OH to sober up these first few days. Anything that helps right? 

 
Other things to consider 

AA Or not?  

I’ve got a good support system in my community and feel comfortable in meetings. I’m not sure it’s right for me in future recovery but I’ll definitely go to a few starting back out. 

   What about marijuana? 

I kind of feared using last year predicting it might make me anxious. But that doesn’t seem to be the case. I’ve had a some grateful experiences with it recently. For me not drinking is more important than being sober. Unless it starts giving me cravings or anxiety I am going 
to experiment with CBD oil and traditional MJ. 


Anyways, just thought I would say hello to anybody out there. It’s been a long time coming.",8
2019-12-17 05:38:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ebu8tn/book_movie_tuesday/,Book & Movie Tuesday,"Happy Tuesday! It’s once again time to share what we’re reading or watching or listening to. 

The holiday season is in full swing now and joy is in the air, or at least it is supposed to be. I have been thinking about this a lot over the past few days as I’ve seen people posting about their various coping strategies for a sober season. I’ve also seen more than a few posts about people who are feeling blah with either sobriety in general or sobriety at the holidays specifically. This is something that has been a particular challenge to me, too. Over the past 3 decades, even during the lengthy periods when I didn’t drink daily or very often, “drunk” became the definition of “joy” for me. Most days now as a sober person, including special occasions, I feel peaceful or happy even, but rarely would I describe the way I feel as joyous. It’s something I hope will change as my sober time goes on, but that I’m perfectly content to live with even if it does not. The rewards of sobriety greatly outweigh that one downside. 

There is one thing that works like a charm to make me feel joyful however, and that is reading or watching a good, silly comedy. I’ve been saving the Netflix standup specials for the holidays because I know they are good for a big hit of natural euphoria. 

There’s a show on right now that is funnier and more delightful to me than any other. I’m just going to admit this right here right now: I am a HUGE *Rick & Morty* fan. I only met *Rick & Morty* in early 2018 so I’m pleased to say it’s a show I’ve only ever seen sober. I am subscribed to the reddit sub and geek out on the memes and everything. I’m really looking forward to S4E5 this week. And I got so excited when Russel Brand talked about the show on his Insta feed recently. Brand is such a recovery guru in recent years that one forgets at times that he is also a comedian. That was a joyful moment for me when I realized Rusty Rockets was doing an encomium of sorts to my current favorite show. Wubba lubba dub dub!",14

2019-12-17 04:44:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ebtrvl/loss_of_respect/,Loss of Respect,"Had an interesting conversation with a colleague recently. We were talking about why we both were not going to an upcoming work party. My colleague said he didn't go drinking with work since a nasty night a few years back where one guy started ranting at everyone. 

 My colleague said he had lost respect for his person, who he was getting on well with beforehand. He said he got a half hearted apology from the drunk guy when they were back at work, but that the damage was done. They've hardly spoken since, and he has no interest in repairing that bridge.

 It felt a bit pointed at me as I have made an embarrassment of myself at work functions in the not so distant past.

  This might have just been paranoia, but it hit quite hard. I had a realisation washing over me and I realised this was the first time anyone had spelled it out so clearly. When you drink too much and cause a scene, people lose respect for you. 

 You have people telling you it's fine, it happens, no harm done. But really, you have damaged your reputation. The reason this hit home for me was because as I ruminated on it, certain things began to make more sense. People who I used to be friendly with at work but who now don't have time for me. Pitying looks and things like that. And it applied just as poignantly to my personal life as I have struggled to get respect in a lot of quarters and it adds up to people who know about my drinking problem.

  I haven't drunk a lot this year by most people's standards, I could probably count how many times. One benefit, perhaps the biggest, has been that I have gained quite a lot of self respect back. This has been a fight in itself but we are getting there. However, with other people as my colleague was basically saying, sometimes you can't get it back. I have to live with reminders of my behaviour on a daily basis.

  In the end, most people want to be respected. And it's a hard truth for me that when I drink, I can quickly lose any respect I had from people. 

 I know that in time it'll probably ease off, and I'm moving into a new role which will somewhat change who I see on a daily basis. So I need to remember that heavy drinkers do not get much respect from the more together people in society, and especially in a work situation you shouldn't expect much mercy.",24

Relationship problems, new job stress, etc (first post)","Long time lurker here. I've had periodic problems with the drink and recently realized that I was on that path again. For a little more that a week I've been trying (with mixed results) to go dry, to at least temporarily pump the brakes if nothing else. But stress factors worry me that I may feel compelled to crawl into a bottle, even though I know that'll only make things worse.

About 2 months ago I moved in with my girlfriend and late last week we realized that we're having issues. Sunday we had a long talk and it seemed like we had both found a positive path forward that would keep us together. Monday night, however, she came home from work and had made a 180. It seems more and more likely this is the end.

When I ended up finding it impossible to go to sleep, I had a few drinks of vodka. For what it's worth, I realized that it was only making me more upset and instead of doing what I would normally do (kill off the bottle) I put it away. I guess that's something. But I worry I'll be tempted to get blasted every night in the foreseeable future. And I don't want to go backwards, especially not now.

I guess I am writing this more for my benefit than anything. But I guess if anyone can offer thoughts, maybe words of encouragement, I would truly appreciate it. Thank you.",3

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!
 
Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. 

Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others. 

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol! 

This pledge is a statement of intent.

 Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. 
Give that person the right mindset! 

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

 What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. 

Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](r/stopdrinking) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

 What this isn’t:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I apologize for the funky post, I am doing this on my phone.

I have been thinking about this quote from ""The West Wing"" lately, you guys are my ""Joe"", thanks for helping me out of the hole. 
 
""This guy's walking down a street when he falls in a hole. The walls are so steep, he can't get out. A doctor passes by, and the guy shouts up, ""Hey you, can you help me out?"" The doctor writes a prescription, throws it down in the hole and moves on. Then a priest comes along, and the guy shouts up ""Father, I'm down in this hole, can you help me out?"" The priest writes out a prayer, throws it down in the hole and moves on. Then a friend walks by. ""Hey Joe, it's me, can you help me out?"" And the friend jumps in the hole. Our guy says, ""Are you stupid? Now we're both down here."" The friend says, ""Yeah, but I've been down here before, and I know the way out.""

Prior to that I was in therapy after a complete breakdown due to my alcohol use and left work on short-term disability for over a month. During that month I re-focused my efforts on taking care of all the things I had put off in all my years of drinking. I lost several pounds, felt healthier, LOOKED healthier, slept soundly at night, woke up early, and all around felt motivated to pursue my passions with vigor again. Unfortunately I made the mistake of thinking that I could go back to drinking in moderation. You've heard it before, one drink turns into two, two into three, repeat ad nauseam until you've continued to feel nothing but shame and disappointment in your inability to control your habits. My body reset itself and began to rely on alcohol again; I effectively drank the soul out of my body just when it had started to become comfortable inside me again. 30 days of sobriety stopped short due to me thinking I had some sort control over this dark affliction.

I couldn't tell you what has triggered me to reset in the past 24 hours since I last drank but I can tell you what triggered it the first time; my fiance. Due to my drinking habits I became a husk of what she fell in love with in the first place. While I had a high-tolerance and could operate quite well under the influence in most of my day-to-day life (or so I thought at the time), I was forgetting full conversations with her and broke several promises that I had promised to keep. In short, alcohol was getting between me and the love of my life and it had done everything in its power to beat her to the finish line. In one final heated argument prior to my initial sobriety stint she packed her bags to stay with a friend and left me to ruminate on what it was I really wanted out of life. At that moment I knew I really needed help. I contacted my place of employment and reached out to some amazing people in HR that helped guide me towards recovery programs they offered (for this I'm eternally grateful in my company for). I then contacted all of my closest friends and relatives to admit to them that I had a problem. Knowing that I had some accountability at this crucial time was a big motivator in keeping me going during the early days of my cravings. Once I had stopped engaging with my support group I got a little too cocky and felt like I finally had control enough over the habit enough to partake in moderation. Nope. The downward spiral was exacerbated by my own guilt and shame at my inability to control the abuse.

All said I'm not going to kid myself like last time when I hit 30 days. I have a very real problem and I need to be honest that it's going to be hard even when today has been easy. I just have to remind myself of how I feel in this moment of clarity when the urge to partake again becomes too great. Should I fail again I pray that I have the courage to come back and read this post as a gentle reminder that I'm not infallible. I'm suffering from a disease and while my struggles are very real, they are not insurmountable. Reading posts in this subreddit has shown me what is possible when you get into the right mindset and engage with like-minded individuals in a positive support system. In the end I have forgiven myself for going back to my old ways and I'll give myself permission to fail again as the pressure I put on myself for succumbing this last time only made things worse. Lesson learned.

My last drink was yesterday, and tomorrow I will have left this post up for my future self in case he needs it. 

But today? 

Well, today I did not drink with you.",13

I haven’t gone more than 42 days without drinking in prolly the last 10 years and I’m only 30. This is a great opportunity to turn things around while I’m young and avoid some real bad messed up crap that alcohol can do. We are hosting some family starting this weekend for the holidays. No ones a big drinker but they will want to go to the liquor store and grab some things. We are having our second child soon and my wife is excited about trying a few new cocktails once she is able to drink again. She never abuses alcohol and she wishes I drank in moderation and I do too obviously. The thought of having it around makes me a little sick to my stomach thinking about having a freaking hangover around Christmas time and with our new baby coming soon I don’t want to be dealing with this crap and having alcohol around the house. I also don’t want to make a scene and be that guy that people can’t drink around. How do you all handle these situations?,6

The hope's was to become sober, but I'm finding so much more than that. Little bits at a time I'm finding myself again. The road so far deffinitly hasnt been easy, and the road ahead look terrifying, yet I'm happy to be walking it. For the first time in a long time I'm generally happy about my sobriety.

I was worried that I would lose those around myself while I become sober. That fear turned out to be true. Sobriety, except for those close to me, has been lonely at least for know. But those I lost I've realized where holding me back and keeping me in the cycle of alcoholism that gripped me over the years. As I continue to explore my new hobbies I know I'll find new friends who benefit me in the long run. Until then I am finding peace in the solitude that I've found myself in.

The hard part with alcoholism as our poison is so ingrained in the world around us. I pass by several liquar establishments walking from the grocery store on the way home. From advertisement to those around us talking about how much they drank last night. It's a hard path we have chosen to walk. But with resolve and determination we can do this. 

I wish you all the best on your journeys.

Recently messed up and fell off the wagon (have a post about it).  When I fell off the wagon I did something smart, or at least smart as far as I'm concerned.  I let anyone in my life and support group know.  I called, texted, whatever.  I wanted to wake up the next morning to consequences, I'm not going to hide drinking, that is just asking for another pattern of trouble, or a months long bender.  I wanted my fall to be a 1 day fall and I kept it that way once mid-fall.  

Here's what pisses me off about the few people in my life who don't get it (and won't be part of my support system in this regard again).

Falling off the wagon is as much an opportunity as a failure.  In fact, it is more of an opportunity than a failure.  The fail is pretty well contained (minus drinking / driving / murdering / etc).  If nobody got hurt but your own self esteem, this is an opportunity.  To reevaluate.  To learn.  Why did I fall off this time?  Is it a new reason? (it was) GOOD!!!  I've now identified a liability to my sobriety which I will not repeat again.  

I'll go so far as to say this as well.  I did a year sober ending about a year or so ago.  And I did that year in a shitty relationship handling bullshit I shouldn't have had to, just because I felt this was my path to 'sobriety'.  Recently I have done as much as 120 days before my fall this weekend.  I did those days caring for me, and me alone.  And I was far more 'sober' than I ever was during that year of 'sobriety'.  Did I have more time under my belt?  Nope.  Did I have more experience and was I attacking the problem at a better angle?  I think so.  And I fucked up again.  But today at day 1 again, I am more sober than I've ever been.  

Falling off the wagon is for sure a cause for concern.  It's a cause to raise back up all of what may have been complacent feelings towards problems.  It's a reason to have higher resolve and determination.  

I'm not advocating falling off the wagon.  This isn't to make one night out every blue moon an excuseable thing.  As most of us know, that first night out always sucks.  It takes a few nights or weeks out to regain that 'ahhh' feeling from boozing, aka the servicing of a physical and mental addiction.  There is nothing fun about drinking for the first time in a long time.  It's always underwhelming and usually super destructive as you get hammered fast as hell and can barely realize it until you've said and done shit you'll regret.  

I'm not drinking today.  Tomorrow I'll figure out tomorrow.  Maybe I lost track of how incredibly important this mindset is.  Had I said words of affirmation that day I fell off, had I said 'I will not drink today', maybe I'd be at 122 days without a damaged ego.  

It's every fucking day now forever.  I stopped saying it.  I will now be saying it every day.  IWNDWYT.

Am I overreacting?,"My significant other works for a very small company (literally four employees). The boss and his wife decided to set up a holiday party but didn't say where. They said after dinner there'd be a surprise event and SO were invited. Well, I went ahead and changed my work schedule (I typically close where I work but traded to open at six am, also meaning I'll have to take a lyft into work since there are no buses that early).

&#x200B;

Today we find out the event is a Wine and Paint bar. Painting sounds fun. My partner drinks and on rare occasions we'll go to a bar where I know a lot of the staff, I socialize, she has a drink or two and we promptly leave. We only do this if I am feeling up to it. This feels forced upon me. I also found out that guy who works there does't drink and one of the guests recently had a baby. No one was informed of this plan. The whole company is aware I am in recovery, it's no secret and I am find with that. 

&#x200B;

I realize that I do not work for this company so I don't know if I am angrier than I should be, but this feels so thoughtless and belittling to what I have been fighting through this past year. Even if my partner had been asked or if the event plans had been reveled before I changed my work schedule I would have been happier. I am not inclined to sit in a room full of wine moms playing, ""How many glasses of wine until we lose motor control?""

&#x200B;

I have been fighting hard for my life this past year and have heard some stupid comments, ""when are you going to start drinking again?"", ""How do you have fun?"", ""Were you really an alcoholic?"", and ""Just a beer won't hurt!"". I brush that shit off and get rid of people in my life who are damaging. I can't get rid of my partner's boss! I don't expect my needs to be catered to, but this feels like a real fuck you.",4

2019-12-16 22:58:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ebqipk/wounded_inner_child_musings/,Wounded inner child (musings),"First off, thanks to stopdrinking for creating space where I can just put my thoughts out here. What a huge help 

I wasn't able to even start thinking about quitting drinking until I did a lot of work towards healing the wounded inner child within me.  I didn't love myself, I didn't value myself, and I blamed myself for all the bad things that had happened in my life.  I was so full of shame and self-loathing, and drinking was just a way for me to abuse myself more & treat myself poorly, the way I had been treated.  

When I first started therapy, my counselor knew that I abused alcohol, but never pushed for me to get sober. She was an incredibly gifted counselor who could sense when to push and when to let things be - she knew that asking me to give up my drug of choice was not going to work, and may even cause me to give up on therapy. 

A few years later and my life is in a totally different place in many ways.  I no longer abuse drugs and alcohol, I have a job that I love that I'm super grateful to have. 

That being said, things aren't perfect: I don't have many close friends & more and more I feel the distance between my old friends who haven't done work on themselves, and myself, who is always looking to move forward (perhaps to a fault). Many of my old friends are dead, and I find myself feeling too 'weird' to be a 'normie', yet striving towards a 'normal' life to the point that I feel outside of my old friends, many of whom are stuck just like I was. 

I've started therapy again and I know that I will soon be going back to the place within myself where some old wounds still live.  With that in mind, I wish to offer these words to the wounded children within all of us - I need this for myself but offer it to anyone who is struggling with finding peace within themselves. It was freaky to me how I was able to direct kindness within myself and realize that I deserved better for myself than I had been giving  (because I didn't know how).
Kind words to your inner self: 
- You are ok 
- It is going to be OK 
- I am here to take care of you 
- I won't let anything bad happen to you 
- You can rest now, I am in charge now 
- Thank you for taking on all the burdens of adulthood, but it's time for you to rest, relax and just be.  
- I will protect you 
- I won't let anyone hurt you 
- I am always here 
- You are safe
-You are loved 


These are all things that I learned in therapy, and they helped me realize that I was basically drowning myself (and my child self) in alcohol.  Weirdly, these sayings also helped me break up with a boyfriend who kept giving me the silent treatment because I realized that the silence was way too much like the abuse I'd suffered as a child, and I knew i had to protect my Little One inside myself from further mistreatment. 

I'm writing this because I'm trying to make sense of a lot that's been going on lately, needed to remind myself what nurturing looks like & thought I'd share in case anyone else could benefit. 

It's been a weird couple weeks & I just needed to write this out for myself.  :)",22

I’m still frustrated by my anxiety/negative thinking, especially concerning self inflicted health damage.

My life is on the line with this one as I can not function at the moment. Which leads to me not being able to work, which ultimately means I won’t be able to afford to live. 

Here’s the health things concerning me:

Possible neuropathy. (This seems to be very hard to diagnose, so I can’t get a quick result back to clear my mind. So this lives in my brain all day long.)

Hands turning red and blotchy in heat or cold. Doctor said not to worry about it, but I want to know what it is. 

Possible brain damage. I’m getting better with this one, as I’ve read that your brain can repair itself. 

Possible permanent lung damage. This one is from smoking which I did the last three years for some reason, and now my breathing feels off. 

I also feel I’ve gotten very ugly. I haven’t been looking after myself this year, so I have broken capillaries and a blotchy face which I obsess over. I can’t stand to look in a mirror. Also I’ve neglected my teeth and will likely need fillings. 

Has anybody else been completely non-functioning due to anxiety in recovery?

As I thought without booze I’d be motivated and positive. But I’m worse than I ever was before.

It’s pretty easy for me to understand why I get extremely drunk when I’m out at a bar or hanging out with friends doing something focused around drinking, I have an addiction and that’s fine. 

What really confuses me is why I REPEATEDLY fall into the trap of thinking that a few beers after work while playing video games or watching a movie is an acceptable idea. 

Getting alcohol is a huge chore for me since I don’t drive and I have to either bus or walk a decent distance to go get it. I also don’t want to spend the money or particularly enjoy being drunk at all outside of the ten minute window where I’m definitely buzzed but not yet blacked out. 

And of course there’s dealing with the inevitable fallout of my sloppy or angry text messages or ruined relationships in the morning.

With all of that being said, every ounce of my being tells me to avoid the liquor store or aisle and yet I feel like I’m being pulled there once a week or so by an invisible force.

Sorry for the long spiel but with all of that being said I guess my point it, how do I convince myself when walking by the liquor store that going in is simply not worth the risk when there’s a 1/99 chance of a slightly more enjoyable night and a 99/100 chance of severe personal and relationship fallout in the morning?",12

Found it while I was in my ""finally accepted my problem but stubborn to start sobriety"" phase. To give a little background on my drinking habbits, I was drinking roughly 3/4 of a 750ml bottle of rum, vodka or whiskey every single day of the week for close to 4 years. Didn't matter if I was at work, just woke up, picking up family from the airport.. I always had some Gatorade or water bottle completely full of liquor. Over this period of drinking I developed slight heart problems, lost a couple jobs, embarrassed myself in front of family, and showed no true signs of changing.

Why I decided to change? I wanted my family addiction to die with me. My fiancée is a completely responsible drinker that barely even drinks socially, never gets drunk or even close to a blackout. I was always able to hold my liquor, but my memory was almost nonexistent. ""Remember?"" Became a way too common question. Anyway, I spent 3 days tapering myself off with just 1 beer per day and then went cold turkey the day before Thanksgiving! 

Accomplishment #1
Thanksgiving - that's a given, but I felt like it matter
That weekend I went to a NFL game and tailgated with a bunch of family hours before the game. They had ALL of my favorite alcohol. Multiple Hennessy Pure White bottles were being passed around, different kinds of Patron, you get the picture. Everyone offered and I declined every time even though my fiancée was also drinking at the time. On top of this it was a rivalry game and extremely cold, perfect day to drink! But I got through it cold and sober watching my team get stomped for three hours in the freezing cold.

Accomplishment #2
Fast forward one week to the following weekend after the NFL game. My fiancée and her friends had planned a small Christmas party between them and their significant others. All of her friends are fairly heavy drinkers, at least on the weekends. Usually when we hang out everyone is drinking to get drunk. So we are over at her friends house and start playing drinking games. The first game they decide to play is a game that involves 5-6 different flavors of soju. Now, next to Hennessy, soju is my absolute favorite thing to drink and I constantly brag about it to people that haven't tried. So I sit there for 45 minutes watching all of them play this game, drinking one of my favorites right in front of me. Still, I didn't drink.

I know these are small accomplishments but this has been a major life adjustment that I'm taking one day at a time. The holidays is a tough time to quit but this place has been an awesome support zone.",10

I've been a long time alcoholic, like one drinking a 5th a vodka a day alcoholic. Rotating liquor stores, drinking in the office calm the shakes...all that shit...
Last October I had to drive myself to the emergency room due horrible pain in my mid back with a 102 degree fever. The pain was caused by an inflamed lung however I was given a laundry list of things wrong with me including border line Steatohepatitis. 
The meds given to me during my 3 day stay helped with the withdrawals and I left determined to change my life around. I changed my diet and started exercising again. I avoided pretty much all social gatherings that involved drinking. It felt incredible being able to go to bed without at a few drinks and being given compliments for my weight loss.

This lasted 54 days.

Last Sunday I had a very cute Tinder match that wanting to meet up Monday at a local bar. I thought that I should treat myself for the progress and having a few drinks wouldn't hurt. I never had a date without a little pre-game to calm the nerves (drinking is a social activity right?) so I got a pint of vodka. We met, we had drinks and then she invited me to her place where we drank some more before getting down to business. 

I was pretty trashed as a drove home.

My brother and his girlfriend were home drinking when I got there. My brother noticing I was tipsy so he offered a toast to celebrate the successful date. 

We ended up killing the bottle.

My alarm woke me up Tuesday and I was pretty hungover (losing 20 lbs made me a lightweight) so I called out from work. The best way to clear the hangover that I knew was to having a few drinks to level you out so I bought another bottle.

From this point everything was a blur until around Friday afternoon. 

I went through 3 fifths a vodka and was working on a handle when it was over. My brother had to intervene with my father and yank the bottle from my hands. My father cried, then I cried. I realized what was happening and sobbed with him. After a few hours of sobering up I then noticed how my body was covered in bruises, I stubbed my toe really bad and left a bloody mess on my bathroom floor. My pants were also on the floor soaking wet, the Pixel 4 I just recently bought wouldn't turn on. I didn't even call out of work that day. 
The withdrawals was harsh, I only drank pedialyte until Saturday and was not able to get any sleep until Sunday afternoon. Somehow I acquired a UTI during this so I had to deal with pissing blood on top of everything.
I was lucky to keep my job as my boss was understanding and was able to be productive today. My piss is normal again.
After not drinking for the longest period in my adult life alcohol teased me and nearly ruined me.

2019-12-16 20:59:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ebp20n/my_first_aa_meeting_at_five_years_sober/,My first AA meeting at five years sober,"Five years and two months ago I made a decision to change my life forever. I quit drinking. This subreddit has been my primary outlet for recovery. In fact, I’m not really a fan of the word recovery, and I have been very hesitant to identify as an addict. I prefer not to be defined by something I can’t do. There’s no other area in my life where I do that. (examplex if this - I’m not a non-German speaker; I’m an English speaker. I’m not an un-man, I’m a woman.) Also, I plan and attend a lot of meetings in my professional life, and going to a meeting on my time off sounded.... not fun. For that reason, I had never set foot in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting...until yesterday.

I decided to go to a meeting with a friend of mine who is more recently sober than me. I have been hearing through various sober friends that one of the best ways to stay sober is to help other people with their sobriety, and I had listened to a podcast recently by a friend of mine where she talked about her multi-decade relationship with AA. Having spent a lot of time here and having read every addiction memoir and seen TV and movies, I had a pretty good idea what I was getting into. 

It was simultaneously exactly how I expected to be and nothing like I thought it would be. I will say this: it felt good to be in a room full of people who are struggling and have struggled and have been tormented by this terrible affliction. The meeting leader said something that really struck me: she said “hell, I wouldn’t even have drank with most of you in this room but I’m happy to be sharing this space with you now.” And it was pretty profound- people of all ages and walks of life were there, but I knew they all knew what it feels like to wake up in the morning with a head full of dread and a mouthful of regret. Man am I glad to not have to taste that anymore.

In some ways I wish I gone earlier but in others I think it’s fine that I didn’t. And at this stage of my life and development, I get it. I understand why the program works, because I could see how easy it would be to be seduced by the slow consistency of repetitive chants, and regular times, and fellowship. I mean, wasn’t that what we were all seeking at one point, when we started drinking? The familiar consistency of a drink at the bar and the patter that will follow, and the fellowship. It’s familiar, it’s ritual. We humans love that shit. We crave it. So just like we sought out the familiarity of bars and bottles, it’s comforting to know that there are meetings all over the place, that will be the same, just like I know that I will be the same if I have one glass of wine. I will want another and another and I want more and I’ll feel unstoppable, and wretched. I understand that outcome.

I used that method to process emotions, to unleash stress, to move through the world and be social, to feel at ease. It’s much scarier to do the unfamiliar with an untested outcome. But for the last five years, I asked a different question:  what if I did it differently this time? What if I chose another way? Would the outcome be better? Is different better? Yes. And yes. I have never woken up in the morning and said, “gosh I’m bummed I didn’t drink last night.” Never, not once.

What worked for me? I took away the option. The choice is to have a tea or go to sleep or write or watch TV but the choice was not to have a drink or not have a drink or go to the bar or not go to the bar. 

I’m five years into this journey staying in a sober place of clarity and everything in my life has gotten better, that is, everything that I can control. The things that I can’t control are just that: things I can’t control. My father has a terrible illness. My depression still haunts me but I do the best I can to face those issues and just show the world that there is great happiness and purpose in addition to sadness. I cannot control many things but I can control the way that I react to them and one of the best ways that I can control my reactions is to choose not to make alcohol a choice.  

I’m not sure if I’ll go back to a meeting anytime soon but I probably will some Sunday. I will be a good sober friend and I now totally understand what it means when I hi to somebody else who identifies as an alcoholic. And I guess I’m one too.

Whether you are brand new to this sub or just checking it out, thank you for making the commitment to be a better you and for those of you who frequent The Rooms,  it’s really pretty remarkable to see a conspiracy of something that’s trying to make people better in the world in a world that sometimes can seem like it’s full of conspiracies to make people suffer. 

I’m sure as hell not going to drink with you today.",44

An old friend died last week. My wife had known her for over 20 years. She was 50 years young.

My last rehab counselor always liked to say ""alcohol is a progressive and fatal disease."" We know of the long term health risks and ultimate consequences from drinking. It probably scares us to wonder what will happen if we keep going. That said, seeing the end stage of this disease first hand made such a greater impact on me than simply knowing what can happen. She had been in the hospital since before Thanksgiving and was experiencing liver failure. Over a matter of days she went from being bed ridden but able to communicate verbally to losing her ability to communicate other than moaning and crying out in pain. After this phase she became more or less unresponsive and remained in a sleep-like state for the last week of her life.

This has given me a lot of compassion for those currently drinking and facing health consequences. A slow and painful end while leaving your family with immense grief is not something I want others to experience.

Moderation does not work. If you’re here, you probably drink to feel the buzz, you drink to get drunk. One beer or one cocktail will not give you the sought after buzz but most likely lead you to a bender. Benders have consequences and none are pretty. Why bother?

Just thought I'd leave you a reminder of something I've learned (again), that I'm either doing the things to support an underlying healthier lifestyle/ mindset or not, and that that underlying decision makes then strongly impacts my will to drink or not drink. My challenge can be remembering what those things are, but then I find I am naturally inclined to help myself as you are too.

I always find that I seem constitutionally inclined to go with my impulse as regards drinking. This used to make me think I was doomed as I read about these heroic feats of willpower where people 'tried' not to drink against he impulse and succeeded/ failed. Where my power lies personally is in finding little ways to set my day up better, habit stacking, coming on here and Actually Participating, (regardless of whether I feel I deserve to or not), and just generally nurturing my motivation levels. Circumventing the urge.

What I find in my case is this truth... Do or do not. There is no try. Dont beat yourself up whichever path you currently find yourself on, just keep looking for answers.

I (25M) have been a pretty problematic drinker for the last 5 or so years. I drink primarily to feel numb and I do it every single day of the week. I black out pretty much every weekend and get decently drunk every weeknight. All of this stems from self medication for Anxiety, Depression, and OCD. The blackouts have gotten extra bad ever since I was prescribed Lexapro and Klonopin for my mental illnesses. To anyone who doesn't know; these medications are no bueno with alcohol and can lead to some truly disastrous results. In spite of these obvious problems, I am uncannily good at holding it together. I'm employed, my girlfriend is oblivious that I'm an alcoholic, and my friends get wasted with me on weekends so they don't have a clue either. However this all changed last weekend.

My breaking point last weekend (Friday night) led me to open my eyes and realize that this is a path I do not want to follow any further. It's just not me and I'm almost glad this shit show happened to wake me the fuck up.

I was at a concert venue with friends including my girlfriend and I was already black out drunk when I got there. My good friend F and his girlfriend L were already there when we got there. So this whole show was kind of like a belated birthday celebration for L. Therefore, I had brought a b-day card letting her know I had bought her and J concert tickets for a band they both love as well as my Girlfriend and I. L was very appreciative, however, in my blackout state, I kept forgetting that I had already told L about her gift! So apparently I kept telling her excitedly that I had gotten her these tickets every few minutes. I guess after like the fifth time she was understandably like ""okay dude whatever"" So my idiot drunk ass thought that was the first time I was telling her and she didn't like the gift. So in the middle of this public dive bar, I yell: ""DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH THOSE TICKETS COST? YOU CAN GO FUCK YOURSELF"" To give you perspective, L is this petite quiet young woman who is basically the last person that deserves some drunk asshole yelling at her. I then stumbled out of the bar and sat on the curb for about 10 minutes. 

I wasn't done though, apparently I stormed back in and saw L and J in a conversation with a random dude. I heard this random dude say it was his birthday, so apparently I storm in their circle and start angrily yelling ""NO IT'S L'S BIRTHDAY"" like some white knight wanker with a middle school crush, until I finally storm out of the bar for good and leave with my girlfriend and other friend who at that point are just trying to get me home safely.

So anyway, I woke up the next day and had to have my girlfriend explain to me how much of a shit-head I was. Then I cried for an hour because I just couldn't believe I had done something so NOT ME. I felt disgusting, I had always thought I was a good person, but when you're a git like that it's harder to tell yourself that. I immediately apologized to everyone involved (Especially L) and everyone seemed to brush it off like ""eh we knew you were blackout mate"", but this has honestly shaken me to the core. To be a different person completely is such an unnerving feeling and I never want to feel that again.

So I won't. I haven't had a drink since Friday which is nothing, but it's something for me. I just wanted to tell my story in the hopes someone can learn from it before they make a fool out of themselves, hurt others, or find that their friends aren't so forgiving. I hope it makes you cringe as it did when I wrote it.",6

Thought this day would never come. I’ve been wanting to stop drinking for years.  Over the last month I’ve been terrible. Drinking more and more straight up vodka and whisky, taking full swigs without a care.  

Last night put me over the edge. Before my wife and I went to a Christmas party, she had to run an errand. During that short 45 minutes, I think I had 3 good swigs of pure vodka.  The once at the party I had quite a few gin and vodka drinks.  When I got home I snuck in 3-4 more swigs before going to bed. 

I had a mental breakdown and told my wife for the first time how bad I was. How much I sneak in.  I cried all night uncontrollably. 

Called the UHC line and got an appointment set up for detox.  I’m sick of this.",140

Ive lost some weight, been hitting the gym, repainted a guest room and bathroom, spent a ton of time at the dog park with my puppy and have been studying like mad for a technical cert I hope to test on before the end of the year. 

The isolation has been hard but I'm finding that my goals this time are changing.  After I finish this cert, I want to finish painting the inside of my house and buy a rental property.    Somehow quitting this time gave me different goals than last time and I'm digging it. 

I'll check in again in 3 months for now.  But this community and recovery elevator/happy hour and the gym have been huge helps. 

To everyone else trying, it may take a few times.  Keep at it.  I do miss drinking now and then but when I think about all my new goals, I realize I can't do them if I'm partying all the time.    What I do now will pay off later is a mantra im trying to keep.

When I was younger I did some dumb stuff that could’ve got me in trouble or possibly hurt but was fortunate enough that nothing like that ever really happened now at this age I am drinking just as much as I did when I was that young and every time I drink I swear I’m only gonna have like three beers but then I end up drinking way too much. 
I never stick to my limits and it is gotten very bad recently I have become violent to my boyfriend while I am blacked out. I have gotten so drunk that I couldn’t stand up and the cops came and checked on me I’ve gotten so drunk then I got kicked out of venues I have gotten so drunk that I lost my car keys and someone else ended up finding them and stole my car and I haven’t had a car now for about A month and a half now. I have said horrible nasty things to my boyfriend who does nothing but love me tried to attack him and I’m usually blacked out and I don’t even remember it. I cause huge fights with my boyfriend and friends in public cause I was drunk. I once got so drunk on my poor boyfriends birthday that I couldn’t stand up and I was in a bathing suit and I started changing into regular clothes butt naked right in front of everyone at this little get together in front of our friends and my friends husbands. I was mortified when I found out the next day. After last night when I got physical with my boyfriend for no reason for the second time... I just decided today that I have to admit that I need to quit drinking. I always find excuses and I try to negotiate with myself and say what I will only drink this many or if I have one glass of wine that won’t hurt but it never ends up really at those limits. And it scares me because a lot of my friends and my boyfriend and even a lot of family love to drink at any occasion or when we go out on the weekends or on vacations, and it sucks to me that I’m not gonna be able to enjoy drinking with everyone else and it scares me because I am afraid that nothing is going to be fun anymore if I’m not drinking. My boyfriend always used to say that he wanted to marry and now he says that he wouldn’t want to propose to someone that treats him the way I do and that if I never get this issue under control then we won’t get married and he is my best friend and I absolutely adore him and I know he’s at his wits end and if I lost the love of my life because I loved alcohol more I will never be able to forgive myself. I am just looking for kind words or just to feel like I’m not alone. I am so tired of waking up feeling like shit and feeling so embarrassed and devastated over what I did the night before. I i’ve been doing really good for weeks and I was in a really good place and I was generally happy for the first time in a while and I even had a few occasions where I did drink and I really stuck to my limits and didn’t get too drunk and I was so proud of myself and then I just drank til I couldn’t anymore again last night and hurt my love of my life again and he had to leave for a business trip this morning and now I’m home all alone for the whole week and I just need some sort of support, I just moved to Texas too and don’t know anyone in this state really at all so I can’t even have a friend here or anything and I’m just so miserable today. I just feel alone and honestly sorry for myself but I know it’s all my own fault. Please just send me some support or stories or something. I don’t want to feel alone.",2

Craig, I’m not sure if I have quite reached the same highs as those times while sober, but then again I also haven’t reached the kind of lows that eventually came with taking those ‘lovely substances’— bashed up in police stations, dehumanised in rehabs, near-death experiences, suicidal thoughts, routine overdoses, reduced motivation, broken bones, being ripped off, liking Charles Bukowski, social and physical anhedonia, herd mentality, dead friends, fucked up relationships, abscesses, car accidents, psychosis, reading The Hobbit, malnutrition, creative impotence, epic time-wasting, singing flat (still working on that), talking shit (still working on that too), life-threatening diseases, and not ringing my mother on her birthday.

2019-12-16 15:56:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ebl1ej/medical_issues_in_sobriety/,Medical issues in sobriety,"I hesitated posting this for fear it might discourage people to quit (the addictive brain will look for \*any\* excuse), but I decided to go ahead since it's honest and I'd like to hear others thoughts. I suspect some of my medical issues might be connected to quitting drinking, but I could be 100% wrong. Spoiler alert: I don't regret quitting. I only regret not quitting sooner and younger.

Overall, my body has felt wonderful since quitting almost 13 months ago. I have loads more energy and waking up without a hangover never loses its novelty. I had some mental issues with overwhelming emotions at around month 4, but my therapy has helped, as well as journaling, reading addiction memoirs, listening to podcasts, taking Lexapro, and visiting here. My borderline high blood pressure went back down to normal pretty quickly and I managed to maintain my weight even though I've been replacing booze with cookies, cake and ice cream a little too much.

In September I experienced a mild triggering episode with an estranged family member where I believe I disassociated for the first time in my sober/adult life. I just completely emotionally shut down (something I used to use alcohol to do) for a few days and although I mentally made it through the turmoil, I came down with shingles 1.5 weeks later. This virus in my body laid dormant for 45 years until my brain had its ""tap-out"" and body revolted! Luckily, it wasn't a bad case of shingles, but it was uncomfortable.

Out of nowhere on Thanksgiving almost one year exactly to the date I quit drinking, I experienced a gallbladder attack, ended up in the ED, and had my gallbladder removed several days later. As far as I know this issue does not run in my family. I suspect my gallbladder failed because I've been eating so much fatty foods and also because I no longer throw up weekly like I did when I was drinking. Maybe it got overused when it was drinking, then clogged up with bile because I stopped drinking poison??? (I threw up weekly or multiple times a week the last few years of my drinking.)

It could just be my age (48) or that drinking had been masking medical problems I didn't notice, but I feel like these two big issues hitting me after quitting might be linked. I know it's silly, but it feels unfair and like I'm being punished! Can anyone else here relate or offer any insight? Thanks for reading. IWNDWYT.",2

Again....and I feel so bad.,"Hi everyone, I've been lurking for a long time but today I decided to write because I need some support since I'm having very dark thoughts and my anxiety is skyrocketing.
Today it's my fourth ""day one"" this year.
The longer time I've been sober it's been for 4 months this year.
I quit for the first time years ago and I've been sober for 7 years straight at the beginning.
But in the last 5 years I've been drinking again.
It's never been like it was before.
It never happens often, but when it happens obviously I have no control over it and I end up wasted and pathetic.
I'm also affected with ocdp, and this disorder by one side and paradoxically is what it takes me from drinking like before because it makes me very stricted towards rules (and not drinking is a rule for me), but on the other side it's what causes me pathological anxiety, panic attacks, depression and a lot of other terrible symptoms that eventually make me crave alcohol to relieve all this unbearable pressure, like a self medication.
It happens every 3 or 4 months lately and the dynamic is always the same.
I start telling myself that I deserve to loosen up for once, like everybody else, that It's ok doing it because it never happens on regular basis now, but the stranger thing is that this happens always when I actually feel excited and well, when I'm really enjoying the day and It's like if I'm rewarding myself somehow.
It doesn't happens because I'm tempted, I have many bottles of wine at home and it even never comes to my mind to touch them, I basically barely notice them! It doesn't happens because I'm with someone who's drinking or because I'm in a social environment where drinking is common like a bar, a dinner or a party.
It happens in the middle of the day when I'm actually feeling finally well and relaxed after a long time.
I start telling me all those bullshit and I'm very much persuasive!
And in the end I do it, even if I know the toll it takes on my mental  health not just the day after, but for longer since alcohol changes chemical balance in the brain and mine is already more than unbalanced itself.
Apparently, being perfectly aware of how bad  this is going to be it doesn't take me from doing it. I can't understand why the craving always just wins!
Today I feel very bad, I feel I'm such a failure, a bad person, I feel guilty, ashamed, frustrated, anxiety is out of control and obviously now I wish it never happened and I'm sure I'll stay away from booze but I'm terrified because I know that at some point in the next few months those thoughts will come back again and I'll end up drinking again.
It's a recurring nightmare.
What could I do to change this? I recently started therapy but I didn't bring up this matter yet. 
Maybe it's time to do so, I think my therapist could help.
I was also thinking about AA, but I'm in a foreign country and I don't speak the language too well yet... Moreover I'm partially skeptical about AA in general for personal reasons.
Is this something that happens to someone else too? How do you find a way to overcome the craving when it hits you?",4

It wasn't a typical hole in the wall type Chinese place, it was a real fancy style lounge.  I walked in to order take out, and in order to do so, you had to place your order at the bar.  I placed my order and proceeded to walk back to the front to wait for my order to come out.  While sitting there, I thought to myself, man, this would be a nice place to come chill everyday during lunch.  It wasn't packed, it was quiet, it was peaceful with lots of water features and things of that nature... Calm lighting, etc... But at the same time, I looked around and saw people sitting at the bar, alone, drinking cocktails and thinking to myself, fuck that... I can't believe I used to be like that.

What a lose-lose that situation would be! 

Keeping this in mind makes it easier to face the next hours of the day. So if I do today what I did yesterday, and do tomorrow what I did today, I only ever have to stay sober for 24 hours. And that makes the stress of these next few hours pretty manageable.",3

I’ve abstained from drinking alcohol since the beginning of September and don’t miss it at all. It’s actually been quite liberating to feel comfortable in social situations without an alcoholic beverage in my hand at all times. 

He completed an inpatient and outpatient rehab program and struggles to stay sober for more than a few weeks at a time. When he drinks he tells me I’m bad for his recovery and that I don’t support him. This is really painful for me to hear because besides staying sober I also attend meetings with him when he invites me, went to therapy, attended SMART meetings on my own, and attended his outpatient family day at rehab. I would like to be a supportive partner. I do get bummed when he relapses, but have recently figured out how to better manage my emotions when he does relapse. 

Anyone have any other recommendations for how to react when he says that I’m not supportive or bad for his recovery when he drinks? When he’s sober he tells me that I am supportive and that he only says that stuff when he’s drunk, but there must be some truth to it, right? What else can I do to support him? I’m doing my best to take a step back and not nag him to attend meetings etc. It’s a fine balance.",3

2019-12-16 11:39:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ebhh1k/i_guess_its_over/,I guess it’s over!,"Hi all. 

I’m on my second “real” stretch of sobriety here.  I say “real” because these past two tries have been the first time I’ve taken it seriously, really wanted it, and (this time) have understood that I  really have to be done with alcohol.  Done. Finito. The end. No more causal weekend flings, no more one night stands.....alcohol is the poison I must stay away from for the rest of my life, or face some bad consequences.

With that being said, I had the day off yesterday, and they just opened a dispensary within walking distance from my apartment. I’ve never had an addictive relationship with weed, I was always very “take it or leave it”. So I decided to try some edibles. “Why not?” The dangerous part is that I convinced myself that I deserved it since I’ve been doing so well.

I popped one, and was looking forward to that sweet release that I hadn’t experienced for so long. I couldn’t wait to just be happy, and worry free, and maybe even lightheaded, the way my old friend wine used to make me feel! 

Well, I got high all right, but I didn’t enjoy it. Sobriety has been so good for me that I felt “out of my own control”, is the only way I can think of to describe it. I didn’t do anything crazy - I didn’t even leave the house. I just didn’t like not being 100% in control over my mind and emotions. I was counting down the time until the feeling went away. 

I hope this allowed here, because while it’s not directly alcohol related, the lesson of the situation applies to alcohol as well. The days of my mind and body being altered by something are over. The fun is over. It will never be fun or relaxing again - but that’s ok, because that also means that it will never be overwhelmingly bad or out of control again, unless I choose to let it back in to my life again. And for today?? That’s not happening! 

Thanks for letting me ramble.",3
2019-12-16 11:24:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ebh9le/acts_of_kindness_aok_monday_acknowledgement/,Acts of Kindness (AoK) Monday: Acknowledgement,"Hi everyone!

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK which have touched us this past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about secondhand or through the media. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

This week’s AoK is from a [deli owner in San Antonio Texas who is answering every letter written to Santa by kids in his town.](https://www.insider.com/santa-letters-get-response-from-deli-owner-aleem-chaudhry-2019-12) As a small business owner, I doubt that he has a colossal amount of spare time on his hands at any time of year, but so far he’s taken in upon himself to write over 400 letters.

This one resonates with me not so much because of keeping the magic of Christmas alive, but because, as a kid, it makes a difference to be heard and acknowledged. 

Reading this piece reminded me of something that I hadn’t thought of in *years*. When I was nine or ten I wrote a letter to the then President George H. W. Bush about, I can’t even remember, the destruction of the rain forest? Something along those lines. And I got a personalized letter back from a staffer with an 8x10 “signed” black and white photo of the president.

As an adult, that’s not something that would make a huge impact, but as a kid it gave me a sense that I was heard and acknowledged as a person. I felt important. So I guess this week’s AoK is both the tireless deli owner and the senior President Bush’s staff member who took the time to write back some little kid.

Anyway, that’s me for this week. How’s everyone else doing, any AoK that you’d like to share?",10

2019-12-16 10:47:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ebgsbg/first_date_tonight/,First date tonight!,"So a side effect of sobriety for me is getting back out there! I haven’t been on a date in 3.5+ years. Drinking ruined all my relationships and kept me company enough that I spent the last three  and a half years alone. I feared what would happen if I started another relationship. Ive been sober a large chunk of the last three years, and done a ton of therapy. I feel ready to start dating. I am 30, and have been alone since I was 26. But nonetheless, I caught myself contemplating drinking tonight. 

I started scheming what I would drink, how much I would potentially have, and all that. But then I felt that familiar “danger zone” feeling. I stopped the fantasy and switched to the brutal reality thoughts instead. I would drink 1-2 at the restaurant. Then I’d cut the date off when I uncomfortably needed more but couldn’t drink more there because 1) I don’t want to drive the hour+ home on more than that 2) fear of doing something I don’t want to do tonight. 3) what it does to my personality.(I am not drunk me. Drunk me is impulsive , overtly excited, and boisterous) 

I can’t drink tonight because tomorrow I could end up back in the grip of an old addiction. One I put to bed 69 days ago. If I drink tonight, there will be no day 70. And there might be a multi day bender right around the corner that could cost me everything. 

So, I will not drink with you TONIGHT!",13
2019-12-16 10:45:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ebgr1d/losing_the_love_of_my_life_to_booze_and_video/,Losing the love of my life to booze and video games.,"I've been drinking heavily since I started, something like 10 years ago. I smoked, I drank, I snorted, but mostly, and steadily, and desperately, I drank. I drank while working nights in restaurants and bars. I drank the night away after the shift, trying to wind down. I drank the afternoons after working day shifts in restaurants. I drank on my days off, cause why not, and I drank after school, cause that's what you do. When you're addicted, that is. I quit most other drugs, quit cocaine, quit MDMA, but I kept drinking. I never addressed it.

Maybe four or five years ago, I started gaming a lot. Dota 2, Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Diablo 2, Path of Exile. That last one has a fitting name. I figured I'd rather be gaming than imbibing god-knows-what harmful chemical my friends would have the brilliant idea of ordering. I figured it was any better. I thought it was better for me to isolate myself, game until the wee hours of the morning, and to down a 12-pack simultaneously, than it was to go out. I made myself believe that. And then I met her. I was fucked.

My ex-wife moved in with me very quickly. We were madly in love, and she was staying with her parents when we met, so we naturally spent a lot of time at my place, drinking beer, wine, listening to music, making love. We went out a lot. We were always up for a sesh at the bar. She nearly flunked her Uni semester cause of the wild fucking weeks we were having. My roommate and I were parting ways in September anyways, and so it made perfect sense than R. and I would find a nice cosy Villeray apartment for the 2 of us, even though our friends were warning us not to move too fast. I was intending on going back to school, to study computer science. But I kept gaming, and I kept drinking, alone, or not. At some point, she realised what she had gotten herself into. She'd go to sleep cause of morning obligations : school, work, sport. You know, real life. I stayed up. Almost every night. Gaming. Sometimes I'd tell myself I'd take it easy and I wouldn't drink, or drink just a bit. I'd still end up going to bed past 2 or 3 am. I could smoke a gram and a half of weed, thinking ""hey at least I'm not drinking"". Such is the mind of an addict. I ended up dropping CS a couple weeks into the semester. It has been a grim pattern in my life to drop stuff before completion. I ended up quitting my job that winter, and I spent the next six months just wallowing in my own shit, gaming, drinking and eating fast food. This was only the first of a couple bouts of me trying to get into something, then quitting abruptly, without telling her or anyone beforehand. I'd tell her with bloody hands ""Hey, I quit my job"" or ""Hey, I dropped out of school"". She hated not having any idea of what the fuck was going on with me.

She saw the empty cases. She smelled it on my breath. She felt it on my skin. At this point I knew my limits well enough that I wasn't completely disfunctional hungover every morning. But I'd be late for work, at least half the time. I'd botch my school assignments. I'd order takeaway. She'd be the sunshine of my life getting ready for her day being excited for what was to come, telling me about her classes, her dreams, her ambitions, and I'd llie there, a disheveled half-hungover asshole. I'd be that cynical snarky know-it-all who doesn't do shit but complain. For two and a half years.

I stopped seeing my friends. My mind was being completely consumed by the holy trinity of work, relationship and substance/game abuse. I'd let them go through rough patches, barely caring. I'd let them spend months abroad without a message. I'd go for months without a ring. My wife was going through some shit on her own, issues with body image and food, and she had denounced her teenage abuser to the police, so her stress and anxiety levels were pretty high. I tried to help her cope by listening, making dinner, watching tv shows, etc. I thought I was doing a good job, turns out I was doing too much of the bare minimum. She needed excitement, she needed culture. She needed to share interests with me, to go out, to see the world, to laugh, to dance, to cry. I didn't catch on. I was so invested in my own little virtual worlds I didn't understand when she told me she needed me to take less care of her and more of myself. I didn't know what that meant. I thought I was happy doing the things I was doing. I knew it pained her to see me abuse alcohol and investing so much time and energy in video games. I thought things would pass. I thought a way would find me. I thought we'd be fine.

At one point, in an attempt to connect with me, she agreed to install Steam on her computer. We added each other as friends, and she downloaded the Sims and Dota 2. Now the problem with being friends with your wife on steam is she can see just how many hours you've sank in the past few weeks on various games. It shows on your profile, and it weirdly feels like a badge of ""real gamer"" of sorts. She didn't fathom how fucking far gone I was, I don't think. ""Eighty-five hours in the past few weeks"", she said. She didn't comment on it much. She laughed nervously and we moved on to something else, like a dying couple does. For the record, I have over 5 000 hours on that game, and over a thousand on Path of Exile. That's over 4 or 5 years, not much more. It's like I've had a full time job gaming and gaining nothing but fucking points. I had given my old steam account to my youngest brother Z., a couple years prior. I'd have to ask him how many more hours played I had on various games, namely Counter-Strike 1.6. It can't be under the thousands. We never did end up playing Dota 2 together. I don't blame her. She had seen me raging on the microphone because complete strangers didn't play the way I wanted. She knew how hard and involved the game was. She wasn't interested in it. She was just grasping at straws, trying to find a way to connect with me.

I am now forty pounds over what I was when we met. I wasn't the most jacked dude you'd ever seen, but at 185-190 pounds and 6 feet, I was relatively lean. I remember having some amount of muscle definition, around the abs and arms and such. Now I have a real goddamn beer gut, fat drooping from where my pecs are supposed to be. I had to change almost all of my clothes. She tried and tried so hard not to fat-shame me, but how the fuck are you supposed to love the fat fucking mess I was becoming while she was hustling at school, at work and at the gym, looking better and better and getting closer to her goals every day? Needless to say, our sex life took a huge hit. In the last year we probably had one or two sexual encounters a month, if not less. I'm not saying I'd fuck me, either. And when we did have sex, my stamina was a fraction of what it was 2 years prior.

Now she tried to give me an ultimatum a couple weeks ago. She said she couldn't bear living with my sorry ass anymore, if I didn't do something about it. I told her I'd curb my drinking, which I sort of did. I didn't change jack about my day-to-day habits, though. Most days, I'd still woke up, have a coffee watching some useless shit about video games on my laptop, gamed a while, ate late cause I was doing ""intermittent fasting"" - which by the way doesn't count if you don't at least try to eat healthily when you do eat, gamed some more, etc. And then some nights I'd kiss her sweet dreams and relapse and drink a case of beer, trying to hide it the best I could. But if she didn't know in her rational brain, she knew in her heart that things weren't working out. I wasn't making the necessary changes to become a husband you can think about the future with, to succeed in my own life, at school, at work. I didn't get it.

Fast forward to last Monday, when she finally couldn't bear the weight of this relationship with me. She left. And instantly, I knew. I knew I had fucked up so much for so long. But it took a couple days to accept it. I was angry, I was furious.I told her I'd be staying in the apartment for as long as I needed to find a new place, and that she wasn't welcome, and that it wasn't my problem. I told her I didn't care if my attitude hurt her : ""Tough luck"", I said.

Jesus fuck, dude.

We spoke yesterday, on the phone. For two hours, a painful, slow, emotive conversation. One of those you never want to have.One of those you wish you could have avoided by being better than you were. I told her I'd change. I told her I'd do anything to be with her. You know, the usual. It feels like such a cliché but it's fucking real. I've never loved a woman like I love her. I knew in my heart I wanted her to have my babies, one day. I was set and I fucked it up so bad by not caring, not listening. Fuck.

I brought her flowers today, at the Uni, with a hand-written note, saying that I'm sorry and that I'm going to get help. That I would give anything for another chance at us. I believe it, though I'm not sure that she does. After I had made her late for class I left, and I called for help. I have an appointment on Monday morning with a social worker, to evaluate my needs. I won't let the pain of her being gone prevent this valuable lesson to help me. I wish with all my heart that she finds her way to me, somehow. I'll be working hard, regardless.

I can't live this way. Not anymore.

Now, where to start....

EDIT : Wow, the reception here helps A LOT. I tend to feel really bad about myself on mornings before I go to work or at nights after I get home and wind down. Reading you guys' kind words help immensely. Thank you, kind strangers.",54

""Playing the tape forward"" is only getting me as far as ""pain subsides"" (more realistically, ""I don't care that I'm in pain""), due to the fact that I'm having a hard time at the moment in holding onto my give-a-shits about anything past not feeling this particular brand of pain.

Don't at all feel like sitting through a full meeting (screams and sobbing tend to be disruptive). I do have a sober buddy at work that I'm gonna have a little mini-meeting with before I head out. 

Past that, I'm hoping my neighbor is home when I get there so I can ask him to hold onto the bottle. If he's not, I'm probably going to err on the side of dumping the bottle, wifely wrath be damned.

I have drank since I was of legal age and up until now (42) I have drank wine for years.  Last Christmas I lost my daughter unexpectedly and during the aftermath of that (and after a brief binge as a crutch) I somehow found the strength to cut out alcohol completely.  That 3 months felt great (health wise) and the mental clarity and sharpness that came along with it was like nothing else.

Anyway throughout the year I have started drinking again, not large amounts, but its back.  Saying that it has never really 'clicked' with me again in the way it did before.  One thing is for sure though, it really does make me feel like absolute crap, waking up at 5 in the morning with a banging headache after a disturbed sleep, feeling sick the next day etc. 

So this is it for me, I am stopping for good, not even waiting for Christmas to pass first.  To be honest I didn't find it that hard to stop for the 3 months earlier in the year and I have already proven the health benefits to myself.  

I hope you all have a good Christmas, this time of year can be a big challenge for many as far as alcohol is concerned.  And while my Christmas will never be the same again, they will be alcohol free.  IWNDWYT, Good luck x",38

3.  Went to a psychologist who was a good fit, who I could develop a rapport with, who treated my drinking as a symptom, and who treats me holistically with a goal of general self-improvement 
4.  Continue going to the psychologist even though it’s hard work and sucks sometimes 
5. Told a friend about my drinking who would accept my story without judgement or shaming
6.  Talked to a friend who has an alcoholic partner, heard what it’s like to be on that end, and continue to be a support system for that friend which makes my experience feel useful 
7.  Gave up my personal credit card so that all purchases can be seen by my partner 
8.  Journal on a regular basis so that I can see thought patterns, like when I have cravings after work but then later in the day I’m so happy that I’m sober (I use the Day One app)
9.  Take it day-by-day and sometimes hour-by-hour, don’t speculate or worry too much about the future, and give myself smaller goals that I can reach (see the book, The Void, for the importance of incremental goals)


Things I remind myself of:

1.  Feelings aren’t permanent.
2.  Humans are incredibly resilient and want to survive (see The Void again).
3.  I’ve promised to be honest with myself and my partner.
4.  Being sober is an opportunity to be proud about 
a very important accomplishment. 
5.  My brain is pretty great, and I enjoy having it firing on all 4 cylinders.",8

They are already 500 days without drinking, I go for the year and a half and this month of December I am anxious, health problems, neurologist and dentist, economic problems (paying taxes on a vehicle), I have not answered two jobs and as it does not stop raining I can not work on a farm that brought me some money. So it's a bad month, almost depressing, without money, with some discomfort of health and anxiety to top, also bad weather makes it difficult to go out hiking, I do not like catching colds so before being irrational I establish routines. I clean my desk, I have the house clean and tidy, papers separated by their destination: work, doctors, taxes. I see documentaries and look for information on the subject that interests me more than I have seen and I drink a lot of coffee, and almost everything decaffeinated to avoid scares.

I know you guys do!  When I started having problems with alcohol it was always my goal not to drink during the work week. Monday-Thursday I would say to myself -I will not drink! I could NEVER  do it. Sometimes I wouldn’t drink on Monday - if it was a very very good week I might be able to not drink on Tuesday - I could never make it through Wednesday! Toward the end I just gave up and drank nightly! I couldn’t get 1-3 days and now I’m at 1000- WHAT‼️‼️‼️‼️ Were there really only two choices ? Be miserable drinking or being miserable NOT drinking ? If those were the only two choices - I promise you I would still be drinking. I wanted a third choice a return to myself as I was before I ever started drinking. I have that! Complete freedom - a child like wonder about life. It is bliss.  It has been work - the absolutely hardest thing I have ever accomplished - but also the work that has brought me the greatest joy. Two books - This Naked Mind - The 30 Day Sobriety Solution - it was therapy! In early days popping on to this site gave me a moment of pause to think and know others were fighting this as well!!

I decided I needed to put this out there. This is a text message from my wife sent at 530am the morning I showed up completely trashed from my company Christmas party. 

I never thought I had a problem with alcohol, even though alcoholism runs in my family. Alcohol killed my mom at 47. You would think I'd know to be careful, but it's easy to have that feeling slip away.

I feel pathetic, and extremely embarrassed. I can't believe I brought myself home in this state with a wife and 8 month old baby.

That's the last straw for me. Alcohol will cause me to lose everything, and that thought scares the life out of me.

It took about three months for my energy levels to even out and I’m really glad they did! The afternoons were hardest. I found it incredibly hard to get through a work day and spent a lot of time in bed and eating sweets (sometimes simultaneously). I also experienced some pretty dramatic shifts in moods during that time. 
My social life has done a 180 and while I still mourn for the way things used to be (I was a social drinker and incredibly social), I’ve found my new routine to be calmer and the alone time has been helpful for the mountains of reflection that has been happening. Rethinking the past while trying to not dwell and focusing  on my future is an ongoing challenge. 
My journey isn’t linear. There’s still lows but they seem more productive than a hangover induced one. I may beat myself up for not going on this journey sooner but I am incredibly grateful to be on it today.
I’ve got the day off work today due to some snow on the ground. I’m hoping to be productive. I know that I won’t be spending it as an excuse to hang out at the bar.

Should I stop before it becomes a problem?,"I have been lurking here for months wondering if I have a drinking problem and would be very grateful to hear your thoughts.

I am nervous to even ask here and do so with respect. I understand many people here are fighting a harder battle than me and are sometimes re-building their lives from rock bottom.

I'm not at rock bottom at all but I am starting to recognise that the addictive nature of alcohol is having more and more power over me. It's tricky because I don't drink every day, and when I do I don't get into any trouble. I can drink a load and am not really a sloppy drunk. Usually, I get quite jolly, a little verbose, then a little sleepy.

But when I do drink (1-2 times a week) lately I have been noticing I can't just stop at a few. I adore the feeling of being tipsy. So I might finish 2 bottles of wine, smoke a load of cigarettes, eat some crappy food and stay up way too late. I am starting to see I am drinking much more than those around me, whether in professional or social situations or by myself at home.  I am finding myself ordering 2 drinks at the bar and covertly knocking back the first quickly to then join others with my second drink. I have been filling up a drink bottle with vodka and soda for an evening walk with my dog.

Then due to my ongoing chronic illness, the next day I can barely move from exhaustion. And then the depression kicks in. I've missed countless days at work plus too many fun weekend days because I 'accidentally' got too drunk the night before.

What scares me is that I am watching my behaviour, and I am fully convinced I need to moderate my drinking but seem to be unable to. I am in the electronic dance scene and have been dabbling with recreational drugs on the odd occasion for more than 20 years. I have never had an issue with moderation, excess or addiction before.

Surely if I am worried that I have a problem, then I have a problem. I've never vocalised this to anyone before, hoping this is a good first step.",12

I can actually say that I haven’t had a drink in over a month. That such a crazy concept to me, because not too long ago, I was getting shitfaced from the AM to the PM. 

God... if October me could see myself now, he probably wouldn’t believe it. 

In all honesty I’m really glad to say that I’ve been over a month sober, however I would like to talk about what day 30 was like for me. Because day 30 wasn’t all sunshine, there were some dark clouds I had to endure.

The days leading up to me hitting my month of sobriety I was very excited and anxious. I was just so ready to be able to puff my chest out and say, “I’m a month sober!”, and best believe I DID.

I felt like a super hero, I felt on top of the world. But in actuality, I wasn’t. At most I was a warrior recovered from a wound during battle & little did I know that there were MANY other unhealed wounds that I didn’t even notice before. That is because I was too busy focusing on the biggest one, and if I’m not careful at dealing with these other wounds I might reopen the big one.

So to say less, day 30 was scary, I worried that once I hit day 30 I would care less about being sober, or that I may get cocky and think I’m okay to drink again. 

BUT I AM NOT & I NEVER WILL BE OKAY TO DRINK AGAIN. It’s something I need to inscribe in my mind, and I’m very thankful for my fears, because my fear keeps me humble. It’s one of the things that keeps me sober.

I am genuinely scared to fall back in to drinking again, and I genuinely do not want to drink, and that’s a new feeling for me, a feeling that I like.",13

Sometimes it was when I was stressed from work or relationships, but other times it felt really fucking random and unpredictable.

I've been sober now for 45 days -- with the help of disulfiram -- and I'm feeling really positive about things. I had a friend who drinks regularly come visit for the weekend. He bought himself an 8-pack of beer on Friday night; I drove him to the liquor store and upon arriving he asked me if I was coming in. Because I'm on disulfiram I knew I couldn't drink, so the decision was easy. 

I just want to say for those struggling to stay sober, disulfiram may help in your recovery process. I find the most powerful part is the psychology of using it: I know I can't drink, so the temptation is almost 100% gone. On Friday and Saturdays, because I know I can't drink I just get on with things. I've recently taken up golfing again, as well as picked up 2 other fun hobbies.

Waking up and seeing the “3 month” notification on my sober app felt really great. 

With therapy and a lot of reflection, I am starting to unpack the reasons why I started to drink so much and how it got out of hand. Sometimes I think that in the future I will be able to moderate well enough to have a drink or two with dinner, but I also have moments where I know I want to binge drink. 

I had told myself I would not drink until January 1. December 25 will be day 101, and at this time I still do not plan on drinking anytime soon.

Going to bed sober after a really tough week at work and emotionally. I know that drinking would only make this worse.

I have crippling amounts of health anxiety over possible things like neuropathy, which is taking up all my brain power and keeping me in one big panic attack. I even think I may be feeling phantom symptoms from all the anxiety. 

Once I have rehab I wouldn't be able to live in the real world if I’m still like this... as I wouldn’t be able to hold down a job to support myself. 

I’m seeing a psychologist. Attending groups at rehab. Going to AA. And trying to change my negative thinking.

I have a question about explaining to other people that you don’t drink and how some of you may have handled it. I haven’t had occasion yet… But I know I probably will ultimately.

Pretty well everyone outside of the people that live in my home with me don’t know that I had an alcohol problem. I think a few of my closest friends may have had their suspicions, but…

Here’s the question. Like a lot of people on this sub, no doubt… I am still quite embarrassed by the fact that I became addicted to an addictive substance (I know… It doesn’t make any sense when I say it like that, does it?). 

If I go out and don’t drink, I know that ultimately someone is going to ask me why not, and I’m really not comfortable with the presumption that I don’t drink because I’m a recovering alcoholic. Maybe someday I will be OK with that… But right now, I’m just not.

What can I say in answer to the probing questions? I suppose that I could say that it is due to a health condition, which isn’t really a lie. I am a T2 diabetic, and really should not be drinking alcohol as it does tend to mess with blood sugars. 

Is there anyone else in the same situation? Who doesn’t care to be branded with the “alcoholic” label, either by coming right out and saying it or not saying anything and allowing people to presume it?",4

Today is my 1st birthday!","There’s a difference between saying, “I’m going to quit X, Y or Z” to get someone/people off of your back and actually *wanting* to quit for yourself. I’ve dabbled in just about every illicit substance known to man but, by far, the hardest to quit is somehow legal - alcohol. Let me back up a bit, I’ve got a story to share...

The only reason I joined Reddit is because I found this sub via Google. I wanted help to quit drinking daily but didn’t want to go to AA or rehab; I knew I wanted to do things differently. I wanted to find some sort of online counseling but knew I needed to hear from others who are struggling. I didn’t think I would find this sub too useful, hence the username.

I wasn’t sure I would quit drinking but I really wanted to! I didn’t give up! So, so so many times did I WANT to give up! I failed so many times! No matter how many times I messed up, I still wanted to gain sobriety.

One year ago from today, I managed to ‘accidentally’ quit drinking. I had cut my drinking back to only weekend nights then, midweek, traveled to my sister’s for Christmas. She doesn’t drink nor do I drink around her so I figured I’d wait until after the holiday for my next drink - NYE, right?

I realized that I had made it 10 days without a drink which was he longest streak in at least 5-years! I was feeling better (no hangovers or anxiety) so why not keep the streak alive? I’ll just keep going ***one day at a time*** because it hasn’t been so tough that way. I learned that mantra from all of you! I may drink next week, year or maybe in a decade (who knows?) but I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY!

So... today is 365 days without alcohol and it’s my 38th birthday!

tl;dr/key point: If you want to quit, don’t stop trying! I joined Reddit for this sub. Please note my # of days of sobriety. Subtract 365 days and that’s how long I tried to quit drinking before I succeeded. It may take time but you can do it!",23

Plus uncontrollable anxiety ticks.,"I am a 20 year old male and every time I consume alcohol to the level where I am noticeably drunk (around 7 beers) I get majorily depressed over the course of the entire week. Admittedly, I am never the happiest guy even when sober. However I am not going to say I’m depressed because I’ve never been to a doctor about it though depression does run in my family. 
My depression seems to stem from how I act socially either when drunk or sober, as well as the unlucky nature of my love life. Exercise helps a lot, but I’m not able to constantly exercise with work and school. I’m wondering if I should seek help from a professional and is alcohol the cause of my depression or does it just aid and increasingly perpetuate an already existing depression? 

Additionally, I appear to always get uncontrollable ticks, such as twitches, cringing, blurring out words, ect, when reflecting on my social interactions the night before. I know this is a direct result of drinking alcohol because they are so prevalent the days after drinking. This sounds pathetic, but I’m starting to get really concerned with this.",3

They knew I drank once a week, so how could one night really hold a person back that much? I knew I could do these things, but getting wasted on Friday night and being hungover all day Saturday and foggy Sunday, and regretful and anxiety-ridden Monday and Tuesday kept me from being the attention-to-detail creative I know I am.

I apologize for my Sunday morning blunder. Thank you again u/SaintHomer.
 
I have known for quite sometime that I was an alcoholic. Throughout my ""I should really cut down"" period, the universe would hit me on the head with books, movies, and TV shows. Leo McGarry, played by the talented John Spencer, from ""The West Wing"" was one of those times the universe said ""YO! If you are thinking about slowing down, maybe it is time to stop.""

""I'm an alcoholic, I don't have one drink. I don't understand people who have one drink. I don't understand people who leave half a glass of wine on the table. I don't understand people who say they've had enough. How can you have enough of feeling like this? How can you not want to feel like this longer? My brain works differently.""

I thought when I got home tonight I might be tempted to give in to “celebrate my doing so well with sobriety” by having a birthday glass of wine.  I know...

Over the last year and a half of starting to deal with my own problematic drinking, I instigated a lot of talks on this topic with her, from my own perspective of being worried about my health, self-medicating, wanting to stop drinking. I loaned her my copy of This Naked Mind.

When she told me she was checking herself into and in-patient program she cried and I was so happy for her, told her how strong she was. I was worried she’d bail on the program early, to be honest.

Today she was home for a one day visit and posted a video on fb for her friends. She looks so happy and vibrant and speaks clearly and it’s like seeing the beautiful person I care for out from under the massive blanket that was suffocating her.

I cried so hard, tears of joy. I never thought I’d see her like this. I am SO proud of anyone who is brave enough to ask for help, no matter what it looks like. You give people like me hope that one day I too can fully come out from under my blanket and shiiiiiine.",8

So I guess I am thankful for this experience with the Weed. While the negative effects were probably 5% of the hell that drinking was and would have been, it was a valuable reminder.

Later that night we played board games, and I still felt so alone.  They were having so much more fun than I was, I was so bored and desperately wanted to drink with them.  The night may have gone differently if I'd told them about my problem, but I'm not ready to out myself to their family yet.  The siblings wouldn't get it, and I don't want to be the subject of judgment and gossip.


I told my partner how sad and lonely I felt, how bored I've been feeling of life in general since quitting, and he said ""It's okay if you just have a couple drinks.  Just have one or two like I do.""  That made me feel even worse.  He doesn't get it either.

Which I appreciated. But sometimes talking about not drinking just feels... exhausting. Idk. It’s like this whole new identity I’m trying to keep up with. An identity, I don’t much like at all sometimes. I can’t shake how boring i feel sometimes.... the whole date I just kinda didn’t want to be there if alcohol was involved I would have felt more compelled. 

And today. I work in the restaurant industry and was getting trained to bartend with some other coworkers. We made over 10+ cocktails. Free for us to drink. 3 months ago I would have been stoked to drink it all. But I didn’t. Not even a sample to see what things tasted like. There was only 3 of us getting trained. So there was a bit of a disconnect and a bit of awkwardness as to why I wasn’t drinking. I’ve shared with some people at my job that I quit drinking but not everyone. I didn’t mind that so much as just... wanting a drink really badly. I miss getting buzzed. 

Anyways. I’m proud that I didn’t drink but sometimes, I’m just so unhappy about this disconnect with people and just that “escape” that alcohol can provide sometimes. Ah.

Start a new job tomorrow,"For the majority of these ten months, nothing has significantly changed. I certainly feel better day to day. But i'm still fat, still not very ambitious toward my goals, and pretty much have been lolligagging through life. I finally start a new job tomorrow. a pretty decent one. I'm nervous, excited, scared, a whole lot of different emotions, which is good. There were times back when I drank and smoked weed where I felt absolutely nothing. Completely apathetic. I've been depressed before where I've felt down in the dumps, I'm sure most people have been there. But when I noticed that I didn't really feel anything anymore, I knew something had to change. i was tired of feeling stuck. Even though there hasn't been significant changes in my life, I have been taking the necessary baby steps towards bettering myself. And I feel as if I'm just about to catch my stride and start making bigger leaps and bounds towards a better me. Its not gonna be easy. But we don't want easy. Easy never gets you anywhere. I feel as if i'm about to close the shittiest 5 year chapter of my life, finally. I hope everyone is taking the necessary baby steps to a better you so you can blast off in 2020 with laser focus and drive to become the person you are meant to be. IWNDWYT.",9

Being back on the wagon, I’ve started running again. And over the last couple of weeks, I’ve started *slowly* to build up the distance of my weekly long run. Now I’m reminiscing about back when (about a decade ago) I’d finish an 18 mile run, shower, limp up the hill to my local pizza stop, and have a couple slices and a beer. I miss that.

But back then, that’d be the only beer I’d drink for the week. And some weeks, I’d just skip it altogether for froyo or tacos. The beer was nice and all, but it didn’t matter that much.

Thinking about drinking generally stinks. But this annoying fantasy is better than most I've had lately. I’m not fantasizing about drinking a bottle of wine a night, or a six pack of 9% alcohol beer. I’m not even fantasizing about having one drink to take the edge off, or having a drink at dinner. I’m fantasizing about the time in my life when I’d maybe have 3 drinks a month.

That I can deal with.  What I really miss isn't the beer after a long run, it is when I *didn’t care* about drinking. I’ve ruined a couple sober streaks over the last 6 or 7 years by convincing myself I can have the “one beer” after a run or a hike (I went back to old habits within the month.) And during those streaks, I told myself that I was just taking a break. But through some painful trial and error, I realize the only way I can get to “not caring about drinking” is by not drinking, full stop. I can deal with that

Anyways, nine weeks sober today feels pretty damn good. And the pizza today tasted great without a beer.",27

I’ve struggled back and forth for a long long time with alcohol. I can go a week without drinking, allow myself to “treat myself” and go into a week long bender. I am not capable of having one drink and stopping. 

The drinking causes the  anxiety and I drink to mask my anxiety. Its a vicious cycle.  I’ve wanted to quit for a really long time but even thinking about it right now, when I want it the most, it doesn’t seem possible. Why does my brain automatically go to all of the fun I’ll miss out on? All the holiday parties coming up? All the happy hour plans I have with people? The new 4 pack of wine glasses I bought this week that won’t get used?  Everything feels like a trigger.

I am in my late 20s and a have a lot of friends that live in NYC.

Last night was the first time I went to nyc since getting sober. Only one of my friends knew, we went to dinner just the two of us, then met the group at our friends comedy show. After I went with everyone to the bar, they bought pickle back shots and my friend just gave me the juice to hers to feel included. I sat at the bar drinking seltzer with a lime. At about 11:30 I started noticing peoples behavior changing, they were about to go to another bar to dance. I knew it was my time to leave. I head up home, got a great night sleep, woke up for 9 am yoga. This might sound so lame but having a fun night out sober seemed foreign. I am so proud of myself and thanks to everyone on this page for sharing your stories. 

Looking forward to more nights out with friends. For me, it’s all about learning your boundaries and knowing when it’s time to go home. I also think having a set event (e.g watching a comedy show) was so much more fun and made it easier then just sitting at a bar for hours.",4

It was my anniversary and I finally told my wife that I have a problem and I’m going to quit. 


The biggest benefit has been my mental game. I used to not believe people when they said being sober made them feel strong. I wrote it off as a generic nothing statement that was what they thought they should say. I stand corrected, because I feel strong. 


When I see people race to get their drink at a holiday party, when I hear people comment on how they cant handle their week without a glass of wine in the evening, when people say they don’t trust someone doesn’t drink, and when I say no to a drink when it’s offered: I feel strong. 
I’m proud of the fact that I don’t drink anymore. It is the single best decision I have ever made in my entire life. I know myself better that I ever did, I’m a better husband and knowing I’ll never give my daughter the same alcohol fuelled trauma that my mum gave me is better than any drink. I feel strong and I feel proud. 


Alcohol is an addictive drug. You’re made to feel bad or like there is something wrong with you if you choose not to partake. Here’s the deal, not doing drugs doesn’t need any justification, just know you’ll live a happier, healthier and more fulfilling life without, just as you do without cocaine.  


Happy Sunday beautiful people. I will not drink with you ever again.",73

I was cooking breakfast this morning and listening to a John Goodman interview and he started talking about his alcoholism . He described it in three stages. Stage one is the “life of the party” stage. Stage two is when it quits being fun but we still drink because it helps us cope with all the unresolved shit we carry around. Stage three is “The Invisible Man” stage where we disappear and any semblance of who we really are is replaced by our addiction. That hit me like a ton of bricks because it perfectly summed up my destructive path and who I was 14 months ago. The successful, hard working, dreamer had disappeared. The husband and doting father? Gone. The son and friend who always had your back? Poof! He was gone too.  I was completely invisible except for my addiction.

I don’t drink, but I’ve worked in, or frequented every bar in town. I either text them in advance, or tell them before you get here ‘Diet Coke, keep em coming’ because I’m embarrassed.” At this point, I should say, this is a woman that has one or two drinks, and calls it a night, once a week, if that. 

“[Toke] why would you be embarrassed about that?”

“[Date] Because, I thought if you knew I was an alcoholic, you’d think I was a loser.”

You guys, I kid you not, she sent her drink back and asked for a diet coke. 

“Thats not something to be embarrassed over. I’m proud of you,” she said.

I just had to learn 'how' to drink...without the consequences...without vomit, car wrecks, and blackouts.  We moved up to Corona...it was the 'in' beer in the early 80's.  Add a few shots of peppermint schnapps for good measure.  Then we had to make our own beer...a barley smell permeating the house as I cooked the ingredients.    Cases of fermenting bottled beers under the bed and in the basement.  This is normal, right?  I am a respected craftsman...not an alcoholic.  

Then was the martini stage...like Hawkeye Pierce on MASH reruns we obsessively watched, we decided we should be drinking martinis.  So we bought martini glasses, shakers, stirrers, olives, and fancy vodkas...what great christmas gift ideas for the new martini drinker...ha!  Mixing a pitcher with just the right amount of vermouth...olives stuffed with jalapenos...so classy. Let's have another.

Then there was the rum stage...sipping rums...I would buy 15 bottles of different 'fine' rums to 'taste test"" them...on a quest to  find the best rum..on cruises in the Caribbean we would tour rum distilleries, and seek out rare rums not available at home.  Soooo sophisticated.

As I look back, I think these were all attempts to put an acceptable face on my alcoholism...in the end, it had degenerated to slamming cheap vodka in secret...all the ritual and acceptability stripped away.  A lifetime of self deception...

So happy to be sober...",64

I'm hoping I can keep up the trend after I'm healthy but my biggest concerns and wondering if others have experienced this...
1) Getting towards the evening I still have a strong need to look ahead to the night and what it'll feel like to get drunk. I struggle here.
2) What do you do to replace drinking? I feel like idle hands are my biggest problem right now. I'm trying to obsess on video games but feel like that's not the best idea. How do you guys stay distracted so you don't think about drinking? Thanks!",4

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I don't feel the urge to drink on a daily basis and can even go weeks without drinking, but when I do drink, I'll drink excessively and for days.  I don't feel like I have a dependency on alcohol but I definitely have an issue with escapism and bad coping mechanisms. The fact is that alcohol is the most accessable and cheapest form of getting fucked up and it's much easier to pick up the bottle than to actually deal with your emotions. 

I also feel like I convinced myself that I have a drinking problem, therefore I do. You believe that you have a drinking problem, so when you drink you feel extra bad about it which makes you drink more and you almost turn yourself into an alcohol because you believe that you must be. You start acting accordingly.

Does this make sense to anybody else?",14

I left a relationship with a very sweet, supportive guy but who also worked as a brewer at a local brewery (bad combo for this whole sobriety thing lol), quit vaping, moved with my son to a new state for my new job, got a big chunk of windfall money, celebrated my first alcohol free Thanksgiving, celebrated my 33rd birthday without a drop of booze, and, today, to commemorate all of these wonderfully positive changes, adopted a dog.

Right now, after a long evening of getting our new family dog settled into his crate for the night, it's 1am, and I'm watching Netflix and drinking hot cocoa, listening to my dog snore happily in the DIY crate I spent hours building. There's presents under our Christmas tree, all bills for the month are paid, the fridge is full of nourishing food, and there's still plenty of money left in the account. Tomorrow, I'm signing and mailing off our Christmas cards to friends and family, making Christmas cookies with my boy, and we'll be spending the rest of the day bonding with our dog.

I'm hoping that this dog, this new home, this city, my son, none of them will ever see me with a beer or glass of wine in my hand. With all of this forward momentum and huge wins since I've cut booze out of my life, I don't see any reason to even consider it.

I set a reminder once a year on my calendar to listen to it again to remind myself of what my voice had become because of the harm I was doing to it and to stop because I'd ruin it forever if I kept up doing what I was doing (so the note says).

 Apparently I listened every year and essentially ""snoozed"" the notification for the next four years or something. I'm not sure, I don't quite remember that time that well. Well today, it popped up on my calendar notifications with the note, ""listen to this and stop"" with the link.

Me, now sober, listened. And then I listened to it again. I was horrified that this is what I sounded like. Gravelly voice, pitch problems, and an obvious cry for help to myself to stop what I was doing. It's harsh, unfiltered, and raw. I almost couldn't finish the song but I kept replaying and replaying it. 

People talk a lot here about what happens when you ""play the tape forward"" when that first drink touches your lips. I recorded a version of that for myself for (thankfully) when I was alive to hear it and recognize its meaning to me.",6

On Thursday, a very difficult day at work (I work as a freelance art director and graphic designer) made me want to do drugs, cocaine not no name it. So late in the evening I did it at the office. I tried not to drink but eventually said 'fuck it'. Resulted in an awful two day binge, with the remorse and the pain. I know this is part of the process, and I hear a lot of relapse stories at my AA meetings. But that's ok. I still have my 72 days under my belt, and I still have an impossible situation with my client to deal with. But I hope I will start over, for good this time. Thanx, I am T and I am an alcoholic.

Edit. I don't know how I will cope with this the next few days. Only thing I know is I have to get back on track ASAP. And it's true what they say : it is way easier to remain sober than to start over again.

I went out by myself last night to the clubs and drank too much. 

My roommate even text me while I was out, ""get home safe dude remember to keep it to 4.5 drinks lolol.""

Well I blew way past that without even batting an eye. 

Okay, 2 AM hits and I don't have any prospects so I head to the car...

I think I'm driving fine, everything is good....

I'm looking at something stupid on my phone, then my right tire slams onto a cement barrier on the highway.

My car is off the ground, it feels like the entire front of my car just slammed into it.

I'm still drunk, but finally alert. 

I take the next exit, pull into a neighborhood and sleep out the night. 

The front right tire and wheel is completely wrecked. Luckly I have a truck so some how the suspension just raised my vehicle and kept it from getting completely totaled. 

I realize when I woke up that I actually drove 5 miles past my house, I was just a drunk asshole driving on the freeway.
I could have easily killed someone. I could have easily killed myself. 

I now have to spend $500 I don't have on new wheels and tires. 

I woke up at 7 AM freezing without a jacket or sweater and I’m out putting on my spare while people walk there dogs and start their Saturday morning.  

I'm ashamed and sickened. 

I'm too old for this shit, I've always been pretty good about not drinking and driving up until last night. 

The usual victims of my drinking have been my relationships and my reputation.  

I'm 30 years old and single and alone in large part because I refuse to grow up and take responsibility and just quit. 

In my last relationship I conscientiously decided I would never get drunk around her... Well, after being in a relationship for over a year we went to Vegass and I drank too much and guess what? 

She broke up with me a week after. This was my dream girl, everything I wanted and we had a perfect relationship before I became a blackout monster. 

Three years ago I was arrested for drunk and disorderly conducted. They let me go they next morning and there is no record of it anywhere, talk about a wake up call!

Let alcohol go. 

Life will go on without boos, the older you get the more stupid all the boos crap is anyways. 

I believe God is giving me one more chance, one more shot and I'm going to take it. 

I am never touching alcohol again. It ruins lives, relationships, and futures. Not to mention it's fucking poison that destroys your body. 
I'm scared. 

Alcohol has always been a way to bond with friends and a way to meet people, but it's not worth the risk any longer. 

I can't do this to myself again because next time there won’t be a next time.",5

The first 2 months were HARD. I have never felt as depressed, hopeless and scared as I did during those first 60 or so days. I have felt more level and happy the last 30 days, and considerably more calm than when I was drinking every night. Alcoholics Anonymous really, REALLY helped me during the first several weeks. The fellowship, and the reaching out of other AA members I experienced as a newcomer was extremely awesome and helpful in staying away from booze. I got a sponsor and began working the steps. I had some really awful days and being able to call/text women from AA was great. This sub, as well as the aa and dry alcoholic subs have been one of the most, if not the most, crucial parts to my recovery thus far. Having somewhere to go 24/7 and find support, stories like my own and a real fellowship, is awesome. They have also provided a wealth of resources to aid in recovery. I found out about SMART Recovery thru r/stopdrinking and then found some local meetings. I LOVE the language of SMART recovery and I love that it applies recent addiction research to its methods. I go to a therapist that does cognitive behavior therapy (what SMART is based on as well), and see two therapists through a local substance abuse center. I have found, so far, that a multi-therapy approach works for me. I was honest about this with my sponsor a couple weeks ago, and said that I’d like to continue to work the steps with her. She said she’d support me but could not continue in the sponsor/sponsee relationship if I wasn’t completely committed to AA. I was disappointed, but I totally understand that AA has to work this way if it’s going to work for those it works for. I am still attending meetings and can’t wait to get my chip tomorrow night. Most recently, I’ve been listening to Alcohol Explained, by William Porter. It is AWESOME. Love this sub and all you guys so much!! One day at a time! IWNDWYT!",9

AA didn't work for me because I suffer from pretty extreme social anxiety, and generalized anxiety, so sometimes going to AA would actually trigger my drinking urges. Alcohol has always been a crutch.

I am a chronic relapser and started feeling so ashamed about it that I became very depressed.

I couldn't comfortably live my life sober until I got medical help for my anxiety and depression. I have been on anxiety medication for almost 4 months now, and I have never felt this confident being sober.

I still think about alcohol daily, but in a different way. I used to feel shame, and think ""I wonder when I will fail again by making a pit stop at my favorite bar on the way home from work.""

But I don't think like that anymore. I now think about all the positive things that I can possibly be doing instead of getting drunk. I found out that no-anxiety sober-me LOVES to be clean and be organized! I was kind of slob before now. And hobbies! I've never really had them. 

AA is great for a sense of community, but at the same time, it was almost like putting a bandaid on a large gash when I really needed stitches.

I finally got professional medical help for my mental illnesses, and I've never been happier. I still don't go to AA, but thats because my urges have almost completely gone away. After almost 3 years of trying to get sober.

But also.. I'm on this subreddit every day! I love you all. We can do this.

To Understand this: I got a DUI last year. I was waaaay over the limit. Was in short term cell over the weekend. Bail got posted by parents and I learned what my charges were. I don't remember the specifics, except that it could have meant months of jail time. I cried in that car harder than I have in a long time. We found an amazing lawyer who said that since it was my first time he could probably get it knocked down a few notches. He did, and after losing my license for about a month, attending a 12 hour state mandated class on alcohol and driving, all I've got left is 1 year of a 2 year probation that amounts to not having any more incidents involving alcohol and a motor vehicle. I made sure not to get behind a wheel after that if I had been drinking, but it took me a while after that to get to the point of admitting that I had a drinking problem, but I finally did. Since then I've been pretty successful at not drinking, with a few bumps in the road. Maybe it was thinking about the ticket that I got the other week that got me thinking back on that tonight, but it suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks. I was really damn close. It's not that I didn't take it seriously at the time. I did. But I feel like I'm only just now really fully appreciating what that lawyer did for me, and what the outcome could very well have been. Saying I dodged a bullet doesn't give weight to the gravity that I'm feeling thinking about it. I'm incredibly thankful for that lawyer and his partner, and the sober journey that it eventually lead to. 

Sobriety is hard. It makes us really face the events in our life, both good and bad. We can't hide them or forget them when we're sober. But without it we can't grow. Without it we stay stuck, endlessly circling the same point, if not regressing (or at least, that was my experience). I'm glad to be sober with you all tonight, and IWNDWY.",16

She's been on a journey of improving her health and has talked about cutting back or quitting since back when I was drinking and we'd commiserate together. She asked me today to be her support person as she wants to kick it for good and is inspired by how I've stuck with it and am outwardly more healthy just from that one decision. It feels really good to be looked upon as someone who is doing right, and I am really excited to cheer her on.

I am an addict with mental health issues.

 I grow up in a strict unhappy family. My father slapped and insulted me everytime I acted like a child. As I grow, I put distance between us to avoid bad memories.

But it didn't work.

I became addicted to alcohol and weed to be able to sleep, supress anxiety and feel warm again.

It made me worse.

I lost too much to my addictions. I made a fantasy world and live in it. Fuel it with alcohol, weed or whatever I have that day.

I didn't answer my phones. I didn't call anybody. I missed events with friends to smoke.

I lost academic performance, girl I loved, job opportunities, friends, relatives and respect.

Last week my managers offered me an opportunity that can have huge impact on my career and I missed the opportunity.

I had a panic attack in that meeting for the first time in my life. I lost control. I couldn't even remember details, I was so out of my mind.

I did not learn to face my feelings sober. I can not think straight due to all of that substances that made my soul and brain numb.

I lost the opportunity and this time it hit me hard. I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. All I can do was beat myself, what an idiot I am.

Then I decided, I am done with this lifestyle.

I saw a doctor and diagnosed GAD, probably due to daily drinking and smoking weed.

Now I am a 27 years old guy who had pushed every good opportunity, loved ones away. I feel terible. All I feel is regret and sorrow.

But I leart my lesson and I am one week sober.

I am facing with all the emotions, decisions and consequences I have been avoiding last 8 years.

I feel terrible. Sometimes, I feel suicidal. But I didn't drink. This time I know that drinking and smoking will numb the pain, I will be high and happy for several hours but I will wake up next morning with more anxiety, more regrets.

Now I am trying to find myself again. I am calling my family and friends again. Talking them openly about my situation, and apologize them. I am trying to surround myself with family and friends ınstead of drugs. 

You guys are awesome and I will not drink with you today.

If you have any advice to help me, dont hold back I greatly need it.",9

Cravings haven’t gone down yet, especially on the weekends. My skin is still dry and cracked. I haven’t lost a single ounce of weight even though I’ve also been working out way more consistently than when I was drinking. Sugar cravings are out of control. Everyone keeps saying their anxiety went down significantly after quitting, but mine is worse than it has been in months and months. I don’t have woodland creatures singing as the sunlight streams through my window in the mornings. I’ve been feeling irritable and impatient. 

Sorry to be throwing a pity party on a Saturday night. I know sobriety is the right long-term choice for me, but I’m just an imperfect human creature who likes gratification.

2019-12-14 23:12:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eaua3o/holiday_parties_can_still_be_difficult/,Holiday parties can still be difficult,"I've been sober very close to 2 years now and I must say it has been rather easy to do after the initial 2 weeks or so of just breaking the routines and habits.

I have a very strong support who has lived with me for almost a decade and the thought of disappointing her makes drinking just not feasible anymore.

Last year we moved to a new state, I started a new job, met lots of great people, but was inundated with booze-filled work events.  A lot of my younger co-workers would taunt me and try to get me to drink but that tended to make my resolve even stronger.

This year I have a new job, closer to home so far less commuting (whew!) but it is a much more stressful job as the company is about 1/4 the size but still doing the same type of work.
On top of that my team is not the friendliest team and they're not people I can see myself hanging out with outside of work.  At work we get stuff done but the pleasantries are sparse.

This place is also soaked in booze for every event.  Everyone knows that I don't drink and they don't push it.  However because we don't get along all that great beyond brief uncomfortable small-talk the temptation to go for the booze was the strongest it has been since I stopped drinking.

I went with my girlfriend to the party, which was in a place that was far too small for the amount of people that were coming, with no place to sit down, and a gigantic bar that was basically the focal point of the whole area.  People I work with on a daily basis (I'm in IT) completely ignored us and pretended we weren't there at all as they formed little cliques.  My own boss couldn't be bothered to say more than ""hi"" and walk away to talk to more interesting people.  The entire thing was horribly uncomfortable and I just wanted to go get a super strong drink and let loose for about the first time in almost 2 years.

Instead my girlfriend and I talked for about an hour as we shifted from standing place to standing place and then quietly snuck out and came home.

I still feel awful about the whole thing but I'm glad I didn't actually break down and get a drink.  I'm quite surprised at the strength of that desire since it snuck up so quickly and forcefully.

I guess that goes to show I still have some demons just waiting to come out given certain circumstances.

I feel better writing this out though so thanks for reading! IWNDWYT!",8

I am going through some shit, per the usual for life. Instead of drinking I have a wide variety of ways to deal with my issues. I talk about it; write it; share it; then (try) to let it go. Part of it maybe listening to music to help me work through it, get through it. Listening and writing reminds me of my early sobriety and the song that resonated with me, versus the songs that resonate with me now. 

I think one of the reasons I am also thinking about this is because I am coming up on 5 years of sobriety...universe willing. I am reflecting a lot on where I am at, where I was at, and what I can do to continue to grow. My drinking is not just about not drinking, I need to grow. That is the way I not only survive but thrive. I spent so much of my live surviving, I don't want that anymore, I want to go beyond the survival life. To do that, I reflect and share. 

My song at the beginning of my sobriety were 2: Chandelier and Elastic Heart by Sia. Chandelier because I was that girl looking like she was having fun. The girl everyone went to, to go out. I couldn't feel anything, I pushed everything down. 1-2-3 drink, 1-2-3 drink. That was the way I lived my life. Every night I flew like a bird of the night to dry my tears, I hung from chandeliers so no one would see how sad and empty I was. I held on for dear life, I couldn't look down & kept my glass full until morning light, so I could hold on. When the sun came up, I was a mess and then he shame crept it...so I did it all over again. Elastic Heart was because I was waiting to break but somehow, I had a heart that rebounded. 

Now, 4 years & 11 months sober, my sober songs are...happier, lol, at least to me. I love Macklemore. Gemini is my favoriate album. Glorious is my jam. My life, even when bad, is glorious. I have a new attitude, a new lease on life. I got a chance to start again, I was born for this, this is who I am. Another morning, I have my breath, I  have my faith and I remember why I came. This is who I am. 

The 2nd Mackelmore song that resonates with me is Shadow. I run from my shadow. I need relief and peace, but sometimes I cannot escape my disease. I am all the good and bad about me. Sometimes, when I am not mentally or emotionally okay, I go to war with myself. I think ""this is not what sober"" and that I thought I was over it. 

But I am sober. One fucking day at a time. I work at it, every day, big or small. Painful or good. I work work work, just like I used to drink drink drink. 

Thanks for still being here, stopdrinking. It's been an adventure but I'll keep coming back. 

What is your sober song, then and now, before and after?",8

I wouldn’t even wanna share how bad it got at the height of my degeneracy, I’m far too embarrassed to even admit it anonymously. Alcohol has been a shoulder to cry on my whole adult life when humanity afforded me no other. For years I’d hardly go an evening without enough booze to knock out a small elephant and it’s fairly obvious now that alcohol has been my only coping mechanism for all this time. That being said, these past two weeks I’ve been handed a call to action. My girlfriend of near four years left me and started dating someone within five days or so (yeah I’m not stupid I know what that means) and after about two days and as many fifths of vodka, I decided I’d rather feel the pain and loss and anger of that circumstance than feel nothing at all.

Somehow drinking, and specifically blackouts, came up. It really saddened me to hear how they just consider blackouts a normal part of the drinking experience. Like it is just par for the course to drink so much that you blackout, and to have this happen at least a few times per year.

I started having blackouts in my mid-late twenties. They were always points of shame for me, even if I didn’t do anything stupid. I have apparently slapped my husband on two separate occasions, I have said terrible, awful things to him, and I have tried groping his best friend and my sister in law. 🤦‍♀️ The other times I basically just had meltdowns with lots of tears or had sex I would never remember.

I don’t understand why people accept blackouts as part of drinking. It has taken me a long time, and many attempts, to stop drinking, but I always viewed blackouts as an indicator of a problem. It breaks my heart that people can’t see it for the warning sign that it is. (I’m not saying all who have blackouts are alcoholics, just that it’s your body warning you shouldn’t be consuming so much ever again.) 

I am glad I never again have to experience the day after dread of a black out.

or my world-weary cynicism

You love me for *me*, you tell me how beautiful I am and how special

I embrace your warmth and acceptance

I feel safe; you are real, mesmerising, convincing

We cook, we dance, we laugh, we make crazy love

We poke fun at the world, its faults and delusional inhabitants

We are superior and invincible – damn all those bastards and ignorant morons out there!

&#x200B;

But in the morning

There you are, my smirking Assassin. 

I am humiliated…outraged at your duplicity

You flattered me, you lied, you promised so much

But in the afterglow, when the brief honeymoon is over 

And my skin is sallow, my features puffy and sadly distorted

I see you are not my trusted lover at all

You are my killer

And god knows I hate you…but I love you…and how I hate you

&#x200B;

This afternoon, at around five pm when I feel human again

And the cares of the day are behind me

I will have forgiven and forgotten, and I know that

You will make everything fun and interesting again

You will help me forget the daily torments of sensitive souls

And we will tread the same path

Hand in hand

You will bring relief, a seductive jailbreak

&#x200B;

And tomorrow morning

I will pay the price once more

You will cut me down with cruel smugness and a blinding headache

You will laugh in my face and put me in my place

I will kneel before you, trembling, submissive and full of regret

Swearing again

that from today I will escape this abusive relationship 

forever",7

A part of me feels like if I don’t acknowledge this I won’t spiral downward because if nobody knows I can hop right back on track. If I tell anyone I have to start at day one again and then I might feel like- screw it I’m not starting over for a few sips- lets go hard again. Please help me.,2

However, I was getting drunk and doing or saying things I regret all of my 20’s and my sober self was sick of waking up with anxiety - it was affecting my work at this point and I don’t like to let things fuck with my work.  I’m 28 now and started seeing a therapist and told her I wanted to skip my holiday party because I had anxiety about drinking At a work function and saying something stupid. She turned to me and said “okay so what if you didn’t drink?” 

I was shocked I never even entertained that idea in the realm of possibilities. But then the next day I went to the party and stayed sober until I treated myself to a couple glasses of wine at the end as a “goodbye” drink to myself. While everyone else was sloshed I was completely composed and looked great in every picture too! I could remember everything everyone else that couldn’t remember saying. It was fucking empowering. 

Since then I’ve gone cold turkey off alcohol. It’s only been 8 days, but I’ve kept an eye on my FitBit and my resting heart rate went from 78-80 BPM down to 70-71 in only a week. And my sleep restlessness went down dramatically. And don’t get me started on my skin. With such immediate benefits I hope to make this a permanent change in my life. IWNDWYT!",144

I have over 7 months total sober for this year, which is probably fantastic for health. I calculated that a low number is I've consumed about 225 less drinks than I otherwise would have.

I've been a little depressed recently because I'm definitely feeling the areas where I'm hitting a bit of a roof again. I hoped that I would find someone special and instead I passed the 1 year mark since the last time I was on a date (I'm extremely socially anxious and was long before I started drinking.) I drank my way out of a severe, cult-like religion and I was hoping by now I'd find some peace about that extremely traumatic experience. I really haven't, I still spend a lot of time reliving horrible experiences. I'm in my 30s and I'm propping up my mother financially, with little idea on how I'll get by on my own, so that can also feel very shitty.

On the plus side, I am almost fit enough to run a 10k, which has been one of my major goals. My job, while not enough if I was to stay with it for 10 years or something, gets me by now and isn't too hard. And I was elected an officer of a Toastmasters club.

Maybe this is just a venting post while I wallow in my regret over last night (again). Maybe it's more of a journal entry to get all of this out. It's most definitely a cry for help. I need help. I need somebody to tell me how to do this.... or at least tell me something other than ""just stop drinking"". If I could just stop drinking I would have. If I could learn moderation, I would moderate. Unfortunately, there is that little switch that gets tripped and I never know when it's going to happen... One day I can have 2 drinks and be happy and handle myself like a normal person. But the next day? With the same exact situation and variables? No. for some reason I become a blackout mess that says inappropriate or mean things. Another person comes out and I hate that person so much. I hate their trauma and their personality. I hate how they behave. 

&#x200B;

But I like drinking.

&#x200B;

How the hell do you do it? How do you stop? I enjoy the taste of beer. I enjoy getting drunk. I do not enjoy being drunk. I do not enjoy becoming the person I become. I do not want to wake up and wonder how I embarrassed myself again or have to go through all my social media and phone history to find out what I did. Worse, I don't want to hear about it. I didn't want to hear today what I did last night. I didn't want to look in the mirror this morning and see my marked up face from taking a header on the sidewalk. I don't like the amount of people that are part of my life that I have to track down to piece together my evening.

I have always agreed with this and every instance when I have relapsed, I would say to myself, ""I'm just not ready...""

The fact of the matter is, no one is ever ready to change their life drastically, in any situation.  It's scary.  We often procrastinate in situations like putting down the bottle because we are scared and then chalk it off to not being ready.  Procrastination is the result of fear.  Fear of the unknown, fear of not being accepted, fear of not fun anymore, fear of what life will be like after the change.  The more one procrastinates, the more they build up more fear and the little voice inside their head gives them more reasons to ""no be ready.""  For me, I found, I just had to do.  I was never going to be ready unless someone forced me.  If I really wanted to do it for me, and me alone, I had to stop procrastinating.

2019-12-14 14:32:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eao4tv/901_days/,901 days,"Hi,
My first post ever(?) I think. Just wanted to say I have made it through 901 days. I still think life is hard, for a multitude of reasons, but if I didn’t stop I don’t know if  I would have been alive. Much less have anyone around me. I want to say thank you to this group and this forum. To be honest its been hard in some ways having other people understand what the ... this is and. Its even hard to explain in words here. I wish it didnt take me 25 years to stop, addiction its a hell of a ride. Its hard to explain how difficult it is, even other people who know I have stopped for a long time still wanted to drink around me. I’m rambling. It’s, as I’m sure we have all learned, so hard, for ourselves and the people around us. I was at 1 day, and at 30 days, 60 days, and god knows how many days to read other peoples stories. That was what motivated me the most. To feel that even if I physically was alone in trying to solve this problem, I wasn’t alone because I could see others struggle as well. And some had even more than me, which made me feel more ‘human’. Like ‘ok I failed’, but one can get up again. Even the most crazy stories in here I don’t remember thinking anyone being ‘stupid’ or me looking down upon them. Because I just knew how much insane stuff we can go through with alcohol. Another thing that helped me a lot was ‘play the tape forward’, to fast forward till the next morning. I’ll spare you the details, but I feel like I wasted a lot of time and even more opportunities in life because of alcohol. No problem in finding idiotic things I could do, so fast forwarding that tape often made it easier to turn away from temptation. I still have some struggles, but..,
No alcohol, I will not drink with you today.

Im not quite sure why I wrote this. I feel like I wanted to tell about it in a place where it is understood. Of course I’m proud, but its also not easy being sober. Not everything is rosy, still it beats drinking by miles! I have probably never met any of you but know I am one that is rooting for you in your quest to stop drinking. We fail, but we get back up. Nobody cares about Rocky because he wins, they care because he fights and gets back up! So we can fail, but still get back up and try again. I haven’t figured this all out, but I hope I will stay away from alcohol for the rest of my life. I’m soon to be 40.

To the people posting here, thank you. Your stories, and you people, was my greatest help to recovery from 25 years of alcohol. Its even strange to really write this, I have quit drinking for good. We all have different paths I guess, and this subreddit helped me more than anything. And i have tried professionals for years. I’m proud, but much more than that I want to express my thanks and gratitude to the people of this forum. To everyone, no matter where on the path towards sobriety you are, much respect for fighting! We are only human.",13

I originally got sober 3/13/86, when I was 32 years old. I stayed sober for 27+ years by going to AA, getting a sponsor & working the 12 steps. Then I quit going to meetings. When my husband cheated on me and my boss sexually harassed me, I drank again. Later, I took another stab at sobriety and got another 2+ years, but when I retired I got this great ((not)) idea to try and drink in moderation. Well, we all know how THAT turned out!! I became physically dependent and drinking wasn't fun anymore. I tried to pretend it was so that my friends wouldn't know how unhappy I had become. But this last Sunday I got real with myself and admitted I was 100% powerless over alcohol and my life had become unmanageable. My withdrawals were horrible!! I felt like I'd been hit by a Mack truck. I drank gallons of water and sweat it out at the gym every day. Finally, yesterday I started to feel human again and today my only physical pain is from the shin splints of working out. During my lap swim today I imagined many scenarios that I will encounter sober while others are drinking and none of them appealed to me!! During my first bout sober I would say ""How can normal people have one drink? Who the fuck would want to stop at one? Not me!!"" I still feel that way. BTW, I am not going to AA this time around. I get too judgemental of people bragging about themselves and I will be doing myself, and others, a favor by leaving my negative energy outside the rooms. I highly recommend AA for newcomers and anyone who is more patient and tolerant than me. This Reddit forum is the cat's meow for me now. So I'm gonna stay on this pink cloud for as long as I can. I plan to stay involved with this forum and hopefully in the smaller chat support groups. If I keep an attitude of gratitude and remember how bad it got, I will be able to do it, ""One Day at a Time"". I wish the same for you folks, too!!",11

Everyone except my sister and another guy we work with were drinking. Someone bought a round of shots and I wasnt aware beforehand, so when the waitress handed it to me I awkwardly stated ""uh I'm sorry but I don't drink haha,"" waitress seemed a bit annoyed but someone else at the table was glad to have the extra shot. I told my sister later that was a really hard thing to do, because, even after over 460 days, it can be hard to turn it down, especially if it's free and looks super tasty. My sister told me shes really proud of me.

All in all it was a really fun night and I'm glad I stayed sober!

It’s long as hell, sorry, but I’ll mark where my actual epiphany is. So grab your cups of tea, juice, or coffee if you want to read.

My entire family; both parents, both sets of grandparents, two great-grandparents all have had an ‘issue’ with alcohol. Save my mother’s mother, the others are full blown alcoholics. My mom is the only one who recognized the behavior and will be 12 years sober in February. Growing up I watched my father choose booze over me, my grandmother down entire bottles of champagne while driving, and my grandfather drink himself into the grave. None of that was alarming to me, just odd. What really scared the shit out of me was seeing my single mother go through hell and back to get sober for my sister and I.

My mom is now remarried, my stepdad is my real dad in my eyes. He drinks but has drastically cut down since being with my mom. My mom has no issue watching my siblings and I drink, she knows we grew up in AA rooms and have seen the consequences.


ACTUAL EPIPHANY HERE:

I have a laundry list of mental disorders: bipolar, adhd, panic disorder, PTSD. And all the meds I take have that wonderful ~do NOT drink on this medication~ label. I have ignored it since I was 16 and chose to drink with friends, because obviously I knew my family has history but since I am aware I couldn’t possibly have a problem, right? I am 21 now and have moved past the party (binge) drinking phase. I tell everyone that I hate drinking, makes me feel gross. Which is true. But some how, every night, I end up having 1, 2, or 3 glasses of wine (never liquor because I just HATE alcohol).

Last night, my boyfriend and I had old friends over and there was drinking and smoking. I downed beers and wine, not feeling anything. Then it all hit me like a sack of bricks, my new ADHD meds apparently REALLY don’t mix with alcohol. This morning I feel depressed, no hangover, just fucking down. I had been on such a good streak of maintaining my mental health and I flushed it all down the drain by trying to fit in. Looking at my family history, how far I’ve come with my mental health, my promising future as a nurse... I think it’s time to quit while I’m ahead. Christmas is gonna fucking suck since we are flying out to see my SO’s family who “hydrates” by watering down their wine but hey, I would rather be sober and uncomfortable than sweating in a meeting five years down the line.

Happy to join SD, currently googling local meetings and mustering up the courage get in the room.",9

2019-12-14 11:32:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ealshn/chasing_the_feeling_of_that_first_drink/,Chasing the Feeling of that First Drink,"My sobriety date is November 21, 2019. I have been struggling with sobriety since 2013, with some sober periods as long as a year.  I consider myself a chronic relapse, but I won’t give up trying.  Each try is another sign that I haven’t given up on this journey.  I had my first drink in 2002 during a spring break party. It was my senior year in high school and I can remember shortly before this party finding out that my best friend (and the girl I was severely in love with, but had a boyfriend) was drinking on occasion. I was so mad when I found out that she was drinking, of course making it my problem when it was really out of my control. This thought process, making it about me when it clearly was not, is probably my first recollection of an alcoholic mindset. My father, brother, and sister all struggled with substance abuse, and I was certain I would not let this ruin my life… but I was wrong.


The First Drink

During the party, I had my first taste of alcohol. I drank straight Captain Morgan’s Parrot Bay Coconut Rum. At this point in my life, I was the guy that always remained in the friend-zone, never had any courage to talk to girls, never had a girlfriend, and never even kissed a girl, other than my mother. After that first glass of Parrot Bay, I unleashed. I danced, I laughed, I got crazy. I remember sitting on a couch and a girl in pajama pants and a sports bra was giving me a PG version of a lap dance. THIS WAS IT! I was convinced this was the thing I was missing. I was getting everything I never had with the females, except sex of course, because of the liquid courage I had drank.

I’m pretty sure that ever since that night, I have been chasing that feeling. I have been trying to get back to that night where all my worries were gone and I was cool, calm, and a ladies man. Well, the joke was on me. No matter how much I drank, what I drank, or who I drank with never delivered me to that place I wanted to go back to. If I could just feel like that again, life would be great. Or at least that’s what I thought. That’s what I’ve learned; my alcoholism gave me false hope that I would make it back to that spot one day. Years and years of drinking never got me back there, but I continued to try, oh so hard. That’s the insanity behind it.  I thought that this was what it felt like to be normal and accepted.

But still trying to adjust socially.","This coming March will be two years without a drink. Right now (1 year and 9 months) is the longest I’ve gone without a drink since I was a child (even then I was sipping some of dad’s beers here and there). I think about my sobriety a lot and it’s a major part of my life, but what I’ve grown to realize more and more is that my social life has drastically changed.

When I first entered the program my sponsor said it was important to recognize all of my current people, places and things in my life that revolved around drinking. He had me make a list of them and see which ones I could alter or change. I did that and it really worked for me. I stopped going to bars or hangout places where it was all about drinking. I stopped staying up till 3am watching tv because I used to just sit on the couch and drink all night. I even got rid of all my social media at the time. I had just started a new job and all my old coworkers from my previous job (who were also my hard drinking buddies) were growing more and more distant. It was hard to find common ground with them anymore and I felt like they saw me in a different way.

Fast forward to now, I don’t know that I have any exact people I would call “friends”. I have my wife and my brother (thank god for them) and two neighbors who I chat with here and there, but I don’t have a person I would truly say is my “best friend”. I used to think I did. I used to think I had a million friends. Turns out the only thing we really had in common was that we were drunk. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love my life now. I’m in control of my emotions. I never wake up with a hangover. I can spend time with my two daughters and remember it the next day. I am finally realizing (after 10 years of marriage) what it means to be in a relationship. When I think back to all the stupid shit I put my wife through when I was drunk, my god I want to puke. 

I guess the point of this is, how do some of you “old timers” adjust to the social life? Right now I’m kinda stuck in a solo loop: I get up in the morning with the fam, send them off to school and work, spend the whole day alone until I go to work from 3-midnight, come home and everyone is in bed, spend an hour alone before I go to bed, wake up and do it all over. On top of that my job (machine operator) is basically done alone without a lot of interaction. 

I know the fellowship of AA is there. I did that for the first year, but I was mostly encountering older guys (I’m in my mid-30’s) who didn’t share a lot of common interests with me. 

What I miss most is just having someone to reach out to go out to lunch sometimes or pal around with during the day before work or shoot the shit with. 

Sorry for rambling. I love all of you and send my support and positive non-drinking vibes to you. IWNDWYT.",5

Sorry if I’m not supposed to say this but this seems to be my biggest problem. It’s like breaking up with someone you still love because you know they’re bad for you. Needing to do something and wanting to do something are not always the same thing.,13

2019-12-14 10:08:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eaks10/two_weeks/,Two Weeks,"2 weeks and one day ago, I had my last drink. I spend the day drinking an entire bottle of champagne from noon - 3 pm alone in my apartment for no reason. Later that night I went out to dinner with my boyfriend who has been sober for almost 5 years. I’d ordered a sangria with dinner even though I felt like crap and a hangover was already kinda creeping in. Halfway through the meal he just politely asked me , “what is your relationship with alcohol like these days ?” I immediately felt so seen. I’d known for months beforehand that I needed to get sober for good and had tried on and off to moderate, but that never worked. 

We ended up having a really candid conversation about my drinking, how crap it makes me feel (he’s known I’ve had a bad relationship with alcohol since college) , and I expressed that I wanted to quit for good but had been making excuses for myself. So, I simply stopped making excuses. I ended up only having a couple sips of that sangria that night and haven’t touched anything since. 

Just writing this because at this two week mark, I finally feel like I can do this. And it’s a reminder to myself that I knew drinking made me a worse person, and I’m better off without it. IWNDWYT",21

Help!","***Sorry this got crazy long! TLDR: I’ve got college finals next week, have not even started studying, and I just quit drinking Monday night (so today is day 5). I have barely been able to sleep the last few days and I can’t focus on my studying at all. Advice on how to sleep? I know a routine and all, but any short-term/quick results ideas? And the second part, I don’t know how to deal with loneliness and long days alone. Today is the first day I don’t have anywhere to be and I’m alone at home til 7pm. 


And I feel so stupid now but just writing “7pm” made me start crying. I’m so overwhelmed and feel alone. I keep reaching for where I used to keep a bottle of liquor and remembering I don’t have any. (At least that makes it easy for me to identify my triggers!)


And now my tldr is too long. Lol. Thanks to anyone who reads this far!****


So, I feel like I picked the worst time to quit drinking. I just woke up on Tuesday, knew I had a busy day and didn’t feel like figuring out a way to fit a trip to the liquor store in. And I just decided, fuck it. Then I just figured, I might as well just stop finally. I’ve been wanting to quit for a long time, but I’ve never actually committed to trying. And I’ve been lurking on this sub for a month or so. And so yea, after I made it a few hours in, I felt pretty committed to it. And I got some encouragement here and it felt like I could a actually do this!


But..I’m also in college right now - and it’s finals week. Actually, last week was too - and it was hell bc I stopped drinking Monday night and was just shaking and anxious and sweaty all day Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I keep thinking this was the worst time to try and do this, bc I’ve gotten so behind in all my school stuff. I was late turning in 3 of my final assignments, finished creating my presentation in class while other people did their presentation (and was a shaky, sweaty mess for mine, it was completely incoherent, I have no idea how I did). Then  we had an open note test, and I FORGOT to bring my notes!!!! None of this is typical for me. But I couldn’t get my head in the game. 


I keep thinking I’m just fucking everything up now. But I know I can’t just start drinking again for the week and quit after finals. I want to keep this going. But I really need some advice!


I can’t sleep. Like barely at all. I slept about 2 hours on Wednesday night (0 on Tuesday night), felt like a zombie on Thursday (for my terrible presentation, seriously I know I looked like hell). And Thursday night I finally fell asleep around 6am, but I don’t have class or work on Fridays, so I slept in and woke up around noon. Then last night I slept for maybe 2 hours. And am a zombie again. I HAVE to get some sleep or I just can’t study. And I’ve worked so hard this semester - this is my second attempt at college. I dropped out when I was 19, I’m 31 now and just decided to try again. This is my first semester. And I’m just so...I don’t know. I hate this right now.


The other thing is, I already knew that I have a hard time when I’ve got down time, especially if I’m alone. I just never really like being alone. But Monday-Thursday, I’m at class/work from 8am-6pm (I’ve got a work-study job, so I’m just at the school all day), then my boyfriend is home by 7pm, so I’m busy and surrounded by people so it’s fine, I can deal with that. And yesterday I had a few appts I had to go to, and my boyfriend got off work early so it was totally fine. Then today I woke up and realized I’m alone all day today. My boyfriend left for work at 5:30am and won’t be back until 7pm. I was up most of the night again, and now...I know I should just try to sleep. But I can’t fall asleep! And I’m stressed bc I should be working on studying. 


Any advice about sleeping and dealing with being alone or dealing with days off? Or just anything. :(

2019-12-14 09:06:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eak3ff/holiday_party/,Holiday Party,"I’m six months alcohol free, nearly to the day. Last night we had our holiday party for work. While I was always reserved at work functions, no way would I have passed up a free bar. Getting more than tipsy, less than sloshed. I’d come home to drink to finish off the job.

Last night I was out on the dance floor having a blast with my coworkers. At some point my brain said “Hey, you are out here doing this sober! Maybe you don’t need liquid courage!” And at the moment, I was both incredibly proud and instantly shy (about dancing in public). I knew that I had to push passed that shy / shame thing and just dive in. 

 I witnessed some of my coworkers getting sloppy - the way I used to. I could see it in their eyes before I heard it in their speech. I felt a twinge of pain for them because it looked like loneliness to me. Maybe it’s just my relationship with alcohol projecting on them. I don’t know. 

I gave away my drink tickets and headed home completely sober.  

It was a good night for me. I’m feeling great these days and I don’t want to lose this feeling.  

I will not drink with you today!

Happy sober holidays!",11
2019-12-14 09:02:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eak22w/sober_skin/,Sober skin,"Your skin is the largest organ in your body. 

I’m 34F; quit drinking on my birthday almost six months ago. Before that, aside from several brief bouts of sobriety, I’ve had a problematic relationship with alcohol since I was 18. It’s taken different forms, more binge drinking and less daily drinking before i was able to buy it myself, and when money was tight. The last few years it’s been pretty consistent though. 2-4 drinks every weeknight, 3-8 on any given Friday or Saturday, more if something “special” was happening. 

My whole life, or since before adolescence anyway, people said I had “great” skin. Olive complexion, never much in the way of acne, not oily or dry. But I never thought I had nice skin. From the time that I was able to do so I wore foundation and cover up every single day. If I went swimming I wore it anyway and would bring it along to touch up when possible. I couldn’t really put my finger on what I found off-putting, but I think it was patchy redness. And it just looked tired, uneven, aged. Don’t know how else to put it. 

It took a few months - longer than I would have expected - but my skin looks amazing now. I haven’t worn foundation in months - which saves like $60 every two months or so. In the morning I put on sunscreen, then a little cover up under my eyes, and then the rest of whatever make up I’m wearing.

I want to make it clear that it’s 100% the alcohol that made the difference. I still have a high stress job and am the main earner in the family. I often don’t get enough sleep. I am still in the middle of expensive and stressful custody litigation with my ex. I don’t always eat well and don’t make exercise enough of a priority. But none of that comes close to the impact of alcohol on my skin. 

Your skin is the largest organ in your body. It tells a story about your health. And holy shit was it a dark one. Mine was a story about wasted potential. My “great” skin being suffocated daily. It tells a different story now. And it affects everything. Feeling good *about* your skin goes a surprisingly long way toward feeling good *in* your skin. 

One of the many unexpected benefits of sobriety. I definitely didn’t stop drinking so I could lose the foundation. But damn I’m sure happy about it.

My husband has been trying to quit for a year and has done pretty much everything— AA, outpatient treatment, medication, therapy, etc.

I have not given up hope but sometimes things look so bleak.  I’m not sure what this 30 days will give him that other treatment hasn’t but I do hope it’s the magic sauce.

When I was 15 I drank so much gin, I blacked out, threw up all over myself and had to be driven back to a girlfriend's house by some guy I didn't know in a rusted out Chevy Nova. I remember nothing from that night. Just one snapshot of my lower jaw falling open and then my guts spilling out onto my chest. I didn't drink for years after that. Hated it, honestly. And I haven't touched a drop of gin since.

College. 18-21. I went to a big school, rated one of the biggest party schools in the US in part due to the enormous fraternity scene. I hated fraternities. But there were also many bars. A bar for every kind of person. So my pile of misfit friends frequented a bar with all the other misfits. We'd drink pitchers of beer and play darts and pool and watch indie bands. I never really got black out drunk, but I would definitely drink enough to stumble home at 2 AM. If I were to be perfectly honest: I loved drinking in college. With the metabolism of a hummingbird, I could put away beers and somehow not get too drunk or out of control, not end up fat and bloated.

Most days were sober days; I'd say 20 days per month were spent not drinking. The other ten were... well, they were just normal fun.

Mid-20s. I graduate and move and get a great job in a city that I love with people I love. I work in a creative field with deadlines so tight, and stress levels so high, at the end of many long days, we reward ourselves with happy hours all over the city. Happy hours turned into dinner hours, dinner hours turned into after dinner hours and before I know it I'm stumbling home drunk. 

My drinking days have inched up slowly from maybe 10 per month to three times each week, sometimes less, most of the time more. 

I was 25 when I took the ""Are You an Alcoholic?"" test online, dialing up through a modem filling up every corner of my 300-square foot apartment with a screeching ""PShhhkkkrrrrkakingkakingkakingtshcch*ding*ding*ding!"" 

The quiz spits back an obvious: ""You may have a drinking problem."" 

I make up an excuse to my boyfriend that evening, a guy who has nicknamed me ""Total Recall"" because my memory is so fucking good, and head out to my first ever AA meeting. But I never open the doors. I chicken out.

Age 27, 9/11 happens. I work a few blocks North from where the Towers fell. A terrible time. A time I find physically impossible to talk too much about, still. I start drinking every single day after that. Everyone I knew back then did. Not knowing what to do or how to do it, *live*, we would just meet out at bars, drink, stumble home and do it again the next day. This goes on for a couple of months until I meet my future husband one night while drunk at a bar.

He didn't drink that much back then, so I put the breaks on things a bit. 

We get married. At age 31, I get pregnant with my first kid. 

My 30s were spent pregnant 3 and a half times (I lost one). I didn't drink while pregnant. I didn't drink much while breastfeeding. But once each pregnancy was complete and breastfeeding wasn't taking place every hour, I went back to drinking every single day. Wine. A little less than one bottle of wine every day. 

**The Ghost of Drinking Present**

I am opening up a second bottle every night. I am not paying as much attention to my kids as I should be. I am not going out, taking them places. I am no longer social. I no longer sign my kids up for after school activities because said activities interfere with my drinking. I am 40 pounds heavier. My skin looks like shit. My memory is failing. ""Total Recall"" is dead and gone. I obsess over how much wine we'll have at home. I obsess over whether it would be enough since my husband usually joins me. I feel like shit almost always. And my running pace (if I can still call it running) used to be a 9 minute mile. Now, if I get out at all, it's at a 12.

I wake up at 4 AM every single night and hate on myself, pure hatred toward this person I have become. I have conversations with myself about how now I have three kids who depend on me and that, if I weren't a mother, I could drink myself into a stupor every night. But I am messing with other lives, other lives that didn't get to choose a mother, a lousy drunk mother. 

I promise to not drink that day. 

A 5 PM that voice becomes a distant memory. I start drinking again. 

**The Ghost of Drinking Future**

I am opening a 3rd bottle of wine every single night. My kids are older and realize that, not only is their mother a drunk, but she's robbed them of their childhood, too. They realize that along with my giving up everything I care about, I stopped giving *them* a life as well, because their lives (*their* beautiful, perfect lives) interfere too much with my drinking. They start to resent me. I see this in their faces so I drink more. 

Maybe I get pulled over for a DUI. Maybe I hurt someone. Maybe I leave *another* family without a son, daughter, mother or father.

I'm 60 pounds overweight. My skin is red and blotchy. My body is failing. 

I am killing myself.

**This Morning**

I don't want my kids to resent me. I don't want them to NOT experience their childhood and all the wonderful things life has to offer because their mother chose wine over them.

This is a progressive problem. It's been growing slowly and steadily since I was 15. I know where things will end up. And I often wonder what would have become of 25 year old me had she entered that meeting. Would she have become sober then? Or, at the very least, would a seed have been planted, leading to an earlier, more serious quest for sobriety later on? 

Who would I be? 

I wonder a lot of things these days. And I know that I can't change the past. And the present is what it is, delicate and new and raw and still very fragile, like clay before it's been fired. But I wanted to write this out today. Perhaps my story, my 20+ year trajectory, can help someone open that damn door, to ask for help, to consider things before they progress too much. Before the years speed ahead and you're asking a 45-year-old version of yourself, ""What if?""

TL;DR: To all those reading this who are still in their 20s, wondering what it's like to NOT drink so much, wondering if they have a problem with alcohol? I want to say this: Look ahead. What would future you wish you had done? Because life can be absolutely beautiful and it's yours, it's all yours.",65
2019-12-14 07:53:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eaje01/a_friday_night_win/,A Friday night win,"Hi everyone, 

I just returned from a five week intervention program overseas and left my kids with their dad (my ex) while I was gone. I felt so torn and tortured over leaving them for that long but I was on a downward spiral and was not really coping anymore. 

Very brief synopsis but my Mum died 3.5 years ago, my (then) 8 year old son fell off the rails and became suicidal for 6 months, my marriage collapsed and my sister chose my ex husband over me and I haven’t seen her, or her husband and three kids for 2 years now. Then I had an 18 month relationship that ended a couple of months ago in quite a brutal fashion and I was losing my grip on my alcohol consumption to help numb and distract myself from all of the pain. 

My ex husband takes our kids to my sisters every Sunday to spend the day with her and her family and also still hangs out with my deceased Mums partner. I have come back to find out that he also took them to my Dads while I was away even though I have specifically asked him to stay away from my Dad as he’s pretty much the only remaining family I have left. 

I effing hate him and his unhealthy enmeshment with my family infuriates me so much.

BUT! Last night was Friday night and despite feeling low and hurting over my family estrangement/abandonment, I forced myself to get out of the house and take the kids to the beach. Old me would have sunk into despair and ended up drinking a bottle of wine at home or at a friends place with the kids. Instead we had a magic time swimming and bodysurfing at the beach, had dinner overlooking the ocean, came home and watched the movie Klaus together and then I put them to bed 100% sober and present. 

Already that has made me feel so much better about myself as a mother and I can see that becoming sober for myself and for them whilst they are 11 and 7 years old makes taking those five weeks away from them worth it. 

I’ve lurked on here for many months and kept disappointing myself over and over when I kept breaking my own ‘rules’ in regards to my drinking. This thread really restores my faith in humanity. I’ve never known such a group of kind hearted and supportive souls. So thank you to you all :)

I've been so anxious as to how I would overcome to be near, and in the middle of, drunk people - Especially close friends - and not drink any sort of alcohol.

Yesterday I wrote this post -> [https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e9yjn6/4\_weeks\_on\_sunday\_first\_sober\_concert\_tonight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e9yjn6/4_weeks_on_sunday_first_sober_concert_tonight/)  
and you guys gave me a lot of good advice and support. You gave me strength and confidence to face my fear, believe in my strength and have a good time.

And you know what! I did it! I didn't drink at the pre party dinner and I didn't drink at the concert!  
In the middle of the concert the lead singer even handed my a bottle of water and gave me a thumbs up - As if he had spotted me as the only non-drinker in the first row crowd or something. I felt so proud and it might sound silly - But I took the (emptied) bottle home as treasured souvenir.

When I got home my mind and body was filled with emotions and I felt my blood rushing through every vein. I smiled in ecstacy ""I could feel!"" I wasn't numbed by alcohol which I with 1000% certainty would have been in the past. And for that I thank you!

Thank you for believing in me and thank you for supporting every struggling spirit on this forum <3

I woke up with no head ache nor a destroyed stomach. Only a soar throat from singing my lungs out and hurting feets from jumping was the only physical signs of a great concert.

I didn't thought it possible to feel so alive and I'ml so happy I could shed a tear. Thank you once again.

Best of health to you all <3

The main problem other than 'I can't believe you're not drinking' and 'don't be soft, get a drink!' was having to listen to total b****cks all night.

&#x200B;

A big part of my drinking and drugging was I hated my life, especially work.  So after rehab I decided to change and entered into healthcare.  Knowing that a large portion of my co-workers would be young and female I was a bit intimidated as a middle age man.  I started and have experience nothing but good things from all of my classmates and co workers.  

&#x200B;

I recently started a new job, a family style company that actually treats their employees like human beings.  I showed up for orientation expecting to go through legal, HR and a few videos.  What happened next was something I dread, I had to share my story to around 50 management/admin/HR employees.  

&#x200B;

The strangest thing happened, when my anxiety would have gone off the charts when I was using, I was calm and collected.  I had nothing prepared, no notes, no talking points and asked how long I should speak. I was told for about 10 minutes if I could manage to pull it off.  We were asked who wanted to go first, without hesitating I stood up and walked to the podium. Ten minutes went by and I felt no anxiety, no second guessing what I had said, no doubts in my performance.  I rocked it and went and took a seat.  

&#x200B;

A year and a half ago I would have felt like passing out or hiding in a corner. Now around 400 days sober that person I once was is a distant memory, a shadow of who I have become.  Albeit an important shadow for without it I would not be where I am today.  Life is good, sobriety has made that happen for me.  I hope someone reading this realizes how quickly things can and will improve without alcohol.

I came home late, woke her up, snored so loud she had to sleep on the sofa because she couldn't wake me up. 

Why do I do this to myself? My overdrinking has been a problem in every relationship I've ever had. And now I'm with someone so fantastic, why am I still doing this? I can see the future of this relationship all mapped out if I don't deal with this. She'll get tired of having to have the ""why did you drink so much"" conversation, and she'll see me more and more as just some drunk. 

She's already said she refuses to have ""the drunk husband"" in her future. And I don't want to be that. How do I stop this future? I'm so happy with her but I'm about to ruin it. Again.

So I've been sober 21 days today, going from drinking every single day. But yesterday two significant things happened. First, I've been telling myself that Im not gonna drink today, but Im gonna drink tomorrow these last 3 weeks. Yesterday was the first time since I became sober when I thought to myself ""Ugh I really dont wanna drink tomorrow"". Huge for me.

Second one was 10 minutes ago. So Im at the airport flying to see my family for the holidays. I used to be a heavy drinker at airports. I always saw drinking a few (which to most people means one or two before the flight, for me, it meant 6-7) beers before a flight as something I could treat myself to because Im flying so I have nothing better to do.

Today however I went there and bought a water bottle and sat down and I didnt even realize drinking beer was an option until I saw the people at the table next to me. Just getting rid of that urge/automatic process of heading to the bar feels like a huge step forward to me.",15

He chose a brewery to meet up (not aware that I didn’t drink as I haven’t really advertised this). What an opportunity to test my resolve! Not just any brewery, but one of my favorites. Anyway, long story short I spent three hours drinking water and having a great conversation with these two guys. I was sharp, I remember every moment and I feel like I’m really going to fit in. They both were great about the not drinking thing, very supportive. I’m fact, my friend was asking how I decided and mentioned how he was needing to cut way back too. Anyway, the rumors are true people, you CAN be around alcohol and you can have a lot of fun without it!

Last night I was at an Xmas Party and felt close to cracking under the pressure to drink. I had an idea and decided to drink a shandy. In case you dont know, shandy is about half a pint of beer and half lemonade. In the UK, people often drink them if they are driving as the alcohol content is low.

  This turned out quite well for me, as I was able to have about 3 pints of it and felt next to nothing in terms of being drunk. 

  No one noticed I wasnt drinking proper beer, I even felt like I was having a proper beer at times. I knew it was never going to get me drunk as it must weigh in at about 2.5% alcohol or something. 

  Just saying as I felt before I went out I might crack, and was glad I had the idea. Especially as the night looked like the kind of night where people would stay out very very late and get really messed up.

  Obviously it's not ideal for people trying to quit totally, but I would definitely do it again if I find myself in that kind of party circumstance. I guess Id need about 15 of them or something before I got drunk, and of course that would be impossible. In fact, after Id had 3, I was feeling a bit nauseous from the sugar and took myself home.",10

I said that I'm not drinking and they say ""Oh yeah, a soda then."" It felt passive aggressive because they know I don't drink soda either. 

How do you guys handle this? 

Do you think they are acting out because they know they have a problem too?",5

Plenty I didn’t agree with in rehab. It being 12 step based having god shoved at me constantly while being an atheist could get annoying needless to say. With that said, something I did take from it that certainly rings true is not only positivity in most things, but that focusing on others and not yourself is certainly something that helps and makes you feel much better than any drink does!

It isn’t per se a “problem.” I would have once said that years ago. Now, I only drink 1-3 days a week, usually 2. Those are heavy days, though. Very heavy. I live in NYC. It’s easy and it’s social.

I’m trying to get off of it for at least a month or two. I want to save money and get my marathon time down about 10-15 mins. My training and exercise will be greatly improved without alcohol. I know I can “stop” things. I quit smoking after 18 years as a heavy smoker (almost two years quit 🎉) Drinking is the one thing I have trouble going without for long periods of time. 

Anyone have any advice as to what helped them get away from drinking? Mainly, the social aspect and the occasional cravings. How to loosen up? Etc etc 

Any advice is appreciated",4

I knew the day was coming but for some reason I posted two ‘Day 70’s in a row and so day 72 snuck up on me. Normally, no biggie. But 71 days is the longest stretch of sobriety I have had since I finished breastfeeding over a decade ago. So today is my new high score!

I am so happy about this, even though I don’t really care what the numbers are. I used to think a number like this was such a huge obstacle; how could I ever stay sober for two months or more??? So, I am happy to have broken through a former hurdle. 

I now have much more faith in my ability to stay sober long-term and am able to even believe I can stay sober for life, which is my goal.

I hope those out there who doubt or wonder if they can beat their previous best feel somewhat lifted by this. If I can do it, you can too.

2019-12-13 21:44:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eae3te/thoughts_on_alcohol_and_life/,Thoughts on alcohol and life,"I've been doing some thinking on why I drink and what makes me want to drink...

I realized it's a form of escapism, same with partying, binging tv, overeating, watching porn, gaming or whatever else...

Even before I started drinking at \~19(27 now), I had many of the problems with other things mentioned above, alcohol gave me the confidence to talk to girls and be more social, which for me as an introvert was a big thing and also partying was fun, but as time passed, the costs started outweighing the benefits and alcohol started creating problems of its own(money wasted, doing dumb things while drunk, which all came with guilt when sober and the sober me had problems living with it and so I started drinking daily for the escape, even without the party).

But when I think about it, now I drink just for the pure escapism of not being able to cope with my life sober because(even before alcohol) I used the other things above besides alcohol just to not think about my life for a moment...

The realization is that I feel less, I feel unworthy of living the good life that I want to, have a limiting belief and I also lack confidence and am fearful of actually living my life the way I want to and dealing with my problems, I feel weak...

So now I'm gonna start telling myself that I am more, I am worthy, I am confident and not afraid and I also want more out of my life, more out of my relationships, more out of my career, I want to respect my body and I want to feel good every day, no matter what happens...and I am worthy of wanting to feel that way, I deserve it... and alcohol is just holding me back and making it even harder to feel good and happy. I know it's easier said than done, but I am my biggest hater, there are plenty of hateful people in this world, I should start by stopping hating on myself first and start doing something to make myself love me and my life again.

Thanks if you read this, maybe some of you can relate.",8

He brought a few of the new to town Athletic Brewing NA Double IPAs with him as I had mentioned I wanted to try it. We sat and talked over a beer, an activity I have not done in 7 months. We talked about being sober, working in the industry as he is also sober and it was great. I stopped at his bar later on and the bartender said “You go sober on us?” Yeah I said. “Good for you man. Proud of you.” We had a conversation about what I do to fill all the time I as we all know the day seems to really open up when you’re not drinking. He made a good joke that I’m the several sober stretches he has had, he gets upset at all these sober people who haven’t invented flying cars or anything yet. “If this is how much time you have why haven’t you figured this shit out?!”

A guy I know from around town came in and sat down by me. He’s a good looking guy (I’m a dude, but real recognize real) and then the most shocking thing came out of his mouth. “He you got any NAs?” We got to talking and he’s been sober since March, and we shared a wonderful sense of solidarity. Enjoying a beverage at a great local business on a Friday while keeping the promises we made to ourselves. 

Can’t explain how good it feels to be in the 6-7 month range and can finally feel like I can tell people and not have them assume something terrible has happened (even though it did). It’s great to find your crew and the acceptance that comes with it.

I am killing people. A legal drug dealer. And even though I recognize that fact, that it is poison, I cannot myself stop. The culture of the shop is welcoming, with great guys working for me, and 98% of the customers a joy w/out issue. But then, there are the problem drinkers who come in daily, some of the ""former customer"" which I have known of them to die from drinking. When openly discussed in the shop, often it's said, ""Well, if they don't buy it here, they'll buy it somewhere else so why not here?"", and it makes me feel like shit.

Still working on getting sober and I am at day one again. That being said, I was hoping to get some thoughts on an idea I have.

First, some background. I don't drink constantly. When I am at home, I can control the urge. My wife helps keep me accountable too (she has a small home breathalyzer).

I drink when I travel for work. I usually have a few beers at the airport. I dont drink at meetings. The problem is that once I am at the hotel and done for the day, I binge drink. Usually enough that I pass out and sometimes blackout. 

My work has a strong drinking culture with several kegs on tap at the office for people to enjoy after hours. But, they are very progressive. We have numerous people in recovery and they are not looked down on.

I have been thinking of disclosing my issue to my boss and his boss. That way, I cant drink at company functions nor place booze on my expense report. I tend to do better with my sobriety when there are systems in place to help me get through things. My therapist says ""Be smart, not strong.""

I think it's because when I was drinking, I would use that as a reward for doing a job well done.

Will be working it to help distract myself. Been working like crazy picking up hours where ever I can. Anything just to keep me busy. I worry what will happen when I stop, so for now I'm just working and keeping up with hobbies. Whether that's books, working out, art. Just stuff to keep me distracted. 

Been thinking of therapy lately. I read a line once that roughly said I'm not an alcholic because of my past, but because I'm an alcholic the sooner I realise that the better. Where I do believe this to some extent there are pieces of my past that I keep stored up and the dark reaches of my brain. I have AA for my addiction, but actual therepy on top of it cant make things worse.

As the title says says I'm on day 18. This time round the urges to drink havnt been terrible. I believe this to be because I sought out sobriety this time instead of fleeing to it out of making an ass of myself while intoxicated. That being said there's this little voice that's telling me how good I've been, and what's just one drink. I know that's the addiction talking, and where that road leads. I like being at day 18 and only want to see that number increase. If I listen to that voice who knows when I can get to day 18 again.

That being said I hope you all have an enjoyable sober weekend with me. I wish you all the best.

On a whim I decided to move back to the city where I was from to be closer to family, also thought it would be better carreerwise and had a feeling drugs would be harder to find there.. I moved and tried to be sober for a while until the same scenario happened. I went out and a strange drag queen offered me a shot that I didn't refused I had maybe 10 after, also found meth, coke, mushrooms and ketamine at the party. And the two days after I had the worst hangover. And decided to go to a meeting and have been sober since! This was the first successful attempt I had made being sober and I had tried on and off almost since I began drinking at 13-14. Now three years after I can say that those years made me more secure, I have a higher self esteem and I finished a novel that's being published next year. But I have feelings of doubt. Was it all that bad? Why am I being sober again? Why can't I have a glass of wine? Why can't I take speed and hang out with strange people in strange places and dance and be less inhibited? I still don't have a functioning romantic relationship, I'm mostly better in terms of energy and mental capacity and I look better I have to say. But I still feel weird sometimes and I still feel lonely? All of a sudden I have this urge to use substances that I havent had in all the three years and three months. I want it to stop! And sometimes I want to shed skin and feel I don't have to have the burden of feeling like an addict and let myself free. Would be happy to hear your thoughts of relapse and if you've ever doubted sobriety.",4

She's tired and finished with waiting for me to control my drinking and now she is just about done with me - - she is scared to take our relationship to the next level and think about a future together (we've been together 8 months). Its scary cause I know exactly why she feels that way. It's a two-prone problem -- I drink too much, and I'm stuck in my career after being laid off. The thing is that they're directly correlated, it is my DRINKING that has caused ALL of these problems, in both my relationships and my professional life. I've decided to list them so that hopefully it gets ingrained in my mind that booze is the root of my problems, and that I need to stop. 

**The Ugly Truth about my Drinking**

* Wetting the bed in High School and College
* Becoming dependent on booze as a social crutch
* Low Self Esteem and Confidence issues
* Drinking every night of the week, drug use on weekends
* Poor performance at work --> stagnant career --> poor reputation in work/industry
* Personal finance struggles (Debt)
* 2-3 day hangovers - Anxiety/Depression- that vicious weekly cycle of the work week and the weekend
* Confused about how to make my life better
* Embarrassing blackouts
* Drinking until passing out
* Drinking \~50 drinks a week
* Drinking in mornings to cure hangovers
* Multiple arrests related to drinking throughout my life (I'm 32)
* Feelings of hopelessness and self-hate
* Losing a girl you were falling in love with

So when you’re on shrooms, you don’t really know how drunk you are until it’s too late. I didn’t eat anything. I also haven’t been smoking weed and that night I a smoked a blunt. Next thing I know I’m cross faded as fuck and in the bathroom with my head in the toilet. The homie who invited me kept knocking on the door and eventually I opened it and I was speaking gibberish. His night was probably ruined because he was watching that I stayed alive (not literally) but yeah. I felt like I couldn’t articulate the words because of the shrooms to say that I was ok. I feel embarrassed because I brought the shrooms and made it seem like I could handle my shit. I just drank way too much. 

The next day I was hit with major depression and anxiety just thinking about what went down and I didn’t talk to anyone about it. Felt like I total buzzkill due to my inability to communicate with anyone. I didn’t even apologize to the homie who took care of me. Just embarrassed cos I’ve known this guy for awhile and it was my first time seeing him. Life should be about growth and I’ve been growing in other aspects of my life and I wanted to show those people I hadn’t seen in a long time that I was a different person.

I used to be a beer snob.

I've had another challenging week.  It's basically the norm now.  I'm trying to find some sort of middle between not minimizing my suffering while not falling into self indulgence .

Behind the counter at the store was one of our local most coveted beers.   It's a seasonal that comes out once a year and often sells out in one day.  And there it was.  

My beer snobbery gave me a license to drink to excess.  I wasn't an alcoholic.  I was different!  It was a hobby not a problem.   I was supporting local businesses and was somehow able to justify it when a brewery supported some sort of cause, especially something to do with the environment. 

They had a few of those beers at the store,  the highly coveted ones.  I'm going back there later today to pick up some groceries for the evening.  I will have no guilt in purchasing San Pelligrino and cookies.   Because by purchasing the San pel and cookies instead of one of those beers, I'll still be coming out five dollars a head.

And when did we ever have just one??  Id've probably bought all of them they had.

When I first became a sobernaut, I'd avoid alcohol aisles.  Being unexpectedly confronted with that beer would have created a cascade of thoughts.  Due to the challenges I've been going through, I'd probably have caved in.   But not then, and not today. 

Apologies for formatting and typos , as per usual posting from mobile, and if you're drinking or doing drugs, I believe that's your God given right, but don't post about it here.

Tonight I'll be doing some mundane things like laundry and dishes, going to the store, and drinking fancy mineral water and eating some non GMO cookies.   No longer a beer snob, just an ordinary snob now.

I’m so proud of myself I can’t even explain, and I’ve never felt so healthy, alert and alive. However, I’ve pretty much put my romantic life completely on hold that entire time because well, staying sober was more important at the time. Now, I really feel like getting back out there into the dating scene but I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that I’m really really nervous about how it’s going to work. I mean, 99.99% of first dates that have ever happened on planet earth occur at a bar/restaurant for the exact reason we all know. 

My biggest worry is that my coming out as an alcoholic is something I would prefer to save till I’ve gotten to know someone a little bit, but because most people will probably want to go out for a drink I’ll have to bring it up right off the bat...

If anyone has some words of wisdom for me, I’d really appreciate it. I can’t get over the idea that being a sober individual drastically reduces how appealing you are to others...

Lastly, I’m sure many of you will caution against dating someone who drinks, or advise me to find another recovering alcoholic, but I’m resolved to not let alcohol run my life anymore, and as such I don’t think I should let it decide who I get involved with romantically.",13

I was arrested for a DWI about 6 months ago. I had a horrible drinking problem that last for 7+ years. Blackouts, fights, traumatic experiences, near death, constantly disappoting everyone in my life, destroying my health, & doing things that I can't believe I did.

 I was terrified as I sat in jail for the whole weekend. All I could think about was losing my job & professional career. I thought about the continued cycle of disappointing my family & friends. Always saying that I'd do better next time only to continue to make bad decisions. Those 48 hours in jail was exactly what I needed at that time in my life. When I was released, I told myself that it was time to change. Actually change. 

A few days after I was released, I went to my first AA meeting. I got out of the car and asked the guy sitting out front if I was at the right place. That man turned out to be my sponsor & a truly influential part of the past 6 months of my life. He has mentored me in my sobriety journey and taught me many other things about life in general. He's taught me about failure, forgiveness, & success. If I never got that DWI, I never would have met him.

After I got released, I also made the decision to seek counseling. I finally gained the courage to speak openly about my past and confront issues that I've been holding on to for far too long. I got to the point where I am comfortable with who I am as a person. I feel comfortable that I'm an introvert and it feels nice to not have to put on a mask of extroversion that I could only achieve through drinking alcohol. I've learned to defeat my problems head on and not resorting to delaying my problems by going to the bottle. If I never got that DWI, I wouldn't have had the desperation & willingness to finally confront my problems.

After I confronted my problems, I finally felt free to move on with my life. I finally had the time to get my life in order & live it to the fullest. Spending more time with my family, taking my dogs on hikes, finally learning to play guitar, & studying all of the subjects that I've been interested in for a while, but never go to because I spent my free time drinking. If I never got that DWI, I wouldn't have rediscovered my life.

Every night when I go to sleep, I have so much peace knowing that I don't have to wake up hung over. I haven't felt that peace of mind since my teen years. If I never got that DWI, I wouldn't be able to regain that peace.

Getting a DWI sucks at first. I've spent $5,000 in attorney fees, my license is at risk of being suspended, I will have a misdemeanor on my record, I will have to go to tons of classes, and pay many fines. However, if this was the price to pay to truly be open to regaining my life, then it is all worth it. Thankfully, no one got hurt in this situation. I feel that this experience was a monumental point in my life that set me on the right path. I hope to look back at this DWI and realize that it was the best thing that ever happened to me.

If I didn't get that DWI, I wouldn't have rediscovered life.",19

My dad is an alcoholic but has never attempted recovery. My mom was an addict her whole life until she passed away last summer. My sister and a lot of my cousins are in recovery. I never thought I was an alcoholic.

I started drinking at 13 and have been a heavy drinker my whole life. I never thought I had a problem until this summer. It started for me in April. After a heavy night of drinking with my wife and her sister I woke up from a blackout and my sister in law was gone. I later learned she had woken up to me standing over her naked and saying I thought she was my wife. She left that night and held a gun to her head. Thank God she never pulled the trigger.

My amazing wife wanted to work with me. We saw a couples counselor, I went to an addiction counselor and I attended a few AA meetings. I told myself I wasn't addicted to alcohol. Just that I have a problem with abusing it. I never stopped drinking I just started to hide it. I didn't believe I needed to stop drinking because I thought I could control it.

A few weeks later my wife became pregnant. We were still in a tough spot but the pregnancy brought us closer together and we were doing well. I stopped drinking around her and when I was home. I travel a lot for work and would drink whenever I was gone.

Last week my wife and I got in an argument and she said I needed to stop lying to her and trying to hide things. Last night, on a work trip, I went out with my boss. I drank way too much and called my wife to tell her I had drank cause I knew she would see the credit card bill. Even though I called her to be honest I still lied while we were on the phone. She told me she doesn't want me to come home.

I'm sitting in an airport waiting for my flight and looking for a hotel in my own town. I hate myself. I know I have a problem now and need to fix it.

I am terrified my wife who is 7 months pregnant with our first kid will never want me to come home. I am going to miss the birth of my kid because I will be in Afghanistan. I only have 2 months to earn my wife's trust back before I leave and I don't know how. 

What if I lose her? What if I never get to meet my kid? What do I do?",1

Dealing with post partum anxiety issues led to daily nightcap, and eventually to the doctor for meds. They dont dance well together, so I chose meds over wine. 
Its gonna be a bit weird over christmas! Although this is actually my second stone cold sober christmas in a row! Planning a hot cocoa party instead of the usual german sugar-on-fire-wine ceremony the family usually does. I cant spell it. Lol! 
I dont want to be a daily drinker, and the way the meds interacted with the wine had me BLACKOUT SMASHED after my normal 2 or 3 glasses of wine in the evening. That was SCARY. I couldn't even string a sentence together. Thank goodness my husband sat me down and was like ""um, you dont remember this, but it's a problem."" I took it as a huge sign of respect that he was honest with me right away. I'm still shaken up and freaked out about it. The thought of being that out of control is so scary. Now that I have been sober a week I have started dreaming again. I realize just how destructive drinking every day is to my WHOLE BODY. I dont ever want to get like that again!! It didnt seem like a big deal at the time, but after only a week I am thinking HOW did I not notice how f*cked up it is to feel that way all the time?! Cant see the forest through the trees I guess. I'm a little worried I'm already deluding myself with the 100 days thing. I dont know. I just want to feel normal. My husband is stone cold sober with me, and I dont want to feel like he is missing out on my account. But I really want alcohol to eventually be a special occasion thing. Not an average tuesday thing, certainly not an every day thing, but i dont know if i am ready to say NEVER again. I dont know. 
Anyways, just had to get that all out there with people I think might get it. Thanks for reading.",2

I feel a little self conscious coming here because I feel like my drinking habits don’t hold a candle to most alcoholics, but they’ve caused me grief and a kind stranger from r/opiatesrecovery directed me here, so here I am I guess.

I got into drugs when I was 14. To make a very long story short, I started smoking meth, switches to heroin and crack at 16, ended up on the streets for three years, kicked dope and rocks, came to a new city and got myself a cheap little apartment in the projects. I handled things very poorly and started drinking more than I already was. I was a lot more reserved with alcohol when I was on heroin, because mixing booze and dope is a really easy way to die. Once I quit I started to drink a lot.

I woke up this morning and didn’t remember most of yesterday. I must’ve gotten in a hell of a fight because my ribs are severely bruised (hurts like hell to breath), I’ve got a black eye, and my knuckles are shredded. My window is smashed in, which is probably why I woke up with glass in my hands. Or it could be the 40 smashed on the kitchen floor. I have a nasty gash above my eye that bled a lot; waking up covered in blood is pretty alarming. No big deal though, head wounds bleed a lot even when they’re not serious. My bottle of benzos was just about full, now it’s just about empty. My wallet is a whole lot lighter. I also can’t find my .38, which is very very very alarming. 

The reason I’m quitting is because stuff like that is a regular occurrence. I’m just starting to get my life on track, but if I keep drinking like this I’m going to end up back on the streets and then probably back on heroin. So yeah, I’m here.

The folks at r/opiatesrecovery are suggesting I go to a medical detox center since kicking booze and benzos at the same time could kill me. I’m looking into it. Any advice would be very much appreciated.",4

I can go out and buy a bottle of wine and sit at home and watch a movie and drink wine.  But I will try to send my daughter to buy a 2nd bottle.  I can't buy 2 bottles at once or I will drink it all.  I drink until I black out.  I have been working on that. When I go out with my husband, he drinks slowly so I will set myself to follow his pace but I always finish my drink  when he is halfway through and drink water until he is done.  I still get drunk/tipsy but I can remember the night, at least.  Am I the only one with this problem?

He took me out to eat 5 times with the express Intention of breaking up with me in a public place. neutral grounds. But when I asked him once we were seated if that was his intention, he said no. So then he just yells at me for everything I do for 3 months and says he just needs some of his own personal space, so could I move to another room. The whole time I kept saying “I know what you want to do, but you need to say the words. I want you to tell me “. Which he didn’t. So to avoid seeing him and being yelled at I started drinking ALL day so I’d be asleep Or too tired to hang out. 
But the drinking was killing me. Not him. I texted him and asked to call me. Because certain things have to be done face to face. He broke up with me over FaceTime. Coward. While I’m thousands of miles away. 
Of course I instinctively thought. I need a drink. And then I said. I don’t drink any more. So I did yoga instead.  And I’m not even sad he’s leaving because he is not the same man I fell head over heels in love with.

In reality I only ever enjoy the first hour maybe two maximum of drinking then it's a downward spiral of consequences.

What my brain is telling me right now:
- I can go and have a few beers, go home at a reasonable time and it'll be fine 
- I'll have fun and get to socialise and let go 
- I'll be less stressed and have a really fun evening 
- There won't be any issues 

What will actually happen:
- I won't be able to stop and I'll get black out drunk and embarrass myself 
- I will bail on my boyfriend and cause another argument that's my stupid drunk's fault 
- I'll wake up in the morning feeling sorry for myself and continue drinking 
- I'll spend all my money and won't be able to get to work next week 

Then after all that I'll some how feel sorry for myself?!

Nah it's not happening, not today. I'll see you at the bar with a lime and sofa folks.

I got where I am today with a couple of books, a couple of podcasts, and this sub.  That and a willingness to put in the work was all I needed.  And before anyone murmurs something about ""not a real alcoholic"", I spent 5-6 years as a daily drinker.  Then I transitioned from that to a binge drinker for another 6-7 years.  I've done the morning drinks to ward off the shakes, I have done the multi-day nonstop benders.  I suffered the increasingly worse withdrawals.  It had a pretty full grip on my life.   But with the knowledge that others had changed before me, and the determination to put in as much work as needed to achieve the same I finally set to changing.  And I worked at it like it was my second job.  I studied and I practiced several hours a day, every day until I got back to a normal life, just an alcohol free one.  That took me a few months, and it was the best investment of time I ever made because I continue to reap its benefits every single day.

I'm 22 years old, and I live in Upstate New York. I'm on a path of bettering myself, and I've found these subreddits to be really helpful. I could certainly use some opinions or advice moving forward.  


I've stopped smoking weed and I'm currently on day 4. Out of anything, that's been one of the biggest helps. But with this lifestyle change, I'm also quitting alcohol. Its very weird how our minds work sometimes...  


So yesterday I had 1 week without alcohol. I figured I'd go over to my friends' house and celebrate his birthday with him. I SWORE to myself, I wasn't going to drink. At first, I told myself I'd have 1 drink, and I knew I could do that. But as the day went on I thought ""Wait... who controls me? I do don't I? I think God would want me to be disciplined and not drink, so I won't drink.""  


I get there and long story short, my awkwardness is illuminated in situations like these, its something I'm coming to terms with. I did end up having a drink. It just goes to show how powerfully our associates and environment impact our actions. It's not a HUGE deal, I just wish I hadn't done it. Can't change the past though  


Anyways, it was a great reminder of why I am quitting alcohol as well as weed. Granted, when I drink its much easier talk to people. But its also much easier to say things I don't want to say, smoke weed I don't want to smoke, or accept drinks I don't want to accept. Any amount of alcohol also tends to make me suicidal and unable to control my thoughts. That's not the type of person I want to be.  


It is frustrating because I REALLY like the people I was hanging out with. But I also find myself going in a different direction than they are. I'm not better for it, I just want to be different than most people in their early 20's. I'm not going to allow myself to be someone who parties or allows a lack of discipline. I'm going to set myself up for a life that's truly fulfilling and happy.  


I've found these subreddits SO helpful. It's a good way to get my thoughts out of my head. Anyways, we're back to day 1! I'd really appreciate any advice or tips moving forward. I'm not beating myself up too much for this small mistake",1

So, after the first few days of sobriety (my honeymoon period), I started to realize I didn't feel any ""better.""  I longed for the magical experience of waking up and feeling great and all that stuff I read about on here.  It just wouldn't seem to come.  I still woke up groggy, foggy, grumpy.  On days off, I would lay in bed watching youtube until noon.  Everyday my mental state wavered between flat/emotionless to depressed.  I tried to focus on the positive things happening, but I didn't enjoy anything.  I didn't look forward to anything.  I was just tired and existing.  Seeing other people claim to feel amazing shortly after quitting became frustrating instead of encouraging.  I wasn't craving alcohol really, I was just disappointed that quitting it didn't seem to improve my life in any noticeable way.  I did see my doctor during this, got a little boost from her being clearly proud that I quit, but she advised me to hold off on any sort of treatment for depression to let my body chemistry level out (I wasn't at all suicidal, but she did give me her personal cell # in case things ""got too bad"").  She's a pretty awesome doc.

So anyway, jump to the night before last.  I was sitting there watching youtube and suddenly felt restless.  I *wanted* to do something.  So I grabbed two kids and two dogs and we went for about an hour-long walk.  Afterwards, I didn't feel happy or anything, but satisfied I'd actually done something.  Then yesterday (my first day off that my family was at school/work) I got up early and made myself breakfast.  I fixed a bunch of little shit around the house and deep-cleaned a couple ceiling fans.  When my wife got home from work we went to the grocery store.  After the store, I was taking a shower and realized something:  I'd gone to the store and *had fun* with my wife.  We were laughing, joking, being dorks, all the things we did when we were newlyweds almost 20 years ago.  I can't remember the last time I was in a store and not anxious or grumpy or worried about money or just tunnel-visioned.  Last night me and my wife couldn't stop giggling about a stupid fart joke while we were in bed.  *I was enjoying life.  I was having fun.  I was looking forward to the next day.*  

This was huge!  I finally am starting to feel the greatness of sobriety.  So, thank you all for just being here, giving me something to read when I'm bored or thinking about throwing the last three weeks away or just looking for hope.  And for anyone in the first few weeks that's still struggling to ""feel better,"" know that for some of us, it takes time.  Sometimes probably much longer than me.  Just stick to it.  (I imagine the fact that I hadn't gone more than a couple days sober in about 18 years has a little something to do with my delay).

I never got black out drunk and I always felt like I knew my limit, but it was a constant for awhile in my life. Two days ago after being drink-free for almost a month I had some beers with coworkers at a holiday party. Cue me driving home and getting pulled over...first DUI charge and first time arrested for that matter. I live in AZ so they’ll be harsh. I have a lawyer and am financially prepared for what is going to happen to me. Just wanting to let you all know I wish I would’ve taken these stories and experiences on stop drinking more seriously. I’m one of the “it would never happen to me” guys. Well it did, and I’m going to be paying for it. My job and school aren’t in jeopardy so that’s a plus, but I’m still scared of the uncertainty. Just wanted to post my story now that I have one. Today is day 2 of being a sober, hopefully for life. Absolutely not one plus to alcohol besides it feeling good momentarily.

I am more patient albeit sometimes irritable...lol

What I also have noticed is there gaps that I know realize I have..stories or experiences shared to me by friends or family that I have NO recollection of...""Remember, when I told you about..."" SO I fake it...but it is troubling at times. Doesn't happen often but enough for me to think thank god I will remember this conversation.

I also realize how I minimized the drinking  I was no longer a binge drinker but a daily drinker.

The best part, The bloat and beer/alcohol belly is getting smaller!!! I have lost 5 pounds although I am eating like a horse!  


Lately,  I feel a bit sick to stomach but  I think that s normal. I have had a lo of excess anxiety However, I am going thru a lot and it's that time of months (sorry guys!) and that always makes me feel anxious (hormones I guess)...

The DUI was the absolute WORSE thing that happened to me yet it has FORCED me to stop drinking. I will NOT risk jail for a drink! If it was not for the DUI and probation I would not have made 14 days. I know this so for that I am grateful. 

Thanks for listening.",12

I was really excited, kind of nervous but mostly excited. But I just feel like I keep screwing everything up, making an ass of myself, and struggling. I can’t stop criticizing my every mood, thinking everyone hates me and is judging me, for my weight, my appearance, being clumsy. I rode the bus and metro from the airport and this really nice guy helped me figure it out and I really appreciated him, he was so helpful and sweet but I could tell he just thought I was a total fucking ditz. I guess he’s not wrong. I used to be so smart and confident. I was outgoing, talkative, could make friends with anybody. I was witty and fun to talk to. Now I feel like such a fucking loser. I stumble over my words, have horrible anxiety, insecurities, and just wish I could disappear. I destroyed my developing brain with alcohol and drugs and now I’m fucked. What kind of dumbass struggles to catch a bus or doesn’t know which TSA gate to go to? I know I’m kind of beating myself up, but it’s really really really hard not to. I hate myself so much. I was at a bar the night before I left for my friend’s birthday, and I just wanted to disappear. All I could think was everyone hates me and I was probably right. I finally got into the city, late, my Airbnb host was frustrated with me, and I was tired and frustrated too so instead of going out and doing the things I put on my itinerary I just napped and cried all day. A whole day of my expensive ass trip wasted because I cant do anything right. What’s the point in sobriety if I constantly feel like this? What’s the point in not drinking when I’m already a total incompetent jackass sober? What’s the point in abstaining and not taking the edge off when I’ve already destroyed everything in my life? I wanted this to be a good trip, and I know all of the negativity and shitting on myself and pity party isn’t helping. I’ve been trying so hard to be positive about everything, meditating, doing yoga and cheesy affirmations, trying so hard to believe them, but at the end of the day I’m still a fuck up. I don’t know why I thought this was a good idea. And I don’t really want to drink, but like the idea of going to a bar and talking to someone after a few like a normal fucking 21 year old sounds really really really nice. It sounds like a vacation in and of itself. I just feel really really worthless and dumb. When I went to NYC, I got drunk before my flight and puked on myself in an Uber an spent the whole first day laying in bed in my hostel feeling sorry for myself. And now I did the same thing, minus the drinking and puke. I was so much more confident then at least. Now I just feel so overwhelmed and literally all I did was get on a plane, ride a bus and the metro. I don’t wanna be like this anymore. I wanna be normal. I wish I could tell anyone how I feel, but I can hardly be honest with myself, let alone the one friend I still have or my family. I’m really really struggling. I hope today is better. I know tonight will be good at least for a few hours because I’m seeing my favorite band, the whole reason I came here.

We had a vote in my country last night, I wont argue political views, but in short the party I was counting on lost and I was gutted. I've been waiting for months to see a mental health professional which will undoubtedly by extended now.
I didnt know what to do, and so drinking immediately presented itself as an option. Who cares if the NHS crashes, I don't need to notice if i stay drunk long enough. Who cares if my income is further reduced, or if I have to limit by prescriptions due to cost, alcohol is cheap anyway.

But I didnt drink. I really wanted to, but I went to bed instead. Easier said than done, but I managed it, and today though I've woken up to a government in shambles I've woken up in my own without a hangover.

The next few days are going to be hard, for a lot of us I'm sure. Hell, the next few years even. But being at ""war"" with the world isnt an excuse to continue the war I have with myself, if any thing it's another reason to keep my body and mind clear. God knows the NHS wont be there if I ever need to detox again.

This subreddit has been so inspirational and helpful in my growth away from alcohol, so thank you for your openness, honesty, and understanding!

Being free of alcohol has actually given me the ability to love myself again! I can’t say that quitting drinking is going to make a significant impact on everyone’s mental health, but it really helped with mine. I feel clear and focused and much more in control of things like my anxiety. It’s also helped make other healthy lifestyle switches easier to accomplish. I feel more productive, and I am not certain that I would be passing grad school if I hadn’t made the choice to quit early into the program. 

Things that helped: La Croix, Sparkling Ice, a partner who basically supports my decision (bonus: he drinks very rarely), additionally quitting a lot of “bar friends” and being involved in something positive, stimulating, and challenging. Getting into a hobby that adds value (new or old). 
Edit: FWIW, I started on La Croix. Now I’m on Sparkling Ice (but that’s is even more expensive AND single-use plastic). Roommate has a soda stream so we are going to start making our own soda as part of my new year’s resolution to reduce SUPs (and save money).

So so many posts from people nervous about Christmas parties, dreading dinners with their families and even running away to a tropical island like me.

I just wonder where we went wrong collectively as a culture? Is it just too many emotions compressed into little time, winter blues or pressure to indulge in the shopping feeding frenzy?

I just feel like every major culture has their own festivals but I really wonder if as many people dread them? And are there that many incidents of violence and drunk driving? And suicides?

Also are those jingles in the stores deliberately designed to make us hate this time of year?

Anyway, just some random rambling thoughts. I am honestly gobsmacked by the number of holiday posts I am seeing on here.

THINKING OF OTHERS

Our very lives, as ex-problem drinkers, depend upon our constant thought of others and how we may help meet their needs.
— ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 20

Thinking of others has never come easily to me. Even when I try to work the A.A. program, I'm prone to thinking, ""How do I  feel today. Am I  happy, joyous and free?"" The program tells me that my thoughts must reach out to those around me: ""Would that newcomer welcome someone to talk to?"" ""That person looks a little unhappy today, maybe I could cheer him up."" It is only when I forget my problems, and reach out to contribute something to others that I can begin to attain the serenity and God-consciousness I seek.",6

So productive on a new project that I decided to stay until nearly 12 am working on it. As my business partner and I finally decided to call it quits he went to the office beer tap and poured a beer. Looked as me and asked if I wanted one. I did. Badly. That’s what we do at the end of the night. Drink a beer from that keg. 

I said no I was too tired. He didn’t make a face or question anything. He doesn’t know how bad I get as I always remove myself after the first couple drinks. 

Instead I drove to my favorite dinner, ordered a turkey club and sat at the counter watching TV for an hour.  A full belly helps prevent me from making a quick stop at a local watering hole. 

I’m now back on my couch at my house my safe place. The one place where I know if I can make it to by 9pm sober that I won’t be drinking tonight. 

Melatonin mocktail for me. Then after a little TV I’ll go up to join my wife in bed where she will kiss me good night and I know she will be proud. Because I smell like turkey club and gravy. Not vodka.

My school project was a Zine (short informative booklet) that I decided to do about drinking habits as a college student with alcoholism stemming from both sides of my family. I didn’t start drinking until college-sophomore year, mostly because it scared the absolute hell out of me. Besides the inherit addictive personality I was bound to have, I also lost people very close to me from drinking and driving, so it’s not something I’ve ever taken lightly. Come college, and when I finally decided I was mentally ok enough to take my first drink, I could tell it was going to be harder than I thought to control my habits. Come Halloween this year, I had way too much and threw up for the first time from heavily drinking. I can’t even describe how disgusting I felt about it. I never wanted to follow in the footsteps that resulted in so many deaths around me- but I can so easily see that happening and that scares the shit out of me.

So that’s where the project came in, because it’s been something on my mind as of late. I scoured the internet looking for people around my age going through similar things, but instead found this sub. The comfort that I have been given for knowing that other people are in the (generally) same boat at me is great. I’m not looking to stop drinking altogether, but cutting back and understanding the role alcohol has in my life is something I’ve really been working on since halloween. I read the stories posted in here daily and I’m not 100% sure why, but it has given me so much more confidence in knowing that I can take control. Alcohol does not have to define me as a person.

Friends to talk to about work and life. I kind of knew this would happen but most if my friendships have all but ended since quitting drinking. I'm okay with it and feel like I've grown out of most of them. When I was drinking i considered them good buddies but all we ever did was drink and I still want to stay away from booze and cocaine and really had been growing out if these friendships before I even quit.

But I'm having such a hard time communicating lately. I think it's because I haven't spent time with anyone other than coworkers in months. Now when I talk at work I'm too fired up or I'm too honest. And I've started gossiping, not in a mean way, I just can't seem to keep a secret. That's new for me and I hate it. It's going to impact my perception at work and maybe has already. 

I have a couple friends that live elsewhere, and I see a therapist every other week. That hour though has turned into me venting and I just can't stop. I think the reason I'm always word vomiting is because I need more interaction involving real connection with other people. I work in a fast paced and high energy place with lots of people around, so I'm not alone all the time, but I am outside of work. 

I have always enjoyed being alone. I prefer it. I dont want to go out and do things after work, I feel weekends are for me time. I don't feel lonely, but I think I am. Has anyone else felt this way after quitting?",2

I don't understand.  Why do I HAVE to hit rock bottom? Why can't I just make the conscious choice to not drink and seek therapy for better coping mechanisms for my triggers?

And I swear my 4 year old notices, just feeling like a better mom :)

Anyways, my concern now which I guess goes in hand with me quitting drinking is my other old (and new) habits popping up. My old habit of smoking cigarettes came back. It’s not like how I used to smoke (about 1/2 a pack a day) but I’ll get some at work and occasionally at home. I go a day or two without. I guess a newer habit of mine is binge eating. I eat at night. And usually it’s not junk food because I keep my house with healthy food, but I’ll eat a lot, making it very unhealthy. I’m not putting on too much weight (yet) but I put on some. I go to gym which sorta balances it out. But I get slim then gain then lose and eat and... it’s a vicious cycle of that.

I guess I’m seeking advice. What’s up with that? I know people say it’s replacing sugar, but I was like a weekend warrior binger type when I was drinking alcohol. Why is my monkey brain looking for more ways to binge or engage in other crappy habits ?

I am recovering from a torn ligament in my knee and have been unable to do my hobbies for about 3 months. Have a month left supposedly. I make art sometimes but that has been a struggle lately. Long story. Used to be my career and has a lot of baggage with it. However, I have not made any friends here in CO through my hobbies despite trying pretty hard to do so. I've found people to be extremely flaky or too cool, unlike my time in NYC. Not drinking also often presents an issue, as beer is such a part of the culture here. 

I do exercise fairly frequently. I go to the gym 3-4 days a week. I actually wrote this last night upon getting home from the gym. I haven't had luck with meeting people in AA here, or outside AA.

I'm indigenous and fiercely proud of my traditions. 
I was raised to know who I am, where I come from, and how important it is to carry on this knowledge. 

I'm indigenous and I'm an alcoholic. 

It's the gift that keeps on giving. 

It has its seductive and merciless hands wrapped tightly around our beads. Our songs. Our way of life.

It sat smugly in the corner of the room while my father told me stories of his father, and stories of my grandfather and his father. 
I listened closely, cross-legged and doe eyed, blissfully ignorant to its unforgiving nature. 

Naturally, I walked into adulthood just as an insect approaches a venus flytrap. 
It welcomed me with opened arms. A dear friend that has been apart of our family for decades past.
A familiar parasite. 

I laid on the bathroom floor, a place where I'm sure many epiphanies have been made before. 

""You're killing me."" 

Silence. 

Who am I talking to? Myself? Whose fault is this? I demand to know! How far back must I go to find the answer?! 

But now I realize that the past simply is. 

So, I bear the weight of this gift that has been given to me and I fight every day to stay standing. 

When my children tell their stories of me and my grandchildren tell theirs, you will not be there. 

I will live a life my ancestors could be proud of and I will hope that I am the last to carry this burden.",65

I won't give you the full run down but basically I'm in my mid-20s and have had a problem with drinking for about 5 years now. I've managed to stop drinking for a few weeks or months at a time in the past without too many side effects. It'd usually be anxiety and cravings on the first night, a bit less on the second night and the third night usually wasn't too bad. 

Recently I somehow managed to make my way to uni which has always been a big milestone for me. I'd managed to convince myself that once I got here I'd be some miraculously changed person, but my alcohol intake actually got worse (surprise).

For the past 10 weeks I've drank pretty much entire bottle of vodka every night. I suddenly realised how disgusted I was with myself a few nights ago and forced myself to change. Day 1 I had half a bottle of vodka and a glass of wine and woke up with pretty bad anxiety. The next day I only had a bottle of wine which I drank throughout the day and the anxiety and dread was almost unbearable. I had about four panics attacks. The next day was slightly improved but still pretty bad, but I didn't drink at all that day. Today is my second day totally sober and most of the day hasnt been to bad, until it hit about 8pm (when I'd normally start drinking) and the anxiety and dread has crept way back up again.

The weird thing is that I haven't really had any cravings as if yet, I'm just wondering how long it takes for this horrible anxiety to go? I've never experienced anything like it but at the very least I feel terrified to touch caffeine at this point, let alone any alcohol.",9

I just feel so conflicted and confused because I know I shouldn't be drinking. I know it's bad for me. I know it's killing me (poor liver). But there's still a part of me that keeps telling me that I deserve what I get when I drink when I try to stay sober. Or that it will take away my anxiety or depression.

I don't really get it. Can anyone relate? How can you want to stop drinking because you know it's ruining your life (work, relationships, health, etc), but keep drinking because some part of you thinks you deserve that.

How do you break that cycle. I want to quit. I really do. I don't want to die a horrid, painful death. But I'm really struggling to stay sober (I can get sober for a day or maybe two, but it keeps falling apart).

Any advice or experience would be appreciated. Thank you all. I really appreciate this thread. Even though I have not been able to stay sober, the few days I have accomplished have been from reading from others on here.",3

Lurker here, but posting now mostly because I need to. I have a serious drinking problem. It started around 20, and I am 33 now. I drink everyday. I used to have huge sugary tall boys at almost every meal, but I gained so much weight that over the years I started drinking liquor and wine to cut down calories. I have since stopped liquor, but my wine is the problem. I drink an average of 2-3 bottles a night. The expense is also something I could do without. :)

I went through a terrible marriage, and he was a drinker too. That's when it escalated, and I finally kicked him out or it would have killed me. That's when it became the worst. I smoke a little W from time to time, and the best luck I've ever had with quitting was when I was smoking. Even so, I haven't for a long time because it isn't legal in my stupid state. I'm looking into CBD oils, and I will give them a shot. 

It's discouraging though, and I know I need to stop but I just can't seem to. I'm good during the day, but at night it's this monster that claws its way out. I've started to get so angry with myself over it, and I am so sick of my stupid bullshit. I would give anything to be someone different...just be apart from myself. Ugh. 

To give myself credit, I have reduced the amount I drink and even slowly tapered down the wine. Even if it's one or two glasses, I just need some. It seems more psychological at this point; more of a habit I can't break. Stupidness. 
I want to stop. I am a strong person, and I can force myself to be sober if I have to, and I have. But I sweat and shake my way through those days, white-knuckled with anxiety. I'm so depressed, even at the onset. I feel like I'm losing a friend. I cannot tell my family, they are not the sort of ppl to be supportive instead of judgemental. 

Also, I have no real reason to quit. Other than...I just should. *shrugs* I feel like I need cleaned from the inside out. Some days, I feel like I will just die this way. Which is so dramatic, but true. I'm going to try though. We'll see if I can just do this whole one day thing.",4

I am going through a LOT right now.  I recently had to have surgery and I've been feeling pretty down about not feeling good for such a long time.  I cried today and I cried yesterday, but then a few moments ago I thought about how much worse this all would be if I was still drinking.   
I'm feeling down for sure, but it's not accompanied by crippling anxiety and panic attacks.  I am going to the doctor tomorrow and it's amazing that I get to say my health is great outside of what I'm dealing with from the surgery.  


I think this would have been my rock bottom if I was still drinking.  I think I would have lost everything if I went into this the mess that I was.  But instead, I get to struggle through a hard time like a normal person and come out like a boss on the other side.

I hit 30 days last Sunday. Even when I was celebrating with some sparkling cider and a movie night with my brother and his g/f and our roommate I was still wishing I could celebrate with something stronger. Then something happened.

I don't know why, or how or what. In the past 4 days I feel like a brand new person, or maybe just the person I used to be. I saw something beautiful and I felt myself get emotional. I laughed really loudly at something I thought was funny. I listened to music and was just absolutely passionately loving it. All these things I thought I only felt when I was drunk. I GOT drunk in order to open myself up.

But I got it back. Stone cold sober and for the first time I feel like I'm experiencing things. Really experiencing things. If you are a few days in or a few weeks and just hating it. Hold on. Make it past 30 and I hope you experience something so profound and beautiful. I believe in you. So don't let me down. And as always, IWNDWYT

Like really put some effort into it this time. For me, drinking has been a boredom killer. I've strategically built my life and career for maximum free time while still having nice things like a house and gadgets and all that, but somehow drinking snuck in there over the last 5 or 6 years. I write everyday from 5 to 10am. I run. I work a little. After noon, I might play a new song on the guitar, game, or watch something. But its that 3pm to bedtime window that gets me. 

About every other day now, I'll bust out the Titos and drink till I stagger off to bed. Its just what happens. 1+1=2. I have no delusions anymore that its not problem. Absolutely is. I just keep doing it. I have that glass that I know exactly how much to pour (right up to the line of the small blade of grass). I have my number. I drink 6. Did some research and found out that 6 is actually 12. Pouring doubles in reality. I watch a movie maybe. Move onto youtube and blast music for a couple hours. I've been good not to embarrass myself in drunken texting (too much) but the texts do go out. Somewhere in there I end up putting the cats in their room and finding my bed.

There are simple things I used to enjoy that took a backseat to drinking for a long time.  It turns out that I like to write, I like music and video games. I like soccer and baseball.  I like coffee and getting up before dawn.  I like working out before work.  Most importantly, I like me.  I'm okay.
2. My alcoholism is most certainly a symptom, not the underlying disease.  I had heard this many times before I decided to quit drinking and never really bought into it.  Not to get into semantics (alcoholism is a disease unto itself, I do believe that), but as I get to know myself again there are feelings that crop up that make me go, ""Yeah, that's one of the reasons you drank so much.""  My anxiety and paranoia levels are high.  I can actually convince myself logically that those feelings are coming from inside my head and I can get through the day, but it takes a lot of energy and I worry that one day I won't be able to convince myself.  I still struggle with personal interaction and really don't know how to talk to people sober.  Just general conversation seems very difficult.  I can not read social cues.  I do feel like most of these can be overcome.
3. I'm actually a pretty good employee and I work hard.
4. The progress I've made over the last year (and the utter failures before that) has convinced me that I will never, ever reach my goals if I am drinking.  I will not have a loving  relationship with another human being and I will die broke and alone and at a young age if I drink.

Calling all creatives.,"I started drinking heavily at the age of 18 when I got accepted into uni. I binged drank on the weekends and well, you know how it goes. I graduated in 2016 when I was 21. Since then, I’ve pretty much drank every weekend-some binges-some not. And I’ve only taken a two month break (which felt fantastic) at the beginning of this year. 

I’ve always known I wanted to do something creative with my life. I wanted to make music and shoot music videos and all that jazz. Somewhere along the way though between age 18-25 I lost my way. Like that Rocky scene where he’s talking to his son, “you let someone stick a finger in your face and tell you you’re no good.” I’m guilty of allowing a lot of people put me down. I feel like this had a lot to do with my drinking

Side note: I went through something traumatic when I was young and this trauma resurface when I began drinking at 18. So since then, I was no longer drinking to socialize or party, but rather drinking to numb the pain. Whenever I’d drink to numb the pain, I’d still try to make sense of that traumatic event which caused more pain and self esteem issues that never quite healed. 

So anyway (lol just gonna sweep that under the rug real quick) i feel like drinking really hindered my ability to grow as an artist because I was so hard on myself. Have any of you become more creative since quitting? How has quitting initiated that creative spark within you?

2019-12-12 11:25:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e9pr5q/i_get_higher_with_sobriety/,I Get Higher with Sobriety,"Hey SD.

This morning I was reflecting on drinking; particularly, my relationship with it.  

I'm 29, and I've had a history with drinking since I was a teenager.  I've had some pretty close scrapes with the law, but have somehow miraculously remained unscathed (and for that matter, so has everyone else thankfully).  Since then I've realized the magnitude of putting others' lives at risk for the sake of my night out, and that helps keep the keys out of my pocket.  But that's another story.

Over the last year or two, I began to question my relationship with alcohol and started to make an effort to change it.  For the record, I was a regular six pack of IPA a night at the least, or perhaps half or a 750ml of liquor (I'd be more descript but any sufficed).  It started with baby steps – not partaking tonight, make plans for the early morning so I have a reason to spark my day up, etcetera.

Then I quit drinking for two months.  Important note: I read *This Naked Mind* during this period of time, and it had an impact. At one month, I got a pretty crazy high from how amazing sobriety felt.  I could end my night in a more positive light.  Sleeping was an issue at first, but even at that speaking from research, the less sober sleep was better than more drunk sleep.  It felt great to not senselessly bicker with my girlfriend over things we would regret in the morning.  MORNINGS EXISTED!  Hobbies formed, and they actually took hold because I had more time where my motor functions weren't impaired.  I digress and will just say, sobriety created a realization for me that there is much more to life than living by the bottle.

Since then, I've had a few setbacks.  There was a family wedding, a few parties, but my relationship with alcohol has become significantly different than it was in the past.  I say this just to mention that IT IS OKAY to have setbacks, as long as you're still aiming towards the same goal.  But recently I've gone two weeks again without drinking, and as I mentioned earlier, that high from sobriety is coming back.  My brain is beginning to function again without battling a substance.  I get a natural high from grabbing the opportunities the day presents without being impaired.  Bear with me, but I made a list of the things in life that get me high and it felt REALLY GOOD, so I'm going to share it.

I get high from having a morning routine.  This routine is less likely to happen after a few drinks the night prior.

I get high from being able to practice the piano well into the evening without losing motor skills.

I get high from reading a book to sleep as opposed to passing out.

Weird flex, but I get high when I think of 5 things to add to the grocery list at night and remember to write them down in the morning.

I get high from being able to train 2x a day. (NOTE: I highly recommend exercise with a partner i.e. martial arts, dancing, etc.  Being close quarters with a partner will make you not want to blow boozy breath in their face and if you choose martial arts, you'll soon not want to show up after a few drinks cause you feel like garbage.)

I get high from being able to formulate thoughts and communicate on a clearer level.  I am a better representation of who I truly am.

The list can go on.  And it feels so damn good. 

So wherever you're at in your journey, you're here scrolling through r/stopdrinking for a reason.  You're either curious of sobriety or are already well on a mission, and I hope with that comes great clarity at some point and with similar realizations and experiences.  Keep fighting the good fight, and thanks for reading.

I needlessly lost a good friend Monday to a decade’s long stream of vodka.

It’s hard to process.

I saw this person go from a respected tradesman with a thriving business and a gorgeous house to a man dying for a drink and dying from drinking.

This once hulk of a man who skied with me, played hoops and softball with me and laughed with me — a lot — became a shriveled-up guy looking years older than he was.

I feel guilty about his death a little.

I wasn’t a great friend at the end.

A handful of years back, he said he was seeking treatment, and when he called me to give me the news as I drove home from work, I literally cried in my truck.

I couldn’t believe he was going to do it.

I was so psyched for him. Those were happy tears.

I admittedly had kind of given up on him before that, especially after seeing the once strong skier and snowboarder tumble multiple times at West Mountain on trails we always slayed — because he was drunk before noon when I picked him up to go.

And then there was the time he was doing work at my house and for whatever reason, I watched as he went to his car “for a part.” Through my dining room window — at about 11 a.m., I saw him pull a fifth of vodka from a cooler on the back seat and chug it.

Maybe those instances help explain the tears when he told me of his rehab plans.

I had just bought a rental property and he was going stir crazy to avoid drinking, so he’d come help me with odd jobs. I’d also drive him to get groceries and bid on jobs — because his license was long suspended.

But the license issue was going to get taken care of really soon, too, he said. He had a plan to get it back.

I was so happy for him.

I wanted that guy back, the guy who could make anyone laugh with his intellect and wit and infectious laugh. I wanted to see him thrive again.

But as the weeks went on, talk of getting the license back to resume a productive life seemed to always be a next week or next month thing. There was always a reason why it hadn’t happened yet.

But he wasn’t drinking, he told me. Which was great.

But he was drinking.

Other friends were telling me they’d seem him drunk in local pubs.

Like most of his friends from the past, I, too, kind of went by the wayside, occasionally seeing him at gatherings and reading Facebook posts, but we drifted apart.

Maybe he was ashamed at his inability to kick it. Maybe I was too bummed at the failed attempt and his fibbing to hide it.

In recent years, it was clear by his appearance that he was drinking heavier than ever. Relatives recently told me his kidneys were failing.

I think I half expected the news I got Monday, but it still shocked me and our friend group.

We all have the same feeling: what a sad waste.

But I know it’s a disease. I know he was obviously powerless over it. And his intelligence must have made it that much harder to deal with every day.

I was recently thinking a lot about him and thinking I should be a better friend and reach out to at least let him know I’m thinking about him.

I didn’t do it in time and I’ll live with that.

Godspeed old friend. Hope there’s lots of laughter for you again now.

He said he tries his best every day to incorporate the 4 ideas on the card.  When he did so he was always able to find peace and serenity in his life.  With peace and serenity, he said, always came happiness.  I have to say, his little card has never let me down in the last 6 years.

A few weeks ago, I told my wife that I was done, for good this time. She supports me, said she's proud of me, and has spent some nights not drinking, but I can tell she doesn't really believe I'm done for good, which in itself is not really supportive.

(This is long. adding TL, DR at end.)

We purged most but not all of the alcohol and there are still wine glasses basically everywhere in our house among with flasks, coozies, shot glasses. If it was up to me, every little sign of it would be gone but I'm willing to compromise. 

I helped make this mess and can't expect too much change all at once, other than what I have been fortunate to feel and receive myself. 

We have a series of holiday and birthday gatherings coming up, and I'm nervous, because she tends to go extra heavy at parties. I'll be the DD which I'm fine with, glad to be doing as a point of pride, but I'm already dreading the drive home if she's more than a little buzzed. It just breaks my fucking heart to see her drunk.

I do see she's trying to cut down but not enough for me to feel at all like we are doing this together. I work from home so we are always together, but I'm feeling more and more alone. 

None of this makes me want to drink, but it makes me constantly on edge. I can work on me, but this is not exactly wind in my sails. I love her more than anything, but we both need to quit if we're going to have the lives I think we both still  want. I guess I don't know what she really wants.

Worst part is, I can see how much I've allowed things to become this way. Other than being an example and finding my own escapes, which only provides more nights alone for her, I feel completely powerless as her husband when it comes to alcohol. 

We can talk, but mostly only about me. If I knew how to say these things it might go just fine, but I'm afraid of being too controlling, or a hypocrite. Everything she's doing, I could have totally done, if she had quit when I wasn't ready. This is so messy. I just want my life and my wife to be ok. 

TL, DR: I'm looking for help staying strong, for both of us, with a spouse who still  drinks, and doesn't seem to get that it is still hard for me. Meanwhile, we have social events to get through and I'm fearing the worst. How do I talk about this with the one person that matters?",14

I had it, the moment where I knew I had to stop drinking. It was me on my back, down the stairs being helped up by my roommate. I was crying from the embarrassment. Never in my life, had I an event like this. A slip on a couple stairs, sure, but never a backwards flip down the stairs with great pain. 

The ironic part is all I had to drink at the party (everyone had a great time and I did nothing to embarrass myself. I actually left when I felt I was getting drunk.) was one shot and about six beers, nothing more. I could finish off a 12-pack at home and only get a buzz.

The face injury will not go away anytime soon, I will tell people the half truth. I fell down the stairs but not because of my drinking, ""Wouldn't you know it? I just slipped!""

The roommate who helped me just checked in on me. He asked me what I drank and I told him. He said it must have been the shot that did me in. He said that six beers should have been nothing to me. ""It is very weird that you got drunk and were vomiting. Maybe someone put something in your drink. It is a miracle that you did not die on those stairs.""

I'm very thank full for this group. We all have a story that we own, with similarities to each other. Please reach out to us, or let us reach in to you. The present-always-sober life is my preferred choice, and that's honestly what it is, my choice. I didn't realize how important this journey was until I started it. Alcohol is a high way with plenty of stop signs, but it's way to easy to keep on that high way than STOP and turn off to a sober life. I'm present. I feel everything, the good, the bad, and the ugly. I can drive anytime without thinking. Since quitting I've had some health scares, and gained 10 lbs, but ya know what, I'd rather be a little heavier if that's what it takes. I reply with ""just a lift style choice"" when people ask why I don't drink, and i understand that those who who quiz me about it probably have challenges themselves. You have to busy yourself, find and learn what you enjoy, find what kind of support you need (and don't need). Life is better now. And I want a good life. I'll keep this brief, and not an epic. It can be done. 1 decision. Every day. Plan this part of your life, figure out what it'll take, a new job, no job, therapy, a move, a pair of old running shoes, medication, move in with family, telling everyone, telling no one, new friends, or old friends.

2019-12-12 08:37:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e9nnr2/22_years_old_drinking_in_excess_but_some_how/,"22 Years old, drinking in excess but some how functioning, looking to make a change. Advice is appreciated","Hey, 2 years ago in the space of just a few months, my best friend died at the age of 18 due to a drug overdose, my grandad passed away, my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer and then my nan passed away, only for my 13 year old dog to die literally the day after. I quickly slipped into drug addiction (ketamine, alcohol, benzo's & opiates... I was completely fucking out of it), and to make things worse my girlfriend of 4 year left me for my childhood best friend.

During my addiction I got involved with the wrong people which has inevitably led to my arrest, where I am potentially facing some serious charges. I never sold drugs personally but was 'asked' to help someone who I was in debt to, threatened with the fact that they knew where my family lived.

Anyway, determined to get better I saved tirelessly so that I could spend some time travelling and away from all the nonsense. With time I actually found I started to feel better, and slowly but surely I can finally say that I am in a good place and rid of all the bad feelings I had in the past.

However, I have come to realise that I had replaced my drug addiction with serious alcohol use, and although I am functioning very well in my studies and with my own business.. I have a seriously seriously bad relationship with alcohol.

Almost immediately after waking up I will open a can or drink a glass of wine, If I don't have alcohol I feel absolutely terrible with sweats and mild depression, incapable of being able to work. If I haven't had a drink all day and I am heading to a pub or to the shop to pick up, I recognise an extreme feeling of joy and excitement, which I feel so guilt about because it's not normal.

I've drank so much in the past 2 years (approx 2 bottles of wine a day/8+ cans daily) that I have now developed stomach pains with the only short escape being to drink it away...

I have so much to live for, my life is going great and I am excited about the future but I just don't know what to do about this grip alcohol has on me. I feel like I can't get passed the first few days of sobriety because 1. I feel to shit and 2. its too readily available and as a student I am surrounded by the drink heavy life style.

I have spoken to a doctor and plan to begin a detox program in January, but that's a little while away.

So, I just wanted to hear from people who have struggled and are now maybe doing better, how did you get over the initial stages of ridding themselves of this fucked up legal drug? And can life be the same without it? As it currently stands I feel like I perform better on alcohol, but the rational side of me thinks well if I'm successful with it imagine what my capabilities are without it.

Thank you, if you too the time to read and I seriously appreciate any help/advice!",3

The problem was it never stopped at just taking the edge off. It stopped when I passed out. It stopped when it was gone and I couldn't really get any more.
A lot of the times I couldn't remember when it stopped, waking up the next morning hungover.

I've been sober nearly 3 years. Nearly all of them a struggle. I would be lying saying I hadn't thought about drinking. Rampant insomnia that always plagued my life (due to the stress) was wreaking havoc on me.

Then I went with my wife to one of our traditional Pet Smart outings. We bought a collar for our littlest, oldest dog. It came with a disc in it that was for relaxing the dog. I could smell it without even trying really.

Then a funny thing happened.

I felt sleepy. I felt tired. I felt relaxed.

I had a medicine cabinet stock full of sleeping medication. I had just cycled off Zoloft. And here a damn dog disc scented in lavender had done for me what alcohol did for me for years.

I nearly cried at how it felt.

And now I have a lavender diffuser.

Point is, screw alcohol. It just comes in convenient packaging. It may take you a while to find your replacement, but when you do, nothing, will, stop, you.

This sub, This Naked Mind, and taking it one day at a time (really, you just have to make it through one day).  Every aspect of my life is better; some just a little better, some a lot better.

I've paid off 3 big debts, 1 more to go.

My skin is smoother, my eyes clearer even though I'm full-on middle aged.

Each morning, I look forward to the day instead of laying in bed berating myself for drinking (and inevitably eating) too much the night before.

My pants fit better.

I have more patience and less anxiety so I can handle stress sooo much better.

I feel good about myself so I stay out of other peoples business more, I stay out of the gossip at work, I've learned to walk away.

I can trust the conversations I have with friends are open and honest rather than one sided and sloppy.  I've learned to listen.

Every night, I clean my kitchen so every morning, my kitchen is clean.

I've begun to purge my house of unnecessary items.   Each week I take a bag to Goodwill.  Goodbye, crap!

I joined a little group of adults who play volleyball just for kicks each week.  It's so fun.  We aren't good but we do laugh a lot!!

I don't doze off at work hardly ever anymore.  Mostly never.  Sometimes it's slow at work...

I feel genuine.  I don't have a dirty little secret to hide.

After reading TNM, I feel like I can have a more comprehensive talk with my 2 teens about alcohol.  It really opened my eyes to the role alcohol plays in society and in our lives.

I'm actually looking forward to the Holidays and NOT having to rely on alcohol to get me through.  God, it feels good.  I wish the best of luck to all you who on this sub.  You all are doing great just to be here.  I wish I had found this years ago.  I thought AA was the only avenue for getting sober and I never wanted to label myself as ""alcoholic"", but I knew my life would be better if I quit.

I wanted to be there to help, and I thought they all might sleep better with a man in the house.  We got her into treatment and over the months she got better.

There is alcoholism in my family.  For years I didn’t drink.  When I was young, I noticed I tended to binge drink.  For years I stopped drinking completely.  Friends introduced me to good scotch and bourbon and I really like them.  I like them too much.

Last week my youngest step daughter saw me pouring a drink and asked, “More alcohol?”  I cannot lose my wife.  I cannot let my girls down.  I have to stop.

So we had my workplace's big Christmas do last night - free food and drink, live band, about 400 people there, probably. I had OH come with me as I knew I would be a bit nervous - the man who assaulted me in February, hereinafter referred to as PNG (for persona non grata), would certainly be there. PNG and I had been friends still, last Christmas, and I had strong memories of being his shoulder to cry on last year about his woman troubles (this was a bad idea, but at the time I didn't know that). I was stressed about that and I wanted OH there as support too.

Over the course of the evening I was slowly hit with a really interesting thought about myself. Usually at work parties I'd have had a couple of drinks over the course of the evening to get through it - to help myself feel at ease in the throng (I hate crowds) and to feel more social. Last night, without alcohol, I realised how shy I actually am, and how for years I've been using alcohol as an aid to being 'part of the party'. And then of course once I get going I have trouble stopping, and then everyone goes to the pub, and then... you all know the story from there. I couldn't get through the night without drinking because without alcohol, I hated the experience.

Last night I was my unadulterated self, and I realised - I don't have to alter myself in order to be 'better' at socialising. If I hate big parties, I hate big parties. I'm allowed to hate them! It's okay to be shy and not super good in large groups. Better to save my social energy for smaller get-togethers when I'm not already stressed out by the setting.

OH and I met the people we wanted to meet and then went home. It was fine. We had a quiet half in the pub around the corner from our flat. I woke up this morning feeling great.

It’s pretty magical and has helped me turn my mood around plenty of times. 2. I want to tell people who are still fighting, struggling, or suffering that there is hope. You can change. We can move forward. The best practice seems to be to get as many helpful tools as you can and implement them for realz in your day to day life. Here are the ones I’ve been using: therapy (someone who specializes in alcohol/addiction), exercise, meditation, journaling, and community!

I work at headquarters for a pretty well known women’s clothing company. That day they were selling leftover samples for $1!!! I walk in and am able to find some leggings that fit and buy them. Instantly feel better and head off to work. 

I was still cranky and just downright sad when I left work. I couldn’t even put my finger on why. Blaming the hormones. Really kind of wanted to drink to numb that away and feel happy. I didn’t, I went home and relaxed. Felt back to myself today. Im glad I didn’t drink and that everything worked out ok. It feels good to be going to the gym and working out everyday. That distracts me, and losing the weight I gained motivates me. I’m going to be visiting a special someone soon and I want to be looking and feeling good.

My blood pressure was alarmingly high, I was overweight, liver enzymes were 10x over normal amount, pretty much every vitamin level was extremely low, and my heartburn was so bad I was put on prescriptions for it. Basically every vital function was suffering. I couldn’t wait for this appointment. She didn’t even recognize me at first. I’ve lost 17 lbs, heartburn completely gone, blood pressure perfect, I’ve dropped my anxiety medication, quit smoking, quit drinking and left a terrible relationship that was making me even more depressed than I already was. She just couldn’t believe it. She cried with me and hugged me. It was the best day ever. I thanked her for believing in me and never pushing me too hard since that wouldn’t have worked anyway. She always listened and took time with me and sympathized. She knew I was suffering but didn’t make me feel like I was doing it to myself. Making her proud means so much to me. Thank you for letting me share this with you all, because you have offered this same type of support to me throughout the last 2 months and you helped me make her proud. I’m not crying you’re crying.

And of course it lands on a Friday...and Friday the 13th at that! 

My alcoholic mind is sad that I waited so long for my birthday to fall on a Friday. It's my addiction telling me well, that is a waste of a Friday. My birthday finally falls on a weekend and I wouldn't have to miss work the next day because of a hangover. I'm like, this birthday Friday is wasted because I won't be wasted. How sick is that? Another thing that is kind of full circle is I don't have a job to get up for either way because I quit my 9 to 5 because my alcoholism was managing my life. I quit to go to rehab last month. 

The good news? The sober part of my brain is nervous yet excited to see how it all turns out. 
I got out of rehab couple days ago and there is NO WAY I am drinking on my birthday, but felt I should post. Age 29 will be a good year!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!* 
  
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!** 

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

And here we are in phase 2 of the week haha.   
  
I hope everyone had a pleasant Wednesday. Mine threw me some big, unexpected curve balls. HOWEVER, while I definitely THOUGHT about drinking, it never really came in as a serious consideration. There was no debate over whether or not to go to the liquor store. The thought came, and then it passed.  
  
Baby steps, right?  
  
I am sure there will be days/times where the feeling comes on much worse.... but I know that 53 days ago, I DEFINITELY would have been drinking right now!!!  
  
  
Instead, I will have a good sleep and wake up refreshed tomorrow and deal with the problem :)  
  
So IWNDWYT!!!  
  
Also if you're interested in hosting a future Daily Check-in please let /u/sainthomer know. The only requirement is 30 days of sobriety under your belt. I've REALLY been enjoying getting the chance to get to know everyone a little better :)",53

We met at a board games club and played a bunch. I had two ginger ales, no one commented and it was a hilarious time. I laughed so much for the first time in ages.
It was also awesome perspective too. I sat next to someone who has a bunch of mannerisms that really irritate me and I've come to realise it's things I do (or similar) and don't like about myself. We're both really anxious twitchcy perfectionists. She had several more drinks than everyone else (normally we'd be matched or I'd be ahead), and she got really loud and sweary, tripping over her words, rules lawyering the games and also not keeping up- all things that I used to do. (I'm actually always a bit sweary).
Anyway I stayed til the end and even though I kind of wish I left at half time when some people did I'm also glad I saw the dregs cos it's a good reminder of how I don't want to be- how I used to be only two weeks ago.

I had to get tests done for unrelated minor reasons, and asked the doctor to check my liver and kidney function as well, just for fun.

In 2017 I was admitted to the hospital for gastritis, severe withdrawal, and vomiting blood. I was shaking like crazy, had a big hole in my stomach lining, and later found my liver was swollen and starting down a bad road. The doctor told me he had never seen higher enzyme numbers on a 22 year old man.

That was the beginning of my journey with recovery, and in January 2018 I finally quit for good (yup, even all that shit didn't keep me from drinking for another half year). I've never felt better in my life, and sobriety has been such an incredible gift in ways I find difficult to explain. I am so glad this all happened to me.

I'm coming up on two years now, and my liver and stomach have completely recovered. My doctor said my labs looked like those of a triathlete.

If you've ever worried about your liver, googled anatomy charts to find out which organs were the dull pain you felt, vomited blood, or had severe panic attacks from alcohol -- know that you are not too far gone. You can choose sobriety and get your health back. The human body is incredible if you're​ kind to it.

If I had kept drinking, I'm certain I'd be dead by now. There is no doubt in my mind. It's funny how things happen at particular times.",23

I had decided to start treatment the next day, and I wanted to feel it one last time, so I got blackout wasted. I was afraid about starting a new life, and desperately wished I could drink like a normal person, but I knew I couldn't, and I knew I needed to change. I tried a few times on my own, couldn't make it past a month and a half. I guess I didn't know if I actually ever wanted to get sober. Like usual, I got uncontrollably drunk as hell. 

Three months later, and wow, I have a hard time believing that I thought about alcohol that way. Like a dear friend whose death I had to grieve. I'm so much happier and healthier now! My entire perception of life is different this moment. I don't have to stay trapped in my own mind and relive my past anymore. I can appreciate all of the people that lift me up and support me!

One big overarching theme for me has been drinking to deal with sensory overload. I typically experience sensory overload once a week, but when it's happening, it's debilitating.  Drinking allowed me to numb everything and isolate myself. Before I say anything else, I've never been formally been diagnosed on the autism spectrum or with any anxiety disorders. I have my suspicions, but growing up, my mom just wasn't the kind of person to advocate for my mental health like that. But now I'm 24 and I'm trying to take care of myself. I hope to see a therapist starting in February so I can actually talk to someone about what's going on in my head. This is a journey I have to go on sober.

It has become amplified lately by cocaine and social media. The alcohol issue has been a thing for many years and I fully accept that I have a drinking problem. Blackouts occur frequently and as of late have happened nearly every time alcohol touches my lips. 

The issue for me is not a physical dependence to any substance. I can go several weeks without consuming drugs and alcohol. I don’t experience any urges and as a result it has been difficult for me to admit or accept that I have a problem. 

I have had my fair share of fucks up. From nearly getting busted for a DUI to insulting friends and family while under the influence. After each of these episodes I feel shame and anxiety which has taken a toll on my self-esteem. To make matters worst I have a tendency of posting shit on social media when I’m blackout. I have friends/family/coworkers and my boss who follow me on some of these platforms. It has become routine to wake up from these blackouts and immediately check my social media and delete the mess I’ve posted the night before. I work in a professional field and this behavior is unbecoming to say the least. 

So far I have been extremely lucky that my blackouts haven’t led to me loosing my job or led to any injuries or death. It seems as though after every reckless episode I just run through the same cycle of shame and anxiety until I eventually feel good enough to drink again and the cycle repeats like clock work. I get an invite from a friend and out the door I go thinking that this time I will be able to control my drinking.

My drinking has also fucked my relationship with women. I broke up with my ex due to my drinking several years ago and haven’t had a serious relationship since. It’s hard to meet women when you’re shit face. The irony is that I go out drinking with the intent of meeting women! I feel like an absolute idiot because I just keep repeating the same behavior over and over expecting a different result. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I felt like I needed to put something down in writing as a first step.",3

I’ve had an “off” week. My husband is gone for the week, my schedule is off, my work project has turned into what I wish was a prank....I mean, it’s not my best week. 

So this week I am beyond grateful for little diversions- those small things that amuse me.

When I take a break to read a book, I focus on the characters and not all the chores I have to do.

When I watch my current tv obsession (Survivor), I can worry about whether or not my favorite guy will get voted out (sadly, usually he does). But I’m not worrying about deadlines so it’s a win!

When I go play with my animals, I can laugh at how goofy they look running around instead of focusing on how quiet the house is when I’m alone. 

Lately I’ve found that my appreciation for small things is really significant. I am thankful for those small moments where I can get my head out of stressful spaces and just be entertained.

Blood sugar down from ""pre-diabetic"" to totally normal.  LDL Cholesterol down to comfortably within normal range.

Somehow, luckily, my liver tests never looked bad even at the height of my drinking.  I know that's not true for everyone and that I am extremely lucky there after two decades of use and 15 years of heavy abuse.

Sharing this here for two reasons.

1. I am excited and this sub (+ counseling) is huge part of the reason I've been able to get to this point.  So thank you all!
2. It took a while.  After a year sober, the blood sugar and cholesterol were still too high for comfort.

And I should add that it wasn't just the just blood test results that took a while to improve.  I was a mental mess for a while - anxiety, catastrophizing, bouts of depression and anger.  Generally not dealing well with somewhat stressful job.  This has all, slowly, improved.  Meditation and exercise help when I can stick to them, but I think more than anything its just been time.  Time to really dry out, heal, and figure out who late-30s me is and how I got here.

I hope this isn't discouraging.  It's not meant to be.  If you're early and struggling still, please know that things can continue to improve for a long time.  Stick to it.  It's worth it.  I'm sure I'm still getting better.  IWNDWYT.",16

My Name is Abby, and I'm Making Another Go at Staying Sober.","Hello there! I hope everyone reading is having a good day. I'm normally not the most active person on social media and usually stick to lurking, but since I decided to stop drinking again, I figured I'd start being more active and doing more contributing. Plus, I like having a space to talk about this kinda stuff, and I worry about being able to fully express my problems with drinking in a small town that doesn't have a lot of tolerance for queer folks.

So, in order to keep this short.

My name is Abigail, or Abby for short. I'm a 25 year old trans woman, and I stopped drinking for the first time right after I started transitioning. I'd struggled with booze for about about 2 years before that. I'd been hospitalized once, crashed by car once, gotten kicked out of a few places, and nothing changed my need to drink until I started being honest with myself about who I am.


For the first time in my life, I could be happy and feel emotions and be some version of myself without needing to drink. And for a couple of months, I stayed sober just on that feeling alone. The problem is that euphoria eventually runs out. I'm now in the doldrums of transition, the hard part that usually gets cut from the movie. The slow struggle of changing names, getting new clothes, getting family to use a new name, ect. I'd not ever really dealt with the underlying problem that led me to drink. I just covered it up with a new feeling. And eventually, I started drinking again.


It didn't take long to end up back where I was. More in control for sure, but turning to booze none the less. And I could recognize the patterns in my behavior, health and relationships and could see a glimpse of the future where I'd lost control and ended up back where I was.


So at the tail end of a vacation with my girlfriend, I came on here to steel myself, and decided to stop drinking again. 


Today's been the first really shit awful day I've had since I stopped, but I'm gonna get through it, in part thanks to y'all, and I'm gonna do it without anything to drink.


So. Thanks for reading, and here's to one more day sober.

2019-12-11 17:58:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e9es2q/my_experience_with_naltrexone_so_far/,"My experience with Naltrexone, so far","I started Naltrexone about four months ago. I am not keeping track of the days or weeks anymore since I believe it is counterproductive to my sobriety, as I turn a positive lifestyle choice into a twisted competition with myself (""Oh boy, 14 days!!""). If counting works for you, go for it. Just not for me.

My drinking started, probably llike yours, in high school. In my case my older sister was dating a guitar player whos band held kegger parties out in the woods. My friends and I begged her to take us to one and she did. My 14 year old self had his first taste of cold beer... and never looked back. The guitar player is long gone. However, I've never really put down that first beer. I've drank for nearly forty years, although I've never had a DUI, got into a fight, drank in the morning, got fired from a job or lost a wife. I've never gone to bed with an ugly woman (but I've woke up with a few... a little levity here). Beer is my poison. At my worst I would drink a six pack or more a night, 5-6 nights a week. Usual cycle: wake up hungover and guilty, recover, drink again. 

I've vowed sobriety in the past, at stretches of a few months or longer. My longest was two years. That was two years of wishing, hoping, praying I could  stop the on-off-on-off craving that became obsessive thought patterns that kept me far from my best self. Straight out of central casting as the standard issue ""white knuckle"" dry drunk. In short, I hated every moment of my sober stretches despite knowing it was best for me. 

Which takes me to Naltrexone. Being a drunk, naturally I am a terrible cynic, too. Naltrexone sounded too good to be true. Just the pharmaceutical industry scamming the vulnerable and desperate for a few bucks. It reminded me of late night TV baldness cure. However, after discussing it with my doctor, she wrote me a script. At that point I would have tried voodoo or putting a leach on my wrist for a bleeding if those things might have stopped my drinking.

To my total surprise Naltrexone worked immediately. Cynical me popped a pill, waited an hour before reaching into the fridge where an ice-cold Heineken was perched seductively on the shelf. I picked up. Waited. I put it back. No desire at all. That's a first. It's been that way ever since. It was so perplexing that I did try to drink a couple months later  -- not out of want but in the name of science. Yeah, ""don't try this at home"" type thinking. Here's the kicker: the beer did nothing. NOTHING. I couldn't even finish it. What I did drink gave me a headache. Same goes for N/A beers. I've found what I miss isn't the beer  so much is  the routine of it all. Popping open the bottle, holding the cold beer in my hand, the first drink. I miss that.

With my insurance Naltrexone costs about $15 a month. I pop one in the morning with my coffee. My doctor advised me to keep it up. She wrote me another script, this one for six months with the warning that this is something I maybe on for the rest of my life. Which is fine. My understanding is that you can't form a tolerance to Naltrexone. It does no harm long-term.

If you are struggling -- and if you are reading this now, chances are you are struggling -- talk to your doctor about Naltrexone. Best of luck.",11

Hello all, first time poster long time lurker here, today is my 100th day of sobriety. Apologies for the long post but thanks to those who stick it out to the end. I haven't really had the urge to tell my story but figured I should since the community here is so friendly. 

I'd always been ""the guy who could drink a lot"" having several pitchers of beer in an evening and be seemingly okay and relatively composed. I moved to NY about 5 years ago and pretty much would go to bars whenever I could since that's very much the culture there. Fast forward a bit, learned my fiance of about a year had been sleeping with a co-worker and ""loved him"" great. Kept up my drinking of course to compensate for emotional distress, buying bottles of the cheapest whiskey I could find and downing half a bottle a couple nights a week. I considered this practicing ""moderation"" I wasn't drinking every night so I must be fine. We all know how much of this is a lie now but alas. 

I visited my hometown for my cousins wedding for a few days, and ended up getting a DWI with a bac of above .15% I'd left a bar and fell asleep at the wheel and slowly drove my truck into a steep ditch and couldn't get it out. Still I continued to drink, all the time promising myself moderation.

Fast forward again, get into another relationship in NY, have to end it and end up breaking the girls heart and I couldn't deal with it all. Drank my brains out, buying beer, drinking all of it, and going back to get more multiple times. End up sitting on my living room floor with a utility knife to my wrist, wallowing in my pain that was only compounded by the amount of alcohol I had in my system. Luckily I have a few great friends and one came over and stayed with me and my other best friend literally flew from Seattle to NY that night to come stay with me for a few days.

I stopped drinking for about 2 months after that and things were still bad but at least the alcohol wasn't playing a part. I start drinking again, telling myself I would only do it with friends and not to excess, all lies of course. I moved back home and after a few months of constantly going out every weekend and getting blasted to blackout I got my second DWI, wrecking my truck into a telephone pole this time, totaling it. I can't describe the level of absolute dread comes over you when you realize you've hit rock bottom and I know for some it's worse but this was mine and it was awful. 

Since that night I haven't had a drop, of course its difficult and having a bond ordered breathalyzer is a pretty good enforcer but it's been my desire to never feel that way again that's been the real motivator. Today is 100 days and here's to many many more. Thanks for reading my very lengthy post if you had the patience to stick through it. 

TLDR: Life happens, I drank to get away from my problems, 2 DWI's later and I'm on the road to recovery.

Tonight, I enjoyed a pleasant meal and some nice conversation with people I like and respect. I had a good chat with my boss, which I won’t regret tomorrow.

I am not an alchoholic, well at least I don’t think so, but maybe someone may care to correct me.

I can live perfectly and happy without alchohol, I don’t actually have any need for it. However when I’m at parties or clubs or social gatherings, I sometimes feel like I (need?) alcohol to let loose and have a little fun. If I did not have a social life at all and did not go to parties, I would be perfectly fine without ever drinking alchohol.

Now hère is where my issue starts, I drink maybe 2-4 times per month and everytime I drink I get blackout wasted, wake up the next morning having to call my friends to remind me what I did before and I spend the next few days hiding and being so embarrassed to the pont sometimes I want to change cities because people probably now see me as (that guy whose always wasted) it’s so wierd that even if I don’t crave alchohol that much, as soon as I start drinking, I just cannot stop and loose all sensible inhibitions. Every single damn time. 

Does anyone else experience this ? I do understand that alchoholism is a progressive disease so maybe these are the early stages ? Well I’ve been like this for about 2 years now, every time it starts with 1 drink and I wake up the next morning (sometimes not in my bed) without any memories of the night. 

I do realize that it’s a problem that needs to be addressed in any case whether it’s alchoholism or not.

My habit was around a beer or two a day during the week and six+ beers on a weekend day. Due to alcohol poisoning when I was 16 from rum and later from whiskey in my teen years, I have not been able to drink hard alcohol at all since I was a teen (am 35 now)--so beer only for me, wine sometimes but it gives me headaches. The thing is, I had been drinking at least once a week, or a few times a month since the age of sixteen or so.

Anyhow--I was wanting to quit and I read a post on here recommending the book ""The Naked Mind"" by Annie Grace and I immediately bought it on apple books and read it in a few days. I took my last drink a couple days later to say goodbye. I wasn't sure how long I wanted to quit for but I knew I definitely wanted to quit for a month--something I had previously tried and failed to do last summer. It was actually very easy this time, I didn't have cravings, I didn't want to drink at all. Instead of going out for beers with my drinking buddies they came over for tea or we had dinner together. It was not as exciting but definitely didn't feel like I was missing anything either---hang overs were really getting to me. Social routines had to change and really that was the worst of it. I used to have a beer at home alone thinking it would cheer me up and then I'd get something done, like cleaning the kitchen or laundry--but that had ceased working months ago. Mostly I just sat around drinking my beer, looking at reddit and if I got drunk then I'd cry over whatever.

HOWEVER, August 11 wan't really really my last last drink (funny how I lie to myself, but it was an isolated exception). On Thanksgiving I decided to experiment. My host offered me wine and I had some. I noticed that after a glass of wine I wanted more and I had more. I did not drink enough wine to get drunk that night but noticing that immediate sense of craving to drink more once I had had one glass was really interesting. I did not drink after leaving that night and haven't even felt the need to drink at all since then. For me, it seems, if I'm not drinking then I'm not drinking--no cravings. But if I do drink, then it's hard to stop for the next few hours.

For now, I want at least not drink for a year or more. I'm still open to drinking on extremely special occasions but basically I see that it's not good for my body and if it's regular at all then my body will suffer. The book made me realize what I have really been doing to my body all these years with alcohol--that it is a poison. I recall when I was doing my undergraduate how in the fourth year I really lost the ability to comprehend what I studying---it felt like my brain was full and the last two semesters of classes I wasn't really able to absorb or digest. I think part of this was that I was studying very complex stuff and at the same time the fact I drank every weekend, sometimes heavily, took a toll on my ability to think. After quitting these 4 months (with the one exception) I feel like I learn faster and that ""soberness"" is actually really making the person I've wanted to be.",7

I'm still digging, but I'm digging sober. It's been a year and a day since my last drink, and I'm so grateful for the positive influences in my life. Down to my core, I'm a different person, and I owe so much of that to the good people around me.

My anxiety levels are lower, I have more free time and money, I’m able to be more honest with myself and others, I’m more productive, I’ve gained actual hobbies, and I’m no longer sick or dead tired half of every day. The best thing probably: I feel in control of myself for the first time in years. 

If anyone has any advice for someone going into their 4th month, I’d love to hear it!

From destroyed friendships and relationships, to hospital visits and near-death experiences, job firings, educational failures, self harm and more, I’ve had some pretty serious problems with my favorite self-medication. 
I turned 21 a few weeks ago, and the freedom of buying alcohol on my own accord has quickly caught up with me. I’m drinking more than I ever have. I’ve already even admitted to the hospital where my heart stopped beating with a BAC of .43, and just lost the best job I’ve ever had 3 days ago. 
For some reason, I don’t feel like I want to drink. For the first time, I feel fed up. I feel disappointed in myself to an extent I never have. I am disgusted with my destructive behaviors, and am terrified of what’s to come now that I’m of age. 
I need some advice guys. Anybody who struggled with alcoholism at a very young age, how did you manage to overcome it once you were granted the right to purchase it?
I never had the will power to deny it before, so how in the hell to I stay on track now?!
I feel as though it will be a long an arduous process, but I can guarantee one thing. 
That liquor store down the street can keep its doors closed today for all I care. And tomorrow. And so on. As long I remain dedicated and diligent.

Somewhat subtle, but noticeable enough that I visited my doctor.

I don't want to bore everybody with the long journey I took to get here, but I've been getting tests done left and right. Lots of blood work, EKGs, chest x-rays, etc. My primary physician, the ER doc from my first visit, the PA I've seen a couple of times. They all reiterated the same thing: you need to stop drinking. 

A week ago I went to my primary physician's office and saw the PA I'd been seeing. There had been intense swelling of my calves and feet. It was unreal. The second blood work I got after the first one showed that my liver enzymes were up. So I needed to get an ultrasound done of my abdomen. All right. I also needed to get an echocardiogram of my heart. You got it.

Two days later (last Friday) I'm stressing out at work. People are irritating me, work is pilling up, meanwhile I'm trying to get this ultrasound and echo scheduled, but I keep getting put on hold and being sent to voicemail. I'm very upset at this point. I keep drinking to a stupor every night. I've stopped caring about the cleanliness of my house, my finances, my diet, my hidden transgenderism, everything. All of these thoughts are going through my mind all at once. And the struggles that I'm going through to get some tests done just so they can diagnose something that could or could not be something bad just pushed me to my limits. I excused myself to the bathroom and I just started bawling. I rarely cry that much, but it just felt like my whole world was falling on top of me and I couldn't do anything about it. 

Once I composed myself I had a long talk with my mom (who knows about my drinking and my transgenderism). It helped a little and I tried to get back to work. That's when I felt some hard pressure on my upper chest. I'd never felt it before. It was bothering me so much that I couldn't concentrate on my work. I didn't want to, but I went to the ER again.

My parents met me there and we had lots of talks when we had the chance between people coming and going. Got more blood drawn, an EKG done, chest x-ray. I knew the routine by this point. A new doctor came in and we talked a lot about my alcohol problem. Out of everybody I've talked to in the last two months he was the most thorough. He really drilled it into my head that I need to quit drinking. He even prescribed an anti-anxiety med for me.

I don't know if that feeling that brought me to the ER was stress or not, but I'm actually glad I went. I even decided to stay with my parents that night and it ended up being the first night I'd gone without alcohol in months. The next day me and my mom went out to lunch and then went shopping. We kept talking about everything and by the end of the day I was feeling much, much better.

Got my ultrasound on Monday and my echo today and it's been since last Thursday that I had a drink. I haven't felt this good in a LONG time.",21
2019-12-11 13:55:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e9bb30/one_month/,One Month!,"I made it over a month without even noticing it! I never hit a point where anyone would say I had a problem and in fact, my family and friends are still surprised (but supportive!) when I say I'm not drinking anymore, but I no longer was comfortable with the frequency or amount I was drinking. I was sick of drinking being a habit, of hangovers, of mental fogginess all day, and all the other BS that comes from alcohol. In the past month I've felt more mental clarity, optimism, energy, and have slept better than I have in a very long time and I feel like I am finally more present in my own life.

I've had sober spots in my life in the past but never a point where I felt like I was stopping for good. I always knew I'd ""need"" to go back because I felt I couldn't have the self control to stop for good. Something feels different this time - I feel confident in myself now. I can do this! 

Have a good day, everyone! Thanks for the encouragement!",3

I will admit that these last 9 days have been pretty ruff. Not in a way you might think. Not once have I craved alcohol, but I've been extremely emotional. I'm usually a tough guy, from the north east with tough skin, and yes, I can have an emotional side to me. BUT these last 9 days have been way over the top, like an emotional rollercoaster. Now being clear minded and waking up hangover free, I've been subconsciously and consciously doing a ton of thinking and sole searching. I've quit drinking before for a week at a time or even a few months before, but this time is different. I'm a 47M and been drinking for 35 years, BTW! I've been wanting to quit drinking for a long time and like I said, I have for short times here and there. This time is for real though. I have finally had it and I'm done. The emotional rollercoaster is about seeing what I have done to myself for the last 35 years. The damage that I've caused my own body and the time I've lost drinking when I could have used that time more productively. Then for the last 9 days, reading all the stories (of yours) on this sub, both sad and very inspiring. However, it's the sad ones that hit right straight in the heart. It's like that feeling of watching a movie that really affects you, and you can't stop thinking about it for day and days. Some of your stories do that to me, cause I can relate to them so clearly. They say: sometimes it's hard to see what you see in the mirror, and some of your stories are just that, seeing myself in the mirror and it's scary. Alcohol blinds the damage you do to yourself and to others. It's super selfish and until you get rid of it, you'll never know, even though those around you can see it all. It's ugly and it's a shitty feeling once you're able to see it for yourself.

So, after crying at least once a day for the last 9 days, something happened yesterday. I had the biggest cry yet. It just came out of nowhere. I laid in bed (alone) and cried and cried!!! Something happened after I was done. When it was over, and I got up, turned over the teared soaked pillow and cleaned my face off. I FELT GREAT all of a sudden. After all the tears I shed for the last 8 days before this, this 9th one was the one which felt like the end of the tears. I got an amazing 8 hours of sleep last night and woke up like a totally new man. I feel VEERY strong and powerful. Super focused and not emotional at all! Something about this 10th day, it's different!!! It's time to get busy living or get busy dying. I'm choosing to live and to live happy! I'll remember this 10th day for the rest of my sobriety, cause I know, I can feel it, THIS is the turning point that I've been waiting for, for the last 35 years!!!! It's good to be home :)",4

The following morning, ready to take control of my life, I began researching treatments for alcoholism and came upon this sub.  I wasn't new to Reddit, but I had never seen this sub before so I thought I'd give it a shot and started reading some of the posts.  I then decided to create a new account and just started writing.  My feelings and emotions that day were some of the most powerful I've ever experienced.  Admitting to myself and to those closest to me (and random strangers on the internet) that I suffer from alcoholism and finally coming to terms with it was one of the most difficult, yet rewarding, things I've ever done.  I had finally reached a point in my life where I was absolutely ready to give it all up and begin truly living my life.  I was ready to live without any external substances dictating the way I feel and act.

I'm likely to go on a rant here, so I'll leave you with my thanks.  Of all of the treatment options available to me, /r/stopdrinking was the most helpful to me.  Having a safe and judgement free place to come and spill my guts out has been extremely beneficial, especially during the beginning phase of my sobriety.  Reading other's stories, getting such positive feedback on my own, and realizing that I was far from alone in my struggles really made me feel like I could do this.  I even went to my work holiday party last night where I was the only one not drinking and I still had a great time.  I never would've thought I could be surrounded by drunk people and free beer while not being able to drink it and still have fun.  I feel like I'm re-discovering the real me and I love it.

Everybody should have a theme song! :)","Yeah so on Sept 22, 2019, I had a heart attack while drinking....well more like totally smashed, on my way to a blackout drunk kinda of night....but it was morning.  After drinking 1/2 a handle (1.75 liters) and a strong beer, the heart attack hit.  

I drove myself to the hospital after debating some serious questions about my life, life in general and whether or not I was really having a heart attack (yeah it was the worst, most intense pain I've ever felt in my chest!!)?

So a few days later, I'm convalescing at my mom's house, and sent and group text to my friends informing them of what happened.  The next morning one of my closest friends texted back being quite supportive but also quite concerned and as we were texting, [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxvBPH4sArQ) came on the radio!  

I laughed so hard but now it's become my new theme song!!

You see to truly understand why this is so funny and awesome to me, you need to understand the context of this song to my life.  

See when I was in 3rd grade, they had a ""disco"" at school and we all dressed up and danced.  I danced like crazy, had a blast and was totally in love with disco music from that point on.  However my brother, who was 2 years older which everyone knows at that time of life might as well have been 20 years, HATED DISCO.  So much so that he constantly made fun of me and my music choices.  This was also right around the time that the [DISCO SUCKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Demolition_Night) movement was in full flight.  I'm not sure if it was right around that demolition night or not....doesn't matter.....everyone hated disco and the chant ""DISCO SUCKS"" was heard whenever a disco song came on the radio.  Hell it was in the news....shit everywhere.  Everyone hated disco except a few.  I was one of the few. 

I fucking loved disco music, not the sad shit....fuck that....the up-beat dancing music.  That stuff was gold and I was a good dancer and had fun dancing so fuck him and anyone else that hated disco.  I was going to like and dance to whatever I wanted to.

Fast Forward to me in college and I was up late one night, drunk with friends watching TV when [Saturday Night Fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Fever) came on and holy shit was it ever funny.  We were all making fun of the clothes, the attitude and yes even the music.  By this time I'd become far too cool in my own mind to admit I liked that music, even in my own mind.  It was a great night tho as I'd never really watched the movie.

Anyways - so here I am, 80 days after my heart attack and things are completely different in my life.  Here are some things that are different: 

* I'm back in AA   
* New sponsor   
* Working the steps once again  
* New diet  
* New sleep habits  
* New cleaning habits around the house

And holy crap I'm feeling so much better than I've felt in a LONG time!

I've lost over 35 pounds so far with much more to come as my diet is very sustainable.  

There's a line in the song that says ""Life going no where, somebody help me.""  And that certainly was my life some 81 days ago and somebody did help me.....a lot of people.  It took me having a heart attack before I was willing to reach out and ask for help....let alone accept it.  It's been an amazing journey and I'm only 80 days in.

So yeah, I'm staying alive, one-day-at-a-time.  Hope for a better future has returned and I'm feeling so grateful to AA, my sponsor, God, this subreddit and all the people in my life in whatever way......what a journey we're on.  

I'm definitely STAYING ALIVE! :)  

**tl;dr** - Don't say ""OK BOOMER"" cuz to that I'll say ""Can it you double 00 dildos"".  :)  I'm a proud x-gen, latchkey kid that had cable TV and burned hours after school watching MTV!  Boomers were too busy working.  Beyond that I'd say read it, I tried to make it entertaining.  And if you really want a good laugh, go watch the movie. It's awesome!  My favorite line is ""These girls.  Jeez  You sleep with them they think you gotta dance with them."" :)",5

And I realized something...well, a couple things.","I successfully survived a night with NO alcohol!!  Instead of going to the store to get booze after work, I hit up a Boot Camp near my house and got some exercise.  I went to this boot camp a couple times in the fall, but after class was over I would leave and immediately pick up a bottle or 2.  Not last night.  Last night I was determined that I was not going to get a bottle. 

I'm addicted to alcohol.  Hell, I've known that I've had an alcohol addiction for a while, but I just shrugged it off and thought ""I can quit tomorrow"" or ""there's people out there who are worse than I am.""  I realized that I have to have something to take the place of alcohol (i.e. exercise) which will make the transition to sobriety easier for me.  I've ALWAYS had to be addicted to something.  And I know, that's not necessarily a healthy way to look at this situation.  As I lie in bed last night, because I was having trouble staying asleep, I guess I had an epiphany.  I was so addicted to exercise when I was sober a couple of years ago that I even did a bodybuilding competition and ran half marathons as much as I could.  However, I had no friends or family around because I was the outcast.  The one who didn't drink.  And that always bothered me.  I didn't like always having to fight with my family and friends about why I couldn't drink with them.  I remember I HATED always trying to justify why I wouldn't pick up a drink; it was constant.  Being drunk all the time for the last year and a half, I realized I was arguing with myself daily about why I needed to get alcohol on the way home.  I was justifying why I needed those bottles of wine, every single day.  Last night I realized that I'd rather argue with someone else about my choice to be sober, instead of justifying the choice to put poison in my body every day.        

In the fall of 2018 I lost something (Warning: Rant Ahead).  I lost my mother  a little over 15 months ago, and simultaneously got divorced around the same time.  My ex remarried a couple weeks after our divorce was finalized and moved away to raise a new family, leaving me to try and grieve the loss of my mother while beginning a new full time job, maintaining a part time job, and caring for our kid full time.  And the drinking commenced.  Alcohol is an awful drug; I cried in the middle of the night last night because I realized that in my 1 1/2 year long bender I never ACTUALLY grieved my mother's passing.  I was too drunk, or hungover to process that loss.  I realized I only cried when I was either drunk or hungover.  And that cry, boy that cry last night felt almost cleansing.  I felt a sense of relief and calm wash over me.  All the booze in the world can kiss my ass.    

I'm at work right now and feel great, compared to what I usually feel like.  I did have trouble sleeping last night, as I mentioned earlier.  I have a little bit of dizziness, but it's not as bad as it usually is.  I'm also still shaky (but I figure that will pass eventually) and I have a bit of a headache.  I brought a gallon jug of water with me today to make sure I stay hydrated.  I'm going back to boot camp again tonight.  I bought an indoor cycle bike to set up at home so I can get up early and exercise a couple days a week before work, or on the weekends.  This new chapter feels so good.  I HOPE I can come back here tomorrow morning and say that I've made it 2 nights without alcohol.       

I'm looking into setting up my first AA meeting this weekend.  I'm a little nervous, because I don't know what to expect and I'm not much of a people person.  Any tips will be helpful.  

I hope you all are doing awesome and I thank you all for the support!!!

2. Driving by a liquor store sign loses any effect on you. 
3. Going out with people who drink isn't as hard as I thought it would be. 
4. Folks who were your drinking buddies, will be amazed, not disappointed. 
5. FOLKS WHO WERE YOUR DRINKING BUDDIES WILL BE AMAZED, NOT DISAPPOINTED. 
6. You will eventually, on your time-frame, completely forget about drinking. 
7. I look better, and feel better, than I have in years.
8. People who are toxic, are toxic, regardless of your success. Cut them out. It's hard, but worth it.

I remember being caught in a vicious cycle of vowing to quit and breaking that vow DAILY. I remember reading the happy sobriety posts and being angry and bewildered as to why I couldn't do it. If you're in that place, just love yourself and keep trying. Just don't give up. And if you're cursing me right now, I get it and I'm not offended. :-)

Onto my realization. I'm reading a library book called ""The Mindful Day"" by Laurie J. Cameron. I love it so far. I just finished the chapter ""Shower With Awareness."" As part of a step-by-step approach to mindfulness to decrease anxiety, she teaches you how to bring mindfulness into each part of your day. So today I was practicing showering with mindfulness. I listened to the water, smelled the soap, focused on the warm drops hitting my skin, etc. Then I had a flashback to what showering used to be like:

A little over 160 days ago I would experience dread in the shower. I would dread that despite my bathing, people would smell last night's alcohol in my breath and pores. I spent my shower cursing myself and belittling myself for being such a loser, such a fuck up. My thoughts would race about how to avoid my co-workers first thing so that they wouldn't smell the residual alcohol. I'd dread the evening because I knew I wanted to be sober but I knew it wouldn't happen and I'd be repeating the exact same thing the next day. I knew that even though I was starting with a clean body, I'd be sweating profusely within minutes of putting fresh clothes on, adding to more anxiety. It was not a happy way to start the day.

&#x200B;

Today's shower was a completely different experience. I relished in the feeling of the exfoliation on my skin, the warm drops of water were amazing when you really focus on them, and even focusing on the feeling of drying your skin with a towel feels like a little massage. I can't believe I am in such a different place. I hope this helps somebody who is struggling. You can do this. I started by loving myself, telling myself I'm worth it (even though I didn't believe it), and telling myself that one day I would have a happy sober post too.",84

Since then I've been going through the same cycle of drinking till I'm sick, being unable to drink, going through withdrawal, recovering, and then drinking again. I always drink alone. I've been taken to the hospital at least four times and I've spent a good amount of time in the psychiatric ward as well. 

The longest I've been sober was when I was staying in a treatment centre; it's also the happiest I can remember being in the past 5 years. The program I was in lasted a month and a half and I stayed sober for about 3 weeks after that, but I eventually fell back into it again.

I've lost count of the number of times I've tried to stop drinking since then. The longest I've lasted is about 1-2 weeks. I'm so tired of the vicious circle of drinking because I'm depressed, getting depressed because I drink, and then drinking again. I know if I don't do anything different, nothing is ever going to get better. 

My first day sober this time was on December 1st. I have a good feeling that I can keep it up this time, although, I've felt that before. I feel like every single attempt in the past and my time spent in the treatment centre has taught me something that I can use to stay sober this time.

I have spent the last 10 months sailing through birthday parties, summer BBQs, family gatherings, fancy dinners and even karaoke. This weekend I happily enjoyed two office Christmas parties (one with an open bar!) and I had zero desire to drink. In the beginning there was some trepidation because it was new and scary to do those things without a drink in my hand. The early days were so hard to beat those cravings one afte another. I've read the books, I've done the hard work. I have come so far! 

Then why is it consuming my mind so much right now? I'm already thinking about if I can have the mini-mimosa they offer on the plane. In the past we would buy hefty travel mugs to take down with us so we could fill up and drink more! I am bewildered at myself that I am considering drinking there. I'm lying to myself if I think that I can try moderation or that it will be just a ""Mexico thing"". 

I think in the end I probably won't imbibe. My kids will be there. I want the be present and sober.  I've made a promise to myself. I got to this point. I am just taken aback by the amount of time my mind has spent ruminating on the ""maybe I can..."" It's an uncomfortable feeling. Does it ever go away?",4

Drank regularly since I was a teen. Most definitely used alcohol as a tool to sooth or self destruct. Surrounded myself with drinkers and people who wouldn’t judge me. Sometimes I was the heaviest drinker in the room and sometimes I wasn’t. Stayed healthy. I have been successful in life but alcohol has always been there holding me back or making me question my choices. I’ve binged weekends away and brunched with the best of them. Thrown up and blacked out and taken time off from it to deal with the shame and self loathing. It’s been 30 years. I’m 45. This year I had two voices in my head. Just have a drink, you’re an adult and you earned it. The other voice saying, this wine doesn’t even taste good. Why are you even drinking it? Usually pouring the second glass down the sink half way through. Though sometimes really “enjoying it” and drinking more. 3,4,5, 6 nights a week. Sometimes drinking vodka and crying on the floor after I looked at myself in the mirror. I’ve been a lurker on this sub for a while and I think it’s amazing what you all do for each other. You are all beautiful! You have gave me insight and helped me come to the realization that I should consider an alcohol free life or at least a solid break from it to really take a look at my relationship with alcohol.

It’s great. I’m on day 24 and I’m not one to shout shit from the rooftops but I think I’m done. I’m only telling you. I haven’t told anyone else. What this experiment has taught me is that if I decide to drink again I will only gain more insight to my feelings towards alcohol. It’s not a failure. It’s research. But right now I think I’m done. I love you all. Stay strong. You are all great and your stories have helped me more than you will know. Xoxoxo",18

For about 6 years (from about 20-26) I was a raging alcoholic. Going out every night turned into staying in and killing a minimum of a fifth a night, literally every single night. To the point where most people get, just fed up with it. After a while, I started drinking because I felt I had to, not cause I wanted to. So I guess you could say I mentally checked out from wanting to drink. I was doing it to stave off the horrible withdrawals that I was to experience later down the road.

But I've been sober for how ever long my tag says and it was hard for the first week or so but now its cake. I dont wanna drink and wince at the thought if it, not even just a beer. I've had bad things happen that used to be triggers but now I just shrug them off, the thought of alcohol doesn't even cross my mind as a solution. And from what I hear from other people is that they struggle every day, and they've been sober longer than me. But I honestly dont feel that struggle at all. I actually kind of feel bad, like have I been exacerbating my problems? So it makes me wonder if I just had a negative habitual thing that I had to break, and not just a problem with alcohol. Is that possible? 

And I wanna end this by saying once again, I'm not saying this to convince myself of anything. I DONT WANT TO DRINK and will not drink. I intend on staying sober and intend on posting here. IWNDWYT",5

2019-12-11 08:28:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e973wh/200_days/,200 days.,"I’m not one to go into crazy detail on here but today is a milestone for me and I want to try to inspire anyone on here who can’t see themselves lasting a week never mind months at a time. YOU CAN MAKE IT. 

In the first days of my sobriety I felt like a weak, tiny little mouse . A shell of the vibrant person I was. I felt like experiencing so many blackouts and not remembering certain periods of time in my life had slowly started to eat away at my identity and sense of self. Years and years of alcohol abuse (from age 14-27) had nearly wiped my memory clean. I had almost no recollection of my younger years because they were drenched in beer and whiskey. 

I tried AA for a while and I got what I needed from them but it wasn’t the right fit for me. My higher power is myself and although AA is a fantastic place to be if you need support every day, it just wasn’t the right path for me . So I decided to take control of my monster in a different way. I started to analyze myself and ask myself the hard questions. Why do I feel like drinking helps me? What type of emotions am I feeling right before my body goes into autopilot and I drive to the liquor store. I promise it wasn’t easy , but it needed to be done. 

Those feelings were mostly anger, but sometimes sadness . I just took that and ran with it. Anytime I would start to feel that urge to drink well up inside , I would stop, breathe deeply , understand the way I was feeling at that moment AND ALLOW MYSELF TO FEEL IT. To whatever extent it needed to be felt . I would sit in anger for a few minutes and NOT get into the car but find something else to do with that emotion. Cleaning or organizing something really helped at first during the initial weeks of coming to learn my true self. Then I started to channel these feelings in a way that brought me to something I loved as a hobby, which is hiking / walking out in nature. 

I am still learning about myself every day. Slowly, the clarity of sobriety has helped me remember a lot of things that I have forgotten over the years and those little memories are a tiny little gift to me every day. This is a constant process of self reflection and self control. I feel empowered every night when I lay my head to rest knowing that I didn’t let my monster take my happiness away from me that day. That I had enough self awareness and self control to keep fighting the good fight. I see the physical benefits each day and I never wake up wishing I had drank the night before. Don’t get me wrong the cravings exist, the temptation is still there but what is the point of sobriety without temptation to maintain sober? I have never felt better in my life. 

I’m now 28 years old 200 days sober from alcohol and I AM THE MOST TRUE VERSION OF MYSLEF TO DATE. 

The benefits are truly amazing and sometimes I become overwhelmed with joy when I am able to feel my feelings! After years of blocking out the thing that makes me the most human , I’ve never felt so alive.

Alcohol costed me my last relationship of 6/7 years, and when we broke up I swore off drinking. I lasted from Feb to my birthday in July, the minute I picked up it was like I never even put it down. Now I realize I only stopped in hopes that would change her mind, and once I saw she moved on and was with someone else I jumped right back in. 


A year and some hang overs later I finally decided that I want to quit for ME. And with the support of my friends and my new partner I finally walked into an AA meeting. 


The days are easy, but it’s thinking far into the future that messes me up. I think about my trip to New Orleans this coming February like “what am I supposed to do as a non drinker” or thoughts like “well my friends like to party and drink, how am I gonna hang out with them”. And I feel like these thoughts are a form of self sabotage. 


I do miss coming home and “ripping shots” while cooking.  But I’m awake, at work, not hung over feeling great. And I’m just trying to practice “one day at a time”.

Making it through last night was a challenge because I was alone during those critical hours when you tell yourself it’s the only way to unwind from the day. I came here and read a lot, responded some. That helped me hold on until my husband got home from work. The withdrawals aren’t as bad for me as they could be, but they seem to hit me right whenever I want to drink most. It’s going to be a battle, but I promise IWNDWYT.",28

I’m so ashamed of my choices .,"I struggle a lot with depression and anxiety and have been a heavy drinker all through college. I would always drink to black out , but I never thought I had a problem because everyone around me was doing it too... but I’d always take it too far .. getting overly emotional, sometimes even suicidal . Even affected some of my relationships. But even with all that laid out in front of me I still want to deny that I have a problem. My mental health got really bad in September so I went to an outpatient facility. I was able to remain sober the entire month of program and felt better than ever. Then friends started inviting me out , and I was like okay I’ll go and just have a few drinks .. but then drank too much and felt intense anxiety and depression each time . And then I got a new job and my coworkers wanted to go out so I said yes and again drank an embarrassing amount . 6 days ago I had a horrible depressive episode after a night out of drinking with my coworkers and my boyfriend. I’m embarrassed of the emotional state my boyfriend saw me in and I honestly am worried I scared him . I decided the next day that I need to stop drinking for good . Now here I am  a week later , regretting the choices I made last night. My boyfriend and I were with some friends and one of them pulled out a bottle and asked if we wanted anything to drink (he’s a bit of an alcoholic himself , but my boyfriends best friend ..) and my boyfriend was so strong and said no he wasn’t drinking anymore and I was like “I kind of want a shot” and he was like “okay babe but just don’t over do it” but what did I do ? 1 shot turned into 7 .. and then I started getting sooo sad and emotional and I just don’t know why I keep doing this to myself when I know the end result is worsened depression and anxiety . I feel like I’ve let myself and my boyfriend down . 
I struggle saying no. 
I feel like somethings wrong with me or I’m weird or an outcast if I’m choosing to be sober. 
Part of me is still not convinced I have a problem , so I’m easily persuaded by the “oh just have one !” but I can’t just have one .. I can’t . 
I just don’t know what to do because this is so hard and I’m so embarrassed that this is even the journey I am on that .. and I think that’s also part of what makes saying no so hard . 
I’m so nervous for the holidays . I’m glad I’ll have my boyfriend to keep me strong , but there will be so many temptations and I’m nervous I’ll crack the way I did last night 😭",7
2019-12-11 07:41:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e96m6a/thirty_days_sober_today_and_a_special_message_for/,Thirty days Sober Today! (And a special message for women trying to conceive or interested in having children),"This morning, I am 30 days free from alcohol and nicotine (and little to no caffeine as well).  I was a daily drinker for the majority of my adult life (10 years at least), drinking a minimum of 2 strong craft beers a day to as many as I could if my husband was working late or away on business. I have all the same stories and regrets that you do.  


 I drank too much and made a fool of myself in front of friends or colleagues.  
 I drank too much and thought I was fine to get home anyway.  
I drank too much and started stupid, pointless arguments with my husband.  
I drank too much and was too hungover to go to work.  
I drank too much and was too hungover to walk my dogs.  
I drank too much and was so hungover that I lost my temper with my employees.  
I drank too much and lost sight of the person I wanted to be.  
I drank TOO MUCH because some was never, ever enough.   


Like many of you, I went through brief stints of sobriety - 4 days here, 11 there, 7 a few times, 23 ONCE - but wasn't ever able to make the full commitment to sobriety. Sure, I felt better when I wasn't drinking, but EVERYONE ELSE AROUND ME WAS DRINKING, and they looked like they were having a great time. Not drinking felt like a sacrifice I was making on a daily basis. One that others DIDN'T have to make - and I was jealous and bitter about it.   


I've read all the books: This Naked Mind, Alcohol Explained, Alcohol Lied to Me, The Easy Way to Control Alcohol (all good and useful in their own right). I'd listened to podcasts. I've lurked here and on similar subs. I've probably tried quitting upwards of 30 times before I got to 30 days today. 

So what finally worked? There was a ""catalyst"" - but I also think that the repetition of reading/listening to these books, reading this sub, and REALLY staying mindful throughout my sober and drinking days helped immensely. Taking notice of how even 2 drinks gave me a slight hangover, how my anxiety was better after a few days of not drinking, how my husband and I rarely fought (and never with intensity) when I was sober. All these things were already making it so I had moved from daily drinking to a few sober days each week.  


The catalyst was that my husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for about 2 years. We finally went to see a fertility doctor who told me that alcohol actually raises testosterone in women and throws off your hormonal balance in general. Meaning that as a heavy drinking woman, you may be stopping your body from having a normal menstrual cycle. Heavy drinking can cause early menopause. It will increase your risk of miscarriage (even if you stop when you become pregnant). If you are trying or want to start trying to become pregnant, it's NOT ENOUGH to stop ""when you get a positive test."" You may never get that positive test, and it may be the drinking that's to blame. (It's not too late to stop and to try and reverse some of the damage! Your eggs have a 3 month maturation period. There are lots of lifestyle changes you can make that will vastly increase egg quality and increase your chances of a successful pregnancy. Talk to your doctor and read ""First Comes the Egg"" for more information!)  


So, I finally found something that I loved more than myself - my future child. And knowing that not only was alcohol making me lazy, miserable, depressed, anxious, argumentative, fat, secretive, ineffective in general, it was ALSO potentially the cause of my infertility, I quit. Right then. Right there. That day. No ""one last hurrah"", ""one last drink with friends,"" none of it. If you REALLY want to stop, all you have to do is not pick up that first drink.   


I've lost 7 pounds in 30 days. And certainly NOT because I was eating well or trying to (the sugar cravings are still insane). People compliment my appearance constantly. My skin has gotten clearer. The dark circles are gone from my eyes. The chapped lips are gone. I get up at 530 am every day, well rested and ready to take on the day's challenges. And when those challenges ARE stressful and difficult, I deal with them much better than I would have either hungover or with half my mind preoccupied with when I was going to have my next drink. Most days, now, I don't think about alcohol much at all. My productivity and organization and work has improved. Sex with my husband has become more frequent and enjoyable. And best of all - friends and colleagues whom I used to drink with are sharing with me that they think THEY drink too much. They want to talk about how to cut back or quit.   


There is no anxiety or fear about not drinking at Holiday gatherings. Just the knowledge that I don't have to do that anymore. I don't have to drink poison that stops me from being the person that I want to be. I can watch others do so secure in the knowledge that they're missing out on sobriety, a good night's sleep and a clear, calm head. I'm not missing out on anything. I'm finally free.

First day down here we were in the pool and many people were enjoying their beers. I felt sad, like I was watching my ex girlfriend having fun with others and I was there alone.  

There’s this self pity element that I hate.   Not that I was sitting and sulking. I actually had a lot of fun with the kids and made good conversation with some people staying at the resort. Inside I guess I’m just wishing I could join the moderate drinkers club and feeling left out. 

I have no plans on drinking this week but I do fantasize about it.  Maybe out to dinner one night or something.  Not to excess like before, just one or two, to show that I can do it.  Then?  Will I stop at one or two and be satisfied?  Will I feel guilty about going back after 4 months clean?  Will I be more likely to drink again at a later date?  Will that lead to a time in the future when I go off the rails and end up drunk again?   

Like getting back with that ex girlfriend that did you wrong so many times. “Look at me baby, I’ve changed!   Let’s try this again for old times sake.”  Definitely not worth it.  But the feelings are still there.",3

Today, for some reason, I feel more positive about my goals. Had some setbacks, but I feel a little more confident about achieving them now. I’m not going to give up. I’m going to ask questions and find answers. I’m going to push forward. 

Tonight I’m back at the gym, and also taking the time to cook for myself again. 

This sober life sure is something else. I have a ways to go, but so far it’s wonderful.

I (34M) have been drinking heavily for the past 15 years.  I've had some few month periods of sobriety, and some times where I wasn't ruining my life.  This is definitely one of those times.  Over a week ago, I had dinner with my mom and daughter, and they dropped my off at home.  Two days later I wake up with 4 empty fifths next me, and  2 empty half-pints.  Nikolai vodka, by the way.  I have to be at work in a few hours for a closing shift, but I definitely don't feel right.  I feel the seizures coming.  I'm a fast food manager, and work is very loud, bright, lots of kids, and very busy.   I try I'm gonna try to power through it.  That was a mistake.  I get there, and I immediately can't handle it.  I start shaking, and bolt out the door without saying a word.   I buy some more booze to stop the withdrawals.  I don't answer any messages from my bosses.  The owner of the store messaged me.  Everyone liked me there, which makes it all the worse.  So, for several days I wake, start shaking very hard, probably small seizures, can't talk without stuttering, so I drink, don't eat, and pass back out hoping it will end.  It doesn't.  It gets worse.  So, I went to the hospital.  Good thing, too.  Turns out I really almost died.  My blood pressure was 175/145.   I was dangerously dehydrated.   I am an uninsured American male, and this for-profit hospital is keeping and treating me for three days.  They don't do that unless you are gonna die.   So, that's been my week.   I think I've really had my fill of drinking.  I hope you all don't ever have to experience this.  Cause it can always get worse.",20

This idea is a little wild but maybe others can relate?


So, my Jeep was in the shop so I had to Uber to work on Monday and Tuesday. I feel like, in a sense, my Uber experiences were showing me something about myself- my present, my past, and I just got this wild idea that maybe it could mean something to other alcoholics, like a story that might be worth passing to others.

Monday, my Uber driver was telling me about the loss of her husband a few years back and how she doesn’t want a boyfriend now. She doesn’t want to answer to anyone or take care of anyone. She just wants to focus on her life and her health. 

I felt like I could relate. I got divorced last year and I’ve spent half of this year focusing on recovery. I handled my divorce by drinking and got myself into a pickle, realizing I was now the pickle and an alcoholic, and needed to get sober. I don’t want a relationship and answering to anyone because I need to focus on myself. I then deleted my dating app on my phone that night realizing I’m just not ready and truthfully, just not that interested. 

My ghost of Christmas Present.

Tuesday, my Uber picked me up and when I slid in, I immediately noticed the smell of vomit. I looked at the window (which was cracked to air it out) and there were chunks in the rubber and on the side of the door. I informed my driver that someone had gotten sick in her car, and I promptly moved to the other side.

She shared the last ride she drove for Uber was on Saturday night. I’ve been that girl blowing chunks in an Uber. I’ve been that girl that a night out for holiday cheer ended in more vomit. At the end of my drinking career, I would drink, vomit, then drink more since “I got it out of my system.” It was a harsh reminder of everything I used to be and why I don’t drink any longer. And how the coping skill of alcoholism just really stopped working for me.

Ghost of Christmas Past.

Jeep is fixed; I don’t have an Uber for the future. Just wanted to share.

Can anyone relate to life kind of meeting them  in the most obscure ways and showing them more about themselves?
Maybe this is in some way an Alcoholic’s Christmas Carol, and the good part is that the future is unknown, now. It doesn’t have to be decided on. I can just let it go, do the next right thing, and drive my own vehicle.

I am here to complain. Tonight (its now 1AM (EST)), I was telling my significant other that I wanted to drink. I am craving some whiskey. After some back and forth regarding me drinking alone, they sad, ""I would obviously rather you not alone but do you think you're ready to with people."" 

This actually rubbed me the wrong way. I have been very open about my recovery, and its difficult for me to look past comments like these. My S.O. and my younger brother have both been very supportive, just not in the ways I need them to be. I wish they cared enough to try and empathize with what I am going through. I have been diagnosed with depression and O.C.D. My addiction is arguably a result of these diagnoses. Neither of them has ever dealt with addiction nor mental illness. It's hard to look past one's actions to realize their intentions.

She said she wanted to be respectful of my sobriety but that’s just more virtue signaling. Being respectful is treating me like a normal person or at least talking to me before it gets to the point where I have to ask.

The question stomped me because outside of alcohol there was nothing else. I partied hard, and when the people I partied with didnt want to anymore I found other people to party with. That cycle continued for a while. Eventually I couldn't find people to drink with anymore so I just drank by myself. I didnt need others to have fun, and eventually I didnt need to have fun to have alcohol.

Now I've been given an opportunity to redefine myself. I know some are still going to see me as the mess I had become, and that's more than fair. I had been that way for many years, but I'm looking forward to creating this person I will become. How will he be known, and how will others explain me to there piers. I've been given an opportunity to rewrite myself and I wont mess it up this time. All I can do at the end of the day is be my best self and hopefully the rest will fall in place from there.

I wish you all the best, and good luck redefining yourselves.

In fact I just put away a pint of egg nog and wine I purchased last Tuesday. I thought i would ease myself into it with just a glass a day but i knew that wouldn't happen. To be honest what's held me is near beer. 0.0%. It doesn't make me want actual alcohol but fixes the malt craving. For the first time in weeks my boss called me to come in for a weekend gig and i have no worries of if I'll make it in or lie like i have before because I've overslept and stink of alcohol. It feels good. IWNDWUT!,3

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!
*
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!
**
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Share your good, your bad, and your ugly (or your pretty, or your future, or whatever else is on your mind) with us below!

-----------------------------------------

**The Good and the Bad:** I have to combine these this week because they cannot be separated. My aunt (who has been a second mother to me) has had a cancer diagnosis, and it looks serious, so my mother and I will be flying to London in early January. I will be thrilled to see my aunt again (and also England itself, where I lived for many years), but I am also extremely upset about her illness and prognosis.

**The Ugly:** I will be staying in an apartment near her home, which is very near Hampton Court Palace. I just read about the “Haunted Gallery” at Hampton Court from palace’s website:

>In 1541, Catherine Howard, Henry VIII’s fifth wife, discovered that she was to be charged with adultery—a charge for which her predecessor, Anne Boleyn, had been executed.

>Legend has it that the terrified young queen broke free from her guards and ran along what is now called the Haunted Gallery in the hope of finding Henry in the Chapel, to plead her innocence. Just before Catherine reached the door, she was seized by guards who took her screaming back to her rooms.

>Catherine’s ghost can, allegedly, be seen running through the Haunted Gallery at Hampton Court Palace, screaming for mercy.

I know that shortly after being (falsely?) accused of adultery, Catherine Howard was put on a boat on the Thames River and sent from Hampton Court down to the Tower of London to be executed. On the one hand, I am haunted by the thought of her having to ride down the Thames, knowing what awaited her. On the other, now I have to go visit the “Haunted Gallery” and see if I encounter Catherine’s ghost.",22

Okay, okay... I’m kidding about the hate, but gosh was that a toughie. It’s was for a new job otherwise I wouldn’t have gone. On the plus side, I don’t have to worry about anyone thinking I don’t like to eat in public. I’m in a very male dominated field and am very used to politely passing on seconds or the last of something so they can eat it. NOT TODAY, “hey... do you want those last chicken wings?” “YES I DO.” If you get to drink a beer & I have to drink Diet Coke, then I get to eat this whole plate of chicken wings AND the last of those nachos over there- ITS THE LAW, I just decided. 

All jokes aside, I stayed strong though, left sober, and listened  to the first 2 chapters of “this naked mind” on my commute home. Gotta say... hope that gets better because I was not vibing with it at all. Not sure if anyone else felt similarly while listening. 

Anyways, proud to say that I did not drink with you guys today <3",21

\[I did want to share the feeling to provide encouragement...\] ""wait... okay. I will share the details. I think it could help. I know I changed this mid post but I think it could help.

Today:

A corporate client meeting went extremely well. My CEO and boss were in the room and were impressed with my performance. In fact, we all did well. I prayed to bless the meeting as I was worried it would not go well a few minutes in. I used to be an atheist for a decade, and do doubt still, but what are you going to do? If one is an atheist that is fine too. It is a choice and I judge on action... not thought. I have scientific training so I am skeptical yet coincidences seem to line up a little too perfectly at times. I do not know for sure, I do not claim to, and I am aware of psychological phenomena that would impact my cognitions. I am aware it could just be a feeling and me blessing has a big impact on my demeanor, candor, and kindness with others which results in positive outcomes in a given situation. It does not really matter in the end: God or no god if it is positive.

A good friend's best friend died from cancer yesterday. Yet today he and I found beauty in is life and I talked about how I had three major depressions and attempted suicide once. I lived to fight another day and gained a couple of psychology degrees. I can help him and others see the value in life. My work was not yet completed. I lived.""  


One could look at the pain in my life and see great sadness. I do not. One could also call me crazy. I have been. I do not care. I see beauty and a love for others that suffer; I truly do care and I am seeking ways to change lives. Some might call this virtue signaling and if someone wants to judge me for it I do not care. I call it the only way for me to not fall back down and kill myself. The only path is up. :)

I, 32 (f) ended a very passionate relationship just one month ago, and it’s taken a toll on me. I used alcohol as a crutch to numb the heartbreak and that was a big mistake. 

The first night of my bender started out as a night out drinking with two of my girlfriends, and ended up with me making some very questionable choices and embarrassing and endangering myself doing things I am too ashamed to explain. I spent almost 300 dollars on drinks and taxi’s that night, not to mention another 100 on other drugs. 

The next day I got called into work and was too hungover to do my job so I paid someone 200 to work for me. That night I spent probably another 50 on alcohol. On the third day I stayed in bed most of the day by myself drinking. That night I was so drunk that I texted my ex which led to him calling me and asking me if I would buy his surround sound system from him. I agreed and he said he was coming to pick me up and spend the night. I agreed to that too. He convinced me in my drunken state to send him 600 dollars for a soundsystem that might be worth 200. He completely took advantage of me because he knew I was drunk, but this post isn’t about that. It’s about the damage I have caused to myself. 

On the 4th day I woke up at my ex’s house in a complete anxiety ridden panic attack. I was supposed to be at work operating my business and I had to close it down, costing me about another 300 in lost sales. I lost a lot of pride and dignity. I am supposed to be a role model and business owner yet I am too drunk and hungover to function on a Monday morning. I spent the next week crying, missing my ex, hating myself for hurting myself, hating him for hurting me. 

By the time this weekend came, I decided that if I don’t make a change, I could lose everything I have worked for. It’s time to start respecting myself, and giving myself credit for the amazing, smart and talented woman that I am. Not beating myself up because someone else decided to take advantage of me rather than loving me. 

I spent this weekend trying my very best to stay away from alcohol. Today I am completely sober and I want to get my life back. I want to be the vibrant confident person I used to be. I want to spend my money bettering myself and not throwing it away and using it to poison myself. 
One day at a time I will heal myself.

 The main reason I am having these thoughts is that I'm afraid of mentally and physically declining do to alcohol abuse. I have been noticing lately that I sometimes struggle in conversation recalling the word I want to use in the middle of a sentence. It will be a word that I know and use all the time and I just get stuck, searching my mind for what the fucking word is. This has been happening more and more lately.

 Also my kids are no longer babies and I want to be sober to be able to drive them to sports games when they join a team and be active with them as they are growing up.

I suppose drinking is drinking. It doesn’t matter if I didn’t have a drink for 7 days, 14 days or 144 days before my mess up last week. Fact is, I poisoned my body, and I’m still dealing with it. 

I’m still thinking of the night I drank. So stupid. Everything about it was stupid. Stupid decisions, disgusting drinks, everything. I never, NEVER want to feel like this again nor do I want to be in that situation again.

Moving to a new city soon, a city very much centered around alcohol (I used to live there) so in my mind it was a definite conclusion that drinking was going to be back, so might as well start now.  

Welp, went out with some friends who don't really know my alcohol story.  Had a few, safely and drove home responsibly.  BUT that opened up my reasoning that I'd had some, might as well make a night of it!  Immediately walked to my local bar, made an ass out of myself.  Alerted some friends who know what's up with my and alcohol (don't remember this).  

Woke up to a knock on the door.  Was one of my closer friends.  She didn't chastise me or anything, but was just like, yeah this ain't happening on my watch.  Spent the day with her, god bless her.  

115 days changed nothing about my drinking.  There is no realistic way to 'start over' on booze.  It's never going to work for me.  I have to embrace being sober an staying that way.  One fucking night is all it took to bring everything bad about booze and it's affects on me.  

I'm calling this a warning shot across my bow.  And I'm gonna keep on keeping on.  Complacency is a bitch, and I'm going to consider this a reminder to stay aware of being complacent.

As far as the new city goes, I'm re-thinking the move.  It isn't new orleans, but it's about as close as it gets to that vibe and culture.  I think I can hack it sober honestly.  But maybe it's too much of a risk.  Going to give this a lot of more thought now.

Anyways, falling off the wagon sucks but it isn't the end of the world every time.  Wake up calls are good... even when my last wake up call prior to this was as close to death as I've ever come.  Can't believe it happened, but the deck is stacked against us.  5% of us will be successful statistically in ridding the booze forever.  I hope I am in that number.  One day at a time now.",15

Yesterday I bought TWO bottles. I blacked out before getting home. I woke up in the middle of the night destroyed and realized I had sent a bunch of imbecilic texts to my brother who doesn’t need that shit.

Today was the most excruciating day ever at work. Completely unproductive, it was painful to think. 

It used to be my drinking did not impact my work so much. With my new job, though, it’s no longer the case. I’m under contract and it ends in March. They have to decide if they are going to renew my contract then but I don’t think they’ll be too keen on keeping an anthropomorphic hangover around.

I have no friends. I have no life. I just drink alone with the velocity of Leaving Las Vegas Nic Cage. It makes no sense. I’m just killing myself. I need to make some major changes.

I picked up groceries on my way home and started feeling really good. Unpacked groceries when I got home and exercised, and I actually felt like doing it for the first time in over a week. 

Now, I did down a small box of caramel filled chocolates before I left my office. I quit drinking coffee awhile back and don’t normally eat chocolate, so maybe the caffeine gave me a boost? I don’t know, but I feel like a switch was flipped this afternoon. After a few weeks steady decline into depression and apathy, I feel alive for a change. Hope it continues tomorrow.

I came to at roughly 7pm in what I can only describe as a concrete box with no roof and walls 8ft tall. One of the walls was a metal fence with very severe spikes on top, the kind you would see guarding a very restricted area and would never dream of climbing. There was 2ft of water in this box. With no recollection of how I even got in this box, I screamed and shouted but no help came. I eventually found a way to climb the metal fence and managed to jump over it. I slipped on the right direction and shattered my elbow after falling at least 8ft on the other side. If I slipped in the wrong way I would have impaled myself and died.

This was honestly the most confusing and scary situations I found myself in. Because of how bad I smelled and how wet I was, I had to walk 90 minutes home.

First thing Friday morning, I took my [sweet dog Zelda](https://i.imgur.com/6fYJQ14.jpg) to the vet. I thought her hip was hurting from when she'd slipped on ice a couple days earlier. But it turned out to be my worst nightmare: she had cancer, her spleen had ruptured, and she was bleeding out into her abdomen and chest. There was nothing we could do to save her.

The last time I lost someone important to me, I was at the height of my drinking and practically drowned myself in booze to obliterate the grief at first. I adopted Zelda six months later and just three months after that, I quit drinking and haven't touched a drop since. I don't even believe in fate, but I'll be damned if that dog and I didn't need each other. I hadn't even planned on adopting a dog that day. For some reason I still don't understand, I randomly told my boss I was sick, drove straight to the shelter, and fell in love with this big pudgy dog who'd been adopted and returned to shelters multiple times. She gave me a reason to stop spiraling into endless self-destruction, and I gave her the security of someone who would never abandon her or let her be lonely ever again. My whole life revolved around her.

I'm gutted. I feel like a bag of skin wrapped clumsily around an echoing void. I want so bad to just turn off, to just make the pain go away. But I can't think of a worse tribute to my beautiful girl than to go right back to what I did before her. I have a doctor appointment in a couple hours to see about maybe getting something to help with anxiety and sleep. But IWNDWYT.",103

I have been struggling a lot with my relationship with alcohol lately. I definitely don't need to drink everyday and don't even have the urge to. I hate being hungover, my hangovers are AWFUL, I get hungover very easily, I don't like adding all of the extra calories to my diet, I sleep horribly and in general, I don't have the urge to drink. Which is why I don't do it often. I have a big bottle of tequila in my apartment and it just sits there collecting dust. I never drink in my apartment alone, unless I have people over and have a drink or two. I can go weeks or months without drinking and be fine. I even went 6 months once without a drink when I was having stomach issues and sugar was causing them. I will say, I really enjoyed not waking up hungover for 6 months but it was hard being around all of my friends, when they were drunk. I wanted to join in on the fun.

My issue is that I have decided to only really drink on ""special occasions"", like Halloween or going to a friend's birthday party. Since I rarely drink, I tend to over do it when because I get too excited that I'm finally drinking. I feel like I've earned the right to get drunk because I typically abstain. I'm similar with food. I'm very strict about my eating but if I let myself have a cheat day, I go crazy because I feel like I've earned it and I don't know when I'll get to eat this kind of food again.

I usually end up drinking way too much because I get carried away. I will typically black out a little and I feel awful the next day. I usually feel incredibly anxious and depressed the next day too. I'm always scared I did something dumb that people will hate me for and I overanalyze everything. I already struggle with anxiety and depression. I've never puked from drinking and it's not like I'm a complete mess. I just wonder if since I can't seem to pace myself when I do drink and I almost always get too drunk, should I just stop completely? I read a lot of posts on here and most people seem to have issues with wanting to drink everyday. Since I don't have that issue, I don't know if I necessarily ""have a problem"". I just hate how out of control it gets on the occasions when I do drink.

If anyone else has a similar story, that would be really helpful. I just hate how much our society (I live in the US) is centered around alcohol. I don't want to miss out on having fun. All of my friends casually drink but I don't seem to know when to stop once I get started. I will say, if I'm at dinner with a friend or something casual, I can easily just have 2-3 drinks and be fine. But if I know it's special event and everyone else will be getting drunk, that's when I lose control.",2

I don't know if my friends are afraid of losing their drinking buddy or if they're just being kind, but everytime I apologize for my drunken behavior they tell me I was fine, they didn't even notice, etc. Finally yesterday my therapist straight up told me she thinks I need to stop drinking after months of failed attemps at moderation. And it feels weird, but in a good way. Hearing it from her was so different than hearing it from someone close to me. I feel like it's what I needed to hear to give myself permission to stop. I'm not overreacting, I'm not doing a detox or on some kind of health kick, I'm not drinking because it's not good for me and I need to stop.

And it was definitely difficult. Especially Saturday night-- I'm an Ohio State fan, and that first half was BRUTAL. I can't remember the last time I watched a football game (especially one I cared about) without drinking. But the feeling eventually subsided, in part because I started entertaining the idea of moderation. Like, part of the problem with committing is sobriety is the finality of it-- I'm not going to drink ever ever again. But I said, hey, maybe I'm just blowing things out of proportion, and I don't have as much of a problem as I think I do, and if I just set an expiration date to it, like 28 days, that'll give me enough time to get perspective and get my drinking under control. It was a comforting thought that got me through the worst parts of Saturday evening. That and the manic cleaning. And the bottomless cups of coffee.

Flash forward to Monday. Sunday wasn't much of a trigger-y day with drinking due to having a lot of things going on. So we're skipping that. But on Monday, I thought to myself, wait. Do I really even need alcohol? Like, what's so bad about just not having that be a part of my life? I can't begin to count the benefits of being sober all the time and never being drunk.

I don't know. It just struck me as interesting. It's like I tricked myself into a deeper commitment to sobriety. It's like when I tell my kid I'll get him McDonald's if he stops whining, and then I just wait out the clock until he forgets about it. But hey, it got him to stop whining. And I saved a trip to McDonald's.",3

I’ve been to that bar before during a connection a couple years ago when I would post up at airport bars and get loaded in between flights. Flight anxiety, id say, but I’m fine with flying. The airport is one place where an alcoholic can be free of the shame of drinking before noon on a Tuesday. If I did that at my local bar, I’d be one of those drunks who goes to a bar alone early in the day. Not here; look at all these people drinking too, I don’t have a problem! 

I stopped because I remembered what happened last time I went to that bar. I sit down with my painful hangover and order a draft IPA and ice water. Dehydrated from the night before, I start slamming the water in between the sips of beer and the bartender says, while refilling it for the 5th time, “rough night last night?” But it wasn’t rough, it was a pretty typical night of drinking an unreasonable amount knowing the next day was a travel day and I could be hungover bc I didn’t have to be “on.” It didn’t even register at the time that the airport bartender noticed my state while I rehydrated and drank the hair of the dog that bit me. One of the many signs of the problem I didn’t notice until I got sober.

This time, it’s different. I’m sitting at my gate sipping on an iced coffee, reflecting on my year of  sobriety and how greatful I am for turning it around. Thank you to this amazing community for keeping me motivated to stay sober and for giving me the platform to tell a group of people who can understand how proud I am to walk right by the airport bar knowing that chapter of my story complete. 

Onwards and upwards, I will not drink with you today.",33

I’m not sure if I could ever have said that for any of my adult or indeed teen years. I AM HAPPY. My anxiety is under control. It hasn’t gone completely but it’s in check, and I don’t feel so terrible that I’m thinking of ways to end it all on a daily basis. 

I am putting myself first in many instances. I’m working out what I need in order to be the best mother/daughter/friend/employee I can. And I’ve realised I’m STRONG! I can pretty much face anything! I do not need alcohol to prop me up, to be my confidante, to be my escape. I AM ENOUGH.

Today  would have been my 366th day had I followed through with the promise I  made to myself when I first picked up my white chip. (367 days since I  had totaled my car in a blackout too, coincidentally)

I  went to meetings, sat quietly, smoked quietly and didn't find a  sponsor. But I went and listened and realized I wasn't alone. I repaired  the damage with my forgiving wife and I woke up early on the weekends  without a headache and full of energy. I ran a half-marathon, felt  better, looked better and enjoyed being better.

But  I had slip ups...bought a bottle of wine on a business trip and drank  alone in my hotel room. No harm, no foul (skipped the conference the  next morning).

Went out drinking  with friends a few times, planned to sip on one drink, drank 8-10 but I  ubered home and took a tylenol in the morning. No harm, no foul. (Acted  like a grumpy entitled shit to my wife and kids the rest of the weekend  because I was hungover and exhausted)

The  list goes on and begins to escalate...but the reality is that until my  arrest a year ago, I thought I could manage booze with a bit of will  power. Now I'm a criminal with an interlock device. So far this time  around, nothing has gone wrong but it won't, until it does...

I guess I need to restart the clock and head out to a meeting.",6

I’ve found that with nicotine each day you don’t smoke seems slightly easier than the last but alcohol isn’t like that for me. I still feel tempted by alcohol. My anxiety has been really really bad lately because my sister-in-law has been going through some crazy shit. Her boyfriend is addicted to meth and now she’s pregnant with his child.

I have a fucking problem.,"My company Christmas party was this weekend. It's a whole weekend thing, and my office is full of quite heavy drinkers. Friday night we went to a pub to watch a sports game and without even hesitating, I ordered a drink. We golfed Saturday morning and I had a drink at 8 am. That night was our potluck and gift exchange and my boss brought dozens of bottles of great wine. I woke up Sunday shivering with a wicked bruise on my arm, multiple texts from friends questioning the insane voicemails I had left them, and a deep sense of shame. 

It's been really hard to admit to myself I have a drinking problem. Like so many others, I have strong friendships, a good job, a loving family, and lots of hobbies. Every time I dabble in sobriety, I tell myself it's just a cool thing I'm trying.. Sobriety is kind of having a moment, so it's like when I do Whole30 or do yoga for a month. 

In reality though, I've been drowning. I keep upping the dose of my anti-depressants. I can hardly stand to be alone. I'm struggling with disordered eating again and only one meal every day or two. I can't keep doing the apology tour of isolating and getting drunk alone and ignoring everyone and making them wonder if I'm ok, and then being social and getting trashed and making everyone REALLY wonder if I'm ok. 

I decided to check out Smart recovery today. There's a meeting after work that I can make it to, so I already saved the location in my phone and looked up how I'm going to get there. I decided what I'm going to eat after work today. I ordered a couple new water bottles to make having NA beverages as easy as possible. 

I have a fucking drinking problem. Luckily I also have the solution. I will not drink with you today.",16

Wine and craft beer on the weeknights and whatever during weekend social events.  Every 6 months I have an incident, where I drink too much and vomit at night or the next morning.  Also, these incidents have been around my son.  

On Saturday night, another incident happened. I yelled at my wife, blacked out, and stumbled home with my son.  The next morning, I felt embarrassed, disappointed and afraid of what this will do to my family.

So I will start the journey to not drink.  I have done this in the past and I end up in the same spot.  Casually drinking and doing fine with one mammoth eruption every 6 months.

Not sure what to do other than take it a day at a time but i am not hopeful that i can last longer than 18 days (previous record).

But as time goes on, I miss drinking less and less, and I'm pretty sure I am going to be done with it forever. When I really think about it, I am sure that alcohol played a pretty big role in giving me the anxiety that led me to Clonazepam in the first place.

The article is horrible. Domestic violence against my wife that resulted in a 2nd degree assault charge. The charge was acquitted but the article remains.

Any violence against women automatically places you in an exiled state that is almost impossible to redeem yourself from. Permanent embarrassment for my wife, and family who share the same last name. My son's name is the same, so when he Google's that name that article appears.

Saturday evening he was wasted (BAC 216), fell and couldn’t get up. The EMTs took him into the hospital as even when they stood him up he was unstable. When the examine him at the hospital it turned out that he had somehow broken ribs on both first of his body. He was medically detoxed and sent home yesterday. He ribs are very painful but he isn’t taking painkillers because he can’t drink when he takes them. He has a home aide and isn’t alone in the house but he’s already drinking again with  NO plans to stop. 

I have had numerous discussions about him considering trying to really stop drinking. I haven’t had a thirty day streak of sobriety yet BUT those 6, 7 and 8 day streaks really have me appreciating a morning that’s not after being drunk is calm and restful. 

So. He’s like a walking billboard on what late stage alcoholism looks like. He’s out of it now but I know that the part of his that is my awesome Dad is poking me on the shoulder and saying “look at this cautionary tale that I am showing you - do as I say not as I do”.",8

So what has changed in 100 days? 
•People tell me the light has returned to my eyes again.
•I really remember the live music I am fortunate enough to experience.
•I haven’t lost weight, which was honestly a huge motivator for me but it’s ok! I am so much less bloated I FEEL like I’m smaller. 
•I have finally donated things I’ve had in a pile for years. 
• My boyfriend has cut down his drinking significantly 
•I say YES to work! I’ve made so much more money than if I sat at home drinking beer all day like in the past. 
•I can finally afford Christmas presents for my family and friends. I’ve always been a grouch over the holidays but this year is different! 
•I am genuinely happier ❤️ 

Life is hard and shit sucks sometimes but the Mark of a strong person is HOW they deal with setbacks and disappointments. My father had always said “Attitude is Everything” I CAN handle life without drinking! I am NOT missing out not drinking wine with my family at dinner or coworkers after a shift!

Half the time I drink, it's just because it's something to do. My tolerance is high and low at the same time. I can function well while drunk. My lower body fat and lower weight compared to a year ago, even a few months ago, means it really fucks me up after a couple drinks.   
I need to dial it back.   
I need to stop on the weekdays entirely.   
I'm very aware of the difference in how I feel when I don't drink every night. Even if I'm not actually getting drunk- just buzzed. I know I will sleep better. I know I will feel better. I know I will have more clarity in my mind.   
I need to stop the cycle.   
In fact, lets make this positive and conducive to actually making a change.

>I will stop the cycle.   
I will stop drinking on weekdays.   
I will cut back to 1 long, and strong sipping drink on the weekends.

It's crazy to me that it still took 3 years of understanding that I had a problem, multiple stints of abstaining, and several more drunken incidents before I was really ready to quit. Looking back and seeing the mind games I was playing to try and ""moderate"" which never ended up lasting.   


It's moments like these that I'm glad I turn to writing so I have a little glimpse of my old self and gain perspective.   


Just wanted to share because I'm feeling introspective today.

2. Dont lose sight of how beneficial the sleep, energy and consistently positive mood is
3. You are drinking to numb your feelings, to escape. Try to examine why instead of feeding a quick impulse
4. You drink alone, even among other people
5. You never regret not drinking the next day

Its been two years now since I was able to maintain the strength to not drink. Since then its only gotten harder. The hardest part? Its not the being around people drinking, its not paying for it. Its not waking up for work the next day or being a dad. I am able to do all of those things, and able to do those things quite well from a functioning standpoint. The single hardest thing I am realizing is ignoring that after work craving and not giving in to it. Its just become this thing thats been embedded in my daily routine. I get out of work, I pick up the kids, I get home, and boom. Walk into the kitchen and pour a glass of wine. Its so rooted in the daily repetition that i am finding it SO hard to eliminate it. For now, trying to replace it with chamomile tea. Worked last night, hope it works tonight.",42
2019-12-10 09:58:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e8rn41/6_months_today_things_i_have_noticedlearned_and/,"6 months today! Things I have noticed/learned, and things that helped me","hey all,

just dropping in to say i'm still not drinking after 6 months! Really proud of myself. it flew by in some ways, in other ways I know it probably can/will get more difficult at times in my life. But right now, I feel like I have my life back and it's easy to stay sober.  A lot of that is trying to totally change the way I live my life, so I don't feel stuck in the same spaces/thinking.

things that have worked for me, things I have observed:

* This Naked Mind book and sometimes the podcast, really made me see all this as a choice to make with obvious benefits; for a couple years I had tried moderating and always felt like not being a social butterfly party animal meant I was missing out on life in some way.  obviously, i was missing out on life more by drinking to numb my brain.  Have not felt that AA or other programs were right for me, and I've had great results with trying to change my way of thinking and create my own roadmap to not drinking based on who I am, and what works for me.   I do think that even more than recovery-centered content, after about the 3rd month I started to feel that it was much more empowering for me to continue walking AWAY from alcohol and TOWARDS other things I wanted to spend my thinking energy on.  Still incorporate recovery information into my days, but just focusing on other things a bit more.  Read some other spiritual/self-help content, and now I am listening to On Being podcasts as much as possible.  The content keeps me focused on being present and considering ideas, rather than reacting. 
* Finding and following random people on instagram who also don't drink (even if that's not the focus/point of their instagram) - this has helped me a LOT in learning to view non-drinking as normal and get rid of the deprivation thinking.  Also, going out to social events MORE has made it the new normal that I'm just having sodas, it isn't weird anymore. 
* all the seltzer, kombucha, hop water, bitters and citrus,  and occasionally an NA IPA beer if i'm at a bar that has it.  Because the beer is doing nothing to my brain, it actually makes me more aware of how weird it is to drink so much of a dense beer for a buzz, and I have no desire to drink an alcoholic one. Isn't for everyone, but works for me.
* keeping track of all the money i'm saving and buying myself occasional presents.  ie, a pair of nice pants since I went down a whole size since quitting, a new pair of shoes, a little bottle of perfume.  the ""rewards"" of not drinking are starting to feel much more tangible and attractive than any ""rewards"" my brain might have felt from alcohol. also putting some of the money aside for long-term savings.... something i haven't done in years because any extra money I was usually like ""let's go out!"" not anymore!  This is also helping my partner as he is becoming more aware on money he spends on alcohol, and has cut back himself.
* because i was/am struggling with anxiety and depression (something that was definitely causing me to drink, and that drinking was making worse) i am taking small amounts of CBD to cope as my brain chems balance out, and am in the process of researching healthcare options and CBT specialists in my area, to hopefully make things even better/easier.  That said, I don't have health insurance (America) so trying to research as a much as I can.  Realizing it might end up being that some medication does actually help me, I'm not ruling it out, but I have noticed a dramatic difference in my anxiety since quitting drinking and spending more of my time actively trying to help myself, instead of hurt myself.
* Cooking basically all our meals.  Sort of happened because cooking felt therapeutic to me, something to focus on... but I noticed that it also made me more aware of what I was putting into my body and how different meals affected me. I've lost weight, but also just feel better, and am saving money even more than from not drinking because I'm not going out to restaurants as much.  Because of that, I sometimes buy some of the higher quality ingredients that I felt I couldn't afford before, like nice olive oil, nuts and cheeses, which feels like a nice treat.  and I have gotten a lot better about buying sustainable ingredients in sustainable ways (ie, local and bulk, farmers markets) which has also made me feel really motivated to keep going down this path of trying to consider my decisions more, and the impact those decisions have.  Reading a lot of books about food, so I'm getting better at cooking, but also learning a lot about history and nutrition and ecology.  If it makes me feel empowered to keep cooking for myself, I say it's a good investment.  But basically I mention all this because focusing on what I eat has really helped me to avoid alcohol, by distracting me but also teaching me to care for myself in a more holistic way.   


It's funny how much of my income I was diverting to drinking because I thought I deserved it, but in reality all these other things I'm now spending money on instead are actual investments in my own life, not just money thrown away on a forgotten night and a headache. 

anyway, thanks to this sub for existing. it's a comfort to know it exists and that if things get hard, this is one of the greatest resources I can imagine for feeling like you're not alone in this struggle. See you at the year mark!",21

Fell off the wagon this summer and am right back where I started, drinking 1-2 bottles of wine every single night. Today seems like a good random Tuesday for another Day 1. Let’s try this again.","37F.  I was sober for over a year (with a few slips along the way) after a decade of heavy drinking. It was a great year.  I met all sorts of goals, slept like a baby, ran and did yoga regularly, was healthier than I had been in years, my anxiety melted away and I felt great.  Content bordering on happy after a decade of misery.



Then in July, I had “a drink” with friends that were visiting from out of town.  I put that in quotes because of course it was 4-5 drinks.  I never have just one drink.  Later in July, I drank with friends again, heavily.  Was incredibly hungover and called in sick the next day saying I had a migraine.  



In August, I drank on a family vacation and my anxiety flared up and I sobbed through my birthday and worried my loved ones.



In September, I traveled to a wedding and drank more or less like a normal person.  It felt great.  I really felt like I mastered moderation.  I came home with the confidence that I can definitely drink again, now that I can moderate.



Then I immediately started drinking 1-2 full bottles of wine every single night and have been doing that for the last two and a half months.

Here is how I feel now:

1. Riddled with anxiety, taking anti-anxiety medication every day of the week.

2. Exhausted because I haven’t had a decent night of sleep in months.

3. Bloated and disgusting – my face is ruddy, my hair is dull, and I gained almost 10 pounds.  I haven’t exercised in almost two months.

4. My digestion is terrible and I am congested all the time.  Both of those things resolved completely when I was sober.    

5. Distracted/trapped.  All I think about during the day is whether or not I will drink when I get home from work, knowing full well that I’m going to drink and not accomplish anything else.

6. Ashamed of myself.  


This time, I am going to start with a short-term goal of staying sober until the end of the year.  I want to be sober and well-rested and patient and kind.  I want to be fully present for my family during the holidays.  I want this as a gift to myself and a gift to my family.  


I am going to push through the withdrawals this week, with the goal of being on the mend and feeling well by Christmas.  Then I will start the even harder work of staying sober permanently.

Right now, I just need to set an attainable goal so that I can start to feel the positive affects again and remember why sobriety is a gift and not a punishment.

I had been drinking everynight for almost 2 weeks. I remember waking up with one of those headaches and making it to the bathroom trying not to look in the mirror. I did tho, my face had a yellowish tint that looked like it wished I hadnt woke up, my eyes were red all over, my stomache hurt. I took a crap and it was almost green, (thanks Budweiser) After that I tried to throw up bit there was just that stuff that looks like snot but isnt. So I ended up with some pleasant dry heaving and a nice whiff of toilet. I realized it was about 7:50 on Thursday and I was going to be late for work, again.

To be honest I dont know why sober stuck. I tried hard not to like it & I don't think I was at rock bottom. Maybe my body giving me the colors of a stop light was not great indicator for someone who was 26. Maybe i was just tired of it. Maybe I knew I wasnt going to last much longer in my current path. It stuck tho, and I'm thankful. I remember starting out as a necessity with one week to dry out, then I figured I might as well wait till after Christmas, then dry January, and trying for 100days... Just kept stringing days together. Here I am

Some pros: I did almost am entire 180. I have better relationships with almost everyone - friends and family. I dont look like death anymore, my heart rate dropped for 95 to 60bpm, mental health is way better, and I grew a beard. Saved probably at least $20,000 and paid off all my debt. Took some awesome trips. Took about 10 strokes off my golf game (still suck) Went back to college. Found new hobbies that I would have never tried. I feel present. 

Things I hope to do this year: get my own place, spend some time abroad seeing the world. Find a new job. Maybe go to grad school. idk, somehow anything seems possible.

I would like to thank this community, its awesome. I wish there was a real place where we could meet up sometime and just chat.

I made my first post here 18 days ago, at which point I had been sober 10 days. So day before yesterday, I was in a bad state mentally as work has been pretty shitty all week. So when I went to see a couple friends (who I hadn't seen for a while, and hence didnt tell I stopped drinking ) for dinner. After it, I got offered it a beer and I just said....sure.

My mind just went into autopilot, rather than saying ""I've quit now"" , I just had it. As I finished drinking it, I immediately wanted another drink and a better buzz because my mind just went ""man I don't feel the buzz ,that one beer didn't do it for me""....and I felt like ""hey while going home let's get another beer"" But some belated sense arrived while I was just sitting and after another hour I went straight went home instead.  

Immediately as I came in I felt a wall of shame coming down on me. I tried to grasp at straws to feel better ""at least you stopped with one fucking beer"" but no, I just went to bed with shitty guilt. Woke up yesterday, felt sad all day, and the same feeling today. Of course I haven't drank again, but I keep having the shame that...if I could only last 26 fucking days without so much as touching a drop of booze,  how the hell am I going to last years or forever like I want to?

I found out that about 3 weeks ago, Anthony Green of Circa Survive/Saosin relapsed after about 5 years sober.

  


Anthony was, and still is I suppose, a huge sobriety role model for me. Circa Survive had been my favorite band for a decade. Their music has gotten me through so much. I even have a tattoo of their logo on my arm.

  


I feel sad. My heart goes out to him and his family. But at the same time, I feel kind of betrayed. And there's no reason for me to feel that way. I don't know him, he doesn't know me, he doesn't owe me anything. So I don't know why I feel like that.

  


But at the same time, I completely understand. I'm pretty sure his drug of choice was heroin, but as we all know, for an addict a drug is a drug is a drug. And I know what that beckoning is like.

  


It's just tough because my thinking was always ""Well if Anthony Green can quit heroin, I can quit alcohol."" And I still feel that way, it's just been hard to swallow, even though I know he's human just like the rest of us. So i'm not sure what the purpose of this post is. Just to vent, I suppose.

The only thing to make this feeling going away is standing up and grabbing another. The wave of relief after sitting back down with a full glass is euphoric and liberating. But then that bottle is soon nearly empty and the world goes round and round. Nowadays I drink ice tea and lemonade that comes in a can. When I throw away the cans morning after they are always empty. Because I am content with that one beverage and am not filling a bottomless glass inside.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It is different this time. I have no doubt I am now permanently sober. Sure, one day at a time yet I just know now. I have a better sense of my triggers and how to combat them. I am also keeping an open mind and reading/posting/commenting on this sub every day. I want to share the love and support.

420-430 days sober in 2018 and 2019 after starting drinking in 2003. This was the right path to choose and I just began it. I am going to keep going.

2019-12-09 23:10:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e8liio/book_movie_tuesday/,Book & Movie Tuesday,"Happy Tuesday, my fellow sobernauts! I have been, as usual, getting my books from the library, but lately I have been getting them as audiobooks and then listening to them as I walk into town. This combines two of my favorite parts of SELF-care (S = sleep, E = exercise, L = laughter, F = food), the exercise part because it’s my thirty-minute daily walk, and the laughter part because I’ve been listening to comedies. (I enjoy audiobooks the most when it’s the writers themselves who read the book, not hired actors.)

Most recently, I have been listening to *You’ll Grow Out of It,* written and read by Jessi Klein, and it is HILARIOUS. Here’s a passage from her essay titled “The Bath:”

>To me there has always been something vaguely miserable about being in the bath. The soaking, the sitting, the water getting dirty and cold, the inevitable random hair floating up against your skin, the pruning. It always makes me feel like I’m stewing up the world’s saddest soup out of myself. It hurts my neck. I get hot and thirsty in the bath and when I stand up I always feel like I’m going to pass out. Because I feel less clean them when I got in, I have to take a shower afterward. Ultimately, it feels like I’ve gone backwards, hygiene-wise.

>But these are just my physical issues with the bath. My conceptual problems with bathing begin with the very same ideology some ad man for Calgon decided to trade on forty years ago: the idea that the bath is the last space woman can escape to, like a gazelle fleeing a lion by running into water up to her head. I feel like getting in the bath is a kind of surrender to the idea that we can’t really make it on land, that we’ve lost the fight for a bedroom corner even just her own chair in the living room. And once the bath becomes our last resort, Stockholm syndrome occurs. We cede all other space to the husbands or boyfriends or kids and then convince ourselves that this is awesome! Yay, I’m submerged in a watery trough! This is incredible! This is my happy place!

I laughed with self-recognition when I read this, because I’m the first person to rave about how great a hot bath is, but the concept of the bathtub as a place of fabulous refuge *is* kind of ridiculous when you think about it.

How about you? What have you been reading/watching?",21

Lots of folks noticed I wasn't drinking and made a point of talking about how I wasn't back to drinking yet. 

Yet. 

This left me feeling as though if we decide to stop drinking, it's only temporary perhaps. When I explained that this was most likely permanent.....like forever.....I was met with shock and confusion. How could I possibly go forever without booze? How would I survive? It felt like a life and death issue to some. Perhaps those most confused have their own battle with the bottle and couldn't imagine going without. No judgements of course. It's hard. One of the hardest things I've ever done. But its thru hard work and a commitment to sobriety that keeps me sober. 

So for all y'all out there at holiday parties not drinking, cheers to you all!! You're all doing great!! Its ok to be sober. Even if nobody there understands. We have to paddle our own canoes. It's a lonely journey sometimes, but it's worth it. Keep trying. Keep going. You're doing great!!

Chatted with a good friend, and on the advice of my therapist, going to reach out to a few more. 

I got a really good explanation as to why I’m more prone to have absolutely zero control in a social setting as opposed to being at home with family. I spoke about the upcoming social outing and the struggle I’m having with saying no to alcohol that night. However, whether it be an excuse or not, I have to leave town early the next morning, so no drinking. Either way, I simply have no desire to drink whatsoever. 

Mistakes were made, I have an issue with controlling myself, and I take full responsibility.

I've debated posting this one for a while. Basically, I do almost all of my drinking while sitting at my desk, so I rigged up a button on my mouse to log each standard drink I down. I've been fastidious about it—it's not something I show anyone else, so there's no reason for me to lie or fudge the numbers. And I've been disciplined about it; I'm not usually very self-disciplined (as you can see!) but I'm able to become a stickler for a few particular things, including logging drinks.

When I go out and drink, I run an estimate in my head (or sometimes use a notes app on my phone), but a few probably slip through the cracks. So this graph represents a good ""lower bound"" estimate; it's probably about 95% accurate, but every time I press that button, I've downed a drink.

I'm not gonna lie, I'm in a bad spot now. Missed work this morning after having 18 last night. My 28-day average is the highest it's been all year. I haven't had a ""zero day"" in almost a month.

But I'm gonna stop for as long as I can. Cold turkey. Shakes, chills, hallucinations, insomnia, whole deal. I'm in for a fun time.

2019-12-09 18:32:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e8i0op/my_venture_into_sobriety/,My venture into Sobriety," On November 23rd, 2019 I had came to the realization that I had an alcohol problem. Well, I shouldn’t say “realization” because I knew all along. I guess I just finally made the decision to make a change on this day. This is my first time experiencing reddit because my best friend sent me the link to this particular group and encouraged me to join Reddit and this thread since he knew the endeavor of sobriety that I was pursuing. After reading so many people’s personal struggle with alcohol I can’t feel the need to also share my story to add into the positive reinforcement that I’ve seen,

I’m 26 years old, I come from a semi-rural town in the state of West Virginia where there isn’t much industry, hell there really isn’t much to do period other than go to the local sports bar, pub, things of that nature. I mean I guess as far as “proactive” hobbies we do have the bowling alley &amp; a planet fitness. I think you can get the point though when it comes to me describing the environment. 


My first experience with alcohol was when I was at the age of 13 and my mom was having a Halloween party. My brother was around the age of 19-20 and his friends were all drinking alcohol and having a good time and I had my first beer. No, I didn’t get drunk or anything. I honestly thought it was quite the nasty taste and I couldn’t understand where the enjoyment was. 


At age 14-15 (I can’t remember the exact age) I had moved out of my mother’s house and into my fathers because it was fundamentally a better move for me. I would come stay with her on the weekends here and there but sometimes she would have to work weekends so it would just be me and a couple friends at the house by ourselves time to time. This is where my first “threatening” experience with drinking stems from. One of my friends had a mutual friend that was over the age of 21 and we ran into him at the mall and talked him into buying us liquor and other sorts of alcohol with the money our parents had given us before we all got a ride to the mall.

From what I can remember it was that nasty stuff, you know like the liquor that comes in only plastic bottles? Yeah, bottom of the barrel stuff. We had made it back to my moms house and started drinking and my last memory of that night was tipping back a gallon of Vladimir and I remember seeing the ceiling light reflect off of the vodka inside the bottle as it slowly got emptier with each mouthful I drank.

Fast forward to the following morning, and I’m at my dads house in my room and had no recollection of the night before. What had happened was I went back into my room for some reason and I never came back out. The best friend that I referenced earlier in the post came in because he wondered where I was and there I am, laying on my back, choking on my own vomit until I could barely breath. Luckily he knew the proper safety measures to save my life.

You would think that an experience like this would make someone never want to pickup a bottle again. Not me. That young &amp; naive, I just forgot about it and went on with my daily life as a teenager. Obviously after this I drank at local high school after parties on the weekend because that’s all we knew in the area, there was nothing to do. I’m not using this as an excuse but to give you a better scope of the area we’re from. 

Let’s fast forward to my freshman year of college where I enrolled at WVU which mind you, was at the time the #1 party school in the nation. Go figure. I went from this rural town to what seemed like a metropolis of people my age, just trying to find themselves and navigate through young adulthood, with the more than occasional partying and drug experiences. I had felt like I found my “tribe”. When in reality the only thing I could relate to all these people with was the fact we were all just getting fucked up on the weekends. Then it’s progression grew into an everyday thing.


I dropped out of College, couldn’t keep my grades up because the only thing I could keep up was a bottle pressing my lips, a blunt rolled in my hand, a line of MDMA on the counter, and other assortment of things like that. My drinking had allowed myself to tap into substances that I never did before, stuff that went against my moral compass (other than pot, 420 friendly but I can’t smoke because of my current job). 


I had to move back home, and I thought this was my chance to actually “get my shit together”. I got a job at a local bar and it just reignited the whole cycle of drinking. One year later, I met a girl that I fell heavily in love with but because of alcohol I cheated, I lied, I was doing things I was not brought up on. I kept thinking she wouldn’t leave because when you’re down that deep you don’t consider other peoples feelings, you don’t consider anything other than your next “fix” if that makes sense. Well, she left, &amp; I chose to cope with alcohol. 

I was coming home one right after the post break up, drunk, and wrecked my brand new truck doing over $12,000 worth of damage that luckily insurance was able to cover. Once again, you would think that this experience would stop someone but it didn’t. It kept progressing to the point where my friends said that it was normal to see me with a beer in my hand. I drank and drove everyday. Making “pit-stops” at every has station and spending $1-3 on a 25 oz. 

I was getting belligerently, blacked out drunk. Remember that best friend that I referenced to twice? I’d wake up and piss all over his shit. His couch, his coffee table, floor, etc. No recollection of any of it. I’m sure this may seem comical to some, and that’s okay I’d laugh to but I felt so ashamed. I still do. Luckily we’re still best friends. (Still sorry about that, dude.) 

I was disrespecting and hurting the ones that meant the most to me, all because I was to busy chasing a buzz. 

My “rock bottom” was 3-4 weeks ago I think, I was on a 3-4 day bender and went over to a friends house and got heavily drunk and decided to snort Xanax. I knew it was wrong but I didn’t give a single fuck. Just like how I didn’t give a single fuck any other time before for my own well-being or anyone around me. 

The following Sunday, I quit.

So here I am, 15 days into sobriety and I can attest to everyone else saying they’ve never felt better. Yes I know it’s only 15 days but that’s 15 days closer to 30, which is halfway to 60 days, and more than half to 90 days. YOU CAN DO THIS.

You’re gonna get triggered, you’re going to have bad days, you’re going to have low moments but I promise you...if you stick with it you’ll rediscover your love for life. You’ll love the simple things again like waking up, smelling the coffee brewing, seeing the world and what’s going on outside. 

We’re all miles away and anonymous to each other but it feels so good to be a part of this group because it feels like I’ve known you all forever. Keep your head up everyone, one love.",5

So I drank a couple weeks ago after having been sober for 3 months. It was horrible, suffice to say. I had a hangover that had me puking in public, puking on the bus, barely able to stand. Not fun. Anyway I decided to return to full blown sobriety. I've been setting up a lot of things for my mental health and accomplishing a lot of goals. I feel good in that regard. But I've been having a lot of trouble with old obsessive behaviour coming back...mainly about my skin. It's turned into a couple of full blown mental breakdowns. On top of that I've been seeing my ex again and he's decided yet again that he wants to get back together. I really don't think it's the best idea given our history (we've already tried to be in a relationship twice before) but I have an extremely hard time just letting him go. Also it seems that all the emphasis is on me getting better and none on him working on himself. Yet another thing bothering me is that a friend of mine has seemingly ghosted me without any reason as to why. All of these things are melting together in my brain and turning into a giant, terrifying beast of anxiety that has left me exhausted and without much ability to resist the idea of having a drink to soothe it all.",2

Last night was my work's Christmas party (at the store itself, so no worries of alcohol there), and as it was wrapping up, some of my favourite coworkers said they were going to grab a drink before heading home and asked if I wanted to join them. They're ones that I rarely get to spend time with outside of work and would absolutely love to see them more in a social setting, but I also knew that I'm not at a point where I could be comfortable watching them drink without wanting one myself. So I politely declined and said that I had to be back to work early this morning.

I'm so proud of myself for being able to say ""no"" - something that I've always struggled with and often leads to me getting roped into things I'm not thrilled about. I'm also so proud that I didn't hesitate to think of my sobriety first before answering. This is the longest I've been sober in years (twenty full days at the stroke of midnight!) and immediately thought how much I don't want to mess it up this time.

Just a very small and minor experience, but one that's kept me happy today. It's also one that I can't share with anyone else, much less anyone who would actually get how important a small moment/decision like that can be.

I’m 32 and I’ve been wanting to take a break or quit for a while now. Not sure which one yet. I am a binge drinker and have been for a long time. I don’t need to drink every day but on the weekends I get this itch that I can’t overcome. Always the last one to go to bed and searching for uppers to keep the night (or day) going. I know that I am not living up to my full potential in life whether it be as a husband and father, life, building my business, my day job. I feel like I’ve lost control of how much I drank now too. I pretty much blackout just about every time. But even after all that, It is still so hard to quit. 

There are a few reasons that make it hard to quit:

1) I’m scared of how it will effect relationships. 
2) the itch to drink after not drinking for a little while is unbearable!
3) the feeling of “I deserve a drink” after not drinking for a couple weeks 
4) I feel like life will be so boring. 
5) is it even worth it? 

Not sure what I want from this post. It’s my first one here. Maybe some advice on how to help me make a decision. I’m sure I’ve stated nothing new. Just someone looking for some guidance. TIA",1

However the drama spilling over from Thanksgiving is still present, more ""infected"", less resolved and it's going to affect Christmas planning.  More infected because the people involved in the drama still have talked and resisted any attempts by me to get them to talk and therefore the hurts have just become magnified.

So yeah, I was triggered as these issues go deep and are very old.   
Some of the people involved need to be in a recovery program but aren't.     
One of the people involved is in recovery but doesn't seem to be working the program on the situation.    
It's all very complicated and complex.

During the call, I made the mistake of trying to help soothe hurt feelings and trying to offer an objective perspective, which was immediately rejected and I was told ""You're taking the other person's side."" and now I'm the bad guy.  WTF? haha OMG....you just gotta love the twists and turns of an alcoholic family.

So while I was all twisted up inside after the call.  I processed it for a bit and then picked up the phone and discussed it with my sponsor and I'm in a MUCH better place.

I don't have to get involved as there aren't any issues that I need to solve.  In fact, I don't think I could solve them even if I see the situation clearly and objectively and could act as a moderator, that's not my job to do.  One person involved is literally gathering their troops, making their logical arguments to these troops as to why their analysis of the situation is correct and then informing others of their plans and why.  

Thankfully my sponsor got me straightened out and I turned the whole thing over to God.   
While my plans for the Christmas Holiday may be in flux and I may very well not spend the holiday with my family, I'm 100% OK with this.  I've voluntarily omitted myself from past Christmas's for a very similar issue.  

The difference is that I wasn't working my program before and today I am.  
So while I might spend the holiday apart from my family, I've still got AA and I don't have to be alone during the holidays.

I'm so beyond grateful to AA because honestly, this shit is so complex, complicated, frustrating and triggering that I might even drink over the Christmas Holiday if it weren't for AA.  There's something so comforting in being able to talk about this with other people that have alcoholism and know how fucking confusing these situations can be and how hurtful and how they can drive us back to drinking.  

But my sponsor just helps me keep it very simple, it's not my situation to resolve.  
It's up to God and the people involved.  
I likely won't have any part to play in the resolution because emotions are high and it's just too sensitive of an issue and I'm too close to the situation.  
So all I can do it turn the situation and the people over to the care of God, as I understand God, and then let it go.

As for my holiday plans, my sponsor advised that I don't commit to any plans yet, just wait and see but be prepared to spend my holiday apart from my family (which is seriously OK and has been preferred in years past when this type of issue came up) and try to enjoy today.  Oh yeah, working the program is also critical during times like these....thankfully I have a program to work today.

It started with sneaking coolers from parents to drink on the weekends, sneaking into bars with fake ID's. Once i turned 18 I was going to the bar every weekend and almost every week night hitting some pub or bar up for their specials. Through university we would manage the stress by midweek drinking and going out at least one night on the weekends. I'm not sure how I actually made it through university and came out with a degree. This is part of the reason why i never thought that i had a problem. It wasn't until 10 years later with a marriage and 2 kids that I started to feel that I may have a problem. Mostly because I realized that I couldn't do any event or outing with out hoping alcohol was involved or depending on it to get through the occasion. My husband started to comment about my 2-3 glasses of wine per night, and although deep down i knew that was an issue i brushed it off as ""every mom has one or two glasses at the end of a busy day"". Truth was i needed that little buzz and i looked forward to it every day. THe only time I truly completely stopped drinking was the years i was carrying my babies. For some reason that was no problem to just stop for the year, there was an incentive that i held onto. But as soon as they were born i looked forward to having that glass of wine again. I recently did 60 days clean and sober, i felt like i was missing out on things for sure but i also felt the best i ever had. I felt like a better parent with more patience, more energy, better diet, great sleep and was hitting the gym hard. Then i relapsed for just one or two drinks and now that was 8 months ago. I think i have probably had a drink 80 out of the last 90 days. I need help but i don't know what to do. I don't think weekly AA meetings would work in our busy lives so i googled online communities and this was one that came up. So here is me starting Day 1 today. Feel like shit, scared I'm going to fail by the weekend.  But I feel like I really want it this time. Maybe that will make a difference.

This was primarily 95% of what we did when we all hung out. This was true even across non-intersecting groups of drinking buddies. Back then it was pretty obvious a couple of us had severe drinking problems... the wake up and start drinking and go all day and night kind. But the rest of us never thought we had a drinking problem. We knew that we overdid it fairly often but it was seen more of a good time and a testament to being a ""champ"" when it came to how much we could drink.

Over the years I have gotten in touch with some of these friends, online mostly but also in person. Something that is starting to stand out to me is how many have gone sober. A lot of the heaviest partiers from the old days are stone cold sober today (and all doing really well it seems overall in life). It's kind of made me realize yeah, I guess what we were doing wasn't normal lol. When you have to go from that to absolute zero you know it was messing things up for everyone. I used to think I was one of the only ones who quit drinking but it turns out a good number of others did too. I think I always just figured drinking would be a part of my life forever, as well as my friends, and seeing that it isnt is kind of surprising I guess. Sometimes when people are struggling with drinking they tend to think theyre the only ones in their lives with a problem, but that's probably not the case.",46

Everyone is around 30 years old and in the married/having kids phase. The level of partying has gone down as the party is sprinkled with pregnant woman, babies and toddlers running around. 

People were still drinking but the attitudes around drinking has changed. No one was chugging, shotgunning, or doing shots of alcohol like we did years prior... except for my husband. He drank an entire bottle of 30% lemonade gin throughout the night.

I watched how in sync his gradual demise into drunkenness was with the level of annoyance people had towards him. As he got drunk, the demeanor or his friends changed as he couldnt hold a conversation anymore as he was slurring and visibly wasted. After he fell down the stairs we left at 945pm. 

When we got home he complained about how his friends are jerks and they are all snobby and he felt so disrespected and is so done with their mighty attitudes. Which is exactly how I felt over the years about his friends while I was the black out drunk one. My friends were way better because we were all alcoholics so the drunker the better and they didnt judge.

Seeing it from a sober POV, I realized that his friends are not snobby they are just not alcoholics and get annoyed when people get disgustingly wasted.

In my sobriety it was a huge relief to not be asked once why I wasn't drinking and no one tried to force me into drinking. I think I may have found a new group of friends now that I am sober. This group is way more respectful to me than my alcoholic friends or former drinking buddies are. 

Crazy how things are changing! And for my husband, he had stopped drinking with me at home in October. He had no problems with it and always encouraged my sobriety as we thought I was the main problem ... turns out it's both of us. Haha who knew! He is embarrassed and doesnt want to drink at all, he really likes being in control and not drunk. Nothing but good things ahead for both of us now!",66

We had nice meals with wine and beer (I stuck to grapefruit seltzer) and discussed plans for the holidays.  My husband and I usually take the kids up to see family over Christmas, then make it back in time to party for New Years Eve, which means eating great food and drinking a LOT.  This year will be my first one sober in a long time and I was finally starting to wrap my head around it.  We found out one of our friends didn’t have plans so we invited her over.   We hardly get to see her, so we take any time we can get with her.  She’s been having a lot going on and said she will come but she wants to get drunk.  I told her vaguely that I’m not drinking, but that my husband would probably love having someone to drink with (they are both “normal” drinkers).   As soon as I said it, I started imagining what it would be like to just have some wine for one night.  Why not?  I think back on previous years and how much fun we have letting loose (forgetting the multi-day hangovers, of course) and now I’m having such a hard time convincing myself I shouldn’t do it.

However I think about alcohol ALL the time - not cravings all the time but just that I wish I could drink normally, maybe I can, is sobriety really worth it, I miss going out and having fun with my friends, I hate feeling so awkward socially, social events that used to be fun are painful and depressing now, I could just go have a beer right now no ones stopping me ect .. anyway it’s just a constant cycle in my head. This is my first time getting sober and no one asked me to go to rehab I just checked myself in (I was “functional” and good at hiding how much I was drinking) so it’s easy for me to get in my head with the “it wasn’t that bad” but deep down I know that if I went back I probably couldn’t moderate and would be in the same place again .. but the not knowing just kills me! Part of me just wants to try to drink normally, and probably fail, just to know that it doesn’t work. Of course the other part of me hearing from people from my rehab who have relapsed and people on this sub the consensus is that it’s just not worth it and will only bring regret .. these past 4 months have been the hardest thing I’ve ever done and I don’t want to lose that progress but I am sick of wondering if I would be ok if I went back.

My anxiety is at an all time high. It comes out of nowhere and my whole body gets tingly, my heart races, and I get super negative thoughts. 

Yesterday I had my first of many Christmas dinners/parties to come. On the drive there I was feeling fine, yet anxiety suddenly decided that then was the time to take over. I’m getting better at coaching myself through it but it’s still one of the worst feelings I’ve ever experienced. 

It was mostly fine once I was there. I had a non alcoholic beer. Everyone else had a drink or two. I was jealous. But I knew I’d have more than two if I even started. I felt very anti social. Early sobriety has me feeling like a lazy homebody. I literally can’t stand listening to most people’s stories. At times I feel the opposite of how people describe being ‘present’. 

Things got a bit worse for me when people began reminiscing on past holidays. “Remember that Christmas we got so drunk that _____.” “Oh remember that really boozy eggnog.” Sheesh. I like these people a lot. They’re not problem drinkers. But these stories create a weird divide in my brain. Half of me wants to laugh and participate in telling old drunken stories. The other feels guilty, like I’m supposed to metaphorically bury the old me along with even her ‘harmless’ drunk charades. 

I stepped outside for a minute and thought “huh, this is life eh? Life without any sort of filter. It will take me forever to get used to this.”

I’ve made the decision that I’m not drinking over the holidays. I was torn between that and “rewarding” myself at Christmas. (I know, I know.) But now that I’ve made that choice, I fear I’m in for a miserable few weeks of feeling out of place and distant.

Even though I don't really agree 100% with Jordan Peterson on this subject, he has some valid points and the scientific analysis seems fair. Something I found very important that if you slip and do have a drink, don't treat yourself as a failure and throw away all the progress you've made until the point to go to the old habits. Just continue not drinking. We're all trying our best and self flagellation doesn't really help. Keep strong!",4

it's okay to feel like you're wading through mud. i'm on day 9. i've had 60 in the past, i'm determined to hold on this time. but i'm tired, i'm anxious, i'm a bit depressed. i'm beating myself pretty badly about all the things i'm not doing with all this new time. i'm a freelancer and it's a quiet work time of year and i'm spending my days planning for this exciting future but i can't seem to muster the action.

and that's okay. it's okay to look after yourself and spend time in the here and now. beating yourself up about not sleeping through the night, about the anxiety being high, about not suddenly being a fabulous brand new you won't get you there any faster. just be. lean into it all and don't worry about what's next. just focus on making yourself comfortable in the moment.

for me - i'm going to take a bath and listen to christmas music with a cold glass of ginger beer. i might muster the enthusiasm to tidy my flat after that, but if all i manage to do is climb into bed and binge netflix, that's alright.

I was in denial for a long time about why I drank, and how much/often, but a few months ago I started seeing a therapist about my general anxiety issues and have come to realize just how much I’ve been using whiskey as an anxiety medicine. 

I’ve been on an SSRI for a while now to help with the anxiety, and it’s helped me get away from the near daily anxiety attacks that had become my norm. Now, it’s time to stop drinking. I don’t enjoy it, I don’t look forward to it, I only do it because I’m afraid of what will happen if I don’t drink that 9oz of bourbon every night. I’ve tried to moderate in the past and I don’t have the self control to do it. 

I’ve made a list for myself of all the reasons I want to quit drinking, and it’s really amazing how many reasons there are. I’ve talked to my wife, I’ve talked to my therapist, and today, I’m going to talk to my doctor. I’ve taken time off work, and I’ve got a plan. 

Friday is my 27th birthday. Wednesday will be my last drink. Wish me luck.",4

But I still drink a 6 pack every night, occasionally more. My health is starting to suffer as I approach 30, and I’m terrified that I’ll die young and leave my husband all alone.

What I learned from those six months is that practice makes for improvement and I have been able to sustain from drinking for 90 days in a row.  Sobriety has not led me to a pink cloud (yet!), but it has led to my best friend saying, “I’m going to stop calling you resilient and just call you what you are, hard to kill!”  A label I wear with pride. 

I am a high functioning drinker, and what I realized when I stopped drinking is that I was completely overwhelmed.  I have been pushing myself past my limit at work.  I ignored the emotional impact of multiple strained relationships for too long.  Compounded with the onset of PAWS around day 50, these realizations led me to the decision to take a 30 day FMLA leave from work to rest, recover and reconnect with myself, instead of continuing to “destress” with nightly drinking.  I have been challenged emotionally and physically exhausted over the past 90 days- that drinking shit catches up with all of us!! Here are some things that I have learned in the past 90 days:

-Never having hangovers is AMAZING!  I eat healthier and move more when I’m not hungover and as a result have lost 10 lbs, finally over the past 30 days the weight has started to fall off. 

-I used alcohol to create emotional distance between myself and others.  Without it, I’ve had to first rest, then develop new strategies to define healthier boundaries.  Some strategies I’ve used so far: being able to say no, being honest and kind together, spending more time by myself and less empty social bar time, and making my own needs a priority.

-Urges pass, depressive moods change, I’m noticing moments of joy, I have cried a lot after not having cried much for years.  Life is full of emotional variety without daily alcohol. 

-My field of work needs to change and burnout is no joke.  Sober, I can take steps to make that happen!  

-People actually don’t care that much whether I decline a drink or not.  Most of my friends and family have been supportive of my decision, though I see some friends less now who drink daily.  

-I am starting to learn what I like to do with my time: reading a lot, yoga, trail running, playing guitar, finding joy in cooking. 

I am excited that the past 90 days are behind me, most of the time they have not been easy and joy-filled, but I know they have been better than they would have been drunk.  I could not have done it without having been in weekly therapy for several years or without this community.  And I’m looking forward to more of the benefits of sobriety as they find presence in my life.  Thanks to you for showing up here and reminding me that it’s possible to not drink today.

I (34F) met this amazing man (40M) about 3 weeks ago. We hit it off really well and hung out almost every day since meeting. He is smart, funny, successful, and very cute. He really has his shit together. I have been drinking 1-2 bottles of wine per day for years. He made it clear to me a week ago that he's doesn't like how much I drink and that I get mean when I'm drunk and start fights for no reason. I said I would stop drinking.

We went to a party on Saturday at one of his friend's houses. I proceeded to drink at least a bottle of wine, possibly 2 (I really can't remember how much I drank). I blacked out and fought with him in the car on the ride home and apparently broke up with him. I have no idea why I did that because I am falling in love with him. The fight continued at his house and he eventually called the cops on me to get me to leave. I got a ride home and continued texting him and calling him, further pissing him off. He ended the relationship. I then drank 3/4 of a bottle of wine the next morning when I woke up and continued texting him. I started out begging for him to talk to me but then got angry and sent him really mean and horrible texts.

He had actually reached out to my mom on Facebook and they chatted over the phone about my addiction (which i had no idea about until later in the day). I had to pick up my car from his house at some point and waited to sober up to call for an Uber. When I got to his house he didn't want to talk me but eventually did. A little bit. He said he's been down this road before with a previous girlfriend and won't do it again. He said he hopes I get sober but never wants to talk to me again. I'm completely heartbroken because we were really great together when I was sober. We both acknowledged that. I said I would get sober for real and asked if he would still want to date if I was sober. He said no, the damage has been done and never wants to speak to me again. I've been depressed and crying since this happened because I know we would have had a great relationship had I taken real steps towards sobriety earlier. I have been researching treatment centers and counselors in my area and will be setting up appointments today once they open. I guess I'm just looking for a little supports here, and hoping that I can eventually win him back by showing I'm serious about getting sober and taking the proper steps. Thanks for reading.",7

So, I have been struggling with alcoholism or over 5 years now. I became addicted in 2015. I would easily consume 20-25 beers in a week. Then i realized i should stop and worked all the possible strategies I could think of to get the number down to 18 beers a week in 2016. Nothing changed in 2017 and I stayed at 18-20 units a week. 2018 was more success, got down to 15 a week. 2019 has been the best so far, got it down to 10 units a week. 

But here is the deal. Even though on a long term basis, I seem to be making progress, I feel guilty every time I give in. I have been trying to get the number down to 6 beers a week for over 6 months but I just can't seem to get past 2 days sober. And once I give in (usually on Wednesday after not drinking for two days), I end up with 9-10 beers that week. The whole next week I feel guilty and ashamed and alone. Why does it feel this way even though I have made such progress. I dont have hang overs any more. I dont drink more than two beers a might anymore and I never black out. why the guilt still?

The progress from 25 beers per week to 15 was quicker. but getting it down to 6 beers a week from 10 seems sooooooooooooo hard. How is that? Any suggestions?

I want to get to a stage where I can stop at 6 units a week (drinking 3 days a week, 2 beers per day). Then I can begin to cut back even further. 

Thank you",2

I'm not drinking today. I did so well, best I have ever done actually and i feel like I messed it all up. My mind feels the same anxious depressed wreck I was 4 months ago! 

Is it safe for me to stop today cold Turkey? I have had slight hand tremors the last couple mornings .. 

I have valium for a back injury that I was thinking about using for the first day..I only have a couple with no means to buy more so I don't worry about getting addicted to them!  just to stop the panic/ anxiety for the first horrible sweaty night!

I'm sure I wasn't physically dependent but I've got enough toe curling black out stories etc to know I have a problem and have to stop. I'm 42. 
Trouble is, I don't feel in the slightest bit proud about stopping. What I feel is:
1. Huge fear (that I'll cave in to temptation) 2 Anger (at myself for not being able to moderate - I mean I could moderate mostly but every 4th or 5th time I would absolutely lose all control, sense of reason and become a person I don't recognise) I'm also  angry that I've wasted so much time, lost out. Upset people. I'm angry that I haven't found ways to cope with life other than a substance which in actual fact makes everything worse. How could I be so stupid (repeatedly) 
3. Regret. For my behaviour and for all the time wasted. Time I can't get back. I long to be the happy go lucky younger me.Confident etc. These days I'm frightened of my own shadow and I find even a little stress overwhelming. 
I realise these feelings I have aren't all down to booze but i feel alcohol has played a part and has cheated me. I guess I feel bitter about that.

I think back to those last few years and how desperate it got. The years of homelessness; the feelings of worthlessness; the regret and pain I had caused. Wishing and praying that the fault was not mine, that I could get along in this world like other people, if only... 

I knew my drinking was ""a"" problem but I really didn't think it was ""the"" problem. I knew drinking didn't make it better but I knew I was the main problem.  Drinking was how I medicated the problem. Honestly,  the only reason sobriety ever entered my mind was so I could save enough money to get off the streets, so that when I killed myself, my mom wouldn't have to tell people her eldest son died, homeless. But the longer I stayed sober,  the better life got. 

It wasn't always easy, once I stopped drinking. I had to do a lot of work on myself and learn life skills I had put off for to long. I ended up going to jail for 8 months. Learning how to date without drinking was mostly humiliating at first. But learning to take responsibility for my own actions was the hardest thing I had to do, at work,  with family, and even with strangers. And now I'm laying here,  next to my wife of 10 years (in 10 years we've literally only ever had 2 arguments), in the house that we bought,  with my dog snoring next to the bed. Twenty years ago, all I wanted was to save up enough money to get off the streets,  and enough rope to hang myself. Come to think of it,  it seems unreal. I can't believe I've come this far.",202

I really don’t like AA, but it’s kind of all I have and I don’t want to die so I just deal with it. I connected with this lady who is my sponsor and I talk to her every day. One of the biggest reasons for my drinking is that I moved states to help take care of my terminally ill mother and watching her die caused a lot of trauma. 

She was my best friend. Years ago she gave me this little heart necklace that matched one she would wear, like mother daughter necklaces. And I never took it off, until one day I was on the beach and of course was drunk. In my drunk mind I thought I should take it off to protect it from sunscreen. 

I lost it that day and I subjected my poor friends to a giant freak out and we spent the entire day trying to find it, including returning that night and begging security to let us check just one more time. I mean dude, it’s a beach. It’s sand. How drunk and stupid can you be?

Today my sponsor handed me a gift bag full of things and I gave her a half-hearted thank you because I hate the holidays. For some reason I just looked through it and inside was some stuff she baked, random lotion, and a cute jean purse. I opened the purse and inside that was a necklace, almost identical to the one my mom gave me that I lost on the beach. She had no way of knowing that as I never told her.

I cried like an idiot. Still crying. I have nobody to share that with right this second and I’m overwhelmed so here it is.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

""What do you like to do?"" ""What are you into?""  
  
These are questions that I have hated for many years. Why?  Because I didn't really have a good, honest answer.  
  
""I like to go home and get shit faced, while staring at my phone all night, or watching repeats of Grey's Anatomy""

So, while I haven't made any ""big discoveries"" in the last 50 days, I can definitely say I'm enjoying doing some stuff!!! I'm reading books, I'm listening to music WITH INTENT (not just as background noise)... I'm getting out and going places.

I am 27 and have been drinking entirely way too much since I was 17. Every day since I was 17. I always justified it by saying I go to work or do the things I need to before I get drunk. Well, a few months back , I broke up with the girl I had been dating for my whole adult life and I started drinking beer from the moment I woke up until I was so tired I couldn't stay awake anymore. Usually about 15 beers throughout the day. So, I wasn't getting hammered or anything but maintained a buzz. Last Sunday, I said fuck it. I was going to quit. Well, by noon on Monday I was shaking and freaking out and the most uncomfortable I have ever been. I realized that is dangerous and tapered my way down to three beers a day over the past week. As in, one around noon, another around 6, and then another before bed, around 11. I can go pretty much as long as I want now without a beer but still have been having them occasionally throughout the day. Not because I feel sick or unbearable anxiety, just because I can. The anxiety is almost gone and there isn't anything physical anymore. 

It is finally time for me to commit 100%. I have put a lot of hard work in to tapering this past week and I'm excited (and scared) to hop on this journey with yall.

Really, the only thing I'm still feeling is anxiety and it has gone down a lot, so I think I can tough this out. Let's go!",13

Earlier in the day, I decided to treat myself… and picked up a bottle of dealcoholized wine, the first time I have done so since I quit. It was a nice little treat, and I enjoyed it. 

Before we went to the venue, we went for dinner where I did not drink. Did that bother me? No. While at the concert, did watching people walking around with their glasses of wine and flutes of champagne bother me? Not a bit.

Seeing the empty wine bottle from the dealcoholized wine that I had purchased. that triggered me a little. Nothing came of it… But seeing that empty bottle made me think about it.

Mainly, my feelings on my past failed romantic relationships/relationship endeavors.

I hate admitting that I've been hurt. 
That I've been rejected. 
That I've been ghosted. 
That I've been led on

It really hurts my self-esteem and pride. The last time I was in a serious relationship was two years ago, which ended badly. 

I think I've subconsciously internalize the fact that no one wants to seriously date or love me. So I sought drinking and partying to compensate. I'm also an avid user of tinder and bumble and while I never failed to find matches and dates, they usually end up as just meaningless flings/hookups. In a messed up way, alcohol was always there to comfort me. 

I know I'm still young (24f) so I always gave an excuse that I'm not looking for any serious relationship. But the truth is, I've been hurt and rejected so many times. 

Sorry for this content heavy post. I've been feeling so emotional and vulnerable lately.

He used to go to AA, and then in the same building, he'd go to a free cooking class afterward. Eventually he turned cooking into a coping skill and he was insanely good at it.

I remembered that a week ago when I decided to stop drinking for what feels like the millionth time, although to be fair I'd never made it past a week or committed in the past.

Either way I can see why it helped him. I've lived on my own for 3 years but I've never really been into cooking. But last week I made a few simple things in my slow cooker: teriyaki meatballs with pineapples and then BBQ pulled chicken. I can see myself taking to this, it's very relaxing to prepare food and follow a recipe and it's ODDLY relaxing cleaning up afterward and putting the leftovers away knowing I won't have to worry about food for a few days.

I'm debating what to make next week since tomorrow will be my 5th and last day of BBQ chicken. I feel like I'm cheating with how much money I'm saving. I'm not buying booze OR eating out. And on top of that I'm beginning to feel healthier without all the booze and crappy food. 

Here's a bonus: I've been buying glass bottles of cane sugar sodas and keeping them in a mini fridge. I'll have ONE with my meal. Not healthy by any means but I'm far better off with one of those than my usual malt liquor or mixed drinks or even worse, shots of hard liquor.

I've been working like crazy to help with the urges; which seems to be working. I've also been picking up old hobbies like reading, and going to the gym, so I already feel mentally and physical better.

One thing I've had to realise since getting sober is that my A.D.D that I thought dwindle as a grew up is actually still in full swing. Apparently being in a haze of alcohol or being hungover all the time just means I wasnt able to run at 100%. Little surprise there. It does mean I'm having to adapt to trying to stay on point and remember what I'm doing from one minute to the next. Kind of makes me feel like I'm losing my mind to tell you the truth.

One thing at a time though. For now I'm just happy to be at the end of day 13, and looking forward for tomorrow.

I'm 42. I've been drinking almost everyday since I was 23. Went to a lot of bars/clubs/live shows and saw/experienced a lot of things. By the time I was 30, it was about 7 or 8 drinks, 5 days out of 7. Began drinking mostly alone and shut out all the life experiences I could have had.. When I hit 40, I was 10 to 12 drinks, 6 out of 7 sometimes more. I've ruined an amazing long term relationship with the best women ever. Not because I was a shitty BF, but because, in the end, I chose alcohol and being alone. 

What we often don't realize is how ingrained booze becomes. It becomes second nature. It's like stopping at the store on the way home for milk. No big deal. For a while I was going to different liquor stores, made a rotation, to avoid looking like a reoccurring beast. But after a while I didn't care. 

How many mornings could I possibly stand in front of the mirror hating myself. How many mornings would I wonder if I should even be driving to work?  For a long time I always said to myself I must quit but kept drinking because one more time.

I finally had enough thinking about it. I did 4 days. I went out with a co-worker to a bar and drank diet coke. This was huge to me. Never been to a bar and not drank booze. I felt great.

Fifth day. Feeling like shit. Wondering why I didn't feel better. Same with 6 and 7. Kept going. 

10 days. Started feeling way more confident out in public. Sleeping is becoming amazing. 

15 days. Apparently I can go to bed and just decide to sleep. Who knew

17 days. I no longer feel like I have something to hide when I am out. Before, I guess I always felt like everyone every where knew I was a fucking looser alcoholic bum but with a tiny bit of dignity. 

Day 20. I now understand that it will take vast amounts of time to be comfortable. What I mean is, so many things in life are completely fucking idiotic and mundane. But anything mundane is better with a six pack. I must learn..

Day 25. Not the first day I've really wanted to buy a six pack and a mickey and listen to tunes and fuck it all. I've become proud. I think to myself ""I just need to see what its like one more time.."" 

Well I did it. I drank. I was expecting that after 3 beers I would be buzzed as shit because I didn't drink for 25 days. But no. The tolerance was still alive. 8 tall cans and 3 Jack and coke. I went to bed. I woke up with a hangover and went to work. After work I felt the most depressed I've felt in a long time. I felt like I was locked in a cave somewhere with every demon Ive had ever.

I'm back to not drinking. But that one relapse showed me this...

Non drinking me would have:

\- gone with that girl to Thailand when I was 24

\- took that 2 month trip to Italy

\- got to know my Dad more before he died

\- been more comfortable financially

\- been more successful in life with my artist side

\- been thinner and less aged looking

\- had closer friends

\- continued a fantastic relationship with an amazing girl

\- not wasted an entire DECADE of his life

\- been more comfortable in his head

\- had way more confidence

That brief time I had sober, not the 10th day, but at least the 20th day, showed me what I could have done with my life without alcohol. It sucks but luckily I'm not dead yet. I tend to dwell on the past lost, but not as much while sober..

So here I am. Back at day one. 

tl;dr  Don't ever start a drinking habit. You are much better off sober.",28

I have started a new account because I lost my old account from when I was really active on this forum about 5 years ago.

I hit my lowest low in the holiday season of 2014. The holiday season is hard for everyone, especially people with substance abuse and mental health issues.

We all drink for our own reasons. I drank because I hated who I was, I hated myself, I hated my life. Alcohol helped me escape, disassociate from myself so I didn't have to deal with, what I know now as, my mental health issues.

When I made the choice to stop drinking, it was only the first step. I had a lot more issues to deal with that I didn't have the tools for. Luckily, I was accepted into an out-patient addiction program offered by the provincial government where I live in Canada. There I was taught tools similar to what is taught in the SMART program.

With the help of the tools and medication I was able to feel, what I imagine people without mental health issues consider, normal.

But one thing I have learned over the years is that my mental health issues need constant vigilance to keep under control. It is so easy to fall back into those though patterns that only lead to a downward spiral. 

All in all I have managed to stay off alcohol, despite all of my thought pattern relapses. I ain't gonna lie, society doesn't make it easy.

My life is so amazing now that I could have never imagined back when I was at my lowest.   
If I can make it this far, then I know you can too.

&#x200B;

I want to share 5 things that have kept me going over the past almost 5 years.

1. I have the power to be the best possible version of myself. If I am feeling down and I don't like something about myself, I can identify the values of the type of person I want to be and I can work towards applying them to my life every day. Little by little I can take steps to be the best possible version of me that I want to be.
2. I can accomplish anything that I want to. Anything that I want, I can make happen. Of course, it won't always happen on the first try, and it may not work out the way I planned. I can make a goal and work to achieve it if I want to, even if someone says I can't. The only thing stopping me is me.
3. Never compare myself to others. Everyone has their own story, their own path. 
4. I am in control of how I react. I cannot control a lot of things, but I am in absolute control of how I react to things.
5. Be grateful. Have an attitude of gratitude. For every regretful, resentful, envious thought that may creep into my day, there is a much more beneficial alternative. There is always something to be grateful for and even focusing on the most minute detail of gratitude makes me feel way better than a ton of shame.

Bob S’s Holiday sobriety tips

1.	Go late, leave early.  If a party runs from 7 to 11, plan on arriving at 8 and leaving at 10.   This is opposite of the active alcoholic, who arrives at 6 and leaves at, well, they are the last to leave.  Use that extra hour beforehand to go to a meeting.

2.	Check your motive for going.  Is it that important?  Do not go if it is to demonstrate or prove your sobriety to another.  To quote Len Grossman,  “alcohol with Fuck You Up!”  This is a good time to run your motive past your sponsor.

3.	Always have a non-alcoholic drink in your hand.   I prefer ginger ale, as it looks like a mixed drink.  Being empty handed makes others uncomfortable, and we wouldn’t want that.

4.	If someone offers you a drink at the beginning of the event, respond with “maybe later.”

5.	If someone offers you a drink near the end of the event, respond with “I’ve had enough.”

6.	If they persist, say that you are allergic or on medication.  It is usually best to walk away before telling them it is “none of their fucking business.”

7.	The only appropriate 12th step work at a social event is for us to remain “quietly” sober as an example.  Confrontation is not an option.

8.	Sobriety is never to be argued or discussed at a social event.  They are 10 times more likely to talk you into a drink than you are to talk them out of one.

9.	Social events are not the time for 9th step work.

10.	Always take your own transportation and plan an escape route ahead of time.

11.	Always go on a half-full stomach.  Craving in one area leads to craving in another.

12.	Do the HALT* test.   If the time isn’t right, the time isn’t right.

13.	No one notices, no one remembers, no one cares.   No one will notice that I’m not drinking, no one will remember that I’m not drinking, no one will care that I ‘m not drinking.

14.	Better to not drink and let them think you are an alcoholic than to drink and remove all doubt.

15.	Never spend the holidays alone.  Solitude is the worst enemy around the holidays.  There are marathon meetings for a reason.

16.	Make a list of every annoying comment that you expect your relatives/friends/co-workers to say.  When they say them, make a check on your list, and turn the evening into an accomplishment.

17.	The holidays are not a good time for major changes if they can be postponed till after.

18.	If you feel uncomfortable, quietly excuse yourself from the event.  Holiday social events are like gunfights, the only prize is the right to walk away.  They are minefields to be treaded carefully.    Have fun.   ;-)

2019-12-08 18:12:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e8166z/my_personal_advent_calendar/,My personal advent calendar,"2019 has been a year of self improvement for me. I stopped diet culture, I went abroad, I did a lot of good things. One thing that always stayed with me though was that nagging thought of ""Am I drinking too much?"" 

I am not even 25 and I can't remember the last time where a month had passed and I didn't have a drink. I started with 16 and since then, I had a drink almost each weekend. 

When I talked about this with my partner we agreed on the first of january. A great new years resolution right? Just until march, just until st. paddy's . He agreed to join me on that. I have to say, we met while having a drink, we celebrate beer and whiskey, we want to know the culture, want to know the combinations. I never drank every day but... my consumption has definitely gone up. A glas of wine here, a weekend of drinking there... even if it was just one drink I struggle to really control my body. 

&#x200B;

Yet, it always nagged on me. ""am I drinking too much?"" a question I shouldn't ask myself at 22. Because maybe I am. Maybe I don't even enjoy drinking. I never had a hangover but just by the description of it, I never want one. What about moderation?  Why moderate? I go to the gym 3x the week and each time I drink, it destroys my improvement. When I went to him about my idea to stop he... supported me in all means necessary. He gladly accepted, he even drinks alcohol free beer just so I feel better, even though I don't even mind him drinking. He offered me a sip of his drinks to try twice, but I politely refused and he accepted. 

&#x200B;

I have been in this subreddit for far too long, have played with this thought too many times. ""I want to stop. Why is it so hard to stop?"" I've come to the realisation that I don't even want to drink. So I stopped at December 1st. It has been hard so far, as we go to a lot of christmas markets but today, at day 8, it has been really easy not to drink. I feel great, had good food and went to the gym in the evening because I just wanted to. No inner pressure, just because it gave me time to think. I want to get through christmas and new years without drinking.

&#x200B;

SO. So far I'm at day 8. I think, if it continues to be this easy I just... will keep on going. Wish me luck, I hope this community might help me. I struggle with anxiety, body issues and other pressure but for once I think it might be the better decision for me and my body to just enjoy other beverages. It's been a blast so far. I think, as a person who wants to be a Mom someday and a person who wants to stay focussed, this might just be the right decision. 

&#x200B;

IWNDWYT . Love to all my fellow christmas strugglers.

The PinkCloud app is a meeting finder for wherever you are sorted by day, time, and distance. Simply put you allow it to use your location, or manually put in a location, and it will find nearly every AA or NA meeting near you based on your personal settings. 

It also has other little features like tracking goals, a filter that shows contacts that are supportive of your recovery, and more. 

It has a 30 day free trial, not really sure what it costs after that but for me it’ll be well worth it. Like I said, if you end up in a new area, especially during the holidays, it’s a fantastic resource if you need to get away and go hit a meeting.",3

I had said, “When I’m at a holiday party and I feel uncomfortable or like I am missing out, I will remember that no one is paying attention to my drinking, most of my friends drink less than I do, and I am enjoying the company of others.”

The dinner reservation was for 7:00pm. I had a good workout that morning and ate scaresly throughout the day. I like to be on time, so I got ready and arrived to the restaurant 10 minutes early. My boyfriend was a bit surprised that I wasn’t making an exception tonight, but I felt fine. That’s when I found out that the reservation wasn’t until 8:00. The plan was that everyone was arriving at 7:00 to have drinks at the bar. And my brain totally panicked. I was hungry. It was standing room only at the bar in my tall high heels. I was trying not to reach for my phone or my vape, and that hour seemed like it was going to go on forever!

In the end, the bartender made me a very elaborate crushed fruit lemonade. It was totally delicious. The discomfort passed, and I was laughing with my friends in no time. Just wanted to share that even if you plan for things you can’t control everything. I kept a cool head and had a great time.",2

Certainly somebody in this community can offer me some insight. I like drinking. I like drinking so much that I don't want to stop. I have been drinking at least 3 drinks per day since 2011, I have been drunk almost every weekend, and for periods of time my sleep has been dependent on being buzzed when I lay down. There have been periods when I have not touched the stuff for a week or two, but I always conclude that I am a grown man and I can make my own decisions. I experienced some trauma in 2011 that is an ongoing source of emotional pain. It is something that I often tell myself I cannot live with. I have experienced at least 3 major bouts of depression related to this situation over the past 8 years. Drinking mostly helps me forget it, but every once in a while it will magnify it.

I was deployed for a brief 4 months at the beginning of this year and while I was there I was able to commit to no  Caffeine, no Nicotine, limited Sugar, and no Alcohol. I did pretty good at my personal challenge, but I wasn't putting a lot of pressure on myself. I only drank over there a hand-full of times, but it was always to get drunk (There are ways to do it if you know how). It wasn't a big deal. This ability to reduce my drinking gave me the sense that I was in control of the juice.

When I came home, I picked up drinking in earnest again. Hard liquor to get drunk daily. I never say things I don't mean, I never do irresponsible things, I never wake up unable to go to work, and I always pay my bills. I am a delightful drunk person. My favorite thing to do is get toasted by myself and watch documentaries or Star Wars (I'm a purist so Original Trilogy mostly). It is hard for me or others around me to say I have a problem, and I still don't necessarily think I do. Still, I decided to cut back in September. I have only been drinking on Fridays and Saturdays since then.

3 weekends ago, I discovered a problem. I started getting totally hammered on whiskey to make up for all the days I wasn't drinking. I remember that I was drinking in my apt by myself because my girlfriend was out of town, and I was making a mess in the kitchen taking care of some projects. I was being a sad drunk by myself. When I woke up the next morning, there was a mess in the kitchen and the depression came back. I didn't know how I was going to muster the motivation or the physical strength to do the dishes, and I only had 2 days to do them before my girlfriend came home. It was an indescribably insurmountable situation, but I fucking did it. 

The next weekend, my girlfriend was home and we had my 2 kids from my second marriage. GF had homework to do, I was hungover and depressed, but I had to get the kids out of the house so she could do her paper. So there I am sitting at the park on a bench going over all the reasons why I hate myself. Hours later we went back home, bedtime happened, and then I started drinking again. Eventually I broke down. I went into this crying fit about everything that bothers me to my GF. She has heard this before maybe 3 times, but it is only ever when I'm drunk. It is always really bad and I never remember it the next morning. I have learned from this last time that there's some deep seated shit I'm not dealing with.

When I'm sober, I am a forgiveness expert. I can think through the trauma with great precision. I can justify the actions of others and take responsibility for myself. But after the experiences I've had through the month of November, I am beginning to think that my sober coping mechanisms are just a smothering blanket used to hide the truth. When I am drunk, it hits me very hard sometimes that I hate myself, I do not forgive the people that have committed wrong against me or my children, I do not forgive myself for the pain that I've caused others, and I am a loser with no hope of winning. The past present and future is becoming so unbearable and so loud, that it now permeates into my sobriety and it is making it difficult for me to sleep.

My request from anybody from this community is this: Can somebody please help me understand what it is that a sober person does in order to live with the trauma of the past?

TLDR: I can neither live with myself nor can I talk to anybody about it without alcohol. I believe I need new short term coping mechanisms for past trauma and I need to learn what the nature of my depression is. I don't want to stop drinking, but I WANT to Want to stop drinking.",12

2019-12-08 11:36:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e7vtcw/i_made_it_through_one_of_the_most_stressful/,I made it through one of the most stressful nights (probably) of the year.,"My wife quit drinking about 2 years ago now. What she has accomplished since then is astonishing. Among other things, she has started a non profit foundation which has been really taking off in the last 6 months.  Last night was her first major fundraising event in which they raised a lot of money to help her cause. I'm extremely proud of her, and if she was on Reddit I would tell her to post her story here because she's been an inspiration to me. 

I helped her out with the event. I have a background in the food preparation industry. There were over 300 guests so the night was pretty stressful. lots of things popped up throughout the evening. Card machines going down. Running out of items at the buffet, guests needing to be cut off etc......it was stressful, but I handled it calmly, and decisively. I was able to be there for my amazing wife when she needed me. 

Normally I would have been piled before the event even started. Shuffling around the dance floor, and the bar. My wife would still have need of me, but she would have ended up looking elsewhere for help, or been disappointed with the result. 

By the end of the night people I normally would have been partying with were left. Friends and in-laws. Unrecognizable by this point. Getting in the way instead of helping with cleanup. I looked at them with pity instead of jealousy. Giving them all rides back home while they hiccup and try not to puke in my car. Something has definitely changed with my relationship to alcohol. 

Sorry for the long post, but this one felt special to me. This event really felt like one that mattered because there is no way I would have considered doing it sober in the past. Thanks for reading. IWNDWYT.",33

I honestly don’t know him any other way, but as a drinker. Some days he would be buzzed, other days flat out wasted. Either way, I never knew him to not drink. 

He had some health issues which made him stop drinking for about a month or so. After that, he was right back at it. Recently, the issues got so bad, he gave it up for good. Of course, I figured this was another temporary moment for him, he would be right back at it in about a month or so. 

Three months later - he hasn’t had a drop of booze. 

Alcohol with the family was always associated with good times. That’s just what I know. The family is prone to issues with alcohol abuse. 

His brother, his father, and I believe a few others gave up drinking, or had every organ essentially shut down because of it. 

I remember my first “blackout”. It was with family. I don’t remember walking home. It was about 15 years ago, and unfortunately, didn’t stop me. 

Fast forward to now, where essentially every drinking episode includes blackouts. Pieces missing. Uncertainty. 

What happened?  Why can’t I handle drinking anymore?  Is this my body telling me enough is enough?  

A very good friend hit his rock bottom with drinking one night, and it turned his life around. He got a DUI and decided enough was enough. He focused his life on exercise and healthy eating. Now, the only time he allows himself to have a few drinks is when he goes on vacation once a year. That’s it. Then, he doesn’t drink again until the next vacation. He doesn’t miss it. 

My father has become a connoisseur with sparkling water. He has lost weight, started reading again, and has discarded old acquaintances that don’t serve him anymore. He doesn’t miss it. 

Then there’s me. Acted like a complete idiot the other night, don’t remember half the night, regret even going out. Put myself in stupid situations. Wasted a whole day hungover. Still dealing with anxiety and remorse, and just waiting to hear the rumours and discussion about what may have happened. 

I am done with this shit. I wish I would have stuck to my original plan of being done with it the handful of times before. Then, this wouldn’t have happened. Nope. I wouldn’t have had this lingering thought of doom. The embarrassment. The shame. The guilt. The anxiety. The possibility of being talked about. 

I wish I would have stayed sober that night. Because like those who were drinkers before me, I didn’t miss it.

I don't have health insurance, I don't have access to any support and I'm not going to AA simply because I've gone to rehab 3 times and then meetings followed, I tried the fellowship, I tried to open up, I worked steps, it's low key a high school club where the most popular get the help and anyone ""different"" gets tossed aside. 

I'm tired of being alone and drinking myself numb every night. I'm tired of being treated like I'm a ghost. I'm an army vet with mental health issues a fucked up childhood and drinking seems to be the only way I can quiet it all until..it doesn't work anymore.

And, let’s be real - because the days are short, the nights are long, temps frequent the sub zeros, and my skin is getting pastier by the moment. During one of my recent visits I came up with a tradition I would like to start - I was laying there thinking what would older me tell myself right now.

The whole thought was inspired, ironically enough, by UV radiation. So item 1 that older me would address is sun protection. I love me a good tan, but I don’t want to look like wrinkled leather when I hit 50 so I recommend I start wearing sunscreen esp on my face. (not to mention I guess I would prefer to avoid skin cancer…. harumph)

Item 2… stay sober. I have spent about half of the past year sober and half of it drinking. Everytime I pick the habit back up - with the conception that I can keep it under control - only drink at normal times, a ""normal"" amount, socially acceptable behavior. But the tendrils of addition reach out and take hold in an insidious but constant way, and before I know it the idea of normal drinking habits is out the window and I’m constantly seeking a fix.

The drinking and drunk dreams are pretty crazy. The I broke my goals of sobriety so fuck it dreams. They were frequent, especially in the first couple of weeks. My goal this time was to make it 28 days (thanks nurse Jackie)... because if I could make it 28 days sober then I could decide if my life was in a better place at that point. I’m at 45 days and I have been spending time with my hobbies, with my family, saved a ton of money, not missed any work…. the list goes on. My mood is stable, my partner comments on how nice I am. My life is better.

The contrast is waking up almost every morning at 2-3 am with a heavy weight on my chest - trying to push down the anxiety - who knows? Did I say something I shouldn’t have? Do you think they could smell the booze? What conversations do I need to try to catalogue? How am I alive? The especially bad mornings - the strange.. Difficult to explain feeling - 1st time - in Mexico, 2nd time - at the wedding … I found myself googling - “alcohol withdrawals feeling like my body stops breathing if I fall sleep”, “waking up out of breath and alarmed + alcohol withdrawals” “Diaphragms feels like constantly need to yawn + alcohol withdrawals”. None of those searches left me feeling like other people had experience and written about that feelings… what a strange feeling..  . Yeah… my life is better. I'm not trying to google why my body feels like I can't/won't breath unless I force myself to consciously do so.",3

I think (fingers crossed) that as Ben Fold's says, ""I have landed"".

I have landed in my body again. At least for this moment. I wanted to celebrate with you.

With the help of the drinks above, I have not missed drinking. 

 I have had a few sips (if you add them up they equal less than one drink) since stopping. The sips reminded me that the drinks were unsatisfying. No more sips for me. I am free from wanting the taste.

But the desire / need to feel the relief /release of having drinks remains. Sometimes I try to trick myself into getting a buzz from the Hop lark or Hop20. Or I push it at the gym. 

The biggest joy of sobriety for me is me landing in my body, reintegrating, reinhabiting. Some-body is home again.

The harder part is learning to live without the protective barrier that being either impaird or hungover provided. I will find strength one day at a time and five this my best effort.

I’m in my early twenties, I have a job in Engineering which gives me the opportunity to travel, I’m in good physical shape, being that my main hobby is Bodybuilding and I hope to one day compete in Amateurs. The problem I face is my routine binge drinking which is holding me back and I can’t get a hold of. Being from the UK and a Gen Z’er, my culture is entwined with binge drinking and the getting F’d up attitude. I’m caught in a loop where I tell myself that I’ll have “just the few” which quickly turns into 10 drinks. As soon as I touch alcohol, that’s it, the cycle has started where I forget all the negative consequences of my drinking, all the reasons why I have told myself, drinking has no positive effects for me and how detrimental it is to my physical or mental health. The only way I can describe is that the Hyde to my Jekyll comes out. What happens when I drink? I lose control. In the past six months alone, I’ve had numerous fall outs, resulting in a break down of a relationship, I have lost a phone and a £150 jacket, been assaulted by a group of thugs, and probably a whole host of other things that I can’t remember (or I’ve subconsciously blocked out). After drinking, my motivation drops and I have crippling depression & anxiety for days. Towards the end of the week though, as I begin to pick up and mentally return to stability, I tell myself that I’ll just have the few on Saturday night and have a good night out, but it always ends bad. The cycle repeats. 

Ultimately, nobody seems to understand. I get told “just stop drinking” or “just stick to drinking a few”. I wish it was that easy. I even went to see a private Hypnotherapist, who although he could see how distressing it was for me, didn’t really seem to grasp how much it was affecting me. What made worse was that my partner at the time didn’t understand and was one of those who thought “You just need to grow up and handle myself. Man up”.

I feel like I’m in a rut. The temptation just seem too hard for me to handle, and that I deceive myself to thinking next time it’ll be different. And being a well disciplined person, I feel ashamed.

I’m interested in reaching out to others who may have the same problem I do. I’m looking for coping strategies to get this under control.

Cut to right before my trip and every thing is great! I lost like 2 dress sizes, felt amazing at work and accomplished, my home life was amazing. I had become a better person and a better friend.

So why not just have a few in Europe? I had never been and I wasn’t sure if I would ever be back.

It seemed like everything was going to plan. I was only allowing myself a few drinks, never enough to get drunk. If I started to feel I was on the way, I would straight up just give away my drinks. It was the perfect plan and it was working, until it wasn’t. 

I started wanting it again. I started wondering if it wasn’t to early to stop at a Parisian cafe and have just one drink. We went out with Germans and I drank too many beers, but so did everyone else, and when the Germans offered me a “wegbier” I flat out said “no.”

That was the first week. The next week I did not practice the same control. Visiting with a friend in Prague I drank 8 beers in one night. Woke up feeling the worst I’ve felt in 5 months. Staying at a friend’s in Germany we regularly got drunk on cheap wine (my drug of choice). It hit me, to my friends this was a fun break from their normal lives, and I was slipping back into my addiction right under their noses. 

Yesterday, on the plane I knew I had two choices: I could take the free wine and hope that my brain wouldn’t convince me that “this time was different” or I could turn it down and think of Europe as an isolated experiment that didn’t work. I had some coca-cola. 

So, I’m back home, in the states, and I’m on day 2. I’m hopeful and to be honest, drinking wasn’t even that great.

It was his birthday Friday and friends threw a big party for him.   The party was at a house of a kid he is buddys with but we don't know the parents.

My husband has all but quit drinking in support of me so we were both stone sober when he texted for a ride- yep, honey on the way.  He asked would we be able to give another boy a ride home as he didn't have one (YOU BET).  Then says ""Josh's Dad wants to come out and meet you guys"" (the host's father).

I was crying for a full hour because I was going to go to my fiancé’s parents’ place and they love to drink. I made it through without drinking, and leaving earlier than usual to go to my parents’ place, and had a really nice time. 

Me and my sister go to the nutcracker every year. We have champagne at the show and margaritas and wine before. Last night, we followed all of our traditions but I had cranberry sodas and a mocktail. Had an excellent time. 

Decorating my friend’s tree used to involve me bringing at least two bottles of wine. Did it on Friday with some soda and grape juice. Had some excellent conversations and drove home instead of taking a $30 cab. 

I think I can do this. The anticipation of doing something sober for the first time is often so much worse than the actual experience. Sometimes the experience is just okay and sometimes, like the traditional events that I took part in recently, they’re so much better. 

We can do this. IWNDWYT.",13

He was shocked, he did not know I stopped drinking!  

I did not tell anyone I stopped drinking.

- It started saying no, I can't drink because I came by car.

- People in Germany respect the car, so they never pushed me to drink and I never went anywhere without my car.  (**and I did not keep ANY alcohol at home**)

- After a few months, I told a few people who do not live in my city about 3 months, or 6 months. They were surprised I was counting, and they did not care too much to be honest.

- I did not tell anyone I meet that I SD because I did not want the pressure and the failing and saying to their face that I fail. I thought that if I fail, it would be better to at least not embarrass myself in front of anyone.

I asked him not to tell anyone. I want to post in my FB ""today is X months/years without a drink"" and again, **I am terrified of embarrassing myself** with a relapse, by claiming victory too early (so I do not post to FB that I have been dry for so long... not today, maybe tomorrow I will, but not today, lol).

But I was confident enough after 666 days that it was just a slip of the tongue, I was not showing off, I was not asking for his support, I was just sharing my milestone.

Not my brother not anyone will ever give me a cookie for not drinking. They do not have to, **it is not their job to cheer me up.**

This has been a very lonely journey for me, except for all you **Sobernauts**  (bring this back!! we all are **Sobernauts**). This sub was all the company I needed.

1) I write this because some of us have little to no support in real life around us, and I want to share that it is possible, we can do this sometimes without family or friends.

I feel much better, I am on 1 year and 10 months now. This is not a showing off, I am TERRIFIED of a relapse, it will just not happen today.

And 

2) when did we stopped calling ourselves Sobernauts?  After some time I did not come here every day, but back a couple of years ago, we were calling ourselves SOBERNAUTS and I loved it!  Anyway, its just a suggetion.

I was happy to read in the right column ""+300 SOBERNAUTS"" are her now... now it only says readers or users, not very inspiring  :P

I was adored by my aunt (since my birth was so welcomed after my parents had a tough time conceiving). I was the golden boy. At the reception, my uncle spiked my water with a few splashes of wine, heretofore known as ""super-water"".  Whether I got buzzed or not, the fact that my older cousins all enjoyed my antics, my brain was quickly coerced into equating drinking with happiness and social acceptance. At. Age. Four. 

At age 12, my older (adopted) brother and a friend were making a short movie for a HS class project. They pitted me against my sister in a cross-country race. My secret weapon? A six pack of Bud cans. Glorified as a magical elixir again, I easily won the race, my sails backed by the winds of alcohol. 

That was 1979. 

My brother worked (conveniently) at a liquor store while i was in HS in the go-go 80s, so getting access to taps and kegs was super easy. It helped my social status, as all the cool kids wanted to be friends as I would always get the beer.

Additional anecdotes aren't really necessary, most of you have similar instances in your lives, and I could go on and on, but I won't.

A handle of Sapphire Gin per week morphed into a handle of Wild Turkey a few decades later and by the early part of this decade, it was obvious to all. The only person whose pain I could ever say affected me was when my then 9 year old (NINE YEAR OLD!!!!) daughter begged me to stop, right here in our kitchen. I couldn't. 

I still have other demons to confront, but today is definitely a day to reflect and find strength in my success. I am a better person. My wife has also made incredible strides, and while not a 100% teetotaler, the weekly handles of Tito's are a long distant memory as she will only drink lightly, socially, and rarely in the house. 

In a few hours, that now 17 year old daughter will awaken, and at some point today I hope to share the aforementioned story from years back. She knows already though.

Thank you SD, from SD. 

(side note: my older brother died tragically in the late 80s, a drowning accident. While the official cause of death was from the drowning, I am absolutely convinced that alcohol was involved as it was the afternoon of the 4th of July. He often seemed to be in accidents, or other incidents, that now looking back, screamed to his own problems. What a loss.)",892

> Addictions, even as they resemble normal human yearnings, are more about desire than attainment. In the addicted mode, the emotional charge is in the pursuit and the _acquisition_ of the desired object, not in the possession and enjoyment of it. The greatest pleasure is in the momentary satisfaction of yearning. The fundamental addiction is to the fleeting experience of _not_ being addicted. The addict craves the absence of the craving state. For a brief moment he’s liberated from emptiness, from boredom, from lack of meaning, from yearning, from being driven or from pain. He is free. His enslavement to the external — the substance, the object, or the activity — consists of the impossibility, in his mind, of finding within himself the freedom from longing or irritability.

Of course, you know the rest of the story: The peace we seek simply isn't available at the bottom of a bottle (nor in a syringe). In pursuing that illusion, we harm ourselves, and usually those around us as well.

People who have relapsed before, what helped you get over the embarrassment and disappointment afterwards? I can't bring myself to tell my loved ones I've been doing this again after they have been so supportive and encouraging, but hiding it probably does me no good. I also fear the following night, because every time I've been drinking, I get insomnia for days. Not being able to sleep well is already a problem for me when I'm sober... 

The bright side (ironically) is that I was drinking alone. No embarrassing texts were sent, no mental breakdowns, anything like that. I had a decent night painting and playing Pokemon while drunk. It's the morning after depression that is getting to me now.

I’ve been through a lot and my problem started 2-2 1/2 years ago after getting out of an abusive relationship. I moved back in with my parents during this time period & they dealt with the brunt of it... I cleaned myself up quite a bit and moved out, but never really stopped drinking. I’ve ruined friendships and feel guilty and embarrassed about how I was during that time period. I also made new friends in this time that made me feel like this behavior is normal — I guess that’s party culture? 

More recently, these past few months I don’t drink nearly as much as I did during that time frame. But I still drink to a point where I think I still have a problem & I don’t want to admit to it for some time because I’ve been doing so much better than at my worst. I don’t see the friends I drink with as often, and I’m usually good for a week or two before I start a binge period. I maybe only have 3-4 drinks per day when I binge (6 at most) so it’s not like I’m getting super wasted or anything... but I really want to be independent of alcohol use. I’m 24 and I feel like it’s hard because everyone around me drinks at this age, people still party like we’re in college or something. 

I’ve started therapy to help me unpack issues from the relationship that started everything, and I started eating healthier and working out. Overall I think I’m making purposeful life choices, but I still go to alcohol to help me chill out from life stresses. Or just to feel something different even if I feel fine. I feel at this point it’s more out of habit than necessity, but the more I read through people’s stories, the more I realize that alcoholism starts like this and progressively gets worse. I want to start making a life change before I get to any physical dependency from it, and rewire my brain. I want to be able to enjoy a drink or two on occasion without getting more to accompany that when I get home and I’m by myself.

How do I really start to make changes from day one? What do you / have you done to help think you through your decisions? I’ve recently started getting into exercise and painting, but you can still drink after all that.

We all suffer to get sober and we tend to almost always go through the same trials. So many times I have read others posts and nodded emphatically. I would always end up saying to myself, ""yes! That's me too!""

Sobriety is about dependability. Depending on yourself to be healthy. To do what's best for you and for those around you. Family and friends who need you and ultimately this community that needs us to keep trying and learning and growing. Life is unpredictable and most of the time it requires our input. Being sober and being available to yourself and others is the greatest lesson I have learned so far on this journey.

Ever since I got the email invite I’ve been debating whether or not I was gonna go to my work Christmas party. I work with a number of people who seem to be pretty heavy drinkers, and it sounded like it was going to be a pretty boozy affair. Apparently an ambulance was called last year because someone injured themselves in a blackout. And that story isn’t told in a scandalized whisper, it’s the “oh hahah, we’re so wild and crazy” way.

I realized today that I just didn’t want to go. I wasn’t concerned about relapsing. I’m at a place in my sobriety where I’m not massively concerned about staying sober around people who are drinking. 

I’m established in my sobriety, and I’m not having thoughts about drinking. I put time and attention into maintaining my sobriety on a daily basis. I’m actively engaged with my sobriety support network both on here and in real life. I know that I can get support at any time, and I’m comfortable reaching out to people because I’m doing it on a regular basis. 

If I have a legitimate reason to be around alcohol I’m in a place where I can do it, and if it gets a little hairy I know that I can call someone, and I know that I can just leave.

I sorta felt obligated to make an appearance. And then I just thought, fuck it. It’s not something that I want to do. This isn’t a career job for me, and I’m planning on leaving in the nearish future anyway, so fuck it. I’m not spending my Saturday night brushing off a bunch of drunks who want to ask why I’m not drinking.

I get asked if I drink at work fairly often. I’m not interested in getting into it. One of the things that I’ve been learning in recent months is that it’s not my job to decide if other people are having problems. It’s not my job to decide if, when, and how they should fix the problems that I think they have. 

It’s my job to make good decisions for myself. It’s also my job to stay on top of my own recovery and to ask for help when I need it. That’s it. I am not all powerful, I’m not even kinda powerful. I have the power to do the best that I can for myself and to get help for myself. That’s it.

So I did what I wanted to do, and I went to my new Saturday night meeting double header, an Adult Children Of Alcoholics And Dysfunctional Families meeting followed by an AA meeting. I saw my friends. I spent time with people who I wanted to spend time with, doing what I wanted to do. I already spend a ton of time at work, I don’t need to waste a Saturday night on it.

And I picked up a flier for a service opportunity that I’m excited about, I think that it’s a really good fit for me. I’ve thought about volunteering answering calls to the local AA service office for a while. I haven’t done it for several reasons which seemed totally legit at the time, but now I realize that it mostly boils down to the fact that I don’t like talking on the phone. 

Because *this* service opportunity is almost completely identical, except it’s talking to people who use the chat option on the website. Clearly more my speed. I could type into chat bubbles about AA and sobriety all day long, for fun and for free. 

There is a part of me that sorta felt like talking on the phone might be good for me, but fuck it. It’s not something that I want to do, so why do it. I might as well use my strengths and do something that’ll be easy to keep doing. It doesn’t have to be a death-march doing what’s good for me. And there’s nothing wrong with enjoying life, which is another lesson that I keep learning.

Anyway, I’m off to bed. I hope that you all are well. I couldn’t do this without you. Together we are strong.

2019-12-08 00:41:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e7q0k3/i_had_to_skip_my_army_units_formal_dining_out/,I had to skip my Army unit's formal Dining Out event tonight because I'm focusing on my sobriety.,"I used to drink...a lot. I was drinking a 12-pack (or more) nearly every single night of the week. I had a huge problem, and I was terrified to admit it to myself or to others to ask for help. 

After years of struggling, I finally broke down and reached out to my supervisor in the Army reserves. I needed help. I texted him on a Saturday night during a drill weekend and said something like, ""I need to talk to you about something that's really personal and difficult for me to talk to someone about."" He responded, ""Is this something that you'd rather talk face-to-face in person about tomorrow?"" I replied, ""Yes, but I wanted to text you now so you know and now I'm committed to talking to you about it.""

The next day at work, I shared with him that I had a problem. We found a private place to talk for a while. He called hotlines with me looking for resources that could help me. We called AA (Alcoholics Anonymous), ASAP (Army Substance Abuse Program), Army One Source, and a bunch of other numbers. Because I'm a Reservist and no longer on active duty, and because of where I live, I didn't have access to most of the programs that are out there.

Finally we found a group called GiveAnHour. It's a group of civilian therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, etc., who donate a free hour of counseling each week to soldiers and veterans. And more importantly, I got connected with someone who was willing to meet with me each week.

It took almost two months of struggling before I finally broke through. I would go sober for a day or two at the most and  then stumble and drink myself into a stupor again. I just couldn't make it more than a day or two. 

But I never gave up. I kept showing up to my counseling. I was honest with myself and my counselor, and that was, quite possibly, the hardest part.

On May 7th of this year, I took my last drink. I haven't had a drop of alcohol on my tongue since that day. Tonight marks 7 months since the last time that I drank.

Tonight was also my unit's formal dining out event. In the past, I've always loved going these events, but I also always got drunk at the open bar at them. So I told my supervisor that I couldn't go tonight because of the need to focus on my sobriety. These events are more or less mandatory so I thought I would get a lot of push back on it. He didn't even hesitate. He totally supported me on it.

So I spent the evening alone in my hotel room tonight, browsing reddit, watching the news, eating a little bit of fast food, but most importantly, not drinking.

I just wanted to say that I feel both proud and somewhat hesitant that even after 7 months, it still scares me to think about attending such an event. Maybe I wouldn't have succumb to the temptation to drink. Or maybe I would drink but not so much to get drunk. But I know how I used to drink. I know how bad it was. And I can't go back to that so its just not a risk I can afford to take. I know myself.

Anyways, if you made it this far, thank you for reading.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello everyone!  
  
Hope you are well and looking forward to another lovely week of December.  
  
I'm happy to be here hosting this week! I made the commitment 2 weeks ago... only 5 weeks sober at the time. This is the only the second time in 13 years I've cracked 30 days (and the other time I was pregnant, so it wasn't optional). I think it gave me a little extra motivation to stick with it this last couple weeks hahaha. 
  
 Looking forward to the week ahead and chatting with y'all.

First friend group are dudes i used to drink with a lot, honestly its all we’ve ever really done for years, but we went to see a movie and then messed around with one of them’s home studio equipment! Totally sober, except for one of them who brought some soda mixed with tequila into the car on the way to the movie, but he says he’s tapering now. I’d like to help them but I don’t want to be preachy and i dont really know how to help. Other than maybe just hanging out with them more often and doing sober stuff. Maybe an escape room next time!

Second group are two dudes from work and their roommates. I get really bad anxiety around new people, and they had beers and vodka at their crib which they offered me some of, but after refusing the first time they didn’t bring it back up. Really swell people, never thought I’d be included in something like that and actually enjoy it sober. It didn’t take very long for me to actually make jokes and contribute to conversation, and they were all really friendly and funny.

I gotta say, this feels really good. I know i made the right decision in quitting. I can’t wait to make real bonds with people again, and I can’t wait to show the world that i can be a valuable member of society.

I owe this to you all, to my family, and to myself, and maybe sky daddy.

All the reading and studying hold no interest. I pick up a book read 2 pages and lose focus completely. Even browsing nonsense on Reddit can't keep my attention.

As I sit down to write this, my eyes are filled with tears. I lost myself at the bottom of a bottle of whiskey, and I’ve been drowning in it ever since. Over the past seven years, I’ve used alcohol as a crutch for everything. I started out drinking socially, but then it turned into an “after a long day” kind of thing, but then that turned into a “about time go to work, I need a shot” kind of thing. If I was happy or celebrating, oh an excuse to drink! Or if it was the loss of a loved one or a tragedy, oh an excuse to drink...

I’ve lost so many friends and relationships because of I was either too drunk or hungover. I’ve missed work and been sent home because of it. I’ve had a DUI and two suicide attempts while being blackout drunk. But worst of all, I’ve hurt the people I love the most. Both of my previous exes broke up with me because they couldn’t stand to stand by and watch me kill myself or even someone else. And seeing the look in my mother’s eyes... aw man, that’s the most painful. She lost her brother to alcohol, so to see her daughter continue down the same path breaks her heart.

I finally looked in the mirror and realized that I didn’t recognize the person that I was looking at anymore. This person that I’ve become... I don’t know who she is. The sadness in her eyes.

I want to get rid of the fogginess. I want to find the person I was before I relied on alcohol to alter every emotion I have. I don’t want to be numb anymore. I want to feel again... to feel happiness. And most importantly, I want to do this for me. I want to be a better lover, a better friend, a better daughter...a better person.

I'm a long-time lurker, so maybe not brand new, but new to posting. I thought I should introduce myself here.

I debated for a long, long time whether to post, because it's really committing externally to change. I thought for a long time I could try on my own to cut back on drinking. But I have realized that I need external accountability and support. I will admit that I don't know if I'm quitting forever, or just taking a long break; but right now I am ready to stop and see how it improves my life. After starting to read The Naked Mind (which I learned about here), I have a feeling that there will be many benefits from not drinking and I hope that those benefits and objective knowledge about the health impacts of alcohol can motivate me to make healthy choices for the rest of my life. I would love to actually not want to drink and I am looking forward to finishing the book.

I don't know how much personal detail I should share. This is a long story, so warning on length. Here is my story:

My sibling, who is a decade older than me, is a chronic alcoholic and has been for my entire life (I am in my 30s now; brother started drinking as a teen and is now approaching his 50s). My parents were never big drinkers, and thanks to my sibling they became even more opposed to it so it was rarely in my home growing up. My parents tried to shield me from my brother's life and while I knew he was an alcoholic, I did not really know what that meant until I was in my twenties. I also lived in a highly religious community that is predominantly abstinent. I was rarely around alcohol in college and only drank occasionally/socially; the party scene was virtually nonexistent for me. 

After school, I moved to the across the country for my career. The city I moved to celebrated alcohol and I found myself surrounded by drinkers for the first time ever. My career niche was also led by a handful of people who happened to be very heavy drinkers. It was quite a culture change. I was a pretty moderate drinker for several years there. But I was also horrifically uninformed about alcohol and had absolutely no sense of what ""normal"" consumption should look like; between my upbringing and this new community I'd only seen total abstinence or heavy drinking. I think coming from a background of abstinence, I had romanticized what alcohol is, and being a drinker made me feel a bit rebellious. I liked that feeling, especially after years of feeling oppressed by my home community and religion.

I met my spouse in this new city and he grew up around/with alcohol and is a drinker too. Every stage of our relationship has included alcohol. Most of our early dates were to breweries or involved alcohol. Our trips and adventures almost always included specific outings to try local craft beers. Since we have been together, we have had alcohol almost every weekend. It is a very habitual and ingrained part of our lifestyle.

Things were fine for almost a decade in my new city, but then I experienced some pretty profound trauma. This was the moment when everything changed. I started to drink more than normal (vodka became a nightly staple for several months) and then it became a problem at home. It started to negatively impact my work and other aspects of my life. So, we both took a 4 month break from alcohol to reevaluate our feelings about it. After the break, we slowly reintroduced it. After the break, I was able to moderate for 2 years... until the start of this year when the source of my trauma unexpectedly re-emerged in an invasive way into my life (that's it's own horrible story). Since then I've seen myself spiraling down. 

After an alcohol-fueled fight in which I was horrible to my spouse, I abstained for a month... which felt great. I missed beer, though, and our social life is all about craft breweries with friends. All of my friends drink. My goal was to limit myself to 7 drinks or less per week. This worked for about a month, but then the worst thing ever happened; my best friend, who had been battling a rare form of cancer, passed away. I got extremely depressed and started to consume more again. It's built up to the point where for the past few months, I've been having a couple of drinks almost every day (mostly beer and wine, but sometimes liquor)... sometimes it's only one or two drinks, but sometimes it's 3-5. Social settings have been worse, too... I have been having more than I want to at events and it has led to some embarrassing moments with friends. To make it worse, our marriage has been on the rocks and alcohol has been like fuel to that fire.

I hate the label ""alcoholic"". But I do think that I have a problem with drinking right now. I was diagnosed with PTSD and the combination of PTSD/alcohol has been very bad. Using alcohol has not only caused problems with my spouse, but also has exacerbated profound anxiety and depression, and made me gain weight. And I want to have integrity and be honest with myself. If the facts point to me having a problem, then I probably have a problem. Hiding from reality has never done anything good for me in the past. 

I have been working on my mental health... I have a new job and reasons to care about my life. As the Shawshank quote goes, I decided to get busy living, instead of dying. I want to do right by myself and my spouse, even if it is too late to save my marriage. I want to get my life and my health under control and become the person I am capable of being.

I didn't want to admit that I had a problem with alcohol, at least not out loud. I think it's in part because of my brother. He is not a functional alcoholic. In fact, the VA doctors have told my parents he is the worst case of alcoholism they have ever seen. He has tried to quit, over and over, and has relapsed every single time. He has detoxed in hospitals countless times, starting when I was a child and continuing for decades. He has done inpatient and outpatient programs, AA, state-run programs, mandatory psych ward stays, two courses of electroshock therapy, naltrexone, you name it. He suffers from esophageal bleeding and seizures now due to the damage alcohol has caused. He's had two DUIs and has been arrested more than 30 times for public intoxication. Doctors told him after his last long stint that he'd die if he drank one more time. A month later, he went on a bender and the cycle began anew. Nothing ever has stopped his cycle from continuing. I can never tell my parents that I have a problem (even if my problem is not as severe). The weight of that news would crush them.

So, to me, admitting that I have a problem with alcohol -- it feels like I am dooming myself to the same vicious cycle. It is like saying I am him. Essentially, dooming myself to a slow and horrible death. Because of the years watching my brother, I always secretly believed that it was impossible for a problem drinker to quit... I know programs work for many people but I know they didn't work for him, and relapses seem absolutely inevitable to me. But at the same time, continuing to drink is clearly not doing me any favors. I guess I've felt very trapped and sort of ""damned if I do, damned if I don't"". And there's nothing like a ""fuck it"" mentality to enable yourself to keep on drinking.

That is why I was so happy when I found this sub, and this community. Meeting people who actually \*have\* stopped, who have actually done this -- that is empowering. You are all empowering. Reading your stories, your successes -- it gives me hope and makes me feel that this is the right path, that this is not only doable but worthwhile. You have shown me that even if someone does relapse -- that they can get back up and get straight back on the right path, sobriety doesn't need to follow an all or nothing rationale. Thank you for existing, and providing the support you do. I am sure I will be here often, if not posting then at least reading. Beyond my social circle, my spouse still drinks heavily and I am surrounded by alcohol at home. He refuses to admit that I have a problem and has told me I don't need to quit... that's made it hard to commit to stopping, but I feel like I at least owe it to myself to try. 

I am on only day 2 of my journey but I look forward to celebrating milestones with you all in the future.

I will not drink with you today.",18

2019-12-07 19:30:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e7mhvx/1000_days/,1000 days,"Today is my 1000th day sober. It's been a great day, as I'm writing from a Lindy hop swing festival where I'm having a great time. Before I came here I wasn't really pumped for this weekend. But if you don't really have high expectations, events can really surprise you in a good way. I have to take a small break now as my knee is a bit annoyed from all the dancing.

Thoughts on 1000 days sober:
- when looking back on the before times, I now see how I was running away from so much: my emotions, connecting with people, sharing my vulnerabilities, my fears, stresses,... people wouldn't classify me as an alcoholic probably, as drinking is such a big part of college culture. Blackouts, so much shame, many dangerous traffic situations and wasted relationships, opportunities for growth and health. Wish I'd stopped sooner, but here we are.

- the hardest thing is probably all the emotional growth I had to go through. I felt like I was behind many years, like a 17 year old in the body of a 24 year old. I had to learn how to Express them, how to communicate effectively, how to work through conflict. 

- best things: last August after a festival I wrote in my diary ""I cant believe I could feel so happy"". Living is so much more real now, I feel all the things, the good and the bad and can make much better decisions. 

- I'm not only reacting to life anymore. I can be proactive and take command. Make choices to improve things, instead of keeping them ""ok"" and prevent deterioration. Being on the offensive instead of the defensive.

- I can look in the mirror and like the person I've become. I can accept mistakes and try to make them better. I can be kind to myself. 

All these things make life so much easier and less stressful. Sobriety is one of the best gifts I could've given myself.",17

Couldn't sleep last night, thought it was mild withdrawal. At about 5am a terrible pain began in my stomach/epigastric area and got worse. And worse. And worse. By 7am I was convinced that I had a perforated stomach ulcer, something I have had before and the previous winner of worst pain I've ever experienced. This quickly became at least 5 times more painful. 

I called an ambulance and during the wait the operator stayed on the call with my, I was barely coherent by this time. The paramedics gave me gas and air then oramorph, neither of which did anything at all. I was taken to A+E and thankfully given IV morphine, a VERY large dose. It dulled the pain somewhat, but the effects lasted less than an hour. 

After around 6 hours of investigations and me reluctantly admitting to my relapse I was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and whisked off to the surgical admission ward, given more morphine and examined by surgeons - which hurt. The slightest touch on my abdomen and back was agony and I could only breathe in shallow gasps. Finally the hospital were able to get in touch with my brother and I told him the truth about what happened to leave me in this state and apologised for putting him in this situation again. He was very supportive, even holding a sick bowl for me as I vomited god knows what, certainly wasn't food! 

My brother was there as the doctors explained how serious the situation is. This condition is life threatening and at this stage it isn't clear what will happen. I'm being pumped full of fluids, having my heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and blood tests monitored regularly. I've been catheterised (no fun at any time but my first time having it done whilst conscious and in extreme pain!). After several hours during which time the doctors had to check my reactions to the morphine - I've never had IV morphine before - I was fitted with a morphine pump so I can self administer a constant dose. It helps but I can still barely breathe and it only blocks out around 40% of the pain, but this is a blessing despite the nausea. I've also been started chlorodiazepoxide to detox again. I was surprised by how intense the withdrawal is given the short duration of my relapse and I'm not risking the seizures that I have previously experienced.

Tomorrow I will have to speak to my parents and tell them something. I'm not looking forward to it.  Our relationship presently is extremely strained and I believe that they will see this as another betrayal, something I couldn't blame them for. I'm planning on telling them once more results have come back and we know what the plan is. I should expect to be in hospital for several weeks and will almost certainly be in over Christmas. I am having a CT scan tomorrow as it's too painful to do an ultrasound scan. Depending on the results I will probably undergo surgery - I'm too ill for a full lap-cholecystectomy (gall bladder removal) so they'll likely attempt an ERCP to destroy any gallstones blocking my pancreas. Either way will probably lead to me spending more time in the ICU - hopefully without the coma this time. I am going to have to go through the awful experience of having a feeding tube inserted again. 

I never want to be in this situation again. I never want to put my family in this situation again. At least now the door to drinking is permanently closed to me, the reminder of this intense physical pain and the painful experience of having to explain to loved ones that I have let them and myself down again is too awful to contemplate. 

I hope that this next and hopefully last scary post-alcohol experience of mine can at least help anyone here would find a cautionary tale.",48

I just feel so lost right now. It’s like the issues I had before are ten times worse now.

I pulled up and wandered to the appropriate place, and managed to have a sit down with the appropriate people regarding registration.

I basically got told 'sorry, your qualifications are vocational, they're for the work place. If you want to get on an academic course, you have to go back to college for a year and get an introduction to nursing course under your belt before you can come to us'. 

So I went home and discussed things with my wife and she's happy to be the major bread winner for a few years while I study, after all if I qualify in four years, I'll still have another 22 to practise as a nurse. But when my eldest son heard I got rejected, he started asking questions about the university I visited, relentlessly asking what courses they did, saying he'd love to go there etc etc. Needless to say, I'm feeling pretty down right now.

I’m currently feeling good about being sober. I haven’t really struggled much with it in the last month at all. Just a couple times when I catch myself scheming. 

I credit this to several things. Knowledge about addiction, knowledge about culture and society on drinking, working out everyday, supplements like B-1, omega 3s, vitamin D, and 5-htp, melatonin, and a good multi, etc., substituting legal marijuana and an NA beer for relaxation(only at night before bed, I smoke, play video games for 30 minutes and go to sleep), I’ve been working out an average of 75 minutes a day, and i read and participate here on this sub, and really like listening to Recovery Happy Hour podcast. 

Lastly, I’ve been rigorously open and honest about not drinking and what I do, like working out 6-7 days a week, eating clean, and talking about good health and wellness. I don’t think sitting around in basements talking about all the bad stuff and misery is constructive and spent years trying to make it work. Being honest with my friends and people who care about me has done wonders though! IWNDWYT",16

I’m worried that I’ll get fired, I’m worried that I’ll get a strike and I’m worried that I’ll gain a bad reputation in my field.

I’ve tried my best over the past year (where I quit my job and dedicated a few months to control my draw to alcohol).  Now I’m in another country working at a great company, but I’m worried that ill jeopardise my job.

I’ve called in sick to work once before since I started with this company around 6 months ago.   I wanted this to be a clean start and I’m calling in sick to a job I love.

I started drinking here and there at the age of 20.  Joined the military and was married before I turned 21.  Even though there are signs on the base, and they talk about moderately drinking, almost every even I have gone to has revolved around drinking.  We even had a program called (airmen against drunk driving) that would be at events so we could drink and make it home safely.  High stress situations combined with fact that every off duty get together revolved around alcohol, and drinking.  Fast forward and Combine that with being 22 and having two children the stress didn't get better.  The drinking became more frequent, I drank more at home fought more with the wife, was constantly angry, and alcohol seemed to be my way of coping.  
19 years later.  Alcohol has never effected work and everyone else drinks, but friends have said things, the wife has said things, but I wasn't going to quit because I had it under control and in my head they were the reason that I drank.  I have no clue how my amazing wife has had so much patience to put up with everything.  
I am on anxiety and depression meds, and I don't know why.  From the outside I have a great life. Amazing career I have gained rank fast, a beautiful talented amazing wife that I can put on less than one hand her negative traits.  
I hit rock bottom the other night, I got lucky, drove when I shouldn't have.  Lucky there were no accidents, no one got hurt, but I woke up only remembering pieces.  I hopped on here last night and was browsing through here when I read someone recommending This Naked Mind as a good read.   I read the reviews and they were almost  all positive.  So bought a digital copy.  I knew alcohol was bad and could cause negative health issues, but the way its talked about, and how and why alcohol is accepted and a ""norm"" and not a drug, yet it kills 15 times more people each year than coke, was just one of the many yeah wth moments while reading.  What really hit me was how alcohol causes and rewires the brain causing depression, and anxiety, and pretty much the reason for the anger and fights over the years was all spot on.  
I never thought a book could change my mind or help me.  I know I am only a few days in, but I literally have no desire to drink ever again,  I look forward to not wanting to drink, and to see things get clearer and happier without medication, and to see it for what it is.  Literally putting poison in my body, and justifying it.  Acquiring a taste for poison.     I will not drink today.  and for anyone having a hard time you have to read this book!!!!",13

This is huge for me. I used to be a swimmer and avid runner, until I went to college 4 years ago. Its been worse lately though, for the past 6 months, I have been getting drunk and smoking every night, whether alone or with friends. I tried to go for a run about a month ago, and got kicked in the face, puking about 3 minutes in, heaving for 30 minutes, and not even finishing the mile. 

Since then, I told myself I would slowly cut back (which never worked). And a week ago (last Saturday) I decided to throw out all my smokes and quit drinking completely, I wanted to better myself. I havent had a single smoke or drink this week, thanks to my accountability partners, and have gone to the gym 5 times since Sunday. 

Two weeks ago, I still couldnt finish a single mile, after cutting back on drinking and smoking. And today, basically a week sober of both liquor and tobacco, I did two miles without stopping!!! I am super proud of myself for being a week sober of both, and meeting my first goal of over a mile without stopping.

I can’t say that I’m still not irked over it. I’d like the weight loss, the face changes, the sleep gains, the mental benefit, all of it. But I was still just life, now sober, and it just seemed the same, nothing better. 

So, I decided to drink last night. Why not right? If being sober wasn’t doing anything why stay sober?

Well, I might not have been feeling major benefits from not drinking, but I am feeling major detriments from drinking. 

I picked the highest ABV IPA (it was a new one, had to try it) and hadn’t eaten much all day, I skulled most of them in short order, didn’t get much to eat, got on the stimulation rollercoaster, kept drinking, ate a pot brownie to try and calm down, nothing worked, so I finally just put myself to bed, but it’s all a bit hazy. 

And I did this all in front of someone who I respect and who’s been amazing to me so I feel so much more guilt about it. And anxiety because I don’t have all the details of the night and I’m worried I did something to hurt myself. Ugh. 

I’m not feeling sick hungover but emotionally I’m not right. I didn’t sleep well. I’m sulking around the house. I want to hide in a hole. Last night was such a waste. I’m fixated on it. I want to take it back. I’m embarrassed. I’m frustrated with myself. I’m just not doing well today. 

So, don’t do it! It’s not worth it. I’m writing this out to remind myself too. IWNDWYT.",20

All my family drink, I've already agreed to go out for a meal with the family on Christmas Day, which I usually work, so my family are already excited and I'm worried about being in a restaurant situation with everyone drinking. I can avoid work and friend gatherings but I can't avoid this one.

I'm starting to think that I need to be straight with them and tell them I have a problem. I don't talk about my problems with people, it isn't my way, the idea makes me cringe.

I am stressed more today than I have been in years. I have a great job, but the company is reorganizing. Most of my peers know what their new roles will be after the new year, but I've been told for 2 months that I will find out ""next week"".  The pay is great but we are still stretched thin as it is. Christmas is in a few weeks and we are deep into our reserve funds too.  We have made financial changes that will help in the new year.  If I make it through this with my job, we will make it, but day to day is tough. The uncertainty is pushing me hard and the stress is at a max for me.

But the good news today is I don't want a drink. I can't afford it right now, both financially and personally.  It's one of the few times I can remember that I don't see an excuse to drink, and I definitely know it's not going to fix anything, or numb the stress, or speed up time to make the stress finish sooner.

Check your ego at the door and reach out for help. You are not alone out there. Warning long post.","Wow.  Posting from mobile so excuse the format(I guess?). This has been the longest time I’ve been sober and happy at the same time since childhood. No more white knuckling it thru life. 

67 days ago I was bailed from jail for my 3rd OUI. Not good. It was over. The gig was up. I had a great life insurance policy that was fully locked in for my family to receive through my union and company provider. As I wrote my final good byes to children and wife assuring them it was not their fault at 3:42am on 10-7-19 I broke down in tears. I could not stop drinking even though I had tried. I was physically dependent. I set myself up in my garage to do the deed and already tested weight limits on load bearing beams and cargo tie downs which would hold me up. That’s when the garage door opened. My wife standing there, note in hand, like a deer in headlights. Life changed at that moment. My kids, my family, my friends, my dear wife all were hijacked by this disease and this was no answer. I immediately got down. Cried like never before. I called a 30 day inpatient program to be “unplugged” from everything in this fast paced world. There, I learned to live for the day. Everyday is a gift. That’s why they call it the present. The past is history and the future is unwritten. I learned to ask for help. I’m stubborn. It was the single hardest thing to do. I learned the 12 steps. I learned to meditate. I learned to stop and listen instead of thinking of the next thing to say. When I left treatment and got my phone and internet back, I found this sub and it’s support. AA, podcasts, TEDtalks, and the like. The obsession of alcohol is lifted. I feel relieved. My life still has its ups and downs as all of ours will. But I can take a step back and think now. Picking up won’t help any of my problems. I’m looking at prison time, many years loss of license, felony record, loss of great job, and many other things. All out of my control. But I’m genuinely happy. I can only do the good things I can do today. So if you are out there struggling, you are not alone. There are people just like you. I am just like you. It can get better. Put the work in. You only hit the bottom if you stop digging. Try to enjoy all the things around you. This world can be a beautiful place if you look for it. Smile. You might just get one back. Much love to you all! Sorry, not sorry, for long post.",21

Three weeks ago my father passed away. I officiated the service, and am handling his estate. I'm also a parent, spouse, sibling, and supervisor. I have been struggling to balance my responsibilities, old and new, with finding time to grieve. 

When I lost my mother 10 years ago I sought refuge in the bottle. I was already an alcoholic but in my grief the ""functional"" part started to slip away and I decided to make a change. I decided I was powerless over alcohol, and that my life had become unmanageable. I sought help. I stopped drinking. Since then, one day at a time, I've been successful. 

I have been feeling the urge to drink. I've been praying, offering service to others, and seeking fellowship. It's still hard. I've been eating my feelings a ton. Where I used to pick up a bottle I have been picking up a spoon. I know I have to find a healthier way to process these feelings because that booze is everywhere y'all!

After leaving work, I had to run errands, including getting groceries for entertaining friends this evening and starting holiday baking. That awful little voice started in the back of my head almost as soon as I hit the store. You know the one: *you deserve it; it will taste good; you can drink and cook/bake at the same time!* I actually stopped the cart at the corner of the beer/wine aisle and used one of y'all's SD tricks: play it forward. And I resisted buying any wine by telling myself:

* When I stay sober tonight I can cook a good meal for my family (pork tenderloin, acorn squash, and sauteed cabbage with apples was the plan).
* When I stay sober tonight I'll sleep well and can get up tomorrow and make them all breakfast so they're amped to start chores and decorating.
* Then I'll stay sober to make a big meal for the friends coming over to celebrate late Friendsgiving and early Christmas.
* Because I will have stayed sober Saturday night, I'll wake up rested and happy on Sunday to start rehearsal for service (I do A/V and sound booth work at church), do church, and then have a nice lunch before an afternoon rehearsal for the Christmas program.
* And I'll end a Sunday spent mostly at church by finishing decorating and baking so I can go to work on Monday with treats for my department and do a kick-ass job orienting the new hires.

I was proud of myself. I rewarded myself by buying a little sprig of artificial mistletoe to supplement my existing holiday decorations. And then, carrying way too many groceries out of my trunk, I stepped wrong on a piece of sidewalk chalk left on the garage floor, bent my foot sideways/backwards and fell on it. Cried real hard for 20 minutes, then took myself to urgent care to find I fractured it and need to see an orthopedist ASAP on Monday. 

My ideal weekend isn't going to happen. My husband says that our friends can wait a week while we learn how to deal with my limited mobility. My family didn't get my beautiful ambitious meal plan; they got frozen stouffers casserole. Baking seems laughable at this point. But I didn't drink last night and I'm not going to drink tonight. Tomorrow will get here when it gets here. I feel like having five days under my belt (as well as more sober days overall this year than in many others) is helping me be more optimistic. Wine Mom would have wallowed in how the universe was against me. Sober me is trying to find the hilarity in continuing to look forward to That One Christmas I Had a Broken Foot.

I cannot moderate and I cannot stop without accountability. It’s amazing how freeing that feels to admit.,"I’ve debated if I should cut back/stop drinking for three years now but I have always been to prideful to fully admit I have a problem. I would take breaks, some times for the duration I planned and sometimes not even make it through the first day. I always found excuses, it makes chores more fun, it’s relaxing for after hours work, it helps me sleep, it’s just fun.

After all, I got good grades, became an engineer, got a great job, stayed in good shape, married my high school sweetheart, and I’m only 25. People with alcohol issues can’t be in their 20s... But like so many others stories, that bliss state of alcohol with little consequences quickly fades. And as I reflected, I’m struggling with my work, am 20 lbs overweight always feeling terrible, and struggle to be excited about anything other than drinking.

I made a decision that I am not in control and that I can’t do it with my own will power alone. I know it’s early on but it feels so different. I shared this with my wife last night and I finally stopped hiding. I really appreciate this sub for helping shine a light on how alcohol abuse can show it self in so many ways, that the best time is now, and for providing a community to work through this together.

I have had years I have quit, but have always seem to get back to it again for one reason or another.  I found this group in August and you have been wonderful.

Last January my husband and I booked a cruise for next week. As it started to approach I was anxious about thinking about whether or not to drink. My husband quit almost 5 years ago (after 3 DUIs, quite a journey but another story) so I would be drinking alone. 

Over the years of stopping and starting I have always tried to moderate, but like most of us realized it DOES NOT WORK.  But I never could bring myself to “quitting for good”. In October I read Allen Carr’s “How to Quit Drinking Without Willpower” (I had read Annie Grace, twice, and it didn’t take) and something changed in me.  I started to think about the cruise and thought, “why would I want to drink and wake up each day hungover.? Why would I want to miss beautiful sunrises (I love them) or (maybe) not remember the beautiful sunsets?  Why would I want to experience each day with a hangover when I could instead, feel lots of energy and ready to go.  Why would I want to miss out on that really GREAT sleep?“

The day of this realization I went to an Octoberfest party, drank and quit the next day.  For the first time I decided I was not just “taking a break”, but (hopefully, we know One Day at A Time) quitting for good.  I have had no desire to drink. I do not feel deprived as in the past when I see others drink.  No more, “I am trying to make it 30, 60 or 100  days, or till the weekend, and spending time doing all of that thinking about drinking/not drinking. I have felt this way since this Day 1 and am still feeling that way today after 48 days.  I loved my glass(es) (bottles?) of wine, but I think it is over. 

So we are leaving tomorrow to drive to Florida and go on our first sober cruise and I am stoked!

THANK YOU to all of you out there. When you share your successes you inspire me.  When you share your challenges you remind me of my own,  I believe you have finally put the nail in my“moderation” coffin and I will quit fooling myself into thinking it can work. Someone out there reminded me about Allen Carr’s book and inspired me to finally read it.  

Peace and love to all of you on this (sometimes very difficult) journey we call life. We are in this together.",15

I had always used parties and social gatherings as my go-to excuse to drink. This work party was especially stressful because the host was an Executive at my husband’s firm in his mega million mansion. I didn’t know a soul there. I’m also working on losing the booze weight and even though I bought a new dress and did my hair yesterday, I was feeling extremely insecure without having my old crutch. It was all so intimidating that even though I drove us the hour to get there, I almost didn’t get out of the car. Lol. 

Well.... guess what! Not only did I have a great time and socialize with relative ease, I remembered everyone’s name. I told engaging stories that had a beginning, middle, and end. I had nice breath. I stood with confidence around total strangers. I looked people in the eyes the entire night. I noticed when everyone else started to slur their words and felt gratitude that it was not me. When I left the party, dressed to kill, holding my husbands hand, and being stone cold sober, I was so goddamn proud of myself.

I realized I have taken too much for granted. I'm still craving drinks. It has been almost 40 days but only a handful of Friday nights. 

Every TV show, every commercial, feels like it is all about alcohol. Even my wife, who has cut down but still has wine in the house, showing me a random internet video of a big group of people enjoying some cool decanter gadget  (I must really seem like this isn't hard or something) right in the middle of this inner battle. But I don't get up. 

I feel like nobody understands me. I just want the day to end. I fall asleep so restless and discontented. 

Then, such a vivid dream. I don't remember everyone but the feeling was, it was everybody who matters. And someone asked, why I decided to quit, like, what happened? 

And I think I gave my most honest answer, ""It just doesn't make me feel good anymore."" 

I have a lot of pressure on me work wise and financially, along with some heavy grief from losing my mom that I'm not really dealing with, and now this perceived pressure from family and friends who feel distanced from me. They probably think I'm solid, I got this, and that just amplifies how much they don't really know me. I feel like a lonely duck, calm above the surface but paddling like hell underwater. 

Anyway, in the dream, I was able to balance it all out. I felt relaxed, calm, and honest. I'm not angry at alcohol. The world hasn't shifted on me. I have chosen to be different. I like being different. They accept me, and my answer, and that's it. Life resumes. 

This morning, I'm so happy that nighttime me stayed strong. Of course it is hard. Of course Friday nights are gonna suck for a while. Of course you are going to be frustrated and wound up tight, you always were. But morning me is grateful and excited for this day.

The positives? I only spent $11. That included admission to a show and a tip for a couple of free soda waters. I left right after the last band since my back and hips were starting to hurt from standing for so long. I got to see some friends and had a pretty good time. 


The negatives? I can’t stand being at bars late. Especially if there isn’t any food. My friends invited some coworkers that I really cannot stand sober let alone when they’re all drunk. I couldn’t leave before the gremlin hour and barely got any sleep last night. I had a panic attack during one of the bands. Apparently, the way they were playing their bass drum triggered something which I’ll need to talk about at therapy. I would have rather stayed home and watched the office which makes me a little sad.

I live in Poland, in a city where virtually everybody drinks. My friends from Spain are also drinkers so, basically, what I had to do was to isolate myself. I just couldn't go near any bar without getting triggered. Once I entered one, I became sick on the stomach or I had to order a drink.

I have been working online all this time and this added to my isolation. This made me a very solitary person and I hate this. So I ended up drinking again. And guess what? I feel even worse. It just makes things worse. One of the great things about sobriety is that I feel much healthier in body and mind. But, as I told you, a big drawback is isolation. 

I have been avoiding people so that I don't have to drink. I know you should get used to being around people drinking, but I am just terrified.

What did I do?  Skip dinner, and pound way too many strong pints.   Low-light?  Me behaving very awkwardly around my boss’ boss, who I have a great working relationship with, and her husband.  
I’ve been lying awake most of the night cringing.    No doubt I’m making it a bigger deal than it is, but either way, I’ll mention in a light hearted way on Monday that I’m embarrassed, so even though it’s not a serious issue, she’ll be reminded I at least have a basic level of self-awareness.
The ‘have a few drinks to celebrate and loosen up’ is a lie that I’m sick of telling myself over and over again.  
I’m going to my second Christmas party (out of many) tonight.  Going to avoid the poison and self-delusion, and sleep soundly on Saturday night.
Thanks for reading, and have a great weekend everyone.

To frame this birth compared to the last. I am not intoxicated. She woke me up in our bed with my son sleeping next to me (she moved to the guest room because it has a memory foam mattress a month ago). We were able to get the bags in the car and feed the dogs. Her parents came over and we were on our way. (gonna be some surprised kiddos in the morning) The other births were during normal hours. The last one I started drinking when her water broke right after work. I believe I even snuck alcohol into the hospital. I didn’t do anything stupid other than that but it was still a shitty thing to do.  I’m fully present now and thankful. I’m not stressed or worried I’m ready to greet this kid into a wonderful loving world. Just wanted to share. You can do this folks and it is well worth it. I’ll keep you posted.,133

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I was drinking either half a bottle of vodka, 4-5 tall cocktail canned drinks, or any random IPA 6- packs on the regular. 

I had quit for almost a month before that because I was having to some health issues and high enzyme levels but I got them down to normal and was doing good. But then that sneaky voice told me “you can control this beast of an addiction, drink moderately!”

Yeah right....

So here I am again. Hit some bad withdrawals about 5 days ago. Those package: it starts with the brain fog...then comes the shakes and hands twitching all the time (I try to hide it at work) I sneak into the bathroom to puke sometimes...can’t focus on anything. Come home tell my wife “It’s happening again” she get pissed, as expected....that night was the worst night ever...I’m sleeping on the couch, shaking, twitching, puking every hour, I start seeing weird visuals in the darks....keep waking myself every 20 minutes from these horribly vivid dreams...I can’t take this anymore!....I tell myself I’m done...but I’m scared of possible seizures.

So I decide to Taper for 4-5 days with sips of vodka(I know they suggest beer) but I had a good plan...so now here on the 5th day I haven’t had one sip of booze and I feel sooooo much better no shake, skins a better color, solid stools and I’m able to sleep somewhat and no visuals.

So I just want to thank all of you because I sat here every night reading SD till 2am getting motivation from all of you. IWNDWYT",4

I haven't treated myself in awhile so tonight I bought a big slice of my favorite chocolate peanut butter marshmallow cake with oreo cookie crumble crust (umm yeah, it's fucking bomb). I ate the entire slice in only a few minutes. Moderation is not my forte, obviously!

Anywho, I was just thinking about all those hangovers I used to suffer through. Times I worked all day while on the verge of vomiting, or running back and forth from the bathroom throwing up or with diarrhea. Days when I was dry heaving or puking up stomach bile, and shaking uncontrollably with a pounding headache for hours only to get off work and go drink again.

How did I live like that?

I had to take some time off from my job late last spring due to panic attacks and crippling anxiety. After that I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder and I started to go to therapy on a regular basis. A lot of stuff was changing in my life and during all those changes I continued to drink heavily, since that has been my go-to practice for dealing with anxiety and pretty much everything ever since I was 17 or 18. 

In the beginning of summer I attempted suicide by overdosing on painkillers, cough syrup and alcohol and had to spend some time in a hospital. Then a couple weeks after that I attempted suicide again while intoxicated, but I managed to admit myself to a mental health clinic for the night. When I got there and the nurse made me do a breathalyzer test, the alcohol level in my blood was well over 4 times the legal limit to drive, even though it was several hours since I had consumed alcohol.

Even after all that and my therapist regularly suggesting I stop using alcohol, I still wasn’t ready. I left the clinic the next morning as soon as I could, even though the medical staff was heavily against it. As soon as I got home I went to a bar and spent the rest of the day drinking. At night I also scored some MDMA and amphetamine and smoked a bunch of weed. 

The next day I woke up on my friend’s couch and I guess I suddenly felt like I was ready to stop drinking and get sober. That was in mid-June. I haven’t drank or taken narcotics since.

After that a lot more has happened in my life, such as being deemed unfit for my job due to anxiety, going unemployed and being described 3 different antidepressants in less than 3 months. But I still haven’t drank or even had the urge to do so. I’ve stayed completely sober.

I had my 27th birthday a while ago and this whole fall I’ve been in the process of rebuilding myself and figuring out who I really am. It’s an ongoing process but one that is necessary for me to some day be happy or even somewhat satisfied with my life. And none of it could be possible if I was still drinking or taking drugs.

The only downside is that I feel like I have heavily disconnected from all of my friends, which has resulted in a profound feeling of loneliness. Even though I try to spend time with them and appreciate having them as friends, I feel like it is difficult to connect with any of them on a mental level, since most of my friends are heavy substance abusers and I feel like I’ve personally ”moved on”, so to speak.

In spite of that, IWNDWYT.",15

Feeling bad about everything I’m not doing, afraid to face simple tasks like cooking or going to work. Ugh. I just want to crawl into bed and stay there forever and I don’t know why. I haven’t exercised in days and I feel bad for that. 

I am still not drinking though and am resolved to keep it that way. I think I am going to have to drag myself, internally kicking and screaming, back into living and doing things even though I don’t want to.

2019-12-06 19:50:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e77ekz/weekend_writing_true_selfcare/,Weekend Writing: TRUE Self-Care,"“Self-care is often a very unbeautiful thing.

It is making a spreadsheet of your debt and enforcing a morning routine and cooking yourself healthy meals and no longer just running from your problems and calling the distraction a solution.

It is often doing the ugliest thing that you have to do, like sweat through another workout or tell a toxic friend you don’t want to see them anymore or get a second job so you can have a savings account or figure out a way to accept yourself so that you’re not constantly exhausted from trying to be everything, all the time and then needing to take deliberate, mandated breaks from living to do basic things like drop some oil into a bath and read Marie Claire and turn your phone off for the day.

A world in which self-care has to be such a trendy topic is a world that is sick. Self-care should not be something we resort to because we are so absolutely exhausted that we need some reprieve from our own relentless internal pressure.

True self-care is not salt baths and chocolate cake, it is making the choice to build a life you don’t need to regularly escape from.

And that often takes doing the thing you least want to do.

It often means looking your failures and disappointments square in the eye and re-strategizing. It is not satiating your immediate desires. It is letting go. It is choosing new. It is disappointing some people. It is making sacrifices for others. It is living a way that other people won’t, so maybe you can live in a way that other people can’t.

It is letting yourself be normal. Regular. Unexceptional. It is sometimes having a dirty kitchen and deciding your ultimate goal in life isn’t going to be having abs and keeping up with your fake friends. It is deciding how much of your anxiety comes from not actualizing your latent potential, and how much comes from the way you were being trained to think before you even knew what was happening.

If you find yourself having to regularly indulge in consumer self-care, it’s because you are disconnected from actual self-care, which has very little to do with “treating yourself” and a whole lot do with parenting yourself and making choices for your long-term wellness.

It is no longer using your hectic and unreasonable life as justification for self-sabotage in the form of liquor and procrastination. It is learning how to stop trying to “fix yourself” and start trying to take care of yourself… and maybe finding that taking care lovingly attends to a lot of the problems you were trying to fix in the first place.

It means being the hero of your life, not the victim. It means rewiring what you have until your everyday life isn’t something you need therapy to recover from. It is no longer choosing a life that looks good over a life that feels good. It is giving the hell up on some goals so you can care about others. It is being honest even if that means you aren’t universally liked. It is meeting your own needs so you aren’t anxious and dependent on other people.

It is becoming the person you know you want and are meant to be. Someone who knows that salt baths and chocolate cake are ways to enjoy life – not escape from it.”

I’m just curious for my own healing if anyone has had any success in using a “crutch” as a way to get through tough times.
I’m on day 3 now and I’m always on the road away from my family. My co workers have drinks all the time and that’s partly why it’s been so hard to take the step to quit...

My question is: do you guys think it’s a bad idea to drink non-alcoholic drinks to get through cravings to ultimately make it through another day during tough times? (0% non alcoholic drinks)

My concern would be: that I keep some kind of connection with the dark side and possibly fall back into the past.

I left from the dinner pretty early, prompting some other people (who don't, as far as I know, have alcohol related issues) to go to bed as well. I'm actually really surprised and happy about that.

The results have been very very serious. My business is back on track. My relationships are better. I’m more likeable, my sleep and drug problems are completely got. 

I live in a big city so everyone’s social life and dating life is around drinking and bars.  I have had the wherewithal to prevent myself from going out, for the most part. It doesn’t require much will power when you never have the temptation. 

I never hit a “low” with alcohol or drank daily. It effected my life more subtly. So I know for a fact the social pressure and habits at a bar if I show up will be irresistible and I will change my perception and perspective accordingly to be in line with my drinking. 

I know some people go to bars and drink club sodas but this seems like bs to me. Does anyone really do that regular? It feels to me like you have to be a sociopath to hang around drunk people sober - not to be a hater, but that’s just how I feel. I have no desire to go out to a bar on a Friday night if I’m not drinking. 

The life choice I made has fundamentally shifted things for the better - but socially my life is lagging; I was always the “frat boy” not this holistic/meditative person where I like doing yoga and getting “smoothies” - so it feels like there is no path to socializing and getting laid other then going to bars again.

Today I was hired for a job in the city I want to relocate to and my girlfriend got hired in the same city on the same day. 

We both graduate this month. And I looked at a beautiful apartment to rent in a nice neighborhood today-- waiting on paperwork to apply this evening.

I have had many day 1s before my current streak. 3 years ago, I was drinking a fifth of Svedka a day and about to crash and burn out of my first good job. I was in a toxic, codependent relationship and never saw my friends. I was addicted to benzos and amphetamines (to control my keel) and I had no interests or hobbies. 

Today I am stronger than I have ever been in my life. Today I feel ready for what's next-- for my new job and my new apartment and my new life. For anyone out there on the fence about breaking up with booze, I would recommend it whole heartedly. It gave me my life back.

I had to go to the bank, which I had been putting off because it's very close to the liquor store. But I knew I had to go eventually, and I couldn't put it off anymore.

  


Often times, on Fridays I would run to the bank and then hop over to the liquor store. It's still burned into my mind: turn at Firestone, drive across the Piggly Wiggly parking lot, cross the street, through the abandoned K-Mart parking lot, down the little side street through the woods, and the liquor store is right there. And could see the glowing red Firestone sign, like the Eye of Sauron or something, calling me in. 

  


But I didn't do it. I went to Starbucks instead. And I got a sugary drink with 2 espresso shots. And now I'm sitting here in the pet store parking lot, drinking my ""coffee"" and sucking on my vape like it's air, trying to chill the fuck out.

After my last relapse (3months ago) I started a new job, and was finally having a set routine and feeling like a responsible adult. Everything was good and I was happy. This past Saturday I drank and I’ve drank every day since. My mom and boyfriend found out and I told them every time that I would stop. Yesterday was my office Christmas party and I over did it. My boyfriend broke up with me and my mom was extremely upset. Waking up today was so hard, I had so much anxiety and the shakes/hot flashes. My body literally felt like it was on fire. Thankfully all of my family is supporting me, and my boyfriend and I talked things out. 

I don’t know why, knowing how terrible this feeling is, I relapse. There was no real reason for me to drink, I don’t know what triggers me. I just saw the bottle and thought I’d have a drink. I have basically been drunk this whole week, and it’s crazy how in such a short amount of time my life has spiraled out of control. Thankfully I have a great boss, and awesome coworkers that are understanding. Not to mention an amazing family and boyfriend. Everything feels really hard right now though, I can’t even sleep because my body just feels horrible. I can go months without drinking but I always ruin it. I just want to be sober and stick to it. I need to start going to meetings again, something needs to change. I am at the point again where I just want to be drunk, and I hate it. I want to enjoy being sober again. 

Sorry for the sad post, but I just needed to get it off my chest. I can’t wait until this feeling goes away.",3

It certainly did have an allure to me wanting to drink what adults were able to drink but wouldn’t tell us about. At least my parents didn’t tell me about it or why they drank.

But aside from the advertising aspect of the term, it’s really interesting to think about the lack of responsibility that can result from drinking, the lack of clarity and intention, lack of bravery to face reality without a crutch, denial to face truths. I was hiding with childish insecurities, anxiety and fear that I was unable to face and cope with. 

So here I am, 50 years old, and realizing that drinking was the least adult thing I was doing in my life. And on the other side here, in sobriety, I find myself able to deeply dig into my past, into my childhood, into my relationships, and the experiences that led up to now, and to make sense of it all.

I’ve been taking the end of this year to reflect, to examine, and to face my story, To finally make sense of this epic journey, now as an adult. 


And “adult“ beverages have nothing to do with it.

Zero drinks is enough.

It's been relatively easy since I haven't been around many people drinking in this time (although my roommate and boyfriend have drank on the weekends which has been a bit rough), but I'm realizing this won't be the case for long. I was invited to a party at a friends house that's in the next couple weeks,  and my initial response was to just not go as I am not a huge fan of this group (they do tons of drugs and binge drink, plus there will be TONS of people there), but my boyfriend really wants to go so I reconsidered. One of the main reasons I've stopped drinking is because I realized how heavily I rely on alcohol to socialize. I am very shy, awkward and introverted, so I always have at least a couple drinks at parties (although usually much more). My goal with not drinking has been to get myself to a place where I am comfortable doing these things without relying on alcohol, so I have decided it is important I try to go to this party.  I can't keep skipping any event that has alcohol. Anyways, I'm terrified. I don't know anyone there who won't be high or drinking (hopefully I can find someone though) so I won't have a sober friend to hang out with. My boyfriend is very supportive and understands I may leave earlier than anticipated if my anxiety gets too horrible, in which cause he would likely leave with me, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I still need to go.

Does anyone have any tips? For anyone who has gone through the same thing, what helped you? I will be driving so I can use the DD excuse, and I will also be drinking sparkling water in place so that I have something in my hand. Just really needing some encouragement right about now...

I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.""

this is how i feel with two months of sobriety now. the possibilities of all the things i can do with my free time are starting to come through, and it's a little overwhelming and exciting. all the hobbies i used to enjoy, that i shut out for so long, and convinced myself that they were really boring activities are shining again in my mind, and i want to do them all, but know my tendency to act in excess, and am trying to tame this newfound wild energy. then this quote pops into my head, and it is just perfect. this is the excitement only a free man can feel, and for me right now it is freedom from alcohol and addiction behavior patterns. and this new possibility of myself is exciting, and scary, but for the first time in a long time i feel actual hope.

I know I have missed a few Friday posts and I apologize.  My idea behind these Friday posts is a simple one... over the past year and a half or so, as a member of this community, I am used to seeing a lot of posts on Saturday and Sunday mornings around relapse and failure to stay sober. 

As I first began my sober journey, Friday and Saturday nights were always my toughest times to stay focused and committed to getting and staying sober.

So the idea is this:  Hop on the Sober Train with me!  In your mind use this as a reminder to stay committed and connected to your friends here.  Help each other stay the course!

So hop on the Sober Train folks, so you can arrive safe and sound on Monday morning, successfully sober and proud.  Hold on, it’s a hell of a ride!

Usually I work 7am-4pm and this week I've been working 3am-12pm.  The first few days I was going home and drinking so I could fall asleep.  Wednesday I ended up drinking a case of beer leading me to realize something needs to change on Thursday morning.  

After work yesterday I wasn't able to fall asleep until about 3:30pm.  I had to wake up at 5pm for my wife's Christmas party.  We ended up being 30 minutes late because it takes her forever to get ready to go anywhere.  Immediately upon arriving she starts complaining because we aren't going to be able to sit where she wants to sit.... Had we been on time she could have sat where she wanted.  This was a minor annoyance, but an annoyance none the less.  The rest of the night we sat around and I watched everyone else drinking and having a good time.  My wife had a few White Claws through the night.  She rarely drinks because someone has to be sober enough to get us home.  I was happy she could relax and have fun without worrying about me.  My wife thanked me for being there and supporting her and even mentioned I looked pale from lack of sleep.  The whole time people are reminding me of years past and how much fun we had while drinking.  I stayed strong because it was the first day of me trying to be sober.  When someone asked why I wasn't drinking my wife replied ""he can't remember parts of conversations we had yesterday so he needs to take some time off"".  I tried not to let it bother me, but way to be supportive and throw my business out there.     

Towards the end of the night as everything was winding down around 10pm one of her coworkers couldn't stand they were so drunk.  There were a few people trying to get this individual into someones car and it looked like they had it under control.  My wife decided to interject us into this situation.  By the time we got him to his house it was after 11pm.  On the way home my wife thanked me for helping out even though I had no say in the matter.  When I mentioned I didn't know why we had to help she reminded me of all the times I needed help.  There were about 4 people helping this guy before she stepped in.  Had I had it my way I would have probably been at home and in bed for about 2 hours had it not been for this.  I have to be at work at 3am.  

As I was driving down my street my wife started complaining that she needed to use the bathroom really bad and didn't know if she could make it the 30 seconds to our house and then proceeded to piss in the seat of my truck.  She got mad at me when I got upset saying it was an accident.  I badly wanted to bring up the fact had we not been involved in the situation from earlier it wouldn't have happened or had she gave a shit how tired I was we would have been home earlier.    

On one hand I am super mad with my wife right now for the events of last night.  On the other hand I'm upset that the whole night she's talking about people drinking and looking like they are having a good time, but when I do the same she says I have a problem.  It's a double standard and infuriating to me.  It makes me feel like why am I even trying to do this.  Right now I just want to go home and drink and bury all of this deep down, but that would mean letting myself down.  I feel like I'm in a lose lose situation and I don't know what to do.

I am determined to continue the rest of this month sober.

I'm just going to get back on the damn train track and go in a better direction this time.

I've gone back and forth in my mind so much about what signifies if I truly have a problem or not. I don't drink everyday. I haven't gotten in trouble with the law. But it does affect my work, relationships, health, mental health etc. when I do drink. Someone once told me its not how often you drink but HOW you drink, and man that really resonated.

I fell. I was rude, and then passed out. I knew it could happen. I followed all the safest practices and asked for help. Was still a total asshole. I was talking to my sister about how it feels like russian roulette, and she asked me why I was still playing. So, I have decided to unload the gun. I asked my husband to get all the booze out of the house. He has agreed to go a total 365 with me. We have made commitments in the past, but we are bad influences on eachother sometimes. 12/6 is gonna be our thing. We are gonna count the days. We have canceled our plans over the holidays because we KNOW its gonna be a big drinking holiday. We are going to have a cocoa party instead and bring sparkling cider for a special christmas dinner treat. We have committed to 365, but honestly we are kinda flirting with the idea of forever. I have NEVER regretted NOT drinking. And I am genuinely really excited to be sober and clear with my best friend in the world. 
It doesnt matter if I am an alcoholic. I DESERVE to be sober.

I’m, shock and almost horror, eight days sober. Which is kind of a miracle in and of itself, but also somewhat imposed/required since I had surgery (holy shit time passes fast). I could have been drinking though, wouldn’t have been advised, but nothing specifically has been preventing me. Other than I’d get drunk and potentially do more than I should and fuck up some sutures (or body super glue as the case may be) and totally ruin the good thing that I had going. Details right? Haha. I jest. 

I think a huge contributing factor is that I’ve been around someone day and night. I drink due to boredom and loneliness a lot. After work I don’t have much to do, or I do much but still, the drink calls, as loneliness increases, and I just give in. Having someone in my life in such a continuous way has been helpful for the above and a distraction since I really can’t do much, for quite a while. 

I’ve missed the companionship of a relationship ever since my wife walked out on me and the following divorce. My somewhat mostly kind of moderate drinking turned into drinking to distract and all night partying to stay out of being alone, to moving and drinking with people and getting sloppy until they distanced themselves, to facing reality and my mental illnesses that I’d run so hard from and subsequently drinking heavily in secret and by myself. And here we are...

I was offered a drink last night though, and declined. It wasn’t my drink of choice though. I’m not a big wine fan, never have been. I watched her drink and was pretty alright with it. Didn’t have any major cravings. I mean, I kind of wanted to be on her level but I wasn’t really upset about it. 

Here’s the deal though: I don’t feel like a million bucks just because I cut out drinking. My sleep is maybe a bit better. I wake up a bit perkier. But that’s all true of my usual one or two days of sobriety after a binge. My mental/emotional state isn’t vastly improved. My face isn’t less puffy and my eyes aren’t clearer. My weight is the same and so is my belly. I still need to lose the 10/15lbs I’ve drank into myself. I guess I’m just not seeing the benefits. Certainly not those that people have been touting on here. 

And it’s saddening, and frustrating and makes me wonder what all the fuss is and why I’m even doing this. I know it’s healthier but, I just don’t see the short term or interim benefits. Sigh. 

Don’t know what I’m looking for here. Just venting I guess. Maybe someone can relate or tell me what the greater good is here. IWNDWYT.

TL;DR: Had surgery, been sober for eight days, surrounded by someone who makes me feel less lonely which is a big trigger, don’t have a lot of cravings or need, BUT I’m seeing no real benefits either, none of the short term that’s for sure. So what gives?",2

2019-12-06 12:03:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e71e01/words_of_encouragement/,Words of encouragement,"I dont remember what being hungover feels like. I didnt get enough sleep the other night and it was the closest thing in recent memory that even compared. My co-workers come in hungover and I see it on them. The tired eyes, the slow movements, the compensatory eating, the sluggishness, the shame spiral, the regret, the wish to wash it away with another drink, the cycle they are trapped in, the brain fog, and the self-doubt. Like a hamster on a wheel. 

Ive noticed that when i go out with ppl who are drinking, they need to warm up. Get a few drinks in them before they can relax. Before they can dance like a fool to that song. To laugh loudly without reproach. To make friends with strangers. To listen to another pain or talk about their own. To flirt. As if socialization requires this performing enhancing drug before it can commence. And at first, it works. They are talkative, open, and welcoming. They arent wrapped so tight, they have uncrossed thier arms. They smile without thought, and forget why they are drinking in the first place. Life comes, and they roll with it. But if you stay around long enough, after the first two drinks, you see that freedom begin to wear on them. It becomes the rope they use to hang themselves. There is a point that the damn they thought they could selectively let, gives way completely, and the water flows without restriction. The emotional blockage floods the town, inundating their present. The things they came to forget are drowning them, surrounded on all sides by thier own reflection. The self they wanted to change is staring them in the face. 

People begin to lash out, because they remember that life is painful, and that the numbness they sought has a cost. After the initial loss of feeling, thier is a rush to the nervous system. They thought they had turned it off, when it was only muted, and the inattention has left it angry and vengeful. I feel like people use alchohol to hide from themselves. But you cant outrun your own shadow. You cannot detach selevetively from your experiences. You are and always will be, you. I used to seek shelter from my emotional storm in a bottle, thinking I could just wait it out, stay in place until it passed. Turn my back on it. Sober, I am not scared to face my self. I dont shy away from whats hard. Im not intimidated by own doubt, denial, and darkness. I dont back down when the monster inside me slithers out of its cave. I stay and i fight. I stay and I feel. I stay and I find answers. I stay. I stand my ground. I do not surrender.

Firmly in my own skin, I see the smiles turn into tears, the laughs turn into screams, and the magic turns into the mundane. That tipping point in the night, when it just isnt fun anymore. When it goes south. They cry about something they dont care abuot, fight with someone they dont know, and are preoccupied by things that arent happening. They realize what they needed was a good night sleep, not another round. They remeber, its never worth it. I will never forget that.

Sober, I have been able to accept my faults and work on them, instead of ignore it all. Ive found courage and embraced chaos, because I am always in control. I accept what i am and what i am not. I try and care about everything and everyone. I dont regret a day of it, and I am thankful. In my addiction i set myself on fire, burned from the inside out. The heat was cleansing and it cleared the way for who I was to become. I grew out of the ashes of the person I was. I was left with fertile ground, ripe with possbibilities. I am a product of my past. The scars on my skin, evidence I have been lived in. I have lived many lives and been many people, a shapeshifter with a survivors spirit. 

 If you arent where you want to be, it doesnt mean you wont get there. If you arent succeeding, it doesnt mean you wont. If it isnt easy, it doesnt mean it wont be one day. Every setback, a setup for a comeback.  Every small change, every attempt, every time you fail, you get a little closer. You build that muscle and clear that path. Its ok to be discouraged and angry. Its ok to miserable. Its ok to wish you were different, someone who could drink ""normally"". Its ok to feel like an imposter. Its ok to make mistakes, and fall back into old patterns. Its ok for it to take longer than you hoped. It takes time to build the person you want to be. Its ok to be scared and unsure. Its ok to not know. Its ok for it be hard, and to wish you were someone else. Its ok to be tired and dispondent. Its ok to want to drink, or to give in to the urge. Its ok to be jelaous and insecure. Its ok to feel uncomforable. All I hope for anyone is that you dont give up. Dont settle for a mediocracy. It me years to like myself and a millenia to find mental stability. Dont be discouraged by your own doubts. Beligerent and blind, belieive in a better life.",10

I failed last night, and likely will a couple times more this weekend. Stress is just.. high. I know that's not an excuse, but I'm honestly at a loss as for what to do with it, and drinking myself to death helps. 

I want to quit. I've been trying for months. I've gotten worse while trying.. I quit drinking liquor all together, which is nice. Now it's just beer. I probably drink less alcohol overall, but the problem still remains. I can't believe I've been in this dance with alcohol for an entire year..",6

To make myself not feel or forget how much my ptsd can be triggered by the person I was with. It isn't really a question of who is at fault for last nights argument (I really am pretty sure it was a little of both of us), it's just insane to me that all these years later without any real threat present my body goes into full ""this person is going to hurt me"" mode and I am just stuck with it and the resulting hypervigilance. I am safe. My ex would and has never hurt me. It was a stupid argument and I am not even sure what it was other than we were HAVING an argument that made me have such a flashback response (about 6 years ago I was with someone who was very volatile and physically abusive, and I grew up with a mom who had some serious issues). I still just kinda wanna cry about it... But I also realized last night that as much as I hate being stuck in my body when its hijacked like that, being stoned over the last 8 years has meant I have never learned to cope with it. I have never spent a night in my body like I did last night. While it sucked, this morning I also feel a sense of power. If I can get through that, I can do so much more and I know it.

Uneven terrain. It feels symbolic to end my racing year the way I started it: doing something unfamiliar just to see if I can. 

This year, I've shed body weight; 56 lbs as of today. I've also shed the weight of expectations and living by the rules of others. I've stopped sitting on the sidelines watching others do what I wanted to do and got up and joined them. 

Before all of this, I spent too many mornings sitting on my patio, cigarette and coffee in hand, nursing a monster hangover, promising myself this would be the last time. On weekend mornings, I would watch runners on the Trail right outside my back door and feel a longing to join them and a sadness because I didn't know how. I'd drink again to drown out that longing. 

And then last December, I signed up for a 50K challenge; 10 5Ks over the course of a year. I also became vegan that same week. The saying ""you change when that feels more comfortable than staying the same"" is true. I had a come to Jeebus moment, staring in the mirror and knowing I couldn't stay where I was anymore or I'd not survive. 

My first race was underground. I showed up, grabbed my packet, stared at the chip timers that needed to go on my shoes and asked someone for help. I lined up, waited for the signal and started running. I told myself ""Just 20 mins. You only have to run for 20 minutes""  20 minutes never felt so long in my life. But I ran 20 minutes and then walked/ran the rest. It took me 49 minutes to finish my 5K .

The second race was after a snowstorm. It was below zero. I had no idea how to dress but knew how to put the chip timer on my shoe. Before the race, I told myself I should go home. There'd be other races. But a stronger voice told me to go. All I had to do was finish. 

That's how running saved my life. Me giving myself permission to do my best, whatever that looked like. I just had to finish. 

That's how I got to the point where I could run a 5K, then 10K, 15K and tomorrow,  a 10 mile trail run.  I told myself ""You just have to show up and finish"" 

I ran with my ghosts and that is where I let go.  I let go of a mom who hurt me and told me I wasnt worth anything. Where I let go of an ex who hurt me and brought me to depths of grief I never thought possible. Running is where I reclaim my body, my spirit, my voice.  

I told my therapist that running is where I found MY story.  Not anyone else's story of me. Mine.  And it's a beautiful story. 

I share this not for kudos. I share it so you can ask yourself: what has you on the sidelines, watching? Does it stir your heart? If so, can you give yourself 20 minutes of uncertainty and fear to step onto the Trail and try something new? 

Where I am now didn't just happen. As my therapist tells me ""I built this shit"" Not every run is good. Not every race is a PR. But every time I show up and finish, I won.

Tomorrow, as I complete my 25th race of 2019 by  tackling 1883 ft of elevation and an unknown course, I finally stop running with ghosts. I'm letting them go. And telling myself, as often as necessary ""All you have to do is finish"" 

Running is my love story to myself. What's yours?",57

So glad that I was there sober and present. Two years ago I almost missed something similar around this time of year, because I was out getting drunk at a work function, and thought about ditching the kids Xmas play so i could stay out and pour more poison into my body- which I didn’t do. But went half drunk and can’t really remember it.

I sure as hell remember tonight and the one last year!!! I prayer that I will remember the one next year as well..

This time of year is very tricky for me- cause there is free flowing alcohol everywhere I look.

But I will be strong and not drink as I really, really, really don’t want to go back to be the person I was.

Be strong sober friends!!!",7

-felt much less social anxiety

-no itch to break a good convo to get another drink

-was able to follow conversations and take social cues, and remain on topic better

-At the end of the night, got invited to after-party (I live farther away so one person’s claim was it would give me time to sober up, hahaha).  I was flattered for the invite but blew their mind when I said I hadn’t been drinking :)

-saved all those extra alcohol calories for other indulgent treats

-relaxed sober drive home, no risk of drunk driving catastrophe or the associated stress

-no hangover this morning, ready for a productive day at work!

-my wife is surely proud and relieved.

-most impactful (maybe): I didn’t have the one drink that might have triggered a weeks/months long shit-show of gradually drinking more, and sneaking it back into other parts of my life where alcohol has no F-ing business.

Thanks for being here. SD community has been a great inspiration.  I hope you all crush your own holidays sober as well! IWNDWYT",101

but I didn’t and I’m so happy. I was anxious about how awkward I’d be. 

 I’m a remote employee for my company and don’t know 90 percent of the people there. Even my connection to the people on my team is a little... strange, because I typically see them in person maybe once a year, even if I’m in fairly regular contact. 

The office party is an open bar deal at a REALLY nice venue and the company culture is pretty hard-drinking, so this was the one event I was stressing about being sober through. My boss was surprised to see me sans gin and tonic. 

But I made it and oddly, I almost felt a little tipsy just off the crowd lol. I wasn’t even the only sober person there: someone at my table was also abstaining. I chatted with my teammates, mixed it up with some new faces, laughed, even danced a little bit. All 100 percent sober. All my worries turned out to be a paper tiger. 

I’m up at 6am the day after feeling good, and really proud of myself. I said nothing gratuitously stupid under the influence, I don’t have that gnawing sense of dread to pay back, and I don’t feel like a bloated whale. 

If I could do that sober, there is nothing I can’t handle.

I was bedridden for two days and have reluctantly been out and about for two more but still not 100%

Last night some friends invited me out for drinks and I decided I was tired of being sick - I’ll go out!

Normally at times like this I would have a hot whisky to clear the nose and give me a kick - and I very nearly did. I thought “it’s medicinal so it’s ok”, “it’ll just be the one”, “I deserve this because I’m sick”.

Aaaaaaand then I didn’t. It’s so easy to believe the crazy lies we tell ourselves when that addiction voice creeps in, but we don’t have to listen to it. 

Today I am still not quite right. But I’m not hungover. And that’s fine by me.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

US—Night/Early Morning

Europe—Morning

Asia and Australia—Evening/Night

I feel great and I don't want to let it go. I've been out regularly during this time just sipping pineapple juice and tonic water and honestly it was great, even had a blast dancing like crazy.

Tonight though is the usual Friday bender where all my colleagues go to drink on a terrace and order buckets after buckets. I wasn't planning to go anymore but I feel like hanging with some of these people that I don't get to see often. I know for a fact I won't drink anything but I'm a bit anxious it's going to be awkward. After one hour there people will be too drunk to notice anything anyway I guess but I kind of apprehend the first hour or so as there's nothing to hide and everyone has beer glasses on the table.

2019-12-06 01:31:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e6uxk3/i_think_about_apples/,I think about apples.,"My local supermarket has a healthy variety - Pink Ladys, Granny Smith, Fujis, Gala's, Golden and Red Delicious, Braeburn - Honeycrisp, the objection of my affection if I have any. Sometimes I like to just stand there and drink in the rich reds and soft yellows, and think about the various combinations of sweet and tart. Think about the texture and taste, and the way they feel in my mouth, and the pleasing feeling of apple juices running down my cheeks when I eat them.

I have to think about things like that. The liquor section is so desperately close, and it feels like torture. I made fruits and vegetables - my health - a centerpiece of my recovery. I wanted to eat right. I wanted to take care of myself. I couldn't undo the damage, but I could mitigate it's long term effects. 

But once a week I stand there, admiring the labors of strangers, trying desperately to keep myself away. My finances are in order. I live alone. I have an excess of privacy... and it'd be easy to go back. So easy. So comfortable.

I could get back into parties. They happen every weekend in my college town, and I see them float across my snapchat. I could get into bars. Meet my peers, spend time with them outside of school. See people. 

I could feel the warmth. I miss the warmth so bad. Even now as I type this, I think about it. When it's cold, I shudder, and feel a pain deep in my chest. I'm sure there's a reason, but it feels like only started after I stopped. It feels hollow. No more hollow than I did before I stopped... but no less either.

I'm lonely. I'm so desperately lonely. I feel it constantly - a canyon between myself and other people my age. I can't have fun like them. Not anymore. I can't relate the experiences of my youth. I can't talk about my daily habits or explain my thought patterns or not be a person who is desperately trying to not drink every day. It keeps me distant. It isolates me.

But I could go back. I've had a single sip of a beautiful, delicious, whiskey since I swore off the creature. An expensive bottle I bought for a close friend. It was a golden honey color. It flowed smooth from bottle to snifter, and it was mesmerizing watching the ice-cubes in his drink slur gently around the curves of the glass. It was erotic. It smelled heavenly. I'm not sure why, but I needed a sip - and I took one. It slipped down so easily. I long for the taste in ways I can't describe - thank god it was expensive, or I might have bought another bottle in that moment.

I cried, later on that night. I wanted to be young again. I wanted to be firing back beers and eradicating handles of sangria and drinking whiskey in bed and waiting until after I'd had my morning beer to brush my teeth so no one would know I'd been drinking at 8 am. I wanted to go back, so desperately. I'm writing this because I know that if I'm being honest with myself - I'll never be happy, but it's more fun to be unhappy and drunk than unhappy and sober.

But I'm here. It's been 1 year, 5 months, and 1 day. Every morning I wake up I fear it might be the last. 

So I stand in the supermarket, examining apples for imperfections. Thinking about their taste. Thinking about how much I'll enjoy eating them. Thinking about skateboarding to the interior of campus with a honeycrisp, and slicing off chunks to share with the squirrels. 

Because I can't let myself think about anything else.

(I don't need any advice or consolation - but I wanted to share my feelings with a community that might understand them. I'm on a good path, but it feels cathartic to embrace and admit the challenges that I - that we, face everyday. As always - I'm glad to be not drinking with the rest of you today. Thank you.)",57

(my story),"23 years old currently going through outpatient recovery for alcohol. I have substance abuse issues, mostly with alcohol but also some other substances. Also going through therapy to get a mental health diagnosis, depression possibly borderline personality, currently going through DBT and chemical depency therapy as well.

When I was 18, I left my home and left the religion I was raised in (Mormon). I lost most of my high school friends in response to me leaving, and decided to move to Portland and start a new life. While the move did help me distance myself from my past. I let alcohol and other drugs take a hold of my brain. I became an addict. 

while I had and went to a lot of parties, met a lot of cool people and made some lifelong friends, I really let things get the best of me, especially alcohol. I was blacking out, waking up with my house a wreck, things on the front porch and broken, ran my bike into a tree and scraped my knee and elbow really bad. I also blacked out at a concert, while I was walking back from the bathroom I believe and then I fell going up the stairs and literally scraped my face, hands and knees incredibly bad, and I have scars as proof unfortunately. 


I think the reason I waited so long to give up alcohol because deep down I knew that I needed to, and once I quit there is a good chance that I can never drink again. now that I have taken that step I can move forward, and not hold myself back. it lets me look and myself and assess situations a lot better and with a clear mind.

 I am almost at my one month mark and just thinking about the road ahead... it's gonna be a long one. I am very committed to maintaing my sobriety and this time I'm not going about it myself. I'm optimistic about the future. thanks for all your awesome and inspiring stories.",6

I am a 28 y/o male and have been lurking around here for a while. I thought I would add my own story even though it hasn't been that long. My average week normally consisted of drinking about 24-36 beers.

I recently decided to stop drinking due to the following reasons:
- Mental health. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for a while and do not want to continue using anti-depressants as they come with quite a few side effects.
- Relationships. I feel I have been neglecting relationships with my family and friends because I would rather be at home alone drinking.
- Health. A recent blood test showed elevated enzymes. I am guessing this means that I have done some damage and I am following this up with more tests in the next few weeks.

Since stopping, I have realized some pretty substantial changes:
- My sleep patterns have mostly returned to normal.
- Anxiety has come down so much that I am wondering if it was the alcohol causing it in the first place.
- Family are very supportive and relieved that I am making positive changes.
- Some friends are not being that great about it, however once I explained the reasons for quitting, they are understanding.
- Way more time to do other stuff!
- My skin is hydrated and looks way better. Eyes are also not bloodshot anymore.
- Weight loss. I have gone from almost 86kg (190lbs) to less than 82kg (180lbs) without making any other major changes.

I would like to thank this subreddit for all the advice and positive vibes, without it, it would be a much harder journey. For anyone else on the fence about quitting as well, I would recommend the book ""The Naked Mind"" by Annie Grace, it has also helped immensely.

Onwards and upwards! IWNDWYT!

It’s a housewarming party for someone I don’t know very well, and I would only know the friend I’m going with. I definitely feel like I would want to drink in order to feel brave enough to talk to people I don’t know. Also, the girl who owns the new house works for a liquor distributor, so she always has tons of free booze. I feel bad for lying to my friend, but I think I made the right call. Did/does anyone else experience avoiding social situations in the early days of sobriety?",3

The impulsive “awwww shit”decision that keeps happening despite every indication that it’s not adding ANYTHING positive to my life whatsoever. 
Thankfully lately there have been more and more sober days where the desire just isn’t there. Which is baby step progress but the constant relapsing is SO discouraging because I just don’t want booze in my life anymore. So why do I have Stockholm syndrome when it comes to my habits? 🤦🏼‍♀️


The excuses, moderation fallacies, legal trouble: it’s blatant. But my goofy brain still manages to convince me sometimes that one drink isn’t going to hurt. ARGH! I remember when I used to pat myself on the back for forcing myself to fake normal drinking habits- now EVERY drink feels like failure. Every sip is guilt ridden. So why would I continue to associate booze with relaxation, celebration, or decompression ? 
I got through thanksgiving with my dysfunctional family completely sober. (White knuckling, video games and chain smoking) 

 Once I road tripped home I felt surviving that holiday was excruciating and gave in against my better judgement. 
Nothing crazy, just two beers but I know with me that level of  self control won’t be consistent. 

After streaks of short term sobriety the dreaded itch comes back. But when I give in I ALWAYS regret it. Not to mention my tolerance isn’t impressive anymore so two drinks can give me a massive hang over. 

LONG STORY SHORT: This is kinda a selfish rant but Your girl is struggling.  I don’t wanna waste any more time so here’s to starting over again. Please wish me luck. And no matter how much time you have under your belt : IM SO PROUD OF YOU and y’all are super inspiring. I won’t be drinking with you tonight.",57

I said to myself it's over, the alcohol, as I have so many times before. Bad timing really as on the thurs I had a work Christmas dinner and dance I'd already paid for and couldn't really back out of. It would have been easy to have said start the morning after it. But I didn't want to delay. Spent the day deciding whether to cancel, go and not drink... or go and drink. I decided to take the car and not drink. My friends looked shocked as I said I was on doctor's orders to stop for 2 weeks for gastric reflux (which I have), told me to ditch the car and start the next day. They had been waiting for me to come and were expecting the usual hard drinking, humour and dancing. They joked that as I wasn't drinking I'd be the creepy guy who spikes people's drinks and have the car to bundle them into. I joked, danced, ate 2 desserts and sipped my coke as they all drank. From thinking I would leave after the meal I stayed for 4 hours as I was having  fun. The cravings were fleeting. Thing is I could have slipped off early to drink in my house, no work in the morning but I didn't  want to... tonight at least. Wouldn't have planned to put myself in this situation so early on but it was easier and more enjoyable than I thought it would be.",12

I'm fairly active though; going to the gym almost every day (25 times a month). I don't really see a point in NOT drinking as it makes my schizophrenia and depression come to a halt, for only a certain amount of time that is. I enjoy going to the liquor store as well.

I have read horror stories about the court system and I chucked it up to people not taking responsibility. Well I have posted about my aggravation but what an eye opener...no one in the court system or the resources provided that you must pay for and adhere to support success especially if you are low on finances.

So, the counselor I see once a month (mandatory) is 65  a month for 16 visits. I also see him in a group setting at 65.00 a week. If you miss it is a 80 fee no exceptions. Random UAs at 35. SOOO, I have random ua's to test for alcohol, a scram bracelet that is beyond horrendous at 300 for a month that detects alcohol AND the iterlock that detects Alcohol..so, 3 things that all test for the same thing..at hundreds of dollars. The counselor even agreed it was overkill...so you have daytime counseling sessions. Expected AA. Daytime PO appointments. NO car at times...Daytime DMV appointments. Daytime Court and pay thousands (I am over 10 and only 3400 was lawyer)...so they have it so you fail. Miss appointments bc of no car (can't afford all the requirements), no money to pay for appointments, and then they tack on all these extra fees. I have to pay 40 bucks or 50 for insurance to complete community service hours. It is set up for you to relapse and fail and that my friends is very sad for all those in need of help and want change but don't have 20 grand to spare. If you didn't hurt anyone and it's your first time offense, let help and support each other with consequences and requirement but don't have it so one fails. Imagine the stress..so people loose jobs and or are so stressed they go back to drinking or drugs and BAM it starts over. Very discouraging.",8

I feel great! Have been going to the gym, eating better, and reading! There has been some close calls these past 30 days with cravings and bad days and boredom but I've made it one month (my longest since I've been consciously trying to get sober all the way in May). I also juul and understand the health risks and want to/need to quit. It just fills up my bored time and I think I have like a need for oral stimulation (definitely not diagnosed but ever since I was a kid I've bitten my nails, chewed on pencils, then turned to smoking), and obviously I like the feel of nicotine.

 I've been juuling since about Feburary of this year, and from about 22-23 I smoked Hookah once or twice every 3 ish days. I took about 8 months off smoking anything and stupidly picked up the Juul to give me something to do while I was sober (it just added smoking to my drinking problem lol). Anyway this is a long winded way of asking if I should even bother trying to stop smoking so early in my sobriety. I understand sobriety in the early days is a full-time gig and I don't want to impede on that progress, but I also don't want to get sick or cancer from juuling.",1

I decided not to go. It caused some issues with my spouse because he also did not go (because of me) SO GLAD I made that call. Here is what a friend who went just sent me in a text:,"“Going to that show on Sunday got me fucking sick. I'm glad you didn't go. Everyone smelled like shit and was so gross.”

I didn’t need the validation but I needed it. I was feeling bad given my spouse did not go because of me. But I know in my heart and in my mind it was the right thing to do.

I am also learning that there is a learning curve when choosing the path of sobriety. It takes adjustment, understanding and support from all. I am learning as I go.

Just wanted to share because I know how hard it is. I almost caved, almost ordered a drink at lunch that day to “get me in the mood” but I didn’t and as a result I am here 33 days sober  and counting.

Looking back at my drinking years I realize now I'd been living life on hard mode.  I was a poor sleeper, unmotivated at work, and all the alcohol had caused me to balloon up to 225 lbs (I'm 5'11"" btw and I didn't carry the weight well).

In the last three years I've:

* Saved more than $20000 from not drinking.  
* Used the momentum from quitting drinking to start regularly working out.  Consequently I'm in the best shape of my life.  When I made my one year post I said I'd lost 60 pounds.  I'm the same weight now that I was then, but with significantly more muscle mass.  People notice.
* Building on the alcohol savings my wife and I reformed our spending, and now we're looking at a very comfortable retirement.  We still enjoy travel, hobbies, etc...
* I'm better at my job - I got promoted in my first year sober and recently was able to convince my employer to (mostly) pay for my Master's.  That would have been impossible while I was drinking.

**For those just starting out:**  It does get easier but my suggestion is you BUILD on your sobriety.  AA talks about how alcoholism is a progressive disease - and it is.  Sobriety is easier if it's progressive too - keep building on it and it's easier to maintain.",240

The sound of a can being opened.. YES!
And the sound of the head fizzing inside my glass....
And the tickle in my tongue as the familiar, cold elixir slowly soothes the pain in my head and my heart....
I know it’s wrong.
I know it’s not fair.

2019-12-05 15:25:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e6n0lu/xmas_party_temptations/,Xmas Party Temptations.,"Hey everyone!

After half a year sober I started browsing this sub. I’ve lurked a bit, but never posted anything, but now at 428 days or 14 months if you will, I just had my first proper scare that I can’t really share with my friends. Or as the joker would say: they wouldn’t get it.  


I quit drinking last October cause I got hammered at a work party. I’d long had bad habits and had been drinking way too much anyway, but missing work the day after because I woke up 15:00 and not remembering anything, in addition to being hungover for three days ruined me.   


Today was the Christmas party. There was food and drink at work before everyone was supposed to go to a booked fancy bar. I thought this’d be easy since I’ve been out for a beer with friends before, drinking non-alcohol, I’d be fine! I quickly came to understand just how different these two situations are. It started alright, but I quickly became distracted while trying to hold conversation. Beer bottles, open and unopened all around me, the smell of alcohol on people’s breath as I mingle like fish in a barrel.   


The peer pressure I put on myself is sometimes worse than that from others, the thought-process that maybe I could have a bit, even though I don’t think I would....unless? A bit like a cat freaking out at a laser show, but not being able to be damaged by it. I started gradually freaking out.   


As people were getting ready to head out to the bar, I got my jacket, said a couple “goodbye, don’t have too much fun” and excused myself. Leaving felt like completing that last sprint of a run that you didn't think you'd be able to run.  


I think it’s easy to be confident in the time you’ve gone without drinking, but be it the person on day one or year 1, and everyone trying to stop, it’s ok to admit that if you don’t want to play with or even be close to the fire, you’re allowed to take a step back. Most of the time you’re the only one that knows what you’re comfortable with and today, as uncomfortable as it was to admit, I was not up to the challenge. I'm slightly dreading the questions tomorrow of where I went, why I wasn't at the bar, etc, but I'll manage.  


I’m on my way home now, I've picked up some strawberry milk and plan to game death stranding the rest of the evening. I'll be going to work sober tomorrow and I choose to see that as a small victory nonetheless!  


Thanks for reading my little rant. IWNDWYT!",6

It needed to happen because I was sliding down a slippery slope. Something bad was going to happen eventually. DUI. Accident. Something. Trying to keep it to weekends only wasn't working (bring home a bottle of wine Thursday turned into Tuesday pretty quick). Moderate weekend drinking wasn't working either. I drove a few times when I should not have (one time recently I backed into a tree turning around damaging my truck....I don't remember it. My wife informed me the next day). I have had an easier time of it that I imagined. I couldn't fathom my life without alcohol. It just was a part of who I was and what I did. But I just flipped a mental switch and, so far, I've made it thru dinners out with friends, football tailgates and Thanksgiving. All places and times I would have drank a bunch. Currently I'm in the middle of a Carribean vacation which normally is a drunken free for all. But I've held firm and stayed the course. This trip worried me but (not so) funny story: last flight leg here was a small prop plane to the island. A 30ish female was so cocktailed she passed out in her seat. The stewardess could not revive her. It was like she was dead. The plane, on it's way to taking off, turned around and she was kicked off once she eventually came around. Set us back 45 mins. But what a visual reminder of the downsides of drinking to excess! And right on cue. So for everyone who thinks it can't be done...I respectfully say if I can do this pretty much anyone can. Besides reading Allen Carr as well as a 'Naked Mind' one other thing that I did that could be helpful...I had an inexpensive bracelet made with 10-27-19 engraved on it. I wear it 24/7. I've earned the days since that date and don't want to give it all back. Just a constant reminder that helps me stay centered. I wish everyone here the best of luck.

Since I started visiting, my progress has been (very!) slow -- but steady.  I'm learning things and soaking up everyone's experiences, and I'm trying new things as I feel better about myself and my decision to be a non-drinker.  Over the past few months, I've gone from drinking 4-5 nights a week to drinking 1 night a week.  I recently had 8 days and it was awesome, but I got freaked out and drank on Sunday night.  I drink to numb sad or uncomfortable feelings and emotions.  The things that helped me are pretty apparent, so here's my plan:

* **I don't love AA...but I have a lot of friends there.**  And I like going out after.  I'm in NYC so there are a gazillion meetings to go to.  I've got nothing to lose.  Even if I go and sit in the back it's helpful.  I'm doing a 90 in 90 starting today.  (NOTE - that's just me!  Y'all do your own thing, I know AA posts can get hairy in here.  At this point I'm neither for or against.  Consider me Switzerland for now.)
* **Therapy has been amazing**.  Started 2 months ago.  My therapist has a very calm, compassionate, but firm approach. Learning a lot about why I feel the way I feel (which is related to why and how I drink.)  Working on some meditation homework this week.
* **Picking up the phone has been huge**.  Calling people when I have drink urges - specifically people who don't drink / are sober - is so effective.  Talking through the craving works.  Sometimes the phone feels like a 500lb brick.  But it isn't.  
* **Make plans.**  Don't work from home all day and not have anyone to see / anything to do later.  Have a life.  Don't isolate in the apartment all day and all night.  No social plan = ""fuck it - let's go to the bar.""  
* **Gym.**  3 days a week.  I have a free membership and I'm not going.
* **Read good books** (or listen...Nikki Sixx reading his Heroin Diaries has been super good for me.)
* **SD kicks ass.**  Need I say more?

So that's it, guys.  Stepping it up.",6

I am an alcoholic, there is no denying that. I've known it since I was 19 and in college, and now I am 30. I have gone many times without, even graduated college on time sober. But it has been a cycle that is hard for me to break. I will go 6-9 months, no problem fully abstaining, but eventually I will convince myself that I can control it better this time and will for a period of time. 2 drinks a week isnt hard to manage, until one day it is.

I am married and have 2 young kids. I have hit this same bottom with them around several times, but I dont know how to break this cycle. I have tried AA and the steps and it helps for a time, but I end up frustrated because of that little voice in my head that seems to get louder the longer I tell him no. That same voice chimes in anytime I'm at a restaurant, a grocery store, even a gas station where I can pick up a six pack and the only person there to stop me is myself. I've explained this to others who aren't alcoholics and they dont seem to understand. I always get the same response, just dont buy it or dont go to those places in the evening, etc. I know recovering alcoholics who have 30+ years sober and their response is sympathetic, but essentially the same.  Or they will say ""call me when you get the urge"", but I can't call everytime i stop at the store.

But it's not that easy. Because eventually, that little voice will catch me off guard, or will get me on a weak day where I have something to celebrate or to mourn over. And I will listen and think, I've done 2 drinks a week for a long time in the past without a problem, the problem is knowing when I wont be able to stop, but i can do that now. And I'll pick up the 6 pack, and think I can control this.

I am back on day 1 today.  I am trying something new, I want to have a solid plan for me in the future.  This is my first step. And I want this to be my last step before relapse, to have something that documents my frustration now, when I think I'm ready to give in to that little voice, so that hopefully one day when I am weak, I can remember and be stronger.  I want to be stronger and for it to be as easy as others think it should be.

Thank you for letting me vent. I know this wont magically fix everything but it helps me now, and will hopefully help me in the future.

Edit:  Thanks to the comments and thoughts.  I am wrapping up day 1 and still have a lot more self reflection to do. But I am in a much better head space from when I woke up this morning.  Taking things one day at a time.  Thank you all for listening.",3

What's scaring me is the social pressure from my friends and family, as everyone in my life is a moderate to heavy drinker. Every social occasion has a huge component of alcohol, particularly during the holidays. I don't want to isolate myself and be a shut in during my favorite time of year, and I'm really looking forward to spending time with my friends in NOLA, but it is intimidating to think about all of the situations I'm going to have to navigate and be strong through. 

The devious alcoholic voice in the back of my head keeps whispering that I can moderate and just have a few drinks here and there, but I know that is a lie. I'm already a pickle and I have rediscovered time and time again that I can't just have one or two.

I'm so excited for sobriety, but scared of what the future holds and how my will is going to be tested. Right now it's one day at a time but I know for sure IWNDWYT! I'm so thankful for this wonderful and supportive community, and I know I probably wouldn't even be at 5 days without you.",3

I’m a 20 year old college student (also bisexual), and my drinking has only become a serious problem in the past year. I’ve always been a sort of binger, but so were all of my friends! However, this past year, as my anxiety and depression increased, so did my frequency and amount of drinking. I would drink almost everyday, and on weekend id blackout almost every night. Last year, my friends had to prevent me from making an attempt on my life, and this year, they weren’t able to prevent me (both happened while I was drunk). I had to spend a night in the suicide prevention room and my parents had to pick me up. I then took a break from drinking, but slowly fell back into the binge drinking. However, this past week, I was confronted my roommate and closest friend and they both told me this wasn’t working, and that I wasn’t being a good friend/roommate and the binge drinking was hurting them. That’s when I promised that I would take a month long break. I made that promise to show them I can change and that I don’t want to keep being this toxic person. I might not pass my classes, but I’m excited to attempt to better my mental health. I don’t plan on quitting drinking forever, however I need to learn how to moderate.

Friday Night / Weekends are my Achilles heel. I thought i would share a helpful thing that has kept me on the right path over the last several weekends and during my 5 day vacation (usually it would be a 5 day bender). The show Intervention.

I mostly pick the ones involving alcohol, but all of them are helpful. It's such a great reminder of the consequences if i pick up another drink. It always reminds me of the reasons i quit. It reminds me, the many shameful things i did while drunk, how my behavior looks on the outside, the long term consequences, how it affects my family etc. Every time my mind works to justify ""just today"" i put on the show and it brings right back the reasons why I quit  to the forefront. It's been very very helpful.

I hope this helps someone as well, i thought i would share. Hulu has a bunch of episodes and you can find a lot of them posted on youtube as well. IWNDWYT",4
2019-12-05 12:46:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e6ko8w/a_win_for_me/,A win for me :),"I had to attend a work function, networking type thing last night. I live in wine country and am literally surrounded on all sides by vineyards and wineries. So naturally this event was held at a winery. Free sparkling wine on entry and two tickets shoved into my hand for complimentary drinks. I WALKED BY FREE CHAMPAGNE (I'm on day 21) I have never done that in my adult life. Like, never. I asked the bartender for a soda water...he sort of cocked his head at me and smiled and said 

""No problem, but give me a second, it's in the back bc no one ever asks for it!""

I Wandered the 200+ person event chatting with colleagues and holding my bubble water in my fancy wine glass. TBH I didn't even have a desire to drink. It was the most confusing, glorious moment. 

I started my booze career in my early teens, mostly to deal with social awkwardness and self-consciousness. Perhaps it worked initially but it grew into a whole other vile, destructive monster over the last 20 years. It's interesting  when you wrench the crutches you've subconsciously relied on, mostly out of fear and habit, from your own hands and realize you haven't even needed them for decades. I somehow forgot I wasn't an awkward, self conscious 15 year old anymore. Booze was my safety blanket long after I needed one, and one that I got so entangled in, it almost strangled me to death while I wasn't looking.

Fascinating and illuminating. 

I hope you are all coping well with the various holiday events out there, and I wish you lots of light and love! IWNDWYT!",7

The reason: my sobriety and although I initially felt guilty, I know I've made the right choice. 

Yesterday I was invited to a huge 30th birthday bash for two of my friends. The bash would take place in Atlantic City over the course of a weekend. There would be a ton of drinking and partying. I was pleasantly surprised that I was even invited as I haven't seen either of these friends since I went sober last December. I was so happy and grateful to be included, but I knew I would not be able to attend. It just would not be beneficial to all of the progress I made this last year. I had to tell them, but I felt guilty and anxious doing so. What if they get mad? What if they feel like I'm exaggerating? What if they think I'm just making excuses? I imagine them saying to each other, ""She never even had a problem."" and ""She's just making this up."" and calling me all sorts of names behind my back, but I did it anyway. I politely declined their invite . I told them my sobriety is very important and personal to me. I suggested I take them both out for breakfast for their birthdays instead. I also over explained myself and apologized profusely. 

Being sober can sometimes feel isolating. I don't go out a lot, I avoid old friends I used to drink with, I spend a lot of time going out by myself and trying new hobbies by myself. I don't really talk to anyone about it. In fact, up until today these two particular friends didn't even know about my sobriety. Honestly, no one knew other than my partner until Thanksgiving when I finally told my own family. It's not that I feel ashamed, I just feel like I hid my addictions so well from everyone that none of them even realize I had a problem (if that's even possible).

I do have a problem though, and I have since I was 12 years old. This sobriety is for ME. It's making ME a better person, and allowing ME to have a better life. I refuse to allow the guilt of saying ""no"" hinder my progress. This has always been MY choice, and I'll do whatever it takes to keep making the right choices now. One day I hope that I won't feel like I have defend and apologize for those choices, but for today I am so proud of myself for being honest and saying ""no"".",3

I have a drinking problem. Never told anyone or said that aloud before. I’m ready to quit (Again...) but I’m scared and nervous and alone.

First thoughts of course are rehab/detox or AA. However, I work in a profession where it will be put on my license permanently if I get treatment and will be public knowledge to all. The United States is so unforgiving to those who need help and the fear of judgement and shame and job loss is real. I should be able to seek help without it becoming possible for people to find out openly. 

I know why I drink. Anxiety, boredom, lack of friends or SO. I’ve always had high anxiety and drinking is what I have found to consistently reduce and ward off awful panic attacks. Boredom: I need hobbies, something I’m passionate about. I literally google hobbies and nothing has appealed to me. 

Friends/SO: I’m very outgoing and bubbly and happy around others, I enjoy interacting with others. But I have always had trouble making true genuine connections and I’m in my 30’s, so the true friends I do have are married with kids etc and enjoying their life as they should. SO: I have a guy whom I care deeply about but he lives on another continent and neither of us is ready/willing to move. Not officially together. Because of this I’ve been holding back on even trying to date. 

So I’m at a loss here on how to proceed with little support. I don’t want to get a ding on my license. I’m too scared to trust friends or my dad for fear of judgement, shame, struggling to stop, and always questioning me for my life if I ever drink again. I’m so ashamed of myself. Yet here I sit craving a drink. Any advice or hobbies or ways to find support? Thank you reading.",2

I’ve been on here a lot reading about detox and while I was scared for myself at first I’m over the point where I could be affected.  Though, over thanksgiving my boyfriend drank heavily from morning to night. He drinks everyday and especially hard when home with family. Every time I called him for a week he kept repeating himself and was super drunk and I was concerned then. The last few days he has been home he has been shaky, forgetful, no appetite, breathing heavy, sweating, confused and super irritated. He’s almost left work a few times. He’s convinced he has the flu or some sickness but I can tell this is alcohol withdraw and every time I bring this up it isn’t taken seriously, I mean he actually laughs at how ridiculous I’m being about detox and how both our alcohol intakes are completely out of wack and not normal. Do I give up on trying to explain the dangers? I’m really worried about him. 

I know there have to be others on here who have to relate to trying to be better, and see their partner not want to acknowledge their own problem as well. Should I push or let it go? I’m concerned about us.",3

I totally regret my reset.

tl;dr is I feel like garbage but I hope I can learn a lesson from this at least to reach out instead of withdrawing, and maybe that I need to slow down instead of trying to do too much at once. What follows is my overly detailed relapse story.

I was stressed from making stupid mistakes at my job no matter how hard I try to prevent them, and finals coming up. Then yesterday the boss in our office area strolls through handing out gift cards for Christmas saying ""have a 12 pack on me"" to people. I'm not trying to blame this guy at all, but it is an example of how alcohol culture can be pretty annoying at the worst times.

Then during the last 30 minutes of the work day I developed what I think was a migraine, where I felt sick to my stomach, had a horrible headache, and felt weak in my arms. Had to cancel my one day break from studying to fly virtual planes with my friend. I got home and tried everything to remedy it, finally managed to just fall asleep for an hour or so.

So I went home and tried everything to remedy my migraine, finally just managed to sleep it off for an hour. Then my wife called me (I just remembered, she might be pregnant and this is not a good time, that probably doesn't help) and asked how I was feeling, I said ""well I slept it off"" and she said ""oh, make sure you you may need to take some benadryl or something to get to sleep tonight then.""

So the stage was set where I had enough excuses to drink in my addict brain. I was home alone, feeling upset, wasted part of my day on feeling bad, and I was hungry with nothing I wanted to eat in the house. So I set out to the grocery store to get food and alcohol. 

On the way, I struggled and decided I would actually do the right thing and not drink. I kept thinking I should simply post to the subreddit, tell my wife what I was thinking, call either of the friends who know I'm working through recovery, but I did none of those things. So once I actually got inside, I passed by the alcohol aisle three times before I caved and got some beer.

It wasn't even a good time, alcohol is the worst drug, and I stayed up too late anyway. Now I'm tired, dehydrated, and writing this way too long post. Today is day one, at least for today I am not drinking. I cannot afford to go back to the way things were, financially or otherwise.",3

Or maybe I'm looking for someone with a similar experience?,"I ended up here from [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/e68tzb/lpt_if_you_think_you_have_an_alcohol_addiction/) and I thought this might be a good place to talk to people with similar experiences. 

Let me start by saying I believe I typically drink more than most people, and my primary concern is health based. A ""normal"" week for me would be 2-3 beers or cocktails each day, with two days where I actually drink to the point of intoxication. I know this qualifies medically as problematic. 

I've been this way since college (I'm 36 now), and I usually think ahead on the binge-type nights and mix in water/gatorade/pedilite to avoid hangovers. Only once has my drinking caused any sort of issue, and that was only because I got called into work in an emergency situation when I wasn't supposed to be there (I lived two blocks away, so no driving). 

All this said, I've never felt addicted or compelled to drink. It's mostly habit, but I do enjoy feeling a little buzzed. As you know, it makes everything more interesting, and of course, you feel like a better version of yourself with the right about of drinks. 

Also, I've never had any issue taking breaks from drinking -- sometimes only a couple of weeks, sometimes for a month or longer. I usually call these breaks a ""detox,"" but I've never had withdrawals or anything. It's simply a way to prove to myself that I don't need it and can stop if I wanted to. I even stopped drinking for six months during college to prove a point to my social group who expressed concerns, even though after a month they conceded I wasn't addicted (I was being petty to prove a point). I'm currently on day 10 of such a break and feel fine physically, just ... I don't know, bored?

For me, drinking has always been a choice, and I have chosen to drink because it makes life less dull. 

I should note a few other things that I expect could come up: I am married and have a child; I am professionally employed in a good career; I coach kids soccer and am physically fit (a bit out of shape for me right now due to a recent ankle injury, but still above average); my diet is mostly healthy, and I very rarely drink soda or eat sugary things; there have been two times where a friend or family member has expressed concerns in recent years, and both times I took extended breaks (about three months each time) to show that I'm not addicted; I have no trouble being around alcohol and not drinking (there are bottles of tequila, vodka and wine in my home right now, but as I said above, I haven't drank in 10 days) and I regularly DD, which means going to bars or parties where everyone else is drinking while I refrain. 

I don't think I'm addicted, neither physically nor mentally, but I acknowledge that I do drink too much to be good for my health. The break I'm taking now is to help jump start my road back to fitness since I am able to run again post ankle injury. 

I guess I don't know what I'm really looking for here. I just hoped to get some feedback from a non-familiar perspective. I feel confident I could stop drinking permanently, and I understand that would be a big win for my health, but at the same time, life is short and I would rather enjoy the time I have than worry about something that otherwise only enhances my experience. 

Anyone else have a life experience something like this? 

(Note: I'm about to have to run out of the office for a few hours, so I will respond when I get back to my desk and have a break. I appreciate anyone who has read this and has took the time to respond.)",3

I can go for weeks without drinking, no problem. 


When I do drink (family parties, nights out with friends, etc) I binge. I black out. I feel disgusting physically and mentally for days on end. The anxiety consumes me, it amplifies my depression. I make a fool out of myself and embarrass my husband. I say things to people that I shouldn’t say, I lie. I damage relationships, I flirt with people I shouldn’t be flirting with. I fall down. I lose jewelry, I break my shoes, I lose my wallet. Then I spend the next day consumed by guilt. Unable to take care of my children. Bent over the toilet bowl vomiting nothing but foam and bile. The anxiety reverberates for days, I shake uncontrollably, I cry. 


I have kept my problem away from my children for the most part but my oldest has seen things he can’t understand. 


I have told my husband I’m going to get sober that I will never drink again but it never sticks. The next time we have an event there I am, blacked out and sweaty. 


I have been binge drinking since I was 12 years old. A combination of hanging out with high school kids and coming from a town with a big drinking culture. I’d say 60% of my family and friends have problems with alcohol. Because of this any attempt to stop drinking is usually criticized and sabotaged, I guess because if they admit I have a problem, they have to admit they have a problem. 


I can’t live like this anymore but i fail every time I try. If I cut out the people in my life that drink, I would be left with nobody. One friend who I’m really not close to (who I was mean to and publicly shamed the last time I was in a black out because she wouldn’t drink as fast as I wanted her to. God what is wrong with me.) it would mean cutting out my entire family. 


Drinking has always been a coping mechanism for me. A family member began molesting me when I was 12 and I was ostracized from my family as a result. drinking felt great to forget what was going on, I began promiscuous behavior I guess as a way to gain some control over my sexuality/life. This gave me fucked up and warped ideas about life which I have mostly corrected but these flaws and my daddy issues come out full force when I’m drunk. 



After my most recent binge I thought briefly about killing myself. I never could because of my children I could never leave them with that, but that fact that it crossed my mind scares me and I realize I need to do something. I feel so worthless, so ugly, so alone.",3

I'm 231 days in, my longest stretch in 25 years.  Most of my friends and colleagues know I'm not drinking (most don't know why, but I'm private about health issues of all types).  I come to /r/stopdrinking several times a day to read, learn and get inspiration from you fine folks.

While traveling for work this week, I went to a bar with a colleague.  I had already been out with him a couple times, ordering sparkling water or a lovely yuzu soda each time.  He knows I don't drink any more.  We sat down, I picked up the drink list, and there was nothing non-alcoholic on it.  I panicked.  My brain said, ""Fuck it, just this once you can have a beer.""  I probably spent 10 seconds thinking about this.

I *know* I don't moderate.  I *know* I won't only have one.  I know where that path leads.  But I spent 10 seconds entertaining the lie my brain was telling me.  

I did not order a beer.  I asked for a sparkling water.  I wonder what would have happened if I didn't spend as much time here at /r/stopdrinking continually reminding myself where that path leads?

I developed a drinking problem during a very dark and somber time in my life. I was mixing a bottle of alcohol with prescription medication. 

I got sober quickly and remained sober for a few a months. It was difficult as I avoided alcohol entirely, meaning I missed a lot of social situations. 

I begun then drinking socially and didn't recognise the problem. I'm young and binge-drinking is common amongst my age group in night clubs. I didn't realise the problem until I went to my first solo gig and mixed prescription medication and shots. I lost most of my memories of that night, walked on dangerous highways, had the police find me and woke up with a stranger in my bed. 

I am still to this day ashamed of that night and my behaviors. Alas, I stopped drinking entirely again. 

I then met my current partner and begun socialising amongst his friendship group and begin drinking again - small amounts at first as I was being cautious. But then we had one night out where I saw my behavior and noticed the warning signs. 

I've now entered drug and alcohol therapy, I've gone completely sober and have an amazing partner is supporting me. Tonight I went out and got a non-alcoholic fish bowl and he shared it with me.

Onwards and upwards to greater things.",3

Here's what I learned:
- Ethanol was maybe a tiny bit helpful at curbing my nighttime anxiety
- It was so not worth it!!

Oh my gosh! I totally did not realize how overrated alcohol is. I remembered it being fun! Instead I was less engaged in family time, I was laughing less, offended more...what a waste of energy! 

I'm so glad I tried it, because I never knew what I WASN'T missing.

I've been drinking heavily for 15 years and I've gotten to the point where I'm embarrassed with myself.  The fact I let beer have power over me is ridiculous.  I know I don't need alcohol in my life, but I like drinking.  There isn't a reason why I drink other than because I can.  I've never been able to drink in moderation and have always drank until I pass out.  I don't think I've ever enjoyed being drunk or buzzed.  I have always blasted through those stages until I go to sleep.  I don't know why I do this.  It's not even fun.  I know the damage I'm doing to body and I don't care.  I almost died from alcohol poisoning 11 years ago and that didn't stop me.  I just went right back to doing what I was doing.  I've tried to quit before making it close to a month a few times but then I just start again.  When I fail I get disappointed with myself and it spirals and then I tell myself I'm going to cut back and it always devolves into the same situation.

The longest I've made it without drinking has been 6 months and the only reason was because I was deployed.  I don't consider that a real time because I fantasized about drinking the whole time I was there and counted down the days until I could drink again.  Over the years the counting down until I can drink again has dominated my life.  It used to be ""can't wait until Friday"" and now it's gotten to the point where ""can't wait to get off work"".  Over the last two years I've been drinking daily.

2019-12-05 08:04:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e6gws2/i_finally_feel_hopeful_again/,I finally feel hopeful again,"So I quit drinking for probably the 5th time in my 35 year life November 11th, my badge is wrong. My troubles with addiction began probably when I was about 12, or whenever my family first got the internet, with porn although I didn't realize it then. Looking back now I realize that anything that gave me a rush or made me feel good I take advantage of to an unhealthy level. My first true realization that I had a problem was when I was about 19 and doing any drug I could get my hands on. I was struggling with depression and anxiety although at the time I didn't even really now that anxiety was. So, anything I could do that would make me feel better or lessen that anxiety I did. 

At 21 I quit all drugs, or so I thought, which mainly consisted of weed and meth. Luckily I didn't slide to far down the meth addiction hole that I totally ruined my life but at 1 to 2 binges a month it was bad enough that it was seriously affecting my life. Being 21 I decided that I would start drinking more to fill the place of my past self medications because hey it's legal and I won't have to deal with people I never liked to begin with. I started drinking at least a 6 pack a day and thought nothing of it because hey everybody drinks so it can't be that bad. I also rationalized my binge drinking when having out with friends as well we're just having fun. The problem was I was always trying to push everyone to get drunker and drunker and I was always the drunkest usually to the point of blacking out and making a fool of myself. I would spend the night most of the time but I drove and put other people in danger way too many times. It was a real problem but I just refused to see it. 

Fast forward 5 to 10 years and I got, luckily, my only DUI right as i was about to close on my first home. There i am sitting in a jail cell scared shitless not knowing how I'll pay for this or how it will affect my insurance. You think that would be a wake up call but no. With a good lawyer i got it reduced and it didn't really affect anything but my bank account. 

Having a place of my own turned out to be a really bad thing for me. I talked about having people over and all that but in the end I just sat at home by myself and got drunk. Don't have to worry about embarrassing yourself or getting a DUI if you never leave the house right? So know for the next 8 years I just drank at home with the occasional realization that I have a problem and I'd quit for a couple of months and then go right back to it. 

The first big wakeup call came in December of 2017 when a tree crashed through my house and ironically because I was so drunk didn't wake me up. When I woke up and realized what happened I posted a video trying to make a joke of it on Instagram and just really was very ho hum about the whole thing. My brother pointed out that, ""hey there's a freaking tree on your house and holes in the roof and you could care less. That's not normal."" That hit a nerve and I decided to straighten things out. I quit drinking that Sunday, signed up for a class at the local community college, and started hitting the gym. 

2018 became the longest time in my life that I went without a drink since turning 21. I did well in the two classes I ended up taking. Started doing side work and paid off a bunch of debt and did more with my family. Slowly over the course of the year though I started slipping back into bad habits of spending too much time alone, looking at too much porn, stopped going to the gym, and didn't sign up for any new classes. The other major oversight is I did not address my mental health problems. Ultimately all these things led me to relapse in October of last year. 

Before I knew it I was back to my old ways of binge drinking every weekend with an occasional weekday thrown in. My life became drinking and looking at porn until my brother finally had an intervention with me a few months ago and we decided that I should move back in with my parents to try and break the cycle. The downside is they both drink and they allowed me to drink at the house but at least I wasn't looking at porn all the time and was participating in family activities. Overall however things were pretty much staying the same until my ex who I have a child with from when we were teens and gave up for abb open adoption told the adoptive parents what was going on because she didn't see enough change on my end and didn't think I was taking it seriously which she was right. At first I was mad at her but I realized she was only looking out for our kid and trying to get me to wake the fuck up. Now I would never drink around my kid but from her perspective you can't really trust an addict can you? 

This was the wakeup call I needed and since then I've been taking my paxil and anti-drinking pills. I should add since i'm horrible at storytelling I forgot to tell you I started seeing a shrink in September. So I've been sober for three weeks and haven't looked at porn in three weeks and between the better habits and medication I feel happy and hopeful for the first time since I was 17. It used to be that I would look forward to events or things but in the moment of the thing it was never enough. I was still unhappy. I've started to take care of shit around the house, doing better at work, and generally piecing together a life that I've never really had as an adult. I'm still living with my parents but for the first time since early last year, and to a greater extent this year, i'm actually hopeful for the future. 

If you've made it this far thank you. I'm not a very good storyteller and I know I've glossed over some details and skipped around but hopefully you guys get the idea. IWNDWYT!

No alcohol is normal now. Cool. The physical and mental benefits are continuing. Excellent.  Social anxiety has lessened and I’m comfortable not drinking at parties.  Great. 

So why am I constantly thinking about the next time I’m going to drink?

Am I what those in AA refer to as a “dry drunk?”

Last couple of weeks I have been feeling this way and thoughts were creeping in of maybe allowing myself a special occasion to drink.  With conditions of course.  Just like before I would go back with rules.  It never worked then, why should it be different now?   

I let myself fantasize about it and the thoughts only grew stronger, to the point that I was becoming irritable, short tempered and unfocused.  I was actually losing sleep some nights thinking and planning how I could sneak one past myself. 

The truth is over the past two months or so I had been feeling confident (over confident) that I got this alcohol thing solved. Instead of going to my weekly meetings I started going every other week, making excuses.  I let my reading and writing lapse and have probably been spending too much time idle browsing on the smart phone.  Started going back to some of the bad habits I have developed over the years.  

I’ve become complacent.  That’s what makes me unprepared to face up to an unexpected challenge. That’s what leads to poor choices being made.  That’s what leads to regret and remorse and shame and guilt.  

After a smart meeting and some honest conversation I’m feeling refreshed and reenergized.  I’ve been letting myself slip into comfort, been too content to rest on my victories until this point.  Abstinence needs to remain top priority. 

Vigilance in other areas of life are just as important as sobriety. Idleness leads to boredom which leads to bad thoughts.  I was better when I was occupied reading and writing and exercising.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

All of my apologies, dear SD: not only have you helped me stop drinking, you’ve helped me to start healing. If you have any interest in hosting next week’s check-in, drop a line below!

A few months back I planned a golf trip with some college buddies and a few of their friends I've never met. We leave tomorrow. I know this is likely going to be a heavy drinking weekend for most, but I'm going to stay strong. In the past week or two I've been tempted to bail but I'm beginning to look forward to having fun and remembering an entire trip for once.  I actually have confidence in my will to avoid alcohol altogether and it feels good. One of my closest friends on the trip (and probably my biggest former drinking buddy) is now over a year sober so that should help out quite a bit, as well.

It feels like yesterday I was posting here trying to get a grasp of what life would be like to not drink. I had never seriously tried to stop drinking. Just the usual dry January to make me feel like if I could withhold drinking for a month, I somehow didn’t have a problem. 

And for a while the obsession had been lifted. I had no desire to drink. It seems the further I get away from the drink, the more I want one. It’s not that I really want one - my brain is trying to trick me. And also, I’m tired of constantly doing work to just be okay. It’s fucking exhausting. I think we can all agree that it’s just fucking exhausting. 

But what choice do I have? Taking a drink will not make things better. I can think of several things right off the top of my head that would get worse with a drink. The good news is I do have a support group and i have this subreddit to vent to when everyone is asleep. 

I used to drink at home a lot, and especially while cooking dinner. I haven’t cooked dinner much since being sober because I’ve been going out with AA people to diners. So tonight when I cooked I almost could taste the Chardonnay in my mouth. It’s like that phantom limb syndrome. I made chicken and brussel sprouts and it’s like I had the wine with me. It was crazy.

On a whim I invited my dad to dinner and told him about my problems thinking that it would be a good support tool. Boy was I not thinking. Now my dad is a good guy, but he's very hard headed and believes he knows absolutely everything there is to know about anything. He does not and will not, change his mind about anything and anything he says he believes.

He was obviously upset over what my situation and in attempt in trying to be supportive he said some things that REALLY triggered me. He said things like

You got the alcoholic gene from my mother,

You'll always be an alcoholic but I hope you learn to live with it.

You were born an alcoholic. etc

These things really got to me since in my journey and research in trying to get sober. I've learned some things that go completely against that thinking. Namely that I think any person alive is susceptible to this. I personally don't believe alcoholism is something you are born with. That there is some gene in your pool that can be identified as making you more inclined to drink uncontrollable. To me alcohol is an addictive drug that can grasp anyone.

Anyways, I know I should just move on and keep on doing what I'm doing right, but part of me is triggered and saddened that this is how he'll view me forever, as a sick person that will always be sick.

>Reflect upon your present blessings, of which every man has plenty; not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some. —Charles Dickens

This idea of present and future looking is something I had to learn. Like many folks, I was caught in my past misfortunes. The past felt larger and more real than the future.

That feeling intensified when I stopped drinking. Suddenly there was no escape from my past misfortunes. It felt like every moment was a reminder of what I had done, what I had lost, what I was giving up. Some misfortune? I had tons.

Gradually I learned to accept my past--misfortunes and blessings alike. It wasn’t an easy or fast process for me. It was deliberately grappling with what I had done, or what I had failed to do. It was deliberately training myself to look for blessings in the present.

With that in mind, **what are YOUR present blessings**?",17

I have also read a lot of people say stuff like once the decision is made it never really would have mattered how you got sober. I saw an interview with Charlie Sheen talking about sobriety and he said something along the lines of waking up one day and knowing he was done and then entering a 12 step program and being sober since.

I am 23 years old and have been drinking everyday for the past 5 years or so. At first it was just for fun but now I’m doing it just to cope with my anxiety. I used to be a fun loving kid but somewhere along the line probably around grade 9 or 10 i somehow developed what I believe to be social anxiety. I used to smoke weed to deal with it but now weed seems to give me more anxiety than anything so that’s why I switched to drinking. 

I now have a camp job where I can’t drink for the 7 days at a time that I’m there and I don’t have too much of a problem, the first few days are tough and I’m pretty much a depressed anxious mess but I’m pretty good at hiding it from everybody lol. About halfway through the shift I start to get more hopeful about how I will quit drinking and change my life for the better once I get home. By the last day I’m usually feeling pretty good but right once I get back to town the anxiety comes back and I feel the need to drink or else I’ll just sit in my house and do nothing. 

So basically once I’m home I go on a 7 day bender only to deal with my anxiety. I know that’s not the right way to deal with it and I really want to change but it’s hard. 

By day 7 of being home the day before going back to camp I feel like an absolute depressed piece of shit hungover mess and my whole days off we’re a blur, even if I got a lot done in that time it feels like I’ve accomplished nothing, and then I go back to camp and the cycle continues. 

I know I’m rambling and this might not be the right place to post this lol but I just felt like I wanted to get it out, also my health is deteriorating but it’s easier to pick up the bottle than put it down. I should also add that alcoholism and depression / anxiety runs in my family extremely. 

I am in camp while writing this it’s my second night here. Wish me luck on my next days off maybe I can break the cycle.

I become an angrier, edgier, more impatient, less rational person when I've got booze in me. Conversely, when I'm sober, things happen but I can let them roll off my back a bit more. Or if I get angry about something or annoyed with my spouse, I can psychologically ""step back"" and recognize I don't want the conflict and just choose to stay cool.

I feel like I always used to underestimate the impact of alcohol on my emotions. It tricked me into thinking everything was normal except that I was having a better time because of the booze. So wrong. It's such a lie. Such an awful lie.

People talk about rock bottom, but I can't necessarily pinpoint one thing.  I've blacked out maybe a handful of times. I think my worst decisions I've ever made was when I was drunk. I've had one night stands, I've drunkenly texted (harassment, not ok at all) coworkers who I thought were flirting with me. I've generally casted a wide net of flirtatious feelers even when I've been in a relationship, almost like a ego validation, but the only times I've ever tried to act on them was when I was wasted. So I think I have to work on impulse control generally and I know stopping drinking will be helpful for that.

I have a therapy appointment on Monday. I suffer from OCD, depression and insomia. So a lot of times drinking gives me a break from that.

I'm in my mid thirties so this type of lifestyle is not for me anymore I don't think. I have a girl that I love and I want to be solid for.",5

What’s been hard has been other people. Some friends were dismissive when I described what I was going through. Others Looked at me with pity. My girlfriend now thinks she’s a bad influence and almost broke up with me, imagining that I would be better off without her drinking around me.

I have had issues with alcohol on and off for years.  However things have gotten progressively better as I have gotten older.  Meaning that a lot of the times I drink moderately, but occasionally have too much.  Either way, those few occasions where I drink too much have really impacted my mental health and relationship with my wife.  And it has caused me to want to take an extensive break and/or quit altogether.

I recently set a ""30 day challenge"" for myself.  I made it 24 days sober before I caved and had some beers.  Nevertheless, 24 days is the longest I have gone without drinking in many many years.  I am quite proud of myself for that achievement.  

Well, I decided today that it's back to sobriety.  I just don't know if I set a short, medium, or long term goal (such as 1 month, 6 months, or 1 year no drinking goals)?  Or just say I am quitting and take it day by day.  The only reason I hesitate a bit is because when I did the 30 day challenge I actually was very proud that I almost made it.  Knowing it was just 30 days made it a bit easier.  But then I begin to wonder if I just caved toward the end because I knew I could just drink soon anyway.

Either way I know what my goal is:  to not drink, indefinitely.  I just want some tips on the best way to achieve it.",10

It has been 20 days so far and I don't feel any crawings etc. My wife was surprised even she said maybe you can drink a few glasses of wine I should not be that hard on myself. I said it is better not to start at all and it is my intention. 

I read a lot studies about the struggle that the people are giving at here and I am concerned if something is wrong with me or am I a ticking bomb that one day I will start drinking like crazy. The only motivation for me was while I was drinking I was telling to my self why not drink some and it was becoming bottles. Now I am telling to my self why not to sober some. Every day I am telling my self that it was not that hard and I can continue for months. I have already attended 2 company drinks and just drank cola.

As a result, my chin is split open, needing ten stitches. Where he punched me in the chest and kidneys I have some cracked ribs, blood in the lungs and of course difficulty breathing. My knees are skun up, and my hands are cut up from defending myself. My back and neck are out of whack from falling to the ground.

This is my rock bottom and the asshole who beat me up is myself. I passed out while standing and took a dangerous header. The injuries are real. It could have been so much worse. I never want to forget what happened and how bad I got.

I feel like I'm starting a new life.  I  am thinking clearer, I am more relaxed.  I don't have this sense of dread like everything is just going to collapse under my feet at any moment.  I am making a super conscience effort to be more positive thinking.  I want to surround myself with positivity.  I am trying to live in the NOW, not focusing on what happened in the past, or worrying too much about the future.  I'm trying to remember my mistakes but forget about the hate, the pain, the loss I have experienced.

  I broke up with my long term partner of 13 years.  We have a 8 year old daughter together.  I feel free again.  I was being suffocated in that relationship, I was bored.  She was bored.  What we had is gone.  I don't know why, but it is.  We had our issues and it came to a breaking point.  I realized it was over a few years ago, but I used alcohol as a way to numb and forget and just hoped it would pass.  It didn't.  I'm not really hurt about it because I have been grieving about it for a couple years now.  I will look back and smile because it happened and not be sad because it is over.  I broke up with her when I realized that ""THIS IS IT"".  This isn't some dress-rehersal, I could stay miserable or I can change and grow.  It was scary to walk away, but I know things will be okay in the end.  So I pulled the trigger.  She is in the midst of moving out.  I hope we can stay friends for the sake of our daughter.  Our daughter will live with me, but I would like to make it as 50 /50 as possible.  She will always be a part of my life due to our daughter. 

I'm turning 40 in 9 months.  I realized I had been drinking for over half my life now.  The last 20 years just went by like nothing... and thought, the next 20 could go just as quick, and then all of a sudden I am 60 and that is where people start looking back at their lives, not forward.  I want to make a difference.  I don't want to be some useless drunk who avoids their problems, tells nonsensical stories to strangers, and feels like total shit for the majority of their life.  I didn't want to be a slave anymore!   I had to escape the vicious cycle I was going through everyday.  

In just over 2 months, I will be travelling to Africa to Tanzania to climb to the roof of Africa.  Kilimanjaro.  I've wanted to do this for a few years now... and I am now making it a reality.  I'm going alone... hoping I meet some new people whose lives don't revolve around alcohol.  I'm excited.   Scared, but life begins when you exit your comfort zone.    


I've been training for my trip, and I feel like I am in the best cardio shape of my life... or at least getting close to it. 

I've never felt so lucid.  My emotions are starting to come back... and I take them as they come.  Some days I feel like shit, some days I feel amazing.  But I would rather feel SOMETHING than nothing at all.  When I was drinking I didn't feel anything.  I was just numbing and making a life of thick fog where nothing was clear.  Days, weeks, months would go by and nothing changed.  Eat, Sleep, work, drink repeat.   What kind of life is that?  

I don't miss drinking.  I miss some of the social aspects of it... but in good time I will develop a new social circle who doesn't revolve around grabbing pints.  Here is to another year, a new decade, and the start of a new life.  :)

Second Disclaimer: Throwaway account because I’m paranoid someone that knows me will read this. 

I have been a lurker here for almost 4 years. This is my first post.  

I think I’m on my way of becoming an alcoholic.

A year ago, I told a psychiatrist that I thought I needed to stop drinking. I was honest with him about how much I was drinking, and we discussed a few situations that I had gotten myself into because I got too drunk and did/said very stupid things (nothing dangerous). He agreed with me, that even thought I wasn’t an alcoholic yet, I should stop or moderate myself. 

I stopped for a month but then continued drinking.  

I can’t moderate. I keep trying and keep failing at that. 

My husband hasn’t said anything yet, not because he doesn’t notice or doesn't know how much I drink.... I suspect it is  because most of the time when I drink on weekdays, I’m up earlier than normal the next day (do to anxiety) and as far as he knows, I'm a very productive person the day after having a few drinks (I'm not). 

I can easily drink a bottle of wine about 4 or 5 nights a week at home and if we go out with friends on weekends, I'll have a couple of drinks where we are at, and then continue alone when we get home. ...the excuse I keep giving my husband on those nights is that it's still early and that i'm not tired yet. 

I’m anxious that one of these days my husband finally going to tell me that I have a problem…. or that my young son will notice that mom drinks a lot.  

I’m not expecting you all to tell me what to do. I just needed to vent; I feel very sad and worried.  

I want to stop but I don’t have the will power to do it. 

I want to stop the anxiousness, the guilt, the hangovers, the tiredness, not being a productive person…. I could be a better mom, wife and friend if I stopped drinking. 

I don't feel I can talk about this with anyone and at the moment I can't go and talk to my psychiatrist.  

I really want today to be my first day of not having a drink anymore and I want to be able to read this when I feel like having a drink.",6

Not only am I not drinking, I've had lots of health issues (AFTER I STOPPED! wtf). Most notably I have laryngoharyngeal reflux, or silent reflux which caused a globulus sensation in my throat. It feels like I'm being choked out. I've been on a proton pump inhibitor and it's not doing anything. Basically to get over it I have to follow a special low acid diet for an unspecified amount of time that eliminates these things:

* dairy
* fried foods
* most meat except chicken and fish
* caffeine
* alcohol
* sodas
* onions
* garlic
* all fruit except melons and bananas
* tomatoes and tomato-based foods

That's right people, I can't have coffee or LA CROIX!!! I really think this happened because I was stuffing junk food down my throat to stay sober. In October I was shoeveling Halloween candy and ice cream and whatever I could find just to not pick up. It caused a terrible reaction in my esophagus but it's finally getting better on this diet, meaning I can actually eat again without pain. This is extrordinary. If you've never experienced the feeling of something stuck in your throat, it makes you scared to eat. So I am happy just to be able to eat food again. Honestly I am so glad I stopped drinking before this happened to me or I would be having a hell of a time trying to do all of this at once. It's changed my perspective tremendously on how I was living vs I am supposed to be living, and also what  the standard american diet is vs what it should be. It's hard to eat this way. I think humans have gotten so far away from the primitive lifestyle that we have all sorts of these maladies happening now.

I just wanted to check in and say that today I'm 28 days off of alcohol and everything else!!

I had not had a drink in over 18 months.  I was feeling hopeless and depressed and booze was my solution in that moment.  A hospital trip later, several other incidents and lots of grief and sadness, I believe firmly I've hit my bottom.

I turned to severe drug and alcohol abuse, violence and just being an all round shit human being. This was all up until I was about 22.

Despite being able to keep my hard drug habits under control, I'm still struggling with alcohol and smoking. I've managed to take a lot of days free from alcohol  but I'm still a long way from victory. About 6 months back I lost my best friend who took her own life after suffering through her own matters. Despite this while she was here with us, she helped me through first hand experience get through the roughest of my time with drink. The reason I hated myself so much was because I was out drinking the night before she died in her area, I wanted to message her to see if she wanted to meet up but my mate interrupted me and asked it I wanted another beer. The next day i found out she was dead. 

I know not to blame myself but this incident made me hate myself because alcohol won that day over me. If I sent that message off a little bit sooner I could have maybe swayed her, made her change her mind and know that she was loved. But I didnt. Alcohol swayed decision, I chose it over my friend. 

For a long time I hated myself and wanted to join her. But I know that's not what she would want for me, the best way to repay her is to live and live well. That doesn't mean be rich and powerful, that means be a good man and be the the best revenge to serve to the people who made my life hell is live a good life. IWNDWYT.",6

Finally broke down, now I'm on day 3. I need this otherwise I will die way too young.","Alright, here we go again. Just a blurb about me. Sorry about the wall of text, I just feel like hopping on my soapbox for a few minutes.

_______________


I was a severe alcoholic leading up to my early 30s. I found a way to quit and became addicted to cycling. After a couple years of cycling constantly (~200-250 miles per week, one year I didn't even gas up my car more than once) I became in great shape. Best shape of my life by far. I ended up moving across the country and where I'm living now is not *anywhere near* as cyclist-friendly. The very first day I tried cycling I went on the most remote side-roads I could find and in the span of a 20 mile ride I had more issues than I had the years prior combined, one person directly threatening to kill me. So, that was out. There was no way I could commute to work, go on endurance runs, etc without fearing for my life. I did try going on a second ride just to see if it was a weird day last time, but nope. People here fucking *HATE* cyclists with a passion, even on remote side roads and me being as little of a nuisance as I can possibly be.

This alone didn't trigger me picking up the booze again, but it really did suck to lose that crutch, it was the one addiction that seemed healthy (even though I know addiction in general is bad, at least with this I was staying off the booze). I'm not at all a fan of cardio in the gym or most other forms of cardio, but I *loved* riding. Back when I was boozing I was 290 lbs, by the end of my cycling ""career"" I was 180, which is great for my height and build. I had quads from the gods!

Anyway, I had quit drinking for nearly 3 years at this point. I got a new job, met some coworkers I like, and they invite me to an after work happy hour. I had myself convinced that my booze days are over, now I can drink socially without risk (a tale as old as time I'm sure). I had two beers and felt a little bad for breaking my streak, but felt I was healed now. I will only drink in moderation and only socially. I went to bed that night not even craving more alcohol.

Of course one thing lead to the next, which lead to the next. I found excuses to drink ""meh, work sucked today, no harm in having a few beers to blunt the edge a bit"". Those days became more frequent and the number of beers increased. Next thing I know I'm downing an entire 12-pack per evening and not taking any breaks. I'm not talking light beer either, my go-to is 7.2% alcohol and after 12 of them I'm pretty lit. Aside from the alcoholism this is ~2700 calories just in beer alone, every day! Insane.

I've been doing this the past two years. I'm a high functioning alcoholic, but my life has gone to complete shit regardless. I function okay in my work life but my home life is a mess. I live alone and my apartment was absolutely *trashed*, beer cans everywhere, old bags of fast food piled up. It's embarrassing. I had an insane fruit fly infestation because of all the beer cans and nastiness piling up. I'm talking tens of thousands of those little fuckers! Buzzing my head when I try to sleep, flying into my eyes and nose, etc. It's terrible.

I weighed myself a few weeks ago and I couldn't believe my eyes. 320 lbs. Wow. And I feel like total garbage of course. 

I did find a park that has paved roads for cyclists (unfortunately it's far away so I can't go daily) and I was completely and utterly gassed after 3 miles. Pathetic. I used to ride 32 miles round-trip to work *daily* and have done plenty of 100 mile rides, but I felt like I was going to die after 3 miles. I used to *sprint* 3 miles and then ride another 60! Sickening. Not to mention I picked up smoking again, which I hadn't done for 15+ years.

I mentally hit a crossroad. I actually had to make this decision consciously. I'm either going to booze like crazy, smoke like a train, and eat like shit every single day until it kills me (which probably wouldn't take long), or I'm going to choose life instead. It's a surprisingly difficult choice when you're in my state of mind. It's easy to booze, it helps me forget about all of my problems. Sobriety is tough because I have to face them, my mind is active and not in a foggy haze, which isn't always a great thing. It can be quite scary, honestly.

Well, I ended up choosing life and now I'm on day 3 (last beer was Sunday). First thing I did was clean my house. FIFTEEN large trash bags full of garbage! Man, what a wreck my life became.",99

It started with daily use of cannabis but my problems with alcohol specifically started a few years ago. I just loved the feeling of being drunk, the escape. After multiple occasions of drunken injury, mishaps and broken friendships, I could see I had a problem. I tried multiple times to stop. Each attempt lasted max a couple of weeks and then I would be back in the full swing of it again. I entered into a relationship with someone who supported my attempt at sobriety but even then I couldn’t stop. I was doing it for him, not myself and my constant failures disappointed him and added strain to our relationship. Eventually that ended and without anyone watching me I fell heavily back into the binging. I tried and failed to stop a few more times after that until this most recent attempt. 

Three months ago I spent 10 days volunteering at a Vipassana meditation centre. It was during that time that I had, once again, the revelation that I didn’t want to carry on the way that I was. That I wanted to gain control. The most helpful ideas that I took from the meditation books I read during that time were: repeating any action will make that action increasingly easier over time- the more I accept drink, the easier it will be. The more I reject it, the easier that will also become. Second, allowing myself to constantly succumb to my craving was making me deeply unhappy. Third, if I wanted to come to a deeper understanding of myself and my consciousness, then routinely taking mind altering substances, like alcohol, was going to prevent me from ever doing so. There was an analogy comparing introspection to looking into a clear pool of water. Drinking alcohol is the equivalent to stirring up the silt at the bottom of the pool. The water becomes muddy and seeing into the depths of the pool is now impossible. I had made so many bad decisions with a muddied mind and I didn’t want to carry on like that anymore. 

I don’t think you need an interest in meditation to see the value of these ideas. But for me, Vipassana meditation and the theory behind was what really gave me the final push into being successfully sober (for 3 months at least). 

Growing up with an alcoholic father is what really alerted me to the severity my own problems. One of the worst moments of my life was watching my dad have a seizure from alcohol withdrawal. I really thought I was watching him die. I called an ambulance and forced him to go to the hospital. To have a nurse come in and tell us we needed to take him to a local shop and buy him booze was so surreal. I didn’t know how reliant his body had become until then, despite him being in and out of rehabs most of my life. I’m thankful for that experience because it gave me a clear picture of where I never want to end up. 


The drinking culture where I live (U.K.) has becoming increasingly shocking to me the more I’ve managed to remove alcohol from my life. It’s seen as normal, even funny, to drink yourself into oblivion every weekend. People don’t seem to realise that having problems with alcohol does not necessarily mean drinking every day. It’s also the need to drink until blackout every weekend. That’s where I was, completely unable to stop at one or two drinks. Waking up or coming to in unfamiliar places. The stupid risk I was putting myself at. The lack of self love and respect. That’s why now I am planning to cut alcohol out of my life forever. But forever comes one day at a time and that’s why IWNDWYT.

It's not like I ever drank on the job; that's when you actually have a problem, I told myself. It was just the ""major"" drinking events that I had to work on-- cutting back at the festivals and concerts and what not. But having a beer every once in a while after work became having a beer every day after work, and then 2 beers, etc. And EVERY ""drinking"" event I went to ended with me getting black out. I realized ""moderation"" isn't a word in my vocabulary. So I decided to give it up.

The first night was rough. I didn't think I'd have withdrawal or anything like that. Maybe it's because I was thinking about it, or because it was something that I couldn't have anymore that it was bothering me. But I made it. Found some things to distract myself, got a good night's sleep. So on to the next day.

I'm glad I found this community. It's inspiring. Thanks for being in this together with me.",6

I am taking the day off and going to spend time in nature contemplating this mile marker. 
I have two kids who will never have to know me as a drinker. My parenting will never have to be affected in a myriad of negative ways by the influence of alcohol. I am grateful for that. 
I drank for more than 16 years. I was a daily drinker. I have learned to navigate life without alcohol, and have been surprised by the realization that I could never become a better person had I continued drinking. Self awareness has happened. Clarity- mentally and emotionally. The great fog and rainstorm continually in my heart as a drinker is gone. In short, life has gotten better. I am better equipped to deal with the challenges and problems of life with the obstacle of drinking removed. I did not realize how much it limited me.
5 years ago, Day One became 5. 5 days became 30. 30 became 90, and then I had a year. Then two. Then three. Then four. Then, here I am today with half a decade.",258

Milestones are great and I'm excited and nervous for the upcoming 6 month mark.

But, today isn't just another day that lies between my last drink and my next milestone. It's a day without alcohol and regardless of how this day turns out, I will be sober at the end of it. Just like yesterday. That in itself is the miracle.

That's the important part. Each day is ""the milestone"". Each day without a drink is my own milestone and though I might not get a shiny new chip, or a cake, or someone patting me on the back or looking at me with envy, I know that I achieved something I never thought I would before.

Woke up a short bit ago and I'm already feeling good. Anyway waking up without a hangover is a great day in my book! I do have one question though!? I've been drinking for decades, but it's never been so bad as for me losing a job or my family...etc. I love drinking and getting drunk, but the wear and tear on my body has finally caught up to me. I have quit here and there for a week or two without any major problems. Even now, when I've decided to take a long break from drinking, it's not extremely hard for me. Yes, when 5 o'clock rolls around, my first thought is, hey it's time to have a drink, but it's easy for me to catch myself and say, NO! I'm on a break from drinking and simply don't drink. I've never considered myself an alcoholic, but I guess we most of us don't, riiiight!? It hard to distinguish (for me anyway) if I have a drinking problem or not. I honestly feel, and this is only my opinion, that it's more of a habit than an addiction for me. I used to smoke cigarettes and I felt the same about that. I used to tell people that I only smoke when I drink, and of course the joke back from people who knew me would say: Then you smoke all the time!! But seriously for me, smoking was more of a habit, if I had a drink, I would want a cigarette. I don't feel as though I have an addictive personality, but I am guilty of having bad habits. Well, 10 years ago, I woke up one morning and decided to quit smoking, but not the drinking. It wasn't easy at first, but I quit cold turkey and never went back. Now 10 years later, never once had a cigarette again nor never wanted one. I felt as though I broke the habit. I was tired of feeling like crap from the smoking the next morning. I could deal with the drinking hangover, but it was the smokey taste in my mouth that I had enough with. NOW, I'm getting tired of the drinking hangover! It's finally caught up with me and it's time to finally fully clean myself up for good! But again, I have to remind myself now each day that when 5 o'cock rolls around, when my inner drinking alarm goes off, I have to say NO! So, I except it and move on with my evening. Yes, it doesn't totally go away that quickly, I may have the urge a couple more times throughout the early evening, but I try to quickly get those thoughts out of my head with a simply ""no"" and forget it and find something else to think about. I'm been sleep great the last couple of nights and feeling even better in the mornings, being sober! I'm thankful every morning when I don't drink the night before. Is it possible, even for the slightest bit, that I'm not an alcoholic, but someone who likes to drink, get drunk from time to time, or even to have a beer or two at 5 o'clock due to a habit I started years ago. I suppose time will tell from this point on, cause I'm truly making an effort to quit drinking, cleanse my body, eat better and get 100% healthy. My personal prediction on how this is going to go is: I won't drink for months to the point that I have broken the ""habit"" of drinking at the 5 o'clock hour and I won't want it nor even think about it anymore and this whole drinking joyride will fade away as did the cigarettes years ago. OR maybe, just maybe I might come to the realization that I truly have a problem with alcohol when the day comes when I can't turn it down, even if I wanted to.....",1

I have no friends or family near me and the first few months were terrible. I fell into a depression cocoon. I was trying to remodel the home I bought but being hungover on all my days off, I wasn’t getting much done. Drinking was worse then ever. I decided to do something about it. I limited myself to one beer per day in November. I know this isn’t quitting but I did well. Stuck to it. Felt good to accomplish a goal that I set forward. Some of the nights I didn’t even drink. Got a lot of the remodeling done. Amazing how much you can get done when your not hungover or drinking by noon on days off. Felt good enough to do some online dating. Went on a few dates. One in particular was very good. Even got a second date. We went out to a brewery and she was late. So I ordered a beer. Had it gone by the time she got there and ordered another. We got to talking and I misspoke a few times. I knew it was more about nerves but I think she thought I was drunk. Offered me water. I didn’t drink the beer I ordered after that. When we got done with the night she asked if I didn’t like the beer. I told here one was enough for me. I immediately felt like a fraud. I stopped on the way home and bought some beer and drank it all before I even got home. Slept terrible woke up hungover and hating myself. Poured out every ounce that I had in the house. How do you explain to a person your dating that you have a problem and are only starting to try to fix it without scaring them off? Here’s to my day 2",3

Later I will be ready later for in person... perhaps at AA. I have told people I do not drink and they responded well.,"I have somewhere around 415-430 days sober in 2018 and 2019.

I will stay sober forever now. I drank starting 17 years ago, did many different drugs (I do none now except occassionaly Ibuprofen), and only recently have I worked on quitting. I only have two attempts ever and they are both in these last two years.

Every day I am stronger than the day before. Sometimes I fall down and do not feel stronger yet at 34 years old the more experience I attain the more wisdom I have. I am, in fact, stronger even if I need to walk and cannot run. 

Even at 20 or so someone in their 40s said I was wise for my age. Well, friends, I have been a fool. Yet there is peace in that fact. It enables me to know where I came from, where I am (most important), and where I am going. It enables me to know what makes me fall and what to do to prevent it.

I have two degrees in psychology, yet this is meaningless if I do not fix myself. I will be better. I am better, in fact, but I can be better  still. I will inspire others and show them it is okay to say enough is enough... it is okay to say one will not be a slave to alcohol or any other drug that negatively impacts one.

All the best; have a wonderful day full of peace.

The absolute enormity of the struggle. But yet here in this forum, I see almost everyone can Understand these feelings.  I’ve been reading Reddit/stop drinking for weeks and can’t believe how much I identify with your many situations. Years of hiding, years of shame, lies, of anxiety and now, knowing it has become a dangerous and terrifying Spiral... it’s hard to breathe and to face this. This post just makes it more real. But maybe somehow someway, someone can give me the magic advice I need.  I see an enormous amount of support here but not so much advice. HOW to make this train wreck stop????  Tools, ideas, methods, hypnotism, drugs... anything I can do without my husband knowing and my world crumbling. 

We are 50 yrs old and early retired.  Married 20 years and we are the happiest, luckiest, most grateful couple I know. We have faced serious issues like caring for sick and dying  parents and have had several surgeries each and losses, But through the tough times, we have come out stronger. Our love and adoration is palpable, we laugh and travel and spend 24x7 together for most of our 20 yrs together. 

All but for my closet secret. After the first few yrs of honeymoon phase and fun, my husband started saying I drink too much, he was concerned for my health and worried in general. But I became angry and very defensive until I finallyyy realized if I just hid the extra drinking, we were both satisfied!  We drink every night with dinner and he is blessed with that wonderful ability to have one glass of wine!  Oh what I wouldn’t do for that satisfaction. I will sneak 4 to his 1 and feel exactly the same light buzz as he. And when he went to bed, I could relax and have 2 more. Ahhhhhh, everyone happy. I’d be hungover almost every morning but learned to live with it. I’d wake up sweating with anxiety that he found the extra bottle of wine I drank so I made better hiding choices. I’d lie if he smelled it, I’d claim I didn’t eat if it went too far one night.  Or that bartender made one way too strong!!  All the lies adding up. But yet, feeling happy in general!  But in the last year or so, I have crossed the line over and over!!  Too ashamed to write all the awful stories but often include black out incidents. My husband has become more aware and has started to have conversations about my behavior and drinking - without even knowing the true ENORMITY of it.  Willing to support me in any way and even tho I downplay it, we agreed I would go to therapy.  One therapist only wanted to send me to AA. That was his one and only solution. Period.  No discussions, no therapy, just one solution. Well, I don’t want to go to AA. I don’t believe in God or even much of a higher power.  I also do not want to meet anyone I know in a local AA meeting. I live in a very small community. I know it helps millions but it is just not the method I want to pursue. And discouraging to think that’s the only way. The 2nd therapist treated me like I was wasting her time. I felt embarrassed when I left her - she basically said that her real clients have real problems and real withdrawals and real DT’s, etc... She stated in an email that afternoon that she was too booked up to continue seeing me. She made me feel exactly as I have been feeling for years. I have too much of a wonderful life to have a severe alcohol problem. I am not abused (tho I was abandoned as a teenager by an alcoholic father after my Mom died in a car accident). But as an adult, I am a happy, successful person with long beautiful friendships and close knit siblings and the best husband one could ask for.  She made me feel embarrassed that I can’t get myself (my drinking) under control. And she’s right. It is embarrassing. But somehow, I still need help. Guidance. Advice. Help.  A magic pill preferable (although I don’t use drugs)

I don’t agree with “telling it all will lift my burdens and set me free”. I think the years of deceit and lies would unnecessarily hurt the closest, kindest people to me.  It would destroy trust and question everything of the past. I would rather find a way to move forward, move away from this deceitful and destructive behavior.  I have gone as far as open the dialogue with my husband, explaining how I will - and am - just having “that one glass of wine with dinner” and seeking therapy (which I told him honestly about the last 2 therapists encounters).  For the first time in a long stretch, I feel great, lost weight, less anxious. I feel for weeks now that instead of the angst and anxiety of thinking of never drinking again and stopping cold turkey, I am comforted with the thought of having that one glass of wine at night.  

If I could do that forever, great!  BUT I feel the pull all the time, knowing I am teetering on the edge. Desperately trying to stop myself from sneaking a shot (or 5!) and occasionally getting that one in. Why why why?!  I honestly do not comprehend it. That beautiful feeling of buzzzz and euphoria of being drunk.  Happy, giddy, dancing. Fun!!!  Until it turns almost tragic. I’m so sick and tired of thinking about it daily, of craving!!  ALL of it, even that I am up at 6am writing this damn post!!!!  

I often research if there are any medical breakthroughs on the horizon to cure Alcoholism. Waiting for the magic pill that will eliminate the ridiculous and senseless and powerful draw to damn Alcohol!!!  
But there never is, ever.

Thank you for letting me fill some space and drone on... I wish everyone the best, there are so many incredible people here.  Thank you",3

Today is the 2nd day of my choosing not to drink. I didn't stop this time because I got a DUI and was forced to quit. I didn't quit this time because I was being UA'ed while on probation for said DUI. I quit because I'm tired of feeling like crap. I'm tired of crying, I'm tired of being what I consider the weakest version of myself I've ever known. 
I thought I could manage my drinking, I wasn't really an alcoholic. Then in July, my daughter decided to live with her Dad out of state, and I saw myself going back down the rabbit hole. 2 drinks a night to cope and sleep turned into 4, turned into 6 turned into sometimes an entire 1/5 depending on the night. 
I'm tired and I'm killing myself. I'm ready to stop drinking and being a sad sack of miserable shit all the time. I'm ready to feel better and be better. 
I don't feel like I have the support of my husband, many times I've mentioned stopping drinking or even slowing down and he shows up with a bottle of whiskey, (which he doesn't drink) and the 1/5 I bought earlier for the weekend, has turned into 2. I'm not blaming him for me drinking them, because that is totally my fault, but don't freaking show up with a bottle of whiskey after I've told you I wanted to slow down or even stop. 
I don't feel like I can continue to live in our house or even be around my husband right now, because everything turns into an argument about how I need to just learn to control my drinking and how I've failed in the past.
I'm currently looking at apartments for myself, because screw this, I'm not going to be somewhere I don't have support, with someone I am coming to believe uses alcohol as a control mechanism. 
This is super scary for me right now, and I don't really have anyone to tell, thank you for reading my rant.",2

As  the one year mark approached, I thought long and hard about the years I'd wasted, and the things I'd done and said that I couldn't undo or  take back. I can't change that, but I can change the future.  My freedom started  this morning one year ago when I woke up in the middle of the night on a weekday after having one too many, knowing the consequences full well, but doing it anyway,  and  decided I had had enough. For many years, my favorite band had spoken through their songs straight to my core and filled me with  hope, and often, brought me to tears. Songs like: Addicted to Pain,  Before tomorrow comes, Buried Alive, and finally, Blackbird for when I  was in my darkest place. I'd heard these songs countless times before, but suddenly, the words felt targeted, like the universe was speaking directly to me. They'd come on in the car while I was driving to work feeling like shit, and it could've been coincidence, but I've experienced enough strangeness to know there is no such thing.

In order to free myself from the habit, I had to cut ties with all my old beer buddies. It does hurt a little that not one of them has cared enough to even call or message me, but it's good proof that I was never their friend.   The majority of these old ""friends"" still gather often, and less than half a kilometer from my house. On many weekend nights, I can hear their uproarious laughter, and bottle caps popping off, which make me feel  sad and like I'm missing out, but it was me who was missing out, on my own home life.  I've become much closer with my  family now that I'm not chasing fake friendships which only relied on a misery loves company association to make them work.  

Holidays,  birthdays, and all other dates were set by me in the past, and they all passed, but the hangovers stuck. If the thought of quitting forever  scares you. Quit for 12 hours, or quit for a day, but at least try.  You  may fall, but just get up and \[keep trying. Don't give up. If you ever  feel overwhelmed, come back to this sub and you'll see it's a group  struggle and you are never alone.

I know most people (most of my friends) out there can moderate and/or occasionally overindulge without long-term consequences (or can they...) but I hate this - and it comes up in this sub regularly - normalisation of alcohol consumption in everyday activities, coupled with a celebratory and group-affirmed attitude towards *getting your drink on* at any opportunity. 

In my mind I feel it's this kind of thing that creates the 'creeping alcoholic'. Someone whose consumption was maybe never *'that bad'* but it steadily grows until it's habitual. Then *suddenly* they're older, more isolated from friends, living through social media and drinking a bottle a night... 

It's insidious, dangerous behaviour but seemingly, depressingly normal. Perhaps I just have a lot of sad, lonely or bored people on my social feeds.  

Anyway ramble over. I think the sudden explosion of alcohol-related posts, plus my general mood at this time of year (read: Low) has caused a surge in my cravings. Been fantasising (and dreaming) a lot about getting drunk so need an outlet.",18

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I read a passage in here not that long ago that stuck with me. Sobriety is something you bank, that you save up, and then how do you plan to spend it? It’s such a fitting metaphor. I’ve scraped up this little chunk change of sobriety, I’ve earned every penny of it, and I’ll be damned if I blow it on a case of beer. I’ve never been so proud of such a small number in my sobriety bank account, and I can’t wait to see it grow. Go out and earn another sober day, SD!",78

I quit cold turkey and never relapsed. From what I remember it was even harder than quitting drinking in the first few weeks. 

I don’t think about smoking ever. I don’t mind being around smokers nor do I ever have to fight even the smallest craving. It’s as if I never smoked and I couldn’t care less about it. 

I don’t think I’ll ever reach that point with drinking. I’m not sure why, I just don’t see that happening. I will never drink again, but I think it is going to require life-long diligence. Just a morning thought...no real point 😊

For 2 of those months I've had a gradually worsening cough with the usual cold symptoms that I just couldn't shift. Eventually, a couple of weeks ago I went to see the doctor and she prescribed me some antibiotics and gave me a card to take for a chest x-ray, advised me to rest for a couple of days. Anyway, long story short, the chest x-ray led to all sorts of other tests which last week saw me diagnosed with CML (chronic myeloid leukemia). At one point they thought I was looking at lung cancer but luckily that's not the case (I quit smoking 7.5 years ago so that would have been a kick in the nuts).

Anyway, as cancers go CML isn't the worst and is perfectly survivable with lifelong medication.

The thing is I feel a little cheated, as after 4+ months of the sauce I should be full of beans, not feeling like crap everyday.

Part of me does think though that the reason I managed to quit properly this year is because somehow I knew I had to. I'd be feeling a lot worse dealing with this and the bottle. And the money I've saved has saved me while I've been forced to take 3 weeks off work. Things could be a LOT worse.

Note : Luckily I live in the UK and the medical stuff hasn't cost me a penny. I also now qualify for free prescriptions forever which is a help (I believe imatinib is an expensive drug in some places) . I know some people knock the NHS but it moved bloody quick when it needed to and its saved my life so I can't praise it enough.

What I really wanted to ask was is there anyone else out there who is sober and has CML? What have been your experiences? Any advice?",7

To the weekend binge drinkers....... after a night out of drinking and once again failing to be ´moderate´and taking it too far..... do you then make the decision that the only way to deal with the problem is to be a Tee total..... but then once you feel ´better´ (i.e. your body is detoxed again), you convince yourself it is stupid to be tee total (Cos oh, alcohol is so yummy, and it feels good, and everybody drinks, it isnt fair to deprive myself of a pleasurable activity which everyone takes part in....) and so you decide you will manage to be moderate this time...... you then go out and maybe manage a couple of times to be more ´moderate´.... but it isnt long before you have one too many again........

My question is - when you know the best thing for you is to be Tee-total, does your mind then always change and you try to convince yourself why you should be allowed to drink alcohol?",1

400 days has been anything but duck soup; it has been the most horrific journey I have ever had to face. The person I was 400 days ago is not the person I am today. I never thought I would ever be able to say that I am 1 day sober; let alone 400. I never thought sobriety could, and would change me in all the amazing and positive ways it did. 

When I stopped drinking it wasn’t an epiphany sprung on by another out-of-control-binge-fest and another relentless hangover with a promise to never drink again. It happened rather gradually. I started cutting back. I didn’t go cold turkey. I said: I’ll try to drink only one tonight, maybe two. I’ll try not to drink when I’m out for dinner. I’ll try to turn down a drink that is offered. I’ll try not to drink this weekend. I’ll try not to drink at this wedding or birthday. I’ll try to turn down these shots. I’ll try to be sober when I’m sad or hurt and I’ll just embrace it. I will try to not drink today. Some I failed but each small success I had helped me to get through to the next one. I got through that, so I can get through this. Sobriety wasn’t my goal when I started out, I just wanted to be able to control my drinking. Only to come to realize, I can’t. It’s a train begging to runaway every time. It’s all or nothing for me. Then I started to get on a sober streak - wow, it’s been 30 days! What’s one more day? What’s one more day? What’s one more day. 

July 10, 2018 was the last time I was intoxicated. The last drink I ever had was November 3, 2018. Today is my 400. 

Though, nothing has ever tested me like these past few months. My sister had been making several suicide attempts and the last one, she hung herself. She died and was thankfully brought back by an incredible medical team. She was without air for up to 16 minutes. She was in a coma for 8 days. She was lucky to survive. She now has a sever anoxic brain injury that she will never recover from. I was just granted her life-long guardianship, joint along with our father because she will never be able to make her own decisions again. I have never felt pain like this before. Not able to properly grieve because my sister is still here, but the person I knew is gone. I remind myself often to be thankful that I am planning her long-term care and not a funeral. I miss who my sister was. 

In the same weekend she was admitted to the ICU, a girl reached out to me to ask if the guy in my photos was my boyfriend. Turns out my boyfriend - who lived with me - was setting up dates behind my back with multiple women (one he was pursuing after knowing what happened to my sister). I later found out that he had been cheating on me for the entirety of our one year relationship. All I wanted was to do was drown my pain in alcohol. How was I supposed to get through this without my comforting crutch that got me “through” everything else. When I turned to this sub for help, everyone seemed to say the same thing - alcohol only exemplifies your problems; it won’t help. For whatever reason, I held onto that dearly every time I’ve felt like turning back to my old toxic habits. It got me through what has been the hardest part of my entire life so far. Thank you to all the people that commented that day. You really made a difference for me and I think about what you all said often. 

I got through this, I can get through that. I will not drink with you today. What’s 400 more?

Cheers.",1003

I am sitting here anxious right now feeling like something is missing in my life. I have been debating on and off all day if I should drink tonight, the only thinking stopping me at the moment is the fear of hurting others if I lose control again.

What I am realizing right now is that it's so much harder on me this time because I didn't want to quit but felt I had to. In the past when I would quit it would be because I choose to and felt excited about the decision enough to get through the initial 4-10 days while my body withdrawals.

I have been down this road literally hundreds of times and I know that after 10 days it should be easier just because the physical withdrawal is over with. At that point it will be a mental game but right now it's a tug of war in my head.",9

I hope you're all doing okay.

It's half 5 in the morning in England right now and since I've been trying to drink less (stop drinking...), my sleep is disgusting, so here I am. 

I went to a pub quiz last night and we came second (team of two! Kinda proud, feel like my brain is slowly coming back to life, the more I continue to abstain from alcohol ha). I did drink last night, two double rum and cokes compared to three the previous week... I know It doesn't seem like progress, but a big thing for me is drinking straight vodka by myself and in the past I probably would have done that alongside. I even went into the shop beforehand, to buy some sour sweets lel, and I was so, so tempted to buy a quarter of vodka to have on me, JuSt In CaSe, but I didn't. Baby steps \~

Anyway, back to the quiz - the prize for second place was a bottle of wine. I did the quiz with my ex and he knows about my drinking problem, to an extent, however not completely because Idk, I just don't want to burden anyone. I took the wine, and he seemed okay with it bc 1. I don't drink wine, and I mentioned maybe giving it to someone and 2. he probs just didn't want to carry it ha.

The thing is, despite not even being a wine drinker, I know it's there and it's been on my mind. I've decided I definitely will not drink it and instead, I'm going to either gift it to a friend like I said OR take it to a work xmas dinner in two weeks. I don't know, I realise how pathetic this post sounds, but having an entire bottle of wine and not drinking it all by myself and instead just going to bed was such a big win for me.

I still find it really hard to count days and say, 'today is day 1', because the feeling when I screw up and have to start re-counting is unbearable, but I think something has finally clicked and I'm as confident as I've ever been to say, today is the day. 

You all inspire me so much, and I don't even really have a question so this could have gone into a diary or something... I apologise.

Seeing as I'm here, though - **what was your turning point/what keeps you going?** I've had so many awful experiences while drunk, I've f\*cked a lot of stuff in my life up due to alcohol, but a big thing that is motivating me right now is how much clearer I am able to think when I'm not pissed out of my brain. I've always had a zest for learning and while I have a separate issue with self-confidence and insecurities aka 5eva feeling stupid, doing well in the quiz last night showed me that, that girl who loves to use her brain and actually do stuff is still in there somewhere and I need to stop killing her with alcohol. I've wasted so much time being disgustingly drunk and I want to now use that time effectively to develop as a person.

I am scared 

Been drinking at LEAST 10 drinks a night for 2 years on and off and have had a problem for 4 years. Over the last year I haven’t slept sober a single day.

I usually only drink to fall asleep so this is important because when I wake up I usually don’t eat until mid day. But recently over the last 3 days I’ve needed to force feed myself so I don’t die of malnourishment. I have no appetite. Zero. Never hungry. This loss of appetite is the most worrying thing to me because loss of appetite is not caused by anything minor.

Anyone know what this means? I also have liver pains for sure and possibly jaundiced eyes I can’t tell.

Read up and it looks like the loss of appetite is a symptom of alcoholic liver disease but I can’t verify this. Maybe something else is wrong with me?

How fucked am I, what should I do besides quit?

Anyone experience anything like this before?

So I call her and somehow within 2-3 hrs she lost the spare. No worries I had a backup plan. I would leave my bathroom window unlocked so I could climb in throughout.

But tell someone you quit drinking and it’s often a quiet pause. Sometimes I get a “good for you”. Often I get a why? Like they can’t imagine their life without alcohol in it. Like I must have had a serious problem if I’m choosing to never drink again. What madness. 

 It’s amazing how deeply drinking is integral to our culture. The blinders are tight. This addictive liquid is so thoroughly accepted. It takes some grit to choose a different path in this ecosystem. 

Even family, people who have seen me in a bad state, even they still ask if I’m ready to try a drink at times. I think they are starting to see that I’m very serious about this and we’ve already had our last drink together. 

It takes courage and conviction to keep exploring this path. Good on each of you. I know how infuriatingly challenging this choice can be at times. 

My best to you.",6

-----------------------------------------

**The Good:** I bought a used car. It’s not a motorcycle like I really wanted, but I have to be able to take my elderly mother to her medical appointments, and I don’t think she’d agree to ride in a sidecar. Nevertheless, it feels great to have transportation again.

**The Bad:** It’s hard to feel like a bad ass when you’re driving around in a second-hand Ford Fiesta. In my dreams, I’m Sonny Barger from the Hell’s Angels. In reality, I’m Jethro Bodine from *The Beverly Hillbillies,* driving around in an old jalopy.

**The Ugly:** A used car salesman [this is not the beginning of a joke] told me, when I said I didn’t like the headrests in a car he was trying to sell me, that he could just remove them for me. 

I asked him, “Aren’t headrests in a car supposed to protect your neck and head in an accident? Isn’t removing them a serious safety violation?” but he just shrugged. What a jerk.",21

Like maybe around 10 at most. I was always 'the drinker' in the group, but on weekends. Something changed in the last couple of years and it's every weeknight now, too. On weekends I just get started earlier and keep going till I drop. 

In any case, I'm on day 2 of being sober. All the conflicting feelings - looking forward to real sleep, nervous energy, odd food cravings, a need to lash out when something small and annoying happens.

But one tough thing I have to do tomorrow - it's come out someone I work with is a drinker. Like an on the job one. Everyone knows it, talks about it. This person broke some equipment recently in a way that's apparent someone drunk and not all there was handling it. 

This person also tried to hide it, minimize how bad it was, but the truth eventually came out. Hearing this person lie and be defensive is an echo to me, and hearing their behavior described by other people,  I hear what other people undoubtedly have said about me. 

In any case, I have to be the pot who calls the kettle black tomorrow and am determined to find a way to do it that somehow helps the other person. 

It's not a comfortable situation but it's been a bit of a wakeup call for me. This person is probably only a few years older than me and it seems like the more you let it go, the more you are controlled by it and the more you kid and lie to yourself.

At first, I was a normal person who could go to the bar, have a couple drinks, and go home. 

Then somewhere along the way, I started drinking heavier, and then I increased the frequency, until I'm going on all-night benders 4-5 nights a week with the only break being the nights in between when my body has been too exhausted to carry on and I finally pass out. 

I'm disappointed in how far I've slid. It's gone past just hungover drives to work and now I've shown up to work drunk on more than one occasion. I've skipped out on family events due to drinking. I've pushed away all of my friends except the ones who have as much of a drinking problem as I do. I never thought I'd get to the day I'd wake up and first thing I want in the morning is a beer. And although I have been yet to act on those feelings, with how rapidly the problem has escalated, I feel like if I don't stop now I'm going to end up killing myself, and I don't want that.

I want to feel like a productive person again. I want to take responsibility for my health again. I know I would have so much time to put into productive habits if I gave this one thing up, but I'm scared my life is just going to be lonely and boring without alcohol.

All those social gatherings, all those drinking opportunities, all that temptation; it’s tough at first. 

My advise to get through the holidays, especially if you are new to sobriety.  First of all, consider just not going to the optional parties, where you are not expected to go. 

2nd, if you have to go, go early and leave early. Leave before it gets sloppy. 

3rd get a hold of a nice sparkling water and jazz it up with garnish, to make it look like you have an alcoholic drink; that way people won’t keep asking if you want a drink. 

If anyone questions why you are not drinking, have your go to answers ready. Eg. I’m driving, I’m taking it easy tonight, I have a big day tomorrow  I’ve already had enough. Or I blast them with the truth, “I have a problem controlling how much I drink, so it’s just easier if I don’t. 

Be strong, have fun watching everyone else get stupid. Be proud of yourself; it’s not easy but is so worth it. Each event you go to will be easier, because you KNOW you can do it. 

4th. Reward yourself. Did someone say ice cream with heated chocolate syrup? Think about how much better you are without alcohol. Enjoy waking up feeling great, remembering everything about that party. 

Good luck my friends. Happy dry holidays. 

I will not drink with you today,

My body feels like it's dying and recently I have been puking every single day, barely able to eat but still grabbing the bottle. My memory is complete shit, I'm 25 and get shakes so bad some days I can't even use my phone or laptop.

The way I've been making my body feel has been so incredibly awful that I know it's time for a change. This past week I've been trying to drink less and keep up on basic things like house work and hygiene. I didn't drink last night and I will not be drinking tonight.

I work swing shift and I usually even have a beer or two before I sleep in the mornings when I am on night shift. The day I come off night shift is the hardest for me. I am already tired and stressed and usually end up drinking on the couch starting around 5pm until I pass out. Tomorrow is that day.

Probably facing eviction, not many options, not much money","I quit drinking I think 76 days ago. But it wasn't enough. I've lived for so long hiding in my house like a scared little mouse, I've let things fall into disrepair, I've damaged the apartment I'm in, the house is full of clutter and filth.

Now I have an inspection on Friday at 9am. Almost certainly, I will be found out and evicted. Not my first eviction either but at least the previous one was 8 years ago.

Got a friend lined up so I can have somewhere to sleep for a couple of weeks, should be able to save up some money by then, and hopefully if I have an eviction but at least have the first month's rent and a security deposit in cash, some shitty little dangerous place in a terrible neighborhood will take me. I won't likely starve or freeze to death. So that's all good.

But now I have to clean up this huge mess I've made and get rid of clutter, wash a bunch of clothes, get rid of aome unsightly furniture, and try to hide what I have damaged to try to survive the inspection.

I'm so ashamed of myself. I'm so embarrassed and feel so small. Ready to burst into tears and feel like just running away, anywhere, to escape this. My anxiety is through the roof and my depression is through the floor. I can hardly make myself move. I do a bunch of work and then take a look around and it still looks just the same.

Things were turning around. I quit drinking and started feeling better and was chiselling away at this pig sty, starting to get my affairs back in order. I just talked to my parents this weekend and told them how I was feeling better and making slow progress.

And I had planned to go on monday and start the process of getting medications going again and really trying to turn things around.

And then I found out I have an immanent inspection coming up woth a landlord who has been good to me but also knows I am a problem that he will have to fix. He's going to be so pissed and almost surely evict me.

I found a bottle of peppermint schnapps, unopened, that somehow got lost in the mess and forgotten about. And now I've gone from having almost no cravings or interest in alcohol for 76 days to desperately wanting to crack that fucking bottle open and drink half of it in a gulp so I can stop feeling so horribly terrified for just a little while.

I haven't drank it and don't want to, but a part of me is demanding that I do. My mind is telling me that if I just get drunk I will feel better and not scared and worried anymore. That if I get drunk I can put my fears aside and really get some work done. But if that's true then how did I get in this shameful mess in the first place?

I want so bad to say that I will not drink with you today, but I just don't feel the conviction in my heart.

Earlier this year I made an effort to track all my drinking. I didn't want my consumption to get out of control. I wanted to be honest about how much alcohol I was using. A check on my calendar means I didn't drink. An X means I had that number of standard units. 

April, May, June, July, August... I wouldn't call it winning. There were stretches of a few days, maybe a week. Then back to the bottle. 

The last day I drank was a friend's birthday party in August. I was only there for 2 hours. Someone else still had to drive me home. 

I wasn't blacked out, but I remember trying to calculate just how drunk I could get on the free booze. They had margarita mix. It tasted weak to me--was there any booze in there at all? Better top it off from the open tequila bottle, just in case. 

I'm not sure what changed. I guess I got sick and tired of being sick and tired. I tried to go through with things one day at a time. One important difference was not being sober to ""take a break"", but rather being sober without having the intention to return to drinking some day. September, October, November--THAT WAS WINNING!

I don't pretend to be some master of sobriety, and this is just my experience. 

But if you fail, you don't have to give up. You don't have to go back. You can go forward, no matter how many times you've fallen before.",106

I'm looking for a new recovery-related podcast to listen to during long runs/exercise that doesn't involve 12-step-related material, falls within the ""mystical""/pseudoscience realm, Annie Grace, or female-specific topics. I know that's really specific and eliminates the vast majority of them, but I guess I'm just looking for something more geared toward young men that features secular content. Topics like ""being a sober young professional,"" dating, raising a family, the latest research on addiction, etc. Just more secular, tangible things not specific to any particular modality of recovery.

I hope that's not construed as being dismissive of all that other stuff, it's more I already have other means and avenues for acquiring that line of content and am looking to expand with something that's new to me that I haven't been able to find.

Here's what I already listen to/have listened to in the past:

I am so over some people at work. I knock things out of the park for them and then they are right back to negativity and asking for more! Agh! Stop it.

Fuck! That’s alcohol!

I was kinda in shock a little bit. And a minute or so later:

“Weeeeellllll.... 



if I’ve already had one.....”


I had to stop that thought dead in its tracks. 

I’m still not 100% sure it was alcohol or if I was getting that weird thing where you sometimes feel a bit drunk just because everyone else around you is.

Withdrawal symptoms have faded, my sleep is getting back to normal, my appetite is back with a vengeance and I'm hungry all the time. My head is clear, my thoughts feel more real and solid. But that last bit is coming with a new problem all its own. 

My brain is trying to negotiate with me. When opportunities to drink arise, I find myself thinking hey...I've been so good for two whole weeks. Surely I can have a beer or a glass of wine without feeling bad about it? I deserve to relax a little, don't I? 

I don't want to go there. I don't want that grasping, needy feeling that comes with having some but not as much as my craving wants. Because that's the worst part. Not the first drink, but all the ones that come after, the ones that steal my eloquence, my sense, my memories, my time, my money, my pride. I don't want to go back to day 1, hurting and hating myself for having no self-control. It isn't worth it. 

The little voice in my head doesn't feel the same way. It's resentful at others, having fun with their drinking. It's annoyed at all the holiday memes and advertising that centre around booze. It's afraid we'll be a party pooper if we're sober, that we're missing out on a good time by not accepting that glass when it's offered to us.

2019-12-03 13:34:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e5leib/3_years_my_experience/,3 Years: My Experience,"This is going to be long, but, it's my journey so far to three years:

Tomorrow will be 3 years since I quit drinking.  I'd like to share my experience in hopes that it will help others.  I wake up every day and still feel like it's all a dream.  I question whether I really did quit or if somehow I missed something and I am just confused.  But then I get through the day and realize, alcohol is no longer a daily part of my life.  I still think about it on a daily, almost hourly basis, but I know now that I will not drink anymore.  Every once in a while I find myself still wondering what it would be like to partake and join others...but I quickly remind myself of all the horrors that came with my drinking.

When I first decided to quit I was at a very low point.  I hated myself and I was full of shame and regret.  I drank every day, whether by myself or with friends.  I binge drank and blacked out on a regular basis and every time I woke up afterwards wishing I could stop.  I really didn't think it was possible.  Alcohol was like getting dressed to me...it was just something that came with the day.  However, it got to the point that I just couldn't handle the stress anymore.  I decided I would try.  The first time I made it about two months and then decided I would drink again.  I planned to drink and was happy with my decision.  I felt I had proved to myself I could quit for a period of time and that it somehow meant I could control my drinking.  After that first drink after the two months off, I quickly went back into drinking heavily every day and once again hated myself and became full of shame and regret.  I kept telling myself I was unworthy of happiness and didn't even like looking at myself in the mirror.  I continued this for another 8-9 months and then on December 4, 2016 I decided it was time.  This time I would stick to my guns and begin a new chapter.  The first year was full of pink clouds and excitement.  It was also full of boredom and anger...fear and uncertainty.  I felt great getting to know myself and realized things were a lot easier when alcohol wasn't involved.  I tried new things and took myself out of my comfort zone.  I also found that I lost a lot of friends and would have to learn to be comfortable being bored.  I would stay in most weekends because all I knew was social drinking and going to the bar.  At first it was tough.  I hated feeling like I was missing out on the nightlife and social interactions.  However, I kept reminding myself how awful I felt when I was drinking and all the shame and regret.

The first year overall was quick and exciting.  You find that the milestones make everything move quickly and you feel accomplished.  My first date sober...first wedding sober...first sexual experience sober...first move sober.  It feels great because everything comes with a sense of accomplishment.  Whatever happens you still know that you are at least winning at one thing: sobriety.  I still have that feeling, just now it's become the norm.

The second year things started to calm down.  I began to realize this was the new norm and life still has it's ups and downs.  You will still be bored, sad, angry, anxious, happy, excited, and everything else.  However, you have to realize how to cope with these emotions being sober.  I realized I still have anxiety and I am sad sometimes...and it's normal.  The good thing is that I now know it isn't just because of alcohol.  It's just part of my chemical makeup and fortunately, there are things that can help.  I reached new levels of success in my career, physical activity, social interactions, you name it.  It was awesome (still is).  I tried new things and pushed myself further getting to know my true self.  I realized alcohol wasn't the only thing causing negative experiences in my life.  I found that at times I was weak mentally and physically and that it was part of life.  I can be lazy, undisciplined, annoying, rude, and even mean at times.  That is part of being a human.  However, what I discovered was that now I was choosing to be these things and therefore, I could chose how to respond to different things.  It's okay to have these reactions, it's a great feeling to know they are coming from a real place based on real emotion.

My third year summed up in one word would be: sobering.  This past year has been a bit of an eye opener.  I really started to settle into who I am and what I like and don't like.  I realized that I tend to make a lot of excuses and can easily become unmotivated and bored if I don't constantly stay busy and active.  I realized that life can be hard and sometimes you are going to be disappointed, being without alcohol doesn't change that. Most importantly, I realized that I was in control of my actions and how I view my life.  I can be lazy and eat like shit and become mad at myself but at the end of the day that is my choice.  I could instead, decide to work out and eat right and find myself happy and energetic.  Also my choice.  Either way, no one is to blame but myself.  I've gone through a range of emotions.  I've been high on life at my best and also in a very dark place at times.  I still never considered alcohol as the answer.  I did, however, realize I could control how I responded to those feelings.  Recently I've been pulling myself out of a bit of depression.  I realized I was tired all the time and constantly questioning myself.  I also realized I had been eating pretty poorly and hadn't been very active.  I went to a therapist and talked it through.  I started working out more frequently (you gotta force yourself) and eating better.  I don't want to say I'm fully in the clear but I feel a million times better.

If you've read this far I imagine this either resonates with you in some way or you are looking for some guidance and/or maybe some insight or expectations for the road ahead.  My life is 100% better without alcohol.  By far the best decision I have ever made.  If we are going off my little sober calculator, I've saved \~$31,000.  I haven't been in any legal trouble, I've been a great friend and family member, I've experienced things I couldn't have dreamed of, dated some wonderful people, and all around did some pretty awesome things in the last three years.  However, it is important to realize that life still happens and just because you don't have alcohol in your life doesn't mean everything will be perfect.  You will have to find out about yourself and what makes you, you.  I can tell you that it will be a much better experience if you are anything like what I used to be.  Hang in there new people, everything you are experiencing is normal.  Don't overwhelm yourself and try and focus on the day ahead.  Get through today and let the rest fall into place.  Before you know it you will be at three years looking forward to what is ahead.  

&#x200B;

TLDR: You will experience a range of emotions and challenges, all that matters is that you don't drink today.",114

My good family friend was singing, so it was important to go and support him. The holidays have always been a big drinking celebration for my family and friends, and pretty much every December for the past 10 years have been spent in a blur of getting smashed at every single party or occasion, which has been the normal as everyone in my family (and my husband's) is a very heavy drinker.

I was feeling really nervous about going, as at least a few drinks are included for free with the event. Also, I wasn't sure what the experience was going to be like and if I'd a. be able to say no and b. if I'd have even a shred of fun being sober while everyone else around me got plastered.

I am so glad I went!! It was a wonderful time. Drank club soda and lime and had almost no pressure from anyone (who were grateful for my free drink tickets which I handed out). Had a blast talking and connecting with everyone. I honestly felt like it was the funniest, happiest, and most social I have been in years at this type of gathering. Normally I'd be completely focused on my drink levels, how much was left, how much wine was on the table, how fast I could drink without looking like a drunk, how much food I could eat without ruining my buzz, how many more drinks I'd be able to order before we left, how much I could have when we got home, and the list goes on.

It made me realize how mentally exhausting drinking can be, and how I was never able to enjoy the company, the music, the food, and the wonderful people around me when my mind was totally focused on where my next drink was coming from. Instead I got to have great talks with everyone, crack jokes, be engaged, support my friend and his amazing voice, really enjoy the food in front of me, and take in the pleasure of the experience and the great feelings that came along with it. So much better than any temporary alcohol buzz. Plus seeing everyone's eyes eventually glaze over as they got louder and sloppier didn't make me miss it one bit.

So happy to wake up fresh and hydrated, clear and happy for the day and appreciative of a wonderful sober night! I can really see now how great life can be without constantly poisoning my body, mind, and emotions. IWNDWYT!!",8

Will this pass after time or is this a new addiction I need to learn how to manage?

2019-12-03 12:26:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e5kdom/36m_i_cant_remember_the_last_weekend_i_wasnt/,[36M] I can't remember the last weekend I wasn't hungover... since high school.,"I can't continue wasting weekend after weekend after weekend my whole life. I truly can't remember a weekend I went from Thursday to Monday without getting somewhere between pretty drunk and blackout drunk.

*See TLDR at the end for a summary.*

This past weekend finally did it. 

I got blackout drunk on Thursday night and was hungover until Sunday morning. Thank god my girlfriend was away at a girls' weekend, so I could wallow privately and not have another person witness how utterly useless I was.

Of course, no one I was hanging out with on Thursday noticed how drunk I was. Everyone remembers a fun time, maybe a bit sloppy, but overall the consensus was that I was fine. That is until my friend gave me bumps of cocaine to wake me up for my walk home at 4am. I have almost no recollection of how I got home, just flashes here and there.

At 16, I destroyed my first relationship due to alcohol. I got so wasted on a camping trip that my girlfriend broke up with me the next day. I still can't remember exactly what happened.

At university, I remember being proud and bragging that I had been to the pub 6 nights in a row and been smashed each every night -- check out the stamina on this guy! 

Still in university, I cheated on every girlfriend I had through the years I was there.  One, in particular, sticks with me. I ruined that relationship due to excessive drinking and being selfish and hedonistic. If I could go back, I'd marry this person. She was fantastic and would've married me if I had asked. No, she did not know I had cheated, so she's probably better off despite my regrets.

After university, the self-destruction of relationships with great women continues until I'm about 33. However, this period is best marked by my career self-sabotage and general lack of applying myself due to either thinking I'm better than the job or simply being hungover 50+% of the time and not being able to perform. There were at least three instances where my career really could have taken off and mentors stuck their necks out for me, but I fucked them all up by not admitting my faults and rising to the occasion.

One notable instance: I was invited to join a startup company at a very early stage, they ended up being very successful. At the time, my then girlfriend and I were doing a lot of cocaine to help support the drinking addiction we both had/have. We did it enough that I, an outwardly healthy 28 year old male, got pneumonia and was bed-ridden for \~6 weeks. I went MIA for the time I was sick, wallowing in my sickness. When I felt better, I expected the offer to still be around. Of course, they laughed when I got back in touch and had moved on weeks prior. Also, we kept going to the bar while I was sick. The cocaine stopped though, temporarily.

This period was also marked by constantly shifting groups of friends. It's much easier to keep up heavy drinking and party drugs when the people around you don't know you that well and still think it's fun! This is an old story I've read on here a few times, so the details are unimportant.

There's probably more I can't think of right now. My memory is hazy, obviously.

**TLDR: Life Damage Tally**

* 5 major relationships destroyed. Any one of them would have been great life partners had I been able to commit.
* At least 4 excellent job/business opportunities wasted. All would've launched my career to another level.
* Uncountable number of former friends who saw me completely blackout/high. I'd be ashamed to run across them in the street. 
* Uncountable number of times I've bailed on former and current friends with no notice because I was so hungover.
* Uncountable number of family/life events I've missed because I was so hungover.

This is my confession and admission of failure.  
I can't control my drinking and I need to break my patterns and learn how to do better.

I bought the Naked Mind last night and am reading it.  
That's the first concrete step I've ever taken to address this. Writing this is step two.

I gotta start somewhere.",8

Btw, I live in TN. I had to go to court today regarding an order of protection filed against me from my wife last week. My attorney has been ill so we had to get a continuance.

Unfortunately, my wife's attorney told me they were also filing for divorce. This is crushing! I've never even considered a life without her. We have a child who isn't a teenager yet.

Now my focus turns to my son and his happiness. Unfortunately the order of protection doesn't allow me any contact with him either, and the next court date is a month away. 

Despite this being the worst day of my life, I have no desire to drink. I'll continue going to my AA meeting today, as well as my first ever outpatient treatment program this evening.

Thanks for reading.

Edit:

First, I've read the messages and appreciate them all. As I've gone through the day and been scared, nervous, mad, sad, and more, I realized is that my desire not to drink is because I'm so scared and troubled. Nothing would help!

I got sober off alcohol 7.5 months ago. I live in one of the largest, spread out cities in the US, Los Angeles. Since then, I’ve only used Uber or Lyft 10 times (mostly used for appointments). The previous 7.5 months, my accounts were used 60 times (not including the times my husband or friends foot the ride). And none of those for appointments. All either for going out while get fucked up and a handful because I was too hungover to get to/from work. Which was LESS than a mile away. And I can WALK because the weather is usually gorgeous here. 

NOW: Although I still go out on occasion, I can drive myself. When folks get too wonky for my taste at that certain hour, I get to drive myself home, wash my face, brush my teeth, go to bed, wake up hours before most of them and get a bunch of cool shit done in the AM. 100% HANGXIETY FREE. As a former blackout artist, I didn’t know this was in the cards for me. I felt truly hopeless and defeated at one time. 

It has taken a lot to get here and I stay vigilant about my inner work. A few things that have helped me in my recovery as a woman in my mid-30s:

- AA (although I don’t affiliate with the program much anymore, it was clutch for the first few months. It was there that I realized I was not alone and that there was hope and a solution). 

- r/StopDrinking. I had been stalking y’all for YEARS. Resetting my badge in hopes that I could have the freedom I saw here. Going out for more “field research.” Reset. Repeat. 

- This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. 

- A lot of podcasts (Recovery Elevator, Recovery HH, Recovering From Reality, Recovery Rocks, That Sober Guy, The SHAIR Podcast, HOME Podcast, Under The Skin and a bunch of others that weren’t sobriety-centric but really helped me grow on my spiritual practice). 

- A supportive husband who, himself, very rarely drinks anymore. He came to his own realizations after reading Annie Grace’s book and seeing the change in me. Our relationship has grown so deep. I feel heard, supported and loved. He may not understand what alcohol did to me on a deeper level and may not have the tendencies that I did, but he saw it for what it is: poison. ☠️ 

- I burned the goddamn ships and was HONEST with my family, my friends, my spouse, and most of all, myself! Most of them knew I had issues, but not necessarily the severity of it.

The shackles of toxicity that bound me are gone and for that alone, I am eternally grateful. My sobriety may not look like yours. And yours may not look like that one guy with the funny username and intense life story. And I have realized that is OK! We are all learning how to navigate life at the same time on this same earth with varying circumstances. Freedom lies within recognition, forgiveness and understanding. We have to be willing to be taught, be honest and be loved. Love ourselves, first and foremost, and extend that to others. 

I love you and am grateful to be on this journey with you. I support you! IWNDWYT 💚",289

5 days later after a stay in the ICU with a blood transfusion and an IV drip, I was on a plane to a rehab in Ft. Lauderdale. When I got home, the real recovery started: Sugar cravings, sleepless nights, AA meetings that alternated between being extremely helpful and incredibly moronic.

I didn't lose weight at first, I wasn't magically happy overnight - in fact I was super angry and bitter for a couple of months until I got that under control, and I felt like everyone was in on a huge con that I had fell for.

But it did get better. I started losing weight, I was happy again for the first time in years for no apparent reason, I bought a home, my cat stopped smelling my breath when I picked her up (yeah - that's a real thing - super weird but true, when she'd smell booze, she'd scratch me to get away), I made new friends which is not an easy thing to do over the age of 12, I stopped lurking here and became active, one user here recommended The Naked Mind (READ IT) which helped tremendously, and I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything anymore. Now, I feel like an asshole for pissing away so many good years fucked up on booze that I can't remember.

Is my life perfect yet, hell no, it probably never will be, but I know whatever life throws at me, I'll be facing it with a clear mind and IWNDWYT my friends.

TLDR (I fucked up my health/life drinking - Things got better after six months sober)

2019-12-03 10:38:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e5itnv/playing_hockey_again_coaching_now_too/,"Playing hockey again, coaching now too!","Just thought I'd share my latest joy brought to me thanks to being sober. My entire life, from the age of 4 through the age of 21 I was essentially a rink rat. I played hockey year round and I was quite good at it too. Unfortunately I didn't really have the size or the dedication to push beyond playing highschool and some Junior level hockey on the east coast of the US. But man, I loved it. My dad did too.

Post highschool, I sort of took a break from hockey for a while when I was away living (drinking excessively) at college. But I kept playing for a few more years up until I was about 21-22. But in the last few years actually making it through a day sober enough to go play a game that night became harder, and harder, and eventually impossible. My last year playing men's league with my friends on our team I was a complete wreck. I'd start drinking at 9am, try to take a nap around 5-6pm and then try and crush down 1/2 pint  of vodka and some weed before playing a game at 9-10pm.

I'd be a shell of a person out there, completely useless and only trying to get through to the postgame locker room beers. I eventually stopped going and nobody on my team really seemed to mind that the drunk guy wasn't out there taking shit penalties and not contributing.

That commenced an almost 10 year hiatus, during which team my alcoholism completely took over my life. I've shared that story here before so I don't need to go through it again.

I am coming up on 2 years sober in April 2020 and I feel like I'm doing great. My mind and body are healthier and happier than they've ever been. My wife's cousin lives in my town and he posted on facebook his pick up league was looking for some guys to play early on Sunday evenings. A push from her and before you know it I'm signed up.

That first week was horrendous! I barely remembered how to skate and I'm super out of shape (a solid 50lbs heavier than my playing weight). But I managed to make it through and I didnt throw up or get hurt so I chocked that up as a win. The next day I was shocked at how well my body responded to the game. Sore, but not dying. Even during the game I noticed that I was obviously gassed but I didn't feel the urge to throw up or to grab some sweet liquor to keep me going. I was just able to do it, it wasn't a big thing. My body could handle it and I'm making some new friends in the process.

I should also mention we play at a highschool so no beers/weed in the locker room afterwards either which is a bonus.

During this time my son started doing learn to skate. At some point during his first few sessions the guy who ran it came over to me, he said ""you skate?"" and 5 minutes later I was signed up to be a coach in my towns local youth hockey program.

I can't tell you how happy/proud I am in this moment. Whenever you start to doubt the sober life, I want you to think about all the experiences and opportunities that may come your way at any point in time. If you're sober you'll be able to take them on if you want to. If you were in your alcoholic state, would you jump at those opportunities or would you sulk back to your bottle? I know what I would do, and damn I'm glad I'm sober.",15

I also started bodybuilding/weight training for the first time in my life at about the same time( first workout was day 3 of sobriety). I like to go by weeks because I meal prep weekly, my workout plan is broken down weekly, and for sobriety, it’s a commitment to the week that I make, which has been a better time than daily to manage because I can tell my cravings “if I want to drink, I’ll re-evaluate that choice next Tuesday. “

So. 8 weeks sober. Just moved into my first apartment on my own for the first time in 7 years. I’ve had bad relationships or a less than desirable roommate situation for most of that time. This morning I woke up, made coffee, knowing I would have a clean coffee cup to put it in and a clean comfortable space to enjoy said coffee. So grateful for this place.

On Sunday when I moved in, I had the desire to drink but quickly thought better of it. I thought about having to clean up spilled drinks, possibly getting lost in my own apartment resulting in my peeing somewhere I wouldn’t if I were sober, thought about falling, injuring myself, getting a noise complaint from said fall from the downstairs neighbors. Thought about what Would happen to me if I were passed out drunk and there was a structure fire. Thought about the money I would end up spending if I started drinking like I used to (which, if I had one, I would eventually do again). Not to mention the hard work I’ve put in 6 days a week 1.5-3 hours a day in the gym, dieting, etc. not worth it. 

I feel like I have started embracing and believing the truth that alcohol will and has previously destroyed everything I want. In the last week strong cravings have changed into pop up bad ideas that I quickly rationalize away. Idk if anyone can relate, but in large quiet spaces sometimes I would get the thought/urge to yell something inappropriate. I would never act on it, and never had to worry to much about acting on it. It’s just a thought that I quickly think better of. I feel like drinking is becoming like that now. 

I’ll end with this...I was scared about moving because of finances/never being able to live on my own successfully in the past, but I make considerably more money than I have before, I’m working a job I love and therefore have no desire to leave it, and when I don’t drink, I feel more capable, disciplined, and able to handle stress without taking drastic measures.

I'm going to my work holiday party in a week and a half from now. I really didn't want to. Not just out of fear that I'll want to drink, but also because I have no desire to be around drunk people.

The good news is, I don't think she drinks, and if she does, she seems to be one who would be reserved about it. I simply plan on attending, taking some time to connect with her, and then politely saying my goodbyes early, with one excuse or another.

I don't have to feel like s\*\*\* anymore. I'm past the lapse in reason that led me to poison myself again. Each relapse is shorter than the last, with more time between relapses.

And this time the relief I feel in putting the bottle down is stronger than the relief I felt when I picked it up. I'm spiraling out, reaching my escape velocity. Breaking chains. Feeling free. Thanks for reading.",61

It was hard and there were many points I almost cracked. The first couple of hours were the worst. I invited more people than my apartment could handle and that stressed me out. Many times I felt like everyone was having fun without me and my brain was trying to trick me into thinking that a drink was what I needed to start enjoying myself. 

I’m lucky that my friends are so supportive and helped remind me why it was important that I stay true to my promise to myself. Before long I was settling into the night and I noticed that I was still having engaging conversations, laughing and dancing but I was experiencing it without the usual alcohol fuelled panic that nobody likes me and they’re all just tolerating me. I didn’t cry about an ex or yell at a friend or pass out. I got to be truely present and enjoy a lovely evening with my friends who all made the effort to come over and celebrate my birthday. 

Choosing to go sober was hard. Reminding myself of why I want to be sober, as the shame of my last blackout gets more distant, is a daily challenge. This group is such a lovely safe place to retreat to when I start to feel like a drink is my only escape so thank you for your posts. 

Without this group I don’t think I’d have successfully partied sober into the morning of day 28.

Thank you everyone for the comments and support! I've read every comment and there's some gold nuggets of wisdom that I have taken to heart.

I noticed a few common themes amongst the comments.  The younger crowd seems to be under served and finds it harder to relate to the older crowd.  If you think about it, this mathematically checks out. Once an alcoholic always an alcoholic, right? So an old guy in his 70s that's been sober for 40 years and going to aa almost every day has attended over 10,000 meetings, so the old crowd is going to stack up like Cord wood. By comparison, the 20s crowd won't have a fraction of the presence. I don't know how to better help the 20 somethings. I'm pushing 50 myself so I can relate to the older crowd and the younger ones. 

Yes, the methodology is perhaps outdated, but the saying 'take what you need and leave the rest' really applies here, and everywhere.

It's been a motto of mine for a damn long time.

Personally, every time I hear the word God, I think ""quantum energy"". God isn't some bearded white guy sitting up in the clouds keeping track of you like Jolly St nick. Is quantum energy all knowing? Damn right it is. Take what you need and leave (or substitute) the rest. 

I also hear a lot of you (especially 20s) getting put off by Assholes. This isn't specific to AA per se. There are Assholes everywhere. Perhaps there are a few more in AA - as someone said - it's a roomful of drunks after all.

I've had to learn to deal with Assholes my entire life. It takes time and experience to figure out how to deal with them and not take it personally. A lot of times, what the AH is saying isn't about you, it's about their own problems - so let it slide off your back like bird shit and move on. 

I happen to split time living in two different cities (life's complicated) and will be attending different meetings today and tomorrow than my experience last weekend. It'll be interesting to see how they compare 

Thanks again for taking the time to read this and comment! 

Today is day 4.

ORIGINAL POST:


I've been to two different groups over the weekend and it definitely wasn't what I thought it would be.

The first was an open discussion group of about 30 people, the 2nd was a bigger group of about 75 which was a big book discussion. 


I had a preconceived notion that it was religious and cult like, combined with the stigma of the label ""alcoholic"" and the stereotypical movie depicting an AA meeting as full of miserable dry alcoholics struggling to get through life. These kept me from considering AA for a long time. 

My experience this weekend shattered these notions. What I found was a group of people who were happy and enjoying their sober life: using the meetings to connect, build healthy relationships, socialize, and use their group time to gain strength and insight from each other and to help those still struggling.

It is not a religious organization. Yes, many meetings are conducted inside churches, but that's just because the rent is cheap. Some mention God, others a higher power and others not at all.

If you're thinking about going, or even if you're not, you should check out the faqs on the aa website to learn exactly what aa is and what it is not.

Also, if you are thinking about going, don't think you have to become sober or be perfect to step foot inside. I heard several people describe how they would show up to meetings in various stages of drunkenness and it took them months to years to get sober. 

Lastly whatever horrible and stupid things you may have done drunk, others have done that - and worse and somehow got through it. 

I hope they can help you too. 

I'm on day 3.

I wanna preface this by saying that I dont wanna drink, I just feel horrible about this and dont know what to do to fix this","So long story short, I have a 9 y/o brother that I was in the father role for and helped raise, until I moved out of state a couple years ago. He came to my grandma's to visit this past summer and I went to spend a few days with him at granny's house, he was so excited.

 I had drunkenly told him that I'd take him to an amusement park, to a water park, to the aquarium, Legoland etc, just building his hopes, just like my pips used to do to me. What really ended up happening is us hanging out outside at the park for a couple days with me hungover as fuck, and also drinking at the same time. I slept at my granny's house and in a hungover daze at 9am, I hear my granny telling him to go wake me up and with the sweetest sad voice he said that he didn't want to bother me, so he sat in the dinning room patiently until my drunk ass stumbled up the hallway. 

He's back at moms house in another state and idk what to do to make it up to him, my little man. I just remembered about all that, this morning at work and I need to fix this, I just dont know how.

I have more money which is nice. But I'm seeing that there's even bigger changes to be made and that almost paralyses me with fatigue. I drank/drink (never say never, just not for today) because it allows me to just quit worrying for a while, but then once I was done holding that wave back it would just come crashing stronger than ever and leave me feeling like I was fighting for life for the next few days.

Ahh.. last night, after re-experiencing a domino effect of hardcore triggers.. followed by triggered dream, using dream.. sucky wake up - I read some magical quotes from this community that I have written on my fridge,  then, challenged my self to step out of 'Option A' ( obsessively catastrophizing the shit out of triggers until there is nothing left but a manifestation of my FEAR) ..breathe..slow down.. why not try mindfulness rather than sinking into 'comfortable' insane stress induced cravings..  

I was able to shift my perspective a tiny bit and made up my mind to go with option B! younger me didn't have the language, skills, esteem or coping to even know there was an Option B out there in life <3

Option B was freaking unreal. I had the best time instead of the worst, ran into friendly folk, and gently placed myself in an environment that I used to love, but avoided going due to a poor experience, only to have a positive one.

Later, after narcy mother got up in my space, I told her to please be able to respect what I am doing, .. Wrote out my boundaries, limitations and responsibilities to myself. and this time, rather than emailing them to my narcy mother and expecting her to be accountable,  (she probably would love any neg/ or pos. reaction/ attention anyways), I emailed them to myself!

The chronic body pain that I carry on my neck and back has shifted.. I'm letting fo of all my belongings that were gifted by toxic peeps/ remind me of bad times.. got by herbal teapot flowing..  rather than past survival skills of brutalizing my self through substance abuse, re-victimization, mental health torture.. rinse-repeat. -I'm here sharing with all y'alls who give hope and inspire me to be a better version of me - for me. 

All I knew was a life worth dying. Change, growth, and treating myself like I would treat Bae is a life worth living.

I want and need to stop for myself and my relationship with my partner. About 2 1/2 years ago I started smoking pot heavily for six months. As soon as I gave that up I replaced it with copious amounts of alcohol. I’ve had a lot of trauma and know I am using this as a crutch. It’s so weird because I feel like my substance abuse problem came out of nowhere as I had never had a problem with control in regards to this in the past.
My drinking has caused countless problems and I want to be sober. Despite this, I find it so hard to fight the cravings. I can go a week or two but always end up caving in to my impulses. Especially if I have been doing really good and something bad happens.
It also doesn’t help that I am barley the legal age to drink (22) and most of my friends, family and coworkers are all drinkers. My boyfriend has completely stopped in hopes to encourage me to do the same. I know he hates alcohol because of me. 
I feel like being sober would be so hard to explain to everyone and frankly a little embarrassing if I’m honest. My family knows my struggles and yet they still push alcohol on me during dinners and events. Several times I have been asked “what’s the matter with me” if I don’t want to drink multiple glasses of wine with everyone. This is especially hard with the holidays and all of the upcoming events I will have to attend. I feel bad that it seems like everyone else can handle alcohol but I can’t.

The interesting part is he recently has had some bad stomach issues which caused him to stop drinkng for a week or so. We had a good chat and I just mentioned that my stomach got much better when I stopped drinking. He skips right over that topic and says it's probably because of his diet that he feels this way. Sure enough two days later he says his stomach feels better. So he proceeds to crack a beer while we're gaming. Hours later he's clearly drunk. I get the same drunk morning texts the day after.

Today marks two years since the death of my dog. During that time, i had already been drinking heavily for a year, but it was always in a social setting, with friends. I also went through a reaaaally bad breakup around the same time too. So, a month after i had to put my dog, the goodest girl in the whole world, down, i turned 21. And since then, for nearly two years I’ve been drinking just about every single day. 

It hurts when i think about her, her time here really was so short, but with a sober mind i can see that all of our time here is relatively short. Time flies by so fast, even when life feels so still. These past two years have been so lonely, i lost all hope for myself- the tiny amount that i even had to begin with. But I couldnt see how drinking was causing that loneliness. I knew that i was choosing drinking over going outside and facing the world, but I couldn’t push myself to stay on the path of recovery for more than a day. 

Then, i found this subreddit, and ive gotta say, seeing all these people with similar experiences really helps me, and i make it a goal every day to be able to post “end of day _” at the end of each day. So far, its working. Im holding myself accountable because of you guys, because i dont want my family to suffer any more, and because i want to live a happy life. 

Nothing can bring back my sweet girl. I have her ashes, her old collar and leash, but thats all that remains along with her memories and photos. She is gone. But I don’t want my family to mourn my death as i mourn my dog’s. So, i have to keep fighting.

My parents recently adopted a little dog, and hes crazy, but deep down hes a sweet boi. He just wants to play. I like him. I try to treat him as if he were her, which is impossible most of the time because they are polar opposites in appearance and personality, but when he falls asleep in my arms and i kiss his head i picture him being her. It helps me, and i know having him also helps my parents.

Goodnight everybody, IWNDWYT.",5

A little over 8 months.,"Nothing much to say - other than I'm here - a little over 8 months in.  That's Easter, July 4th, All Summer, Labor Day, Memorial Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, my 23rd anniversary, my birthday, my wife's, 5 kids' birthdays, and probably a lot more.  At this point, I haven't convinced myself that I'll never drink again - just that I need to see a year through - experience one of every important day sober.  I have at least 6 cases of wine in my cellar and full handles of gin and whiskey in the pantry - not even tempted anymore.

In the beginning, I was here all day every day.  I tried getting healthier; lost some weight, then ended up in the hospital (SUPER ironic that what I got wouldn't have happened if I were drinking!) - but carried through living my life.  Now I don't think to even check in here that often except when I'm curious to see where my count is at.

LOTS of times I've thought I'd love a drink - nobody would know the difference... I've done well - I can blow it off for a day - but that counter keeps me honest, as it's the only true place that has a record of my sobriety date - and this forum right here is the only place I've talked openly and honestly about it - not even with my wife, who thought I was bad, but really had no idea just how bad.

Keep it up, all - it's not that big of a jump to get from ""I can't get past day 4"" to where I'm at.  It just takes pushing through just a little bit more.  Like learning to ride a bike, or learning to water ski or wakeboard (just gotta hold on 2 more seconds, and you're up!) - you can do it.",21

I've tried several times. I always seem to fall back off the wagon. But I'm trying to remind myself of all of the things I hate about being so dependent on alcohol. While I worry a lot about all of the typical things, I think one of the things I hate about it the most is the extent to which I fixate on it. I walk home from work and every bar I pass beckons to me. When my partner and I pick up a bottle of wine, I drink almost all of it and hope that somehow he won't notice (I'm sure he does). Sometimes I'll be having a bad day at work and I feel this lift in spirit when I decide that I will let myself pick up a bottle on the way home. Then I hate myself so much afterwards.

But it just takes over. It's everything. It's this permanent, sinister backdrop. That's what I hate so very much. I do find that when I've had successful stretches without drinking for a while, that preoccupation fades and it's a sign to me that I can do this if I just let myself. If I work at it I might be able to do it.

Thanks for listening, everyone. I really find this community to be therapeutic and it's truly one of the most positive places on the internet. IWNDWYT.",8

I still crave alcohol, but physically I feel better. From getting up early to going about my day to day activities. I know this is the right choice. 

It's my girlfriends Christmas staff party this evening that I wish I could make it to. However, I know I'm not far enough in my sobriety to not be tempted in such a social environment. Its moment like these I wish I could control myself. Unfortunately this the hand I've been dealt. So I'm going to a meeting instead which my girlfriend totally understands, and is supportive of. It's funny because even if I wasnt sober the chances of me making an ass out of myself would be high and it probably be better I didnt go anyways.

I'm worried about the next coming days. I've usually relapsed around the 10 day mark. Which is somthing I need to be aware of but not ponder on to badly. That being said I'm excited for the next part of my journey. This time around I chose to be sober. Not because I was embarred over somthing I did. Not because I was become overly ill, but because I felt like it was the right thing to do.

I wish you all the best with your journeys.

I found this subreddit a few months ago. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/cx2t2b/i_want_to_want_to_stop_drinking_how_does_one_do_it/ 
After some lurking and reading I decided to take a break. I did so with the mindset of ""it doesn't have to be forever"" as many had recommended here. I tapered down my drinking: a 12pack a day for a few days, then 10, then 8, until I got down to 2, then I stopped completely on 9/14 The first couple weeks were easy as there was the excitement of trying to get sober and healthy. After that it got a bit harder. Beer has been such a big part of my life for so long, everything I did outside of work I found myself wishing I had a beer to accompany. My goal was too make it to the new year though. That would give me a good 100+ days sober, which was a rather sufficient break imo.

About 6 weeks ago I went to my dads for some football. Having told him I was taking a break from drinking, he purchased some Odoul's. I was instantly hooked. I was able to lug around my 25oz beer-stein filled to the brim with bubbly golden goodness, and I wasn't poisoning myself either. I never imagined myself enjoying ""fake beer"", but it turns out it isn't fake at all. It's actually the SAME beer as the alcoholic version, but since alcohol has a lower boiling point than water, they just heat it up until the alcohol is gone. I believe knowing it is still legitimately beer helped allow me to transition to it.

I now drink NA beer just as I use to drink regular beer, and I picture myself doing this forever. Some people may claim that I'm not actually sober, since on my heaviest NA-binges I have put down a full 24pk of em in a 16 hour period. That is the alcohol equivalent of 2.4 standard drinks (Ten 0.5% abv NA beers = to one standard 5.0% abv beers), and I guess I wouldn't argue their point. But the bottom line is I am not longer poisoning myself and that was my goal all along. So whether or not anyone labels be a cheater, I guess I really don't care if people don't consider me truely sober. I'm clear headed and feeling the best I have in a long time.

If you're a beer person, and you are struggling to stay clean, consider possibly giving NA beer a shot. You might end up being just like me.",3

Today's day 29 without alcohol and the last few days seem to have been the hardest, or maybe I'm just remembering it that way.

It's the same anxiety that used to hit as I was leaving work at the end of the day, the same anxiety when the barkeep called last orders, and the same anxiety I felt when I'd already had a drink but thought I may not 'have enough left' before the local shop was due to shut. Can't count the amount of times I'd already had 8 beers, had 8 still in the fridge yet still walked round to the shop to get those 'security beers'.

Been so tempted to 'just pick up a few', but I've had to forcibly remind myself that within seconds of taking that first sip I'd be straight out the door again to get those 'safety beers', and it seems the only thing actually stopping me is the calendar on the wall that I've been marking my days sober on.

That 'bad self' on my shoulder keeps whispering in my ear that 'I've managed this far, so I've proved I'm in control', but the very fact I'm in this struggle is because I know I'm not. Maybe one day, but that's not today.

Now after a drunken thanksgiving and an even worse weekend where I lied and hid my drinking despite smelling like a bar at 2am, I’m ready to take another stab at this again.   My brother remarked “drinking a beer huh?” over the weekend and I replied “I took my medicine don’t worry”.  


My wife said she feels like she is in an abusive relationship with all the lying and manipulating from me about my drinking and I cannot blame her, my actions, while not violently or physically abusive,  certainly fit the category of emotionally abusive plus the physical state of me being a zombie on the couch when passed out counts as well.  

I can tell this is truly the last straw for her and I know what I’m like if I have one drink, that turns into ten or more and I become like some addict obsessively trying to find the next drink, whether it’s out of the trashcan or making up a ridiculous excuse to get out of the house (and to the liquor store).

Just out of curiosity, I asked him how much the average person drinks based on his patients. His reply was ""I'll never know because almost every single patient lies to me about how much they drink""

That answer floored me. I always thought it was only people as bad as me that were lying to the doctor about it. He pointed out the other people in the restaurant and said ""The average couple in here is having 1 or 2 bottles of wine just with this dinner. And that is what everyone tells me they drink per week.""

Hearing this really affected me. Even though things have been going great for me since I've been sober for over a year, I still often beat myself up over the past. How did I waste so much time? Why didn't I stop before ruining friendships? Things like that. But what he said reminded me that this could happen to anyone. 

So if you find yourself being down on yourself, just remember that problems with alcohol are within reach of everyone. If you start telling the truth and helping yourself, you've already accomplished so much even if there is still very hard work to do.",255

Best thing I’ve ever done.  Predictably, things have all changed for the better.  And for me it seems mostly to have occurred on an emotional and psychological level.

So before I make my coffee and oatmeal at work, I'm going to type this out.  Warning, this is going to be a long post as 1) I don't want to start working yet and 2) I'm pretty proud of making it through November. 

I made it.  I made it through the of November.  

I was not the type to need a drink every day.  I was a social drinker.  I had fun whenever we went out to bars, concerts, parties, family gatherings, etc, and if alcohol was involved, even better.  I would say about 90% of the time, I was a fun drunk, but it was the 10% of the time that was the bad apple that spoiled the bunch.  My problem was whenever I drank, I had way too much fun and kept on drinking, up until the point that the next thing I know is I'm waking up.

Oct 30 - We went to a concert downtown.  I was with my girlfriend, my brothers, and some friends.  We pregamed with a bottle of crown, had a beer at a bar, another beer at another bar along with some happy hour foods, and then went to the show.  Here was where I was good, having fun, and I should've just stopped drinking here.  Then I saw some old friends at the show, and we bought another round of shots....and that was that.  I woke up on my girlfriend's couch, to my 5am alarm going off, with her standing above me with a deathly stare.  I'll never forget that look.  She filled me in on the dumbassery that happened, keeping her composure.  Ashamed, embarrassed, guilty, all that, I cleaned up the mess I made, packed my things, and just left her house.  I took the day off work and stayed in bed all day.  It was this moment I told myself I'd commit to stop drinking.  I did not want to lose my girlfriend over drinking stupidity and I did not want to embarrass my brothers and my girlfriend anymore with my drinking stupidity.  My girlfriend and I hardly spoke all day and rightfully so.  She texted me at night to see if I was okay and that was it.  I couldn't sleep that night.

Oct 31 - This was day 1.  I took the day off work again.  I decided to find an AA meeting near me and I found one.  I stayed in bed up until it was time to go to the meeting.  The meeting was an eye opening experience.  I told my girlfriend I went and she didn't reply right away, but when she did, she was proud I went, but still very angry with me.  Again, rightfully so.   We didn't speak again all day and again, all day, I spent in bed.  

Nov 1 - I spent all day in bed again.  My girlfriend and I didn't speak until about after 6pm.  She asked if I wanted to meet to talk and of course, I was down.  We met for dinner, talked about things, discussed my plans to stop drinking, and I felt like life was filling me back up again.  We were okay, or at least starting to be okay again.  But the real test to my commitment to stop drinking was staring at me right in the face...

Nov 8-10 - This weekend was her friends' wedding weekend.  We drove up to the venue Friday, about an hour away and we picked up a bottle of crown to share with our cabin mates.  We get there, get settled with our cabin mates, and then head to the dinner area to mingle with the bride and groom, family, and friends.  I made it through the night sipping on a cup of soda, pretending that it was a jack and coke to anyone who offered me a drink.  This was pretty much the entire night.  Saturday was the day of the wedding and was going to be the real test.  Our cabin pregamed as we got ready and then went to another cabin of their coworkers who had more drinks.  Again, just had a coke bottle pretending it was mixed in with something.  At the reception, a waitress was handing out champagne and I did a big boy move and asked if they had apple juice or something since I don't drink.  I didn't think my girlfriend heard this but as I was in line for the food buffet, she hugged me from behind and said ""I heard you ask for apple juice instead of champagne...i'm so proud of you!"".  I was surprised that i was able to have so much fun the entire night without a drink.  I didn't think I could dance without alcohol to loosen me up.  Being sober allowed me to be present that night and to enjoy the night.  Sunday, was just breakfast and then we drove back hom.

Nov 13-18 -  This was another test.  The 13th was my girlfriend's bday and we were going to Chicago to celebrate her bday.  Also her younger brother lives in Chicago and his birthday was the 16th and he was having a house party.  Chicago is a beautiful city.  The first couple days were just touristy things.  We went to a few bars and her brother noticed I didn't order any drinks and he got curious, so I told him I was going sober.  It was a good conversation to have and I'd like to say he was a bit inspired as he was thinking of at least slowing down.  Saturday night was his party and actually wasn't too bad.  It's strange being on the other side, meaning that I was watching everyone go from sober to completely hammered and it was really a sight to see.  Part of the sober journey that makes me glad I'm on this road is after a night of drinking, I feel so glad I'm waking up with a clear head instead of waking up foggy and hurting.  The rest of the trip was fun and a birthday success.  

Nov 20-24 - The 20th is my older brother's birthday.  The day of was fine, but on the weekend, his friend threw him a birthday celebration at Top Golf.  I didn't drink anything there.  After Top Golf, however, was a friendsgiving at my girlfriend's friend's place.  This was tough as these guys are pretty heavy drinkers.  The man of the house always thought I was fun to drink with and instantly cracked a beer for me and he was shocked when I declined.  He pulled me aside and we talked about it and he was impressed also.  I opened up to a few people there, but everyone else I just said I was DD for the night.  I survived this night and again, it's strange to be on the other side.  

Thanksgiving Weekend - this weekend actually wasn't too bad and it was easy to decline offers for shots.

And that was the mine field that was November.  I was able to tip toe through it all and made it out alive and sober.  I didn't have a sip of alcohol even though it was in my face the entire month.  This just proved to me that I can survive on this road to sobriety.  I used to be the guy who never turned down a drink and yet here I am.  One of my fears about going sober was not being able to be strong enough to say ""no thanks"" or being judged for it, but that wasn't the case at all.  It's actually not hard at all to say no to alcohol and I can see myself saying no for a long time to come.  

If you read the entire thing, I appreciate you for going through it.  I didn't mean to make it long, but I'm just way too damn proud of myself that I made it through the month that otherwise would've been a drunken month.  I just want to thank everyone on here for posting their stories and for inspiring me and others who are also on the same road.

Sobering up has allowed me an opportunity to reflect on my behavior over the last X number of years. For context, I used to drink daily, during (lunch) and after work, and my nights consisted of either drinking with co-workers or drinking alone back in my apartment. With giving up drinking, I’ve realized that a majority of my free time was spent and centered around alcohol. 

Removing alcohol has left me with realization that I have almost no hobbies, and finding ways to soak up time has been more difficult than I’d imagined. This is a great problem to have! That being said I wanted to hear from the r/stopdrinking  community on what kinds of hobbies and/or activities you have found helpful in your journey. 

Some hobbies that I have been working on adding over the last few weeks include, going to the gym, reading and just today started my own bullet journal.

I’m nearly a year sober (not sure what my badge says but the big day is Dec.18). He’s been really supportive and stood by me. But this one really stung.

I've lurked on this sub for a while, under this and different accounts. I've tried getting sober before but it never stuck; I always told myself something was missing in those previous attempts.

In the past year I've basically single handedly raised my 2 year old, left my abusive and compulsive liar husband, started anew. I don't have much money. My new apartment sucks. I have spent way more money than I want to admit on alcohol, putting it on my credit card and telling myself I'll deal with it another day. I told myself I was drinking to cope with all of the stress. The thing is, when I was still with my husband, I told myself I was only drinking to deal with the stress of the relationship and the abuse, and once I left him I would stop. I thought leaving him would make everything in my life 100% better. In some ways it did, but it's still a very stressful path to take.

My ex was always adamant that I had an issue with drinking, but I ignored him. A lot of what he did was wrong, but he was right about that. I always told myself that one day getting sober would be easier, and one day it would ""stick."" But that day never really came.

I'm in a good relationship now. It's been a few months. We've never fought when I'm sober, and we have peaceful conflict resolution when I'm sober. But when I'm not sober, which is a decent amount of time, I'm not the same. I want to be a better partner to him because this is the best relationship I've ever been in and I don't want to mess it up.

I've never considered myself an alcoholic but maybe it's time to start. Too much of my life is centered around drinking. I want to remember what it feels like to be happy, genuinely, freely happy, while sober. I have turned so much of my life around since this time last year, this feels like the logical next step. 

This time will be different because I have a supportive and loving partner, I believe in my own strength, and I am joining this wonderful, supportive community of people who understand, because no one in my ""real life"" understands. I've got this. IWNDWYT.",5

I don’t know what my point in writing this is. I guess sometimes if I get it out it makes me feel more accountable. I know I can stop but I’m weak and I start again....this is the cycle I want to exit.

2019-12-02 09:41:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e4zyrx/we_agnostics/,We Agnostics,"Six month ago today, I had my last drink and boy was it a doozy. Resulting in my second DUI, I vowed this time would be different.

And it actually was.  I got a therapist, I started going to AA, and I started working on myself. AA was kind of sporadic for the first month but after that I committed. I found a home group. My therapist told me to get a sponsor, I got a sponsor. I even chaired a meeting, which was terrifying.

But I still struggle with AA. People will tell you it's not religious, but I think part of that is probably the meetings you go to. I'm in a very rural location so maybe that exacerbates it? I don't know. Reading AA lit it says ""God, as you understand him"" and the idea that anything can be a higher power. But it feels like, between the lines and hidden in there, in the end it has to be the capital God.  I mean "" **that Power, which is God** "" leaves little room for interpretation.

""We Agnostics"" reads like he's talking about people who are confused or angry at the idea of god. And maybe this is why members of AA have attempted to sympathetically discuss my ""struggle"" (as they put it) with my belief in god.

Thing is, I don't mind religion or god. My sister prays for me, and so do my parents. They mean it kindly and from the heart so it doesn't bother me. They also don't try to convert me. They don't tell me to pray. When people from AA tell me to pray about my struggle with god etc, I kinda smile and say thank you.

I don't struggle with the belief in god, I just don't believe in god. I'm not angry at the church, I actually enjoy going to Christmas service with my folks because of the singing. Every single meeting up here opens and closes with a prayer, and I don't mind that. I don't care if others want to make their focus god. I'm more bothered by the idea that if I don't believe in god I **will** fail, and the idea that I'm confused/struggling in belief of god. When I ask myself, ""why do I care what others think of me?"" and I guess it's just because it makes my time in AA uncomfortable when these things are brought up to me. I find myself wanting to avoid AA and meetings, but I'm spending more time here (I've made a new account for this post because so many people from my past know my main username).

I just wanted to get some of this off my chest. I would really love to hear from other atheists/agnostics on their experiences. If others have had people try to push their beliefs on you, how did you personally deal with it? I don't have my license back for a few months so I'm limited on meetings in can attend. My therapist gave me some SMART recovery worksheets which I think were fantastic, so I plan on trying out those meetings when I get my car back.",9

I felt incredible craving, and I could not understand why.. I remember in This Naked Mind, Annie Grace talked about her experiment while drinking so I decided I would buy a 200 ML bottle of ethanol and ingest it and track everything from heart rate, to mood, to dehydration, etc. 

I wanted to know why my mind was craving something so bad, even though my conscious knew it was horrible for me. Was it worth it? 

I can assure all my sobernauts that it is most definitely not worth it. 

First, my heart rate shot up from 65 bpm to high 90’s within 12 hours of drinking my first sip of ethanol. 

Second, my stomach became severely upset. (I used to think this was normal and lived like that day to day) 

Anxiety kicked in. Dehydration and exhaustion like no bodies business. 

Now here is the worst part, the next day it was like my brain went crazy trying to get more ethanol. My conscious knew what was happening but my brain was just going into over drive trying to get that next drink. I started driving to the liquor store, and the entire time all I could think was: “What are you doing? Turn around!” However my monkey brain won. 

That is why it is most definitely not worth it friends. 
The monkey brain will do the stupidest things even when we know better, so it’s best not to fuel the fire. I have definitive concrete proof now that no, a weekend craving or “just a few” is NOT worth it. 

I’m not resetting my sober count. I needed this slap in the face, and I got it. I tried doing a controlled experiment, and even that was too much. 

Today is a new day. 

Thanks for not drinking with me today!",36

I was at a bar and one turned to four turned to (?) so quickly! I loved it and I literally told myself in my dream it was fine, I could go back to not drinking like nothing ever happened, but I LITERALLY kept saying to myself “just one more then I’ll be done”. I remember thinking “I don’t have to reset my badge, it’s just this once”.  (I only finally sorted it out yesterday!) I truly feel ashamed of that thought. The thought of lying to all of you!

Anyway I think this is a great example of the lies we tell ourselves while we’re drinking, trying to convince ourselves we’re really ok, trying to justify our behavior. I so often told myself “I can have just one....or two, or three or four or five” the off switch doesn’t work people!!! So none is better, even in my dreams.

I’ve been pondering this lately.


When I first decided to get sober, it wasn’t so much the fear of living without booze that held me back...it was the fear of struggling every single day.

When I got sober, yes the first 30 days were white knuckling it and really tough.  But it got so much easier.

If I hadn’t bought into the media’s presentation of an alcoholic struggling 24/7 for the rest of their life, I think I would have tried to get sober earlier.

What do you all think the biggest media/social misrepresentations of sobriety are?",16

I am 16 years old almost 17...almost. I began drinking and smoking weed when I was 13. It was always just fun until it wasn’t. I was always a pretty happy person growing up, my family was the picture perfect church family( I have always been and will always be religious). I have 3 adopted younger brothers and a 19 year old biological sister. My sister had always been the one who was so talented and smart she played the piano and was an amazing singer for our church. I have not really gotten along with my sister over the years due to different beliefs but I do love her. I have been a cheerleader and gymnast nearly all my life. The summer before high school I really began drinking with my friends. Everything was going good. I was on a competitive cheer squad, I was years ahead in school, had lots of friends. My freshman year was okay until the spring when I was hospitalized due to a suicide attempt and that messed up a lot of school and cheer stuff. My freshman year i began to party with all of the seniors every night. My relationship with my mom got very rough and it still is right now it’s probably the hardest part of my life. Me and my mom can’t even be in the same room as each other. Never thought I had a problem. I had a very close friend and in the summer after freshman year we started DRINKING like every single night bottles upon bottles. Never thought I had a problem. Sophomore year my best friend moved in with me and i fell very codependent on her. I started gaining weight and depressionnnn. In the winter of my sophomore year I was drugged and raped. God seriously I hate myself. I stopped going to school and cheering. My best friend who I would have called a sister then screwed me over during all this and switched up on me. After that my back started killing me to the point where everyday I was sobbing in pain. I started working out and lost 50 pounds that semester. My body was still killing me. I got my license and started coaching gymnastics which I LOVE. I was sober for a couple months. In the summer I became friends with my best friend again even though I shouldn’t have and we started DRINKING. Again drinking every single night going to parties. She screwed me over AGAIN. JUNIOR YEAR I get hospitalized due to a ruptured organ. Found out I have ehlers danlos syndrome which is a connective tissue disorder. Basically it causes me a fuck ton of problems. I found out I can’t take ibuprofen or anything you would take to help your muscles so I just DRANK. Never thought I had a problem. 2 nights ago I got my first dui. Been taking it pretty rough which is why I’m here haha. I have dreams of becoming a psychiatrist and opening my own practice. This year As a junior I started taking college classes. I wanted to be at my school the least I could be. I flunked out of my English class because I didn’t turn my work in on time. This point I don’t really have any friends. I feel so broken. And now I feel like my life is ruined due to this dui. But here today I recognize I have a problem. A lot of mean words coming from people about the situation and I don’t know what to do. Everyone has this picture of me now and I can’t seem to think differently. Trash. I feel like legit trash. Have no friends or family to talk to.",6

It's been 22 days since I've had a drink, and I have to say that today's cravings were the hardest I've ever had to overcome. My partner of 15 months broke up with me today, and I am devastated. I did 100 days without alcohol in 2018, then 90 days earlier this year. Some hard stuff happened in August of this year, and I lost my ability to power through, and turned right back to the drink. My relationship, which had been going pretty well up until then, took a massive toll. I started going out to the bar until 2 AM, three or four nights a week. On the nights I wasn't out, I drank alone in my room. My partner was understandably upset - I was not paying her the attention she deserves. Alcohol came first, and even though I wanted to put my partner first, I could not. My addiction once again controlled my life.

About two months ago, I read the book ""This Naked Mind"" by Annie Grace, and it turned me around for a little while. I had a few weeks sober, and then I went to a wedding with my family. My dad has been a daily drinker my whole life, and I just couldn't bring myself to tell him that I didn't want to drink at the wedding. Instead of holding true to my belief that alcohol is a poison, I succumbed to the pressure and got plastered at the wedding. It was easy to do, given that my whole family was doing the same.

I came home and went right back into the addiction. My relationship with my partner continued to get worse and worse. Eventually, we came to the point where I decided I need to turn things around. We started seeing a couple's counselor, and I committed in therapy to staying sober, going to a recovery group, and seeing a new individual therapist with a specialty in addiction/recovery. Since we started seeing our couple's counselor, I think things have been turning around. I've stopped drinking, I've been much more attentive and loving to my partner, and I've even started going to yoga classes and working out again. From my perspective, everything has been improving.

A few days ago, my partner told me that she doesn't feel the same connection she used to feel. She says the last few months have been too hard on her, and she's been taking on too much of my shit. She's been supporting me too much and not taking care of herself. She said wants to break up. I can't believe this is happening. I'm finally turning my life around, making a commitment to her and to sobriety, and then this happens. I love her dearly, and this news has been absolutely heartbreaking. I've tried every angle over the last two days to see if she'll change her mind, but she won't budge. We are definitely breaking up. All I want to do is have a drink (or 10), and forget about all of this. I'm really fighting the craving, but I know I only have so much willpower, and I'm afraid that it will run out sooner or later. These feelings are so intense that I want to escape. I could really use some support right now.

Thanks for reading everyone.",23

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's been 17 days since my wife told me she was having an affair.,"I first decided to quit because I had a feeling something big was coming and I needed clarity. I detoxed alone, and woke up on the other side to find out how alone I really was. I haven't drank to cope with this, though I wanted, and still want to, badly. But I know it will only make this situation worse.

I needed to quit for other reasons. I'm glad I have, but I am feeling rock bottom now. I log on here each day reading everyone's words of encouragement to one another. Tomorrow I won't wakeup with a fog over me and will make it to day 29. IWNDWYT

What a difference a year makes. Year 1 for me was all about learning to resist the temptation to drink. Year two was about self-improvement and learning to roll with the punches without becoming “disturbed”. 

I’m in a much better place today than a year ago, and in a completely different universe than I was 2 years ago. What an amazing ride. And it isn’t over yet.

Thanks to this sub for being supportive during the first few months. I don’t know if I would have made it without that help early in sobriety.

Actually, yesterday I was as sick as I can remember being in years, when I wasn’t puking hungover. I don’t get the flu often but holy crap I was a wreck. Sweating through the sheets, headache so bad I couldn’t stand, fever dreams as I slept half the day away. I missed my nephew’s birthday party and felt awful for it.

However, it was a genuine illness and I made it through. While I felt terrible for missing the event, I wasn’t riddled with the anxiety and guilt that came with missing so many other things over the years because I was hungover sick.

My wonderful fiancé brought me ice water and ibuprofen and a nice meal when I was finally at the point where I could stomach food. She didn’t guilt me over missing the birthday. She could tell I was genuinely not doing well and she knew that it wasn’t because I drank until I fell into bed (like I’ve done so many other times).

Today that wonderful woman woke up with what I had yesterday. I was awake, coherent, and able to return the favors that she had just done for me a day ago. 

I neglected to mention that all of this is taking place at her parents home on Thanksgiving weekend, an hour drive away from our home. Sunday has traditionally been a drinking day for me. Beers at 10 am, whiskey soon after, an afternoon spent in a haze.

Not today. I made sure the kids were fed and entertained. I cleaned up and packed. I ran our 15 month over to my mother’s for a visit. I checked on my fiancé as she slept and suffered. When it came time to drive home, I put everyone in the car and drove all of us home safely.

All of them are tucked into bed now and I’m sitting with my thoughts. I’m not where I want to be yet with alcohol. I’m two weeks off liquor, but still drinking a couple of beers each day. I’m finding my way little by little.

It seems like such a small, easy thing to stay sober on a day where someone who loves me needed me most. It’s also something that I have failed to do too many times. I did it today and I am proud of myself for that. 

I cannot yet say I will not drink with you today, but I will not get drunk today. I will be in the moment and be there for those who need me. I will live another day for those who love me.",25

I had been thinking about sneaking away all day, about running to the gas station just down the street and slamming a few shooters. Sneaking back home before anyone knew anything. Then I could just have them in my system and I would feel better and happier and I could just. Stop. Thinking about it. And my bf asked me if I wouldn't mind going out and getting him a Coke. Perfect opportunity! They were right there, not a foot away from me. 
   But I said no. I wanted to cry as I was saying it. I played it off and made a joke and went back out to the car. I drove the 2 blocks to my apartment like someone was chasing me because if I sat there for one more second I was going to change my mind and go back in. Cried for 10 minutes outside my apartment, made myself go in. Opportunity ruined.
   The craziest thing about it was how I felt when I realized I just threw away my last chance to drink tonight. Angry? Sad? Hopeless? No. I was sooo relieved. I did it. I was right there and could have had all the booze I wanted. And I said no. The thought (just go get some really quick, toss them back and then you'll feel better) didn't keep barging it's way into my mind the whole rest of the night. I felt peaceful.
   We've all had issues that come up with our significant others, family, friends because of drinking. This was what I needed. A feeling of peace. I couldn't get booze right now even if I wanted to and it's such a relief. I'm not looking forward to 06:30. I know it will start again. But knowing that I didn't die or have a breakdown without drinking helps. A lot. At least right now. 
   I've been through this before and I know I'll feel better in a few more days. It's just getting there that's the hardest part. And no matter what I can't just have a few and then 'hop back on the wagon' because the next night I'll want 5, then 8, and then I'll blackout and do something to make me hate myself more.
   Thanks for listening to my rant. You guys help give me hope and a distraction.",23
2019-12-02 01:33:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e4v1or/tagged/,Tagged,"Hi. I’ve never posted before. Anyway I’ve been drinking pretty much every day, a lot, since the summer before I started university. I’ve befriended a lot of people who I genuinely think care about me and I feel like are there for me when/as I struggle with my mental health. They know I have a problem with drinking, as in I only really have a sober day a month and find it hard to sleep without at least being drunk enough for my memories to be fuzzy if not black out/not remembering going to bed. 

One of my closest friends still tags me in “drinking memes”/“drunk video memes” 

The other day I was tagged in a video with the caption being “tag a mate who gets this drunk”

The video was of a guy who couldn’t even bend down to pick up his keys. His eyes were rolling around, he couldn’t get out a coherent sentence. It was devastating. 

I get sent videos like this all the time, with laughing emojis and “funny” “relatable” captions

When my friend sent me that video I started crying 

I had to be escorted home by the police the other not because I apparently could not stand 

I don’t think it’s funny anymore. But I also feel like it’s so normalised, and I’m so embarrassed, and afraid of disappointing my parents that I’m unable to seek out/receive the help I really need. 

I’m unsure if anyone will see this and I guess I kind of hope no one does. 

The experiences I’ve had as a result of drinking are humiliating. 
I’ve endangered myself countless times, lost friendships, pissed numerous beds (including my own a lot). Dozens of sexual encounters I don’t remember actually having besides the panic of waking up naked in a strangers bed, and the resulting humiliation, and then anger and shame. 

I guess I know I need to stop and I’ve told my parents and friends about it but they don’t seem to want to acknowledge that issue with me. Maybe because I’m functioning but I feel myself slipping, academically, socially, mentally. 

I’m lost and afraid and lonely and bored, and the alcohol helps. 

But it’s kinda like when it helps I’m getting a loan with a really high interest rate that’s impossible to pay off.",7

Until Christmas, coincidentally both my close family (so my mother) and my girlfriend are both traveling out of country. In the past, this would have been prime time for me to drink to my heart's content without the fear of making my loved ones worry, and of course to kill the time to be able to see them again ""faster."" But as I don't intend to go back to my old habits now, I need new coping skills. 

To give some context, I only work 6 months a year, and as it is winter now, I don't have a job to keep me busy. I don't have friends that live nearby. My friends live in other cities, and even though I have one overnight visit planned, most of the time they have their own lives to live, work, studies, etc. I have quite a few online friends, but I'm not sure if we are close enough for me to ask them to provide me support in this endeavor. 

I fear that my alcohol-free nights are going to be long and dull.

I seek to live my life in a way that will be fruitful and good, find ways to relax and enjoy myself that are truly fulfilling, try to connect with others, but I most often seem to still feel an emptiness. I often wonder if the emptiness is me and will therefore never leave. 

Alcohol was one of the many ways I have tried to fill the void over the years and I won’t *truly* miss it. I just wonder how to feel complete or if I ever will. I suppose the only thing to do is keep trying; it just gets tiresome some days. Today, I am not truly sad but I do wish I could crawl into bed for a week. Not to hide, not to feel sorry for myself, just to be still and quiet I think. I’m just soul tired today.

I thought I was stronger than the alcohol, and I thought I could win. I didn’t. After 89 days, my longest streak in more than a year, I relapsed. Which then led to a daily evening binge for a month. Today, after having constant heart palpitations and chest pains, I am kicking myself and wondering why? Why did I do this to myself again? 

During my 89 day sobriety, I felt so proud, so good about myself. I slept well, snacked less, took my meds regularly, flossed daily, read books, worked in my hobbies, journaled, did crosswords, etc. All things that bettered myself in some way. On my binge days, I watch tv that I can’t remember, black out, and forget half of my regular self care routine (meds, flossing, etc). I go to sleep too late, wake up groggy, am late to work, and suffer from heart burn and heart palpitations. 

I never considered myself an alcoholic and that’s part of my problem. My dad was, and it impacted his work and his relationships. He was black out drunk a majority of days to the point where he couldn’t remember his kids. He drove. He drank at work. He snuck it and hid it. I don’t do any of those things, therefore, I couldn’t be an alcoholic. Then I heard an ad on the radio that changed my mindset. Women who drink more than four drinks in an evening is considered a binge, and more than six a week was considered heavy. I was regularly, nearly daily, drinking 6 drinks. I never even knew that classified me as a binge drinker or a heavy drinker— things I swore I would never be! I have since taken multiple “breaks” from alcohol just to prove to myself that I could, and to say “see? Not an alcoholic!” I’d aim for 30 days and make it 29. Or I’d say “not this weekend” and then would try to convince someone else to bring it up so I could go along for the ride. It had just enough control over me that I knew I’d need to start moving toward full sobriety. 

Then it turned into daily binges, just about a year ago, when our son was about 9 months old. The infancy stage was really hard on me, and I went through some stuff at work. The nightly binges stuck around, and now they’re just habit. Night hits and I don’t even think, just start taking shots. I decided to go sober on a night when we happened to run out of all booze in the house. I thought, we just won’t buy it. Period. Got a sobriety app, motivated myself by the “money saving” aspect, and although days one-three felt impossible, days 40–89 were a breeze. I told my husband I’d never go back. 

Then on Halloween, he said “you know, I kinda miss it. Drinking. We used to have fun playing Mario kart drunk, and we’d be silly and have deep conversations all in the same night.” And I agreed. So we agreed to drinking on special occasions, starting that very night (Halloween). He went out and got a bottle, and we got blitzed. What meant to be one or two drinks for a special occasion became right back to the drawing board: six to eight drinks a night,  every night, for weeks. And now I’m in chest pain, googling whether I’m having a heart attack, and thinking about how much better things were before. 

Sorry I’m rambling. I just kinda had to get it out. I’m disappointed in myself and worried I have done permanent damage. I just my little boy so much, and the thought of taking years off my time with him makes me feel so sad and guilty. But I also know how hard those first days of sobriety were and how we still have booze I. The house. And how easily I caved when my husband wanted to start again. And how I really thought I could do it... and I couldn’t.",18

 It's Sunday afternoon now and I'm trying to not go back to sleep to avoid everything.

I've been on and off not drinking for the last 6 or so months. The problem was that whenever I would drink, I would find myself heading towards the shady parts of town to go find drugs to use. I have never used a drug sober, so it seems that alcohol is always my trigger. 

Friday I had gone out with a family member, and actually had a wonderful time. As we do, one thing leads to another, and I'm fairly inebriated. At this point I had purchased cocaine from the bouncer of the bar we were at, and was well on my way to pure idiocy. I went back to family members house, but of course, was not sleepy. Hey turns out he has some wine!

At this point, everything went black. I recall him going to bed, and me cracking open a bottle of wine. Next thing I know, i woke up in a jail cell. I was naked, and screaming for medical attention. 
My finger was broken and my hands were covered in blood.

""Help! Help!"" I remember screaming. I believe i spent about 7-8 hours there. All of Saturday day. Finally a couple officers came it to let me know what was going on.

I was told that I was behaving recklessly near a mall, and that i was covered in my own blood (presumably from the fall which broke my finger) and ""was trying to put your blood on a random woman""

What the hell! This is SO not how I'd ever behave. I can not believe it. I was then told that when I got into the cell, they wanted to search me so I was so angry i just decided to remove all my clothing and give it to them. 

I'm ashamed. I began apologizing profusely. I finally got on a train and found my way home early Sunday morning. I've been getting messages from my family (even my mother whom I don't often speak to as of late) asking if I was okay.

I have not yet turned on my phone, for fear of listening to everyone wondering where I am.

I messaged my mom and asked her why everyone was messaging me? She said a friend of the family had seen me stumbling down the side of a highway and I looked in bad shape. Shit, I am so embarrassed. 
I don't know what the hell to do. I've been on and off sleeping, because it's the only time I feel okay. 

I have been having such a good week. Work has been wonderful and I just signed the lease on the new place. This 'thing' inside me always shows its face when I am doing well. It sabotages me and finds a way to bring me down, quickly as possible. 

I do see a substance counsellor, but I have been drinking/drugging myself once a week for the last 2 weeks. It has also been the last two weeks that I couldn't get an appointment to talk with her.

Something serious is wrong with me, guys. I've never blacked out before. People know now. I have made a complete fool of myself. I don't know what to do, I just want to sleep. 

I want to not tell my family what happened.. at least not in full detail.

It’s not the keeping myself from drinking that seems as hard as the problems I neglected about myself due to drinking.

Which effects my romantic life and to a much lesser extent my other relationships. For example just recently I got in a fight with her where I got defensive about some suggestions she made in regards to promoting my art. Initially I didn’t feel that I was but after reading some articles I saw what she meant, but I also feel that it was unnecessary which she did apologize for stressing me out I just felt that she didn’t point out at the time that it was. Which is hella insecure and I need to work on that.

I have creeped the entire year and finally thought I should post. I always thought I would have a great note to write if I made it to my 1 year but I don’t.  But I can tell you what I’m thinking...

As my year approached a lot of people asked if I would like to start drinking again, as my initial
idea was just to quit for a year and see what I could change. Initially my answer was a resounding ‘yes’ but as time went on it was as a maybe at best.

 I came into this sub looking for stories from people who tried drinking again and it worked just fine for them. Short answer: rarely.   Arrogant me wants me to think that since my sobriety hasn’t been a problem for me at all, that drinking again will also be flawless. I also keep having this feeling that there has got to be something I’m missing out on, though I know there is not. There is nothing I have missed out on in life at all because I quit drinking. I am sure of it. 

So right now I’m thinking of two things 1) a comment that I saw on here this time last year that said “I’m so quick to forget the perils of my partying even though I spent the last decade getting drunk” and 2) It has been a year since I couldn’t sleep, had a racing heart beat, been unable to eat, and looked like crap every day. I guess I’ll keep not drinking and truckin along :)

I maintain a quite busy lifestyle with my girlfriend and during the moments we are not together I used to fuel my alcoholic lifestyle (we both still live at home but we have plans to move in at the beginning of next year). My work sometimes allows me to work from home which I always used to continue Sunday's bender, which also happened last Monday. 

Due to work circumstances I was allowed to work from home 3 days this week which meant continuing the bender. When I'd visit my girlfriend during the evenings I would simply say I don't feel too well and I'd prefer if we'd just watch a movie together in bed. This continued all the way up until Friday afternoon after which I felt extremely sick (the ""my-entire-body-hurts-and-I-think-I-might-die"" kind of sick). Before this hard relapse I was sober for 3 weeks and on Friday I felt like a really selfish ass towards both my girlfriend and more importantly myself. I knew that I can't continue doing this because I literally feel like I am killing myself, something that 23 year olds shouldn't be doing. I decided right there, right then that it is time to seriously abstain from alcohol. 

Now I knew it was going to be challenging right from the start because we had a party to attend to the following day. I decided to drive the both of us there so I knew I couldn't drink. I got hit with a DUI 2 years ago which all in all cost me a fortune, especially at my age back then and I knew getting hit with another DUI is simply not an option. There were a lot of triggers during the party, not gonna lie, but something I've learnt from this sub is that saying no to the first drink is all you have to do. I kept on repeating that sentence in my head and I managed to not get a single drop of alcohol in my body - a victory!

Watching my girlfriend wake up with another major hangover once again confirmed my thoughts that I don't want to drink anymore. While she was grumpy recovering I decided to make use of the gym membership which I haven't used in 4 months and after exercising I simply felt so much better. It is currently late in the evening where I live and I am enjoying some sparkly peach water in bed and I'm already getting tired without wanting a drink. 

I'm currently on day 2 and I know day 3 - 5 are my worst recovering days, I'm mainly worried about the massive wave of anxiety which is going to hit at some point. But on this day, day 2, I feel better than ever during my past recoveries.

as the title says, i'm tempted to drink today as i have gotten myself into conflict with my partner. I feel hurt, grumpy, and mad.

i have a history of blacking out with alcohol. After an 11 month period of working hard and navigating my troubled relationship with alcohol, i blacked out pretty badly on my birthday two weeks ago and almost took all my medications as an attempt at suicide. I felt so angry and ashamed of myself; i've been sticking to sobriety and haven't been really tempted to drink.

My partner rarely drinks and is supportive of my sobriety. However, he likes to smoke weed and in the past, had an issue of smoking too much (often high most of the time with him). I have been feeling really sensitive about being around drugs, weed, or alcohol & have been reactive and taking out my difficult feelings on my partner. Another thing that informs my reactions is that my dad is addicted to drugs and alcohol & it has been very hard/ traumatic for me. I know my partner isnt like my dad and in no way abuses any substance, but it bothers me when i'm wanting him to be present with me as being sober forces me to confront all my emotions and not use substances to drown them out.

i dont want to be the anti fun police but i dont know if what i'm asking for is reasonable.  i noticed he has been smoking a lot more and more. I brought it up this AM that it has been bothering me (because im navigating my own sobriety, id like him to be more present with me) and lo & behold - he called me ""the weed police"".  I will admit that i have been feeling grumpy all morning due to some nightmares and I didn't bring it up in the nicest way. But i guess deep down, it had been bothering me that he is shifting back to his old behavior. He said it's not a big deal because he mixes half the weed with a herbal spliff so he's actually not smoking that much... anyway, he stormed out of the house and now he's gone. 

i'm just feeling really crappy and like what i'm asking is for too much. any advice is appreciated. i plan on attending a sobriety meeting tonight.",5

All I could think was “ that would be me if I didn’t stop earlier this year”.  Feeling blessed that monkey is off my back. I am so thankful for this sub, you all are the reason I was able to stop and stay sober so far!

I could go on for days about the ways my life, my psyche, my spirit has been on a seemingly endless trajectory upward since May. 

Deciding to quit was pretty easy for me when it came down to it. I was absolutely disgusted with myself, and for weeks the very thought of alcohol would make me gag. I went to therapy for a couple months afterwards for support and have really only had positive thoughts about this transition in my life. I’m not very active socially anymore now that I’m a mom gone solo and my career keeps me very busy and tired... so I’ve been able to avoid social settings that are triggers for me almost entirely for the last 6 months, and have navigated others just fine. I’ve used the wealth of resulting solitary time to become reacquainted with my hopes and dreams and really just my general emotional being as it exists without the buffer of alcohol. And I’ve really enjoyed it so much. I’ve relished in my solitude.

But today, for the first time in 187 days, I feel like I’m grieving parts of my non-sober life/self that weren’t 100% toxic that I feel estranged from these days. I know, rationally, that I’m more free now than I’ve ever been in my adult life... but there is something nagging me today telling me I’m now just a boring loner that never does anything and never really rewards herself for her hard work anymore. I feel restless, bored and a bit trapped in a wheel of endless days that are all kind of the same... like I’ve built this great new path for myself but forgot to build in the fun.

I know that these feelings will pass, and I know that it just takes time to completely relearn how to fit in healthy rewards and a healthy social life into sobriety. I know I have to be patient and that after some time I will be better acquainted with my needs. I know that I’m still healing from years of self abuse, that I need to be proud of how far I’ve come and not dwell on the small scruples i have with this new version of myself.

But today I guess I kind of miss the blissful ignorance of skipping over to the bar for a change of scenery and a dose of conversation/socialization.... feeling like I have a lot to celebrate and letting myself let loose to do so. I considered maybe going out to an event that has piqued my interest tonight and prove to myself that I can have a good time at a bar without the booze... but the idea of it makes me very uncomfortable still. I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be tempted to drink anything, but there’s a small chance I would. And that’s frustrating. 

The good news is, regardless of my grief, I still don’t want to drink. And I won’t. Time will keep ushering me beyond all these shadows of my past and I know more than ever that at age 32 I’m finally headed where I’m meant to be in my life. I’ll take these blips of shaken confidence in stride, and tomorrow I’ll fight that much harder to love myself. 

Thanks for listening 🙏",34

You know when you reach that point where you can't do one more hangover? well I'm there. I'm 35 and they are getting bad, more depressing and crushing than ever before but I still drink like a teenager when I go out. 

I can't help it - one becomes many. It's not in my control. Others don't understand - why can't I get be happy with a few? I can't. I only drink at weekends really but I'll easily ruin a day or two of it with a hangover and then hate myself. Part of my reason/excuse is I have chrnoic pain and it does temporarily block it out but then it can make it worse the next day as well so there is that to consider. 

Anyway I've just had enough and think I need to reset my relationship wth alcohol. I have stopped in the past (longest time for 6 months) but I've found it very hard recently, every attempt I've made has failed to were I don't believe I can anymore.

I don’t do any exercises I wasn’t doing before, though I feel like I would benefit from doing some physical fitness regimen. 

Instead of drinking Coca-Cola all day, as I was doing before, I drink water or unsweetened tea until 3. I sometimes have some chewing gum during the meal window so I’ll have something to chew on that doesn’t have sugar or other sweeteners outside the meal window. I feel like my teeth and breath are cleaner when I have some gum. I don’t know if it’s true, but it improves the way my mouth feels, so I have that. 

But the one thing I think really made this possible is that I quit drinking 122 days ago. 

Besides not consuming the empty calories of the liquor, I’m not binging on snacks because the alcohol wants company, I have more impulse control. I’m taking far fewer needless risks with other people’s health or with my life. 

At first, my goal was today. Then it was getting all the way through tomorrow without drinking. Then waking up Saturday and Sunday not regretting the previous night’s antics. Now I’m gearing up for December 31st/1 January, the event last year that ruined my previous longest streak of sobriety (which was only October-December, but it _was_ an accomplishment). Luckily, nobody important to me and close to me in my life now drinks, so that’s good. 

But still, basics are key.

When I was drinking I forgot this passion. I was hungover a lot and I had no energy for others.

Now I do have a lot of energy again! I will get to a year sober and beyond one day at a time and get a solid group going again.

More and more of us are waking up to the reality that drinking is not sexy or sophisticated or adult. It is the exact opposite of those things. Drinking makes us look like shit, kills our self-confidence, sucks our time/money/energy, ruins our health, works against every single goal we have for ourselves, and keeps us stuck and stunted. By just trying on sobriety or questioning our drink-centric culture, you are profoundly ahead of the pack and among good company. Remember: 70-80% of adults drink depending on where you live; drinking is basic. Sobriety, and the refusal to partake in alcogenic culture, is subversive, rebellious, and edgy. It's not a sad consequence. It's a proud choice. There is a common held belief in our society that sobriety is the consequence of our actions or inability to control our liquor. I don't see it that way. Discovering that you can’t tolerate a neurotoxic, carcinogenic poison isn’t a consequence—it’s a privilege; it’s your body intelligence talking to you loud enough to hear. Regardless of how we come to it, sobriety is our decision, and one that most people don't consider an option for themselves - regardless of where they fall on the spectrum of addiction. Those that choose the path to stop drinking willfully choose to stop drinking—because there is always the alternative to spiral further. Sobriety isn't something that you *have* to do. Sobriety is something that you *get* to do. You decide you want more for yourself, you decide that your more won't be found in a wine glass, and you get the fuck after it. And proudly so."" -

Loving other beings is a powerful set of actions and beliefs which requires presence and thoughtfulness. Difficult decisions will have to made in life no matter what. When those choices are guided by love and connection to others, joy and peace can be found. When we are guided by impulse, instant gratification, selfishness or vanity we degrade our moral character. Our lives become unfulfilling and lonely. In my case it leads to alcoholism and shame. In addressing step 2 I dedicate my life to love as my HP.

There have been plenty of nights where I didn't have my old coping behaviors to deal with life, so I just sat alone with myself. Sometimes I would cry because I couldn't drink. Sometimes being sober is very lonely. 

Learning different ways to deal with, and identifying triggers was difficult and resulted in alot of restarts. One of the major things was to let go of alot of hate, and be more gentle with myself. The constant negativity was in no way helping me. 

Being kind to yourself is hard but makes a hell of alot easier. Getting to know myself all over again has been weird, overwhelming, and kind of exciting.

First off, thanks to all on this sub who've, through my causal lurking, convinced me I had issues I needed to confront. I'm not sure if I'm a full on alcoholic or dependent or if that's all interchangeable, but there's definitely a problem I need to fix. 

A little over a month ago I decided to stop drinking with a goal of lasting at least a year without any alcohol. I'm the sort who can stop for awhile and then binge for a week or two, then stop again, and so on; but this time I've been pretty diligent...until I went out with some friends. Maybe it was a bit unwise, but I had to get out of my house and got invited to go bar hopping for a friend's birthday a couple of weeks ago. I refused drinks with little trouble and even managed to prove to myself that, no, I don't need alcohol to have fun or let loose. That was a big accomplishment for me! Typically I use alcohol to lessen my social anxiety, so to be able to talk and joke while sober was a plus. However, I was getting some pressure to drink by my companions -- not meanly just the occasional ""you sure you don't want one?""--and at one point I was offered a shot...which i took. I didn't feel anything. I didn't drink any more and haven't had any since, but as a lot of you know once you get one it's hard to stop, and I know if I had been offered another drink I would have relented.

I still feel incredibly guilty not only for betraying my self and my goal after only a month, but for that urge to drink more and only resisting bc no one offered me another one. The last couple of weeks have been tougher bc of it and now I'm craving a beer. 

In my head I tell myself I can have one and stop, and I'm confident that's true. After all it's not the one I have THAT DAY that gets, it's how that one I had that day justifies me in having another one some other day. I mean I stopped at one before right? I can do it again.  Maybe next time I can have two. Maybe the time after I can have three - that's not so bad right? I rationalize buying more and more till I have a box wine and I'm drinking 3-5 glasses a day, and so the cycle continues. 

Maybe I'm not ready to believe that I have to stop for good, but I really really want to be able to control this.  

My question is, is it a fool's errand to work on control rather than quitting? Like now, I'm confident I can buy one and not drink again for another few weeks, but will those weeks between lessen like always? Will I one day just say ""fuck it"" like always and start that cycle again? 

I feel like a liar when I tell myself that ONE drink is normal, ONE drink is fine especially when everyone else my age over drinks all the time, but I don't feel like everyone else. Everyone else can leave alcohol in their fridge for months while I can't leave it alone for a day. Everyone else doesn't think about alcohol all the time even if I  don't necessarily ""crave"" it. 

Is it right to say I'm not an alcoholic and therefore don't have to stop drinking forever?

Ideally, I'd like to use this year as practice for control. I have 1-2 beers once a month at most, never buy a six pack only one at a time, and never drink socially (recipe for disaster). Honestly typing this out is already convincing me it's not possible/smart and I shouldn't try it, but i'd like some advice all the same.",2

Massive love to all of you.

Quick tips?
- be honest about not drinking because you don't want to, hiding it makes it feel temporary still
- stick to where you're comfortable, but don't automatically exclude yourself from social occasions because there will be drinks. Don't associate being able to socialise with drinking - you're not missing out by not getting hammered.
- exercise, binge watch TV, do whatever makes you happy BUT drinking for the first few months. you can fix this again later if you need to!

Quick facts? In 1 year of not drinking:
- saved ~£1865 (that's a low average of £5 a day)
- lost 4.5kg (not a huge amount but bearing in mind I haven't been dieting, just replacing drink time with other more active stuff)
- got a REALLY good job that I can't do without being organized AF
- got engaged!
- gained something close to an arm muscle
- huge change in mood - it's way more stable

Pretty frequently, I see stories or comments from some of you that have YEARS of sobriety under your belt. And you would think, that by that time, you wouldn't even think to still click on articles, and be active in the community. But it seems like most of you still do. That says a lot about your character. That you feel your knowledge / experiences can be helpful to us ""low-numbered"" folk lol. So, if you're one of those people - thank you from the bottom of my heart. 

Also just a quick thought about something I read in another post today. The person commenting mentioned ""put the work in now"". This hit home with me. I remember when all I could muster was a day or so sobriety. But If you keep putting that work in, focusing, and monitoring yourself, it really does gradually get better. YOU get better AT  figuring out what works for you. Thanks again.",9

I feel like hammered dog shit today...but this is it!!! Like I need to put more poison in my body while it’s fighting fucking cancer! WTF is wrong with me? 

The bills are already coming in...I can’t stop crying. I’m scaring the shit out of my daughter who said she already feels like she’s losing me.  Thank God she wasn’t home last night. Everyone says I’m so strong. I don’t feel it right now....

Any advice or thoughts appreciated.","TL; DR - had a gig last night with my alcoholic guitar player who was so drunk he kept fucking up, could barely stand and fell into the drum kit. Need some advice on how or if I should talk with him about it. 

So I had a gig tonight with my new band (one of the guys, “Dave”, I’ve actually played with for years in another band) and it was so-so. I was sober and clear-headed the whole time and had some fun, but Dave was drunk as a fucking skunk. He’s had his issues with alcohol in the past, and has admitted that he’s an alcoholic, so I’m not saying any of this to out or shame him or anything like that. 

I got there a little bit after everyone else to unload the truck and start setting up, about 3:30 (gig didn’t start until 9) and I noticed that Dave was already working on a pint. No alarms were going off; this is just Dave. He can put away some beers and still play his ass off. He’s one of the most talented guitar players I’ve ever been lucky enough to play with in 20+ years of playing, and just a really great guy too. I shared stages with him where we were both loaded and just having the greatest times. 

But today was different. I have stopped drinking and Dave is heavy in the thick of it. He has tried to quit in the past and had shared his intentions with our former band mates whenever we’d get together for rehearsals, and we all obliged and didn’t bring alcohol into the space, so as to keep temptation from him (sidebar: I would keep a vodka bottle out in the car and go out in between songs for shots, thinking nobody would know. Didn’t realize at the time that I was in the same boat as, or maybe worse off than Dave). 

Anyway, as we continued to setup I just kept noticing the heavy smell of alcohol around him. But he still seemed clear, so I didn’t think too much of it yet. By the time we finished setting up and all went out for a pre-show dinner, Dave was hammered. Plus he had smoked half a joint, and I think that always intensifies the beer buzz by a factor of 5. The time was 7pm, and we still had a couple hours before we even start. He was all happy and giggly, but his eyes were half shut. I was starting to get the bad vibes. 

To make a long story short, by the time the third set rolled around, he was fucking up almost every song. Plus he fell into the drum set once. He could barely stand up. It was horrifying and embarrassing, and I felt terrible for him. I know what it’s like to be so fucked up you can’t even play the right chords to a song you can play in your sleep. 

How do I say something to him? Or should I even say anything at all? I know that he knows he has a problem, and I’m not the kind of person to lecture another about their issues, especially when I have the same issues. But then again, since I do share that with him, maybe I am uniquely qualified to talk to him about it? I don’t know. I know that I don’t want to get up there and go through that experience again, so it’s either he figures it out or I will have to move on and quit the band. I’m not comfortable talking about it with the other guys in this band, but I know they saw the same thing I saw. But I’m pretty certain they don’t know about Dave’s past and his alcoholism. 

I know some of you guys have had experience with this; what’d you do, and did it work? Or what would you have done differently if you could?",3

I made it through Thanksgiving with the in laws without drinking again, even with the snide comments they throw at me every time I refuse the alcohol they try and push on me. My favorite comment from my MIL so far was the one where she served me water in a wine glass so that I “could at least pretend to be a grown up”. 

It’s been a good year for the most part. I rarely think about drinking anymore, but when the thought pops into my head nowadays, it’s a lot easier to tell my lizard brain to shut up and leave me alone. 

Another good thing that has come out of this (depending on how you look at it, I’m choosing to be positive) is that I actually noticed that I hadn’t been feeling well for several months, and went to see a doctor about it. They still aren’t sure what is wrong with me, but had I still been drinking, I would have chalked up my feeling poorly to the constant hangover I was living with, and could have ended up doing even more damage to myself. So here’s hoping they can figure it out for me and I’ll feel better soon.

Laying in bed, barely moving for an entire day, with another hangover most normal people rarely experience, I'd already conceded to myself that I was getting another bottle as soon as I felt well enough to make it to the shops. I'm sure a lot of you can relate to this feeling.

I'm coming to terms with, frankly, how pathetic my drinking is making me as a person. At 31 years old, waking up at 4pm and vomiting for the first few hours of the day, shaking and feeling close to tears. Last year I had to have my front 4 teeth replaced with crowns. The acid from drinking and vomiting all day 5 times a week had left them completely eroded and chipped. After a few sober stints last year I'm back in a bed bound cycle of drinking and recovering. The progressive nature of this is making every relapse worse and every low lower. 

I have everything at my finger tips, a well paying job that I do from home (somewhat of a curse for an alcoholic) and friends all over the world. But I don't do anything, I don't take care of my appearance any more, I don't travel or visit friends, I don't feel happy. Basically, I'm not living my life. I'm wasting it, trying not to feel terrible by staring at the bottom of a bottle of rum. 

Today is day 3 for me and farther than I've gotten in 3 months. Please join me in ending this year like we mean to start the next year. I don't want to waste my life, I don't want to be a 31 year old man who eats his meals in bed, showers twice a week and throws up nearly every day. Join me in living life this December.

Edit:

I'm blown away by the amount of support you guys have shown me here, this community is something else. There were far too many messages for me to reply to, but thank you to everyone who has offered me advice, support, solidarity and shared their story with me.

I drank because I didn't want to be in my own skin. Saying alcohol is the problem is like saying the pencil Hitler used to write his manifesto was responsible for the words on the page. It wasn't alcohol. It was me all along. I have PTSD and I have been running from it my entire life. Maybe it makes me angry that people think 'if she just quit drinking she would be fine' or maybe it makes me angry because 'admitting' I am an alcoholic makes me feel like I am sick and to be honest, I am tired of hearing how sick I am when I know it's my unconfronted PTSD, when I know it's a result of things that happened to me that I never stood a chance against and never realized were affecting me as deeply as they were. If it wasn't alcohol it's weed. If it wasn't weed it's sleep. If it wasn't sleep it's binge eating and if it wasn't binge eating it's starving myself.... When people tell me that my problem is alcohol I feel like they don't understand that it's a symptom and not the problem. I don't actually get on anyone about it because I know that they are trying to be supportive and help and it's easiest for them to just categorize it as 'alcohol is the problem'.... but damn does it suck when they just expect that now that I have quit drinking my problems are gone. They aren't gone. They are there just the same and I feel like it's unreasonable to tell people that struggle with alcohol that if they quit things will just fix themselves. They don't. Most of us drink for a reason and those reasons are still there when the alcohol is gone. Getting sober isn't about cutting out alcohol to me, it's dealing with the things that I avoided by using alcohol. Does alcohol make all of it worse? Fuck yes it does. But so does indulging in my own self-hatred, so does eating so much sugar I feel sick, so does disassociating from things that make me feel uncomfortable... Some days it's hard to not use the escape of the alcohol, but on those days it's hard not to use any of the other unhealthy coping mechanisms I have learned. And now that I am pushing through my PTSD I realize that my work is cut out for me... but at last my coping mechanisms are becoming sustainable and healthy. I don't want to drink when I don't want to escape. So the only conclusion I can come to is that I must build a life worth participating in. Thank you for being here.

2019-12-01 09:37:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e4i6hb/my_miracle_year/,My miracle year,"This former wine mom made it one year, people! And what a year it has been.

A year ago today I woke up and started doing some research on sobriety instead of moderation.  I had consulted Dr. Google about my alcohol problem many times before.  But something about this time seemed different.  

The night before, I’d been pretty sloshed at home with my husband, after the kids went to bed.  We started to have sex, but in the middle of it, he got up to throw up.  I was not as drunk as him, but I was drunk, and I realized that if our kids needed us, we would be in a terrible condition to help.  I also realized that this was a pretty common occurrence for us to be drunk together while our kids slept at home.

I took responsibility for my own actions, in that moment.  I knew I couldn’t control my husbands’s drinking but I could try to fix my own.  If I had to be, I would be the parent my kids could count on.  I’m the past, I had tried moderating, and tried getting my husband to moderate with me.  While it would work for a while, we always went back to the same insane behavior.  I was ready to get out of this terrible cycle.  I committed to 30 days to begin with.

I first discovered Holly Whitaker’s website Hip Sobriety (now Tempest).  She made me feel like sobriety was not only possible, but an incredible superpower.  She made it clear that you don’t need to have a full blown, classic paper-bag day-drinking alcohol problem to benefit from quitting.  I read her site, trembled like a leaf all day, and kept sober.

Then, I discovered quit lit.  I read so many books at night to keep my mind busy and focused on my new path.  “Drinking: A Love Story”, “This Naked Mind” and “The Recovering: Intoxication and it’s Aftermath” are among my favorites.  Once I read to my hearts content,
I found myself at 90 days, and decided to commit to 6 months. I read, ate ice cream, and stayed sober.

In my new found free time, I began to take joy in working out.  I’d been a runner while drinking and used it as an excuse (see? I can still run fast so it’s not so bad!) and as repentance (damn I drank too much again, better go run 8 miles to burn off that booze).  This time around, I switched to strength training, yoga, and HIIT.  I invested in a trainer/programmer who would send workouts to an app 3-4 times a week.  I’ve never been physically stronger, and I’ve kept up with my training all year. I replaced my endorphins, got stronger, and stayed fucking sober.

I used to drink for thrills and excitement (which looking back now was SO boring), so I’ve spent the last year creating my fun.  I got my motorcycle license in July.  I finally rode the Honda CB350 4cyl that my husband restored for me years ago.  About that time, I found myself at six months, having the time of my life, and happily committed to one year sober.

And here we are.  In the last year, I have found myself.  I trust myself again.  I rediscovered joy in the little things.  I no longer scan the room for alcohol to figure out my next fix. I have created healthy boundaries.  I have been the parent my children deserve.

Finally, I am happy to say, both my husband and father have joined me on this incredible sober journey this year.  My dad has 5 months and my husband has 60 days, and is in and IOP treatment program.  To those of you considering making a the sober choice: not only will you be doing a beautiful thing for yourself, you just may positively influence the lives of those around you in a way you could’ve never imagined.  

Have courage, be strong, live life on your best terms.  And THANK YOU, to this sub, for being one of the most supportive and kind places on the internet.  You’ve all helped me more than you know.

I realized a lot of things in my sober journey. 

1. my gf is an absolute saint for sticking by me during my dark times
2. the 'innocent' teenage binge drinking I did was actually a massive warning for what was to happen in the future
3. for me, there was no romanticised 'rock bottom' moment. my friends never pulled me aside for an intervention. for people in my situation, do not wait for this moment, it will never come.
4. so much of my life and identity i had built was connected to drinking, eg living close to a train station (so i could stumble home easily), being the drunk and loose guy at parties, only allowing myself to be silly when alcohol was involved.
5. working in a bar, for someone like me. was actually the **perfect** thing. I was constantly surrounded by people who are at the mercy of drinking. I ended up losing that job right before my 1 year soberversary, couldn't help but feel it was meant to be.

I initially decided I would do 100 days, then i felt so good I said id do a year. and now I feel so good I'm going to go another 10. Also my skin is beautiful now lol, the perks dont stop.",16

As I type this, my SO is asleep in the next room.

Our lives are full of so much more now than it was nine months ago.

We were chatting the other day about booze, and how we had been using it to fill all the empty spaces on our lives.  Have a Saturday afternoon with nothing to do?  We'd go drinking.  An hour between dinner and a movie?  Drink.  Time after the movie?  Drink.

Eventually, though, alcohol created it's open emptiness to fill, until our lives were nothing but alcohol-filled emptiness.

We're filling the bigger empty moments with different things now.  Running.  Fitness.  Family.  *Real* Friends.  Sporting events and musicals and ballet and live music.

We still have those tiny spaces, between the larger filled ones.  An hour here, an evening there.  And, not gonna lie, sometimes it's tempting to go back to old ways and fill them with booze.

But we don't, and instead we sometimes discover amazing things.  A good coffee shop or bakery.  A quiet moment where we chat, or simply browse our phones and exchange funny memes.  Or go to bed early and snuggle till we drift off to sleep.

I'm headed back to bed now.  Sleeping in on a Sunday morning when you're *not* hung over is kinda awesome.",3

I’m relatively new to the sub. I’m on day three, as Thanksgiving was my most recent relapse. Now that I’m taking a genuine, honest look at my drinking in addition to having open, vulnerable Conversations about my drinking, I’m slightly blown away that I put so much time into planning my drinking crusades.

I literally convinced myself a week before Thanksgiving that I can moderate(for the millionth time,) And systematically went out to dinner on two occasions and only had one drink. For me that is the threshold. I’m able to have just one drink, granted that I drink it slowly or else the floodgates open. With this tiny unrealistic success, I told myself I was allowed to enjoy a bit of imbibing  after cooking for 25 people on Thanksgiving.

With that, and of course with an immense amount of planning, I made sure I wasn’t available the day after Thanksgiving, as I told myself I would be exhausted from all of the cooking and cleaning. Ha!

Clearly this was the little devil bird on my shoulder talking.

I convinced myself that I deserved to drink more on Thanksgiving, as clearly I’m now in control and can moderate, right?

Um, no bitch!

Here’s what happened. I sipped on Champs after everyone was served, sipped on more, that led to white wine, which led to a blackout, me humiliating myself in front of a man I really like, and a crippling hangover the next day( my subconscious knew I’d make myself sick; so yes I need the following day off.)

When I came to the self realization that not only am I planning my drinking, but also planning the day after, knowing I’m going to be sicker than a dog, yes, there’s a huge problem here..

When you have to plan your binges to fit into your schedule, you have a problem(well, in my case you certainly do.)

I didn’t hear back from the guy I highly respect and like btw..
F***, that’s shitty, but very sobering.

Has anyone else planned their binges from start to finish?

How about planning bad ass sober events? Hmm

Open to suggestions!

It has taken 2 years (from when I made an attempt to stop) to get to this point. I went on this 'stop drinking' journey on my own, no AA.

2 years ago, I left my husband because in my mind it was the only way to beat the drinking problem. He wasn't supportive and would purchase alcohol even when I never asked. He didn't want to quit drinking either. I couldn't live this way anymore but as much as I loved him, and my 2 sons, I left the marriage.

After that marriage, a year later, I got into a short relationship, that had it's issues due to drinking. Not that I was terrible, I had already cut back to only drinking on weekends this time (it used to be everyday). The issue was, it seemed like everytime we saw each other, he just wanted to drink. He often gaslighted as well. We are no more because, I left that relationship too.

Now that I am a bit more level headed (and I know I still have a long way to go), I've noticed I'm starting to look back on my past. My husband was a nice person despite his hick-ups here and there. I've recently learned from one of our children, that him and his partner (of 1 year) drink almost everyday. I am really concerned about this, but theres not alot I can do as we don't have any contact. I instill in my kids to stay away from alcohol and explain what it does to people. It's not prejudice. I really hope they don't start.

I am feeling a lot of guilt. Is this stage normal? I feel like all the pain is catching up on me, the pain I drowned with alcohol. It's really sad and sometimes I question whether or not I made the right choice because I am lonely. I know I made the right choice to quit alcohol, and I did try to remedy our marriage but he had already moved on.

Is this normal to feel guilt after quitting? I can't be the only one.",9

I moved to Hawaii about 4 years ago and met an amazing girl and her dog last year.  We hit it off for the first few months until our Friday night ritual turned into drinking and watching television at my place.  I have a very addictive personality and know that I need to focus my addiction on health and the gym or things will go downhill pretty quickly.  About four months into our relationship I found out she had one DUI, then two DUI’s, and she continued to drink.  I’d suggested sobriety and AA meetings because I was starting to drink and drive, started to see my life go down the toilet due to alcohol addiction, but she declined, so we called off the relationship (though alcohol wasn’t the only problem). 
 Fast forward to about one month ago and I hit her up for dinner.  I show up to her place and she comes walking down the stairs, desperately clutching both railings, her emaciated body shaking severely  She comes out the door and immediately rolls her ankle because she’s shaking so bad.  I offered to take her to the hospital because I was so worried about her shaking and ankle injury but she declined.  I soon realized she had the shakes from alcohol withdrawal and feared it would get worse if she didn’t get treatment, which she consistently denied.  I did the only thing I knew to do and got her alcohol which eased her withdrawal symptoms.  The next day I went to Costco and bought her a ton of food and drink, offered to buy her a giant bottle of Costco vodka that she would use to wean herself out of alcohol withdrawal (boy was I naive). I get to her house about three days later to take her to the hospital for her injured ankle, got inside and the giant bottle of vodka was completely empty, I knew she’d drank it.  Her place reeked of dog piss, roaches everywhere, clothing everywhere, it was seriously disgusting.  It’s amazing what alcohol did to this beautiful 31 year old girl who I loved, it made me feel truly helpless.  That day I took her to the hospital, told them of her drinking problem, and never saw her again because she refused to get help.  Seeing this has been so difficult and has encouraged me to become sober.  Has anyone else here had a similar experience?  A desire to become sober because a loved one has been so consumed by a drug?  I wish you all well and look forward to uplifting posts! Aloha",16

2019-12-01 02:35:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e4d9qc/my_story_at_360_days/,My story at 360 days,"I'm 28 years old and about 18 months ago I had it all, my dream job, dream girl, etc... Then I threw it all away because I couldn't put down the bottle. Even then it took me awhile to really admit to myself my weakness and try and get some help. I got lucky. My neighbor, who had been mentoring me in my now trashed career, happened to also be 5 years sober and volunteered to help me and sponsor me. 

Since then I've been working the AA program to some degree and have been successful so far to the point that, as the title says, I'm about to hit a year sober. I haven't even begun to rebuild my life but what I do have is a solid foundation to begin again. 

My main purpose in posting this is this - my sponsor has lately been encouraging me to begin some form of service. Whether it be being the coffee guy at meetings or whatever. So I thought I'd start here with the thinking that maybe one part of my ramblings might be helpful to someone. 

Don't let anyone tell you what the ""correct"" way to stay sober is. Find something that works for you as an individual and stick to it. Find something powerful and meaningful that motivates you. For me, it's my career. I can't have both it and alcohol. I want my job back a hell of a lot more than I want to drink again. I kind of relate this to the ""higher power"" AA talks about. It's especially useful if you're not particularly religious. I've heard from plenty of people that tried quitting just for the sake of quitting and struggled with it. (That being said, if that's what works for you, more power to you, I am jealous and wish I could be that strong) 

A big worry I had when I started on this path was that I would be viewed as weak by my friends and others close to me. If at all possible, block that out. Adopt the thinking that you are stronger than ever for confronting a problem and having the guts to do something about it. My friends have been nothing but supportive and some have even joined me on this path. If someone doesn't want to associate with you anymore because you've quit drinking then, unfortunately, those are the kinds of people that were never quality friends in the first place. 

Finally, a silly little trick I came up with that helps me out, especially early on in my sobriety, is: get greedy. Get greedy and proud. Think of your growing number of days sober as a bank account. Do what you can one day at a time to stay sober and watch that ""bank account"" grow. Be proud of and grateful for that growing number. Even if it's just something between you, yourself and the wall. At the end of the day it is something to be proud of because this really isn't an easy undertaking but it is rewarding and you will feel all around better because of it. 

That's my piece. If you got something out of it, great! If not, that's ok too. Good luck to any and all dealing with this malady.",54

-Alcohol and substance abuse have dictated my past romantic relationships

-I am an embarrassing drunk. I seriously say the stupidest things
 
-I'm in graduate school now. I can't jeopardize my academic career because of this bad habit.

-I want to become a better person. I have to admit, I have made dumb mistakes and decisions in the past. In order for me to get better, I know that I have to stop drinking/using substances.

-Corny, but I believe in soulmates. I want to meet my future partner when I'm at my best

Interestingly, what actually pushed me to make this decision was a horrible night that happened a month ago. I got into a nasty argument with someone (who I have feelings for). We were both drunk and were having dinner with classmates. Everyone saw me leave the restaurant early, sobbing. I was so embarrassed, upset and ashamed...it was a hard night for me but it was a wake-up call. I know this person hates me now, which is a struggle, but I know that was my rock bottom. It's only uphill from here!

I spent two days inside from the rain. I called three people and they were all doing family shit the whole weekend. I messaged girls on OkCupid and none of them responded. I even arranged to buy rare CDs from some guy, talked the whole deal outand he’s so far ghosted. I went to a punk show across the county and the bands were so fucking late I finally just left. I started to read a summary of the Indian classic the Mahabharata in a dingy fast food place near Disneyland, while I could hear a homeless guy vomiting in the background the entire time. I liked the book and it was the only thing that went well in over 72 hours. 

As I drove the streets of that area, I thought of all the times I almost ended up homeless there through no fault of my own from a shitty start in life and I really wanted to drink because those areas carry a lot of trauma for me that eventually led to the drinking.

He then fell off the wagon for a few months, but got back on track and it has now been almost a year since his last drink. Today he made amends with me. I knew it was coming because he actually brought it up on the phone last week when we were talking about my DUI, but it still caught me off guard. 

I won't get into too much detail; we pretty much just talked about how he missed so much of my childhood, etc. (We've had a really good relationship the past few years btw). 

But I'm really happy for him. I'm glad he is sober and living a good life. I'm glad that he's in my life again and we can literally talk about anything. I'm glad he's finally being the man he was meant to be. 

Good job Dad. I love you.",23

A lot of bad shit is going on in my life and I'm having a really time not breaking and going to the liquor store to drown out all of this awful stuff happening to both me and my wife. But every day I wake up I remind myself not to drink. I remind myself it's not good for me.  I wasnt able to do all of that until I found this sub. 
In this time where we are supposed to be giving thanks, I want to say thanks to all of you who constantly show me, and everyone else taking this hard journey support and love. It's not easy to take that step towards a better life, and it wont always happen overnight. But because of people like all of you, people like me can finally have that support system that is so difficult in this day and age. 
Everybody out there on this journey with me, good luck, and god speed

2019-12-01 01:00:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e4bvco/i_feel_like_i_cant_help_myself_and_dont_know_what/,I feel like I can't help myself and don't know what to do.,"I hate drinking. Until I drink. Then, everything I plan is out the window. There's not much I can tell myself besides that my problems stem from drinking. I know better,It's awful for you. Besides the 40lbs I've gained in the past 3yrs I feel awful. 

I had been pretty well, until about this time in 2016 when the person I'd been with for 11yrs cheated on me, and left a day later. We were always fun-havers. Mostly weed, but I really like beer. I hate that I like it. I used to hear people say ""I can drink you under the table."" and think that was admirable. Until I realized I can drink 15 millers in an evening without blinking. That's 120oz of beer for everyone not counting. At one point I even said it, self-depricating and disliking it that no, I could drink YOU under the table. For days.

So when she left, it was weird to be honest. Sometimes I wonder what was happening in my head at the time. There's a period between Thanksgiving and Christmas of 2016 that I do not really remember. But I know I drank a ton, met my second girlfriend and bought a new car. Wow! This is great! Whole new me. 

No, worse me. My new girlfriend didn't know how much I drank. We got along great at first, she was a lovely person. I'm honestly sure if I had been sober and met her a few months later I'd have married her. We moved in together six months or so after I'd broken up with my first ex. She didn't want to live in the very nice three bedroom house I was renting at the time, because my ex and I had lived there together. We rented a modest apartment. She moved from her small town to join me and we played house for a few days. She didn't do well with work, I didn't do well with not drinking (she didn't know, or probably didn't say anything). I was still in love with my ex. We were together for eleven years, a third of my life. She knew. I'd try to reassure her, but she knew. We tried for a bit. I'm pretty sure we dated for six months to the day. The day she left,  I loved her, she's my model of a girlfriend. It was such a hard goodbye, worse than the goodbye I received after eleven years. 

Guess what I did approximately two minutes after? Damn straight, went to get some booze. And I kept drinking. I justified it that I was working hard, and I was. What better to celebrate a long day than a few dozen oz? Would you believe that eventually, my bank account fell in the negative, I stopped cleaning my apartment, and that I could have probably built a home out of the boxes and cans I neglected. Now I'm excessively lonely, remember that car I mentioned? Ever walk out of work and your car is gone? And you realize it's because not only couldn't you pay for it because of alcohol, but the affects of alcohol? Not fun, also try doing it with a co-worker you've just offered a ride to. 

That's embarrassing. Wanna know what else is? I didn't tell anyone I lost my car, lol. This lasted about two weeks, I think? Until I just couldn't do finding an Uber, or the bus. So I just stopped. Done. I didn't go to work. Which usually people would just say meh, and let me be. These people? No. One of my co-workers called 911, so I got a wellness check. While I was napping (drunk sleep), so I literally woke up to a cop telling me to get on the ground. Because I hadn't gone to work, there's a policeman in my bedroom pointing a pistol at me. So, we go to the living room, where I'm confronted by the officer as well as my landlord. They want me to go to the hospital. I refuse, I have been this drunk before, I need left alone. Guess what? My coworkers call my parents! So now everyone knows I'm fucked. (Except me.) My friends come over, we talk. I cry. Guess what I do when they leave? I'm finishing my beer! So eventually from these events, and alcohol, I'm able to return to sleep. Again, my coworkers called my parents, so while I had talked to my mom to explain it off, obviously not bought. 

I'm an only child and my mom loves me very much. I woke the next morning to my father calling that my mother was outside. Great. So I go out, guess who's along? A social worker and a cop. At this point I will do anything to be let be.

So, I'm charged with possession. Which I have now finished the probation for. All told it cost several hundred dollars, barely any of which I had.  Moved home, and did well. I was hundreds of days sober, even though I was still low. I wouldn't describe myself as happy then, but I was better. I was still lonely but better.

Until summer of 18. Like a kid in a candy store. I had started to retool, got a good job. Gotta celebrate, how do I celebrate? I have a few friends, no one I hangout with. Lost that one too, to drinking.

I've been spotty ever since. I have a few friends. I have my family and my cats. And I'm excessively lucky. Things could be much much worse.

So today, I sit lonely, wishing I wasn't an alcoholic. I have no one to talk to. I'm going to church for the first time tomorrow to hopefully start making some friends. Then I'm deleting this account. Most of my comments on Reddit were drunkerd, some jealous, some hateful. It's hard for me to look at posts referring relationships, because I would do anything.

This is rambling and I'm sorry, but I don't think I've ever even tried to explain myself. To those in their twenties; don't be me. It sucks. Don't give up your future for an evening of 'fun'. Because fun is fleecing. You're forever.

I cannot say I won't drink with you today, but I'll try my hardest not tomorrow.",3

In todays world of social media where were are constantly inundated with negativity and division through media. Its refreshing that the typical political, racial, sexual, gender, and every other difference under the sun that makes us different isn't on the radar here. I feel this sub is one of the positive aspects of technology. I'ts great to hear people support each other without the dividing lines based on all the things you hear about these days.  Its become so bad that I refuse to watch the news anymore, but I don't have to worry about that on this thread. This support group has been instrumental in my progresss and continues to be so. So I will keep fighting the good fight, heres to another battle won, peace be to you all. Heres to the sober revolution!",37
2019-12-01 00:47:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e4bon3/karaoke/,Karaoke,"I worked three nights a week in a bar for three years, I had all the karaoke nights. Once I started allowing myself to drink at work I started allowing myself to get shitfaced so I could appease my regulars by singing. I don't remember any of the times I sang, but there's some videos floating around in case I wanted a reminder.  

Tonight I went to karaoke, drank a thousand diet Cokes, and sang my heart out. After all that time thinking I had to have a blackout in order to sing, I sang while 32(?) days sober. It honestly feels like I crossed something off my bucket list that I didn't know was on there. The only downside was this was my first time in a bar since I stopped drinking and the smell of all the beer and liquor got to me a little but I DID NOT DRINK TONIGHT!

Edit: 34 days!",9

Now I go back to a few old habits...one is, I always enjoyed receiving holiday cards.  Yes, the physical ones, not email or text greetings.  Here's the thing...post-drinking, it's a great low-key way to reconnect with folks I may have disconnected from in the past (usually because they weren't drinkers).  I reach out, take the first step without pressure  - ""Hey, how are you?  I'm sending out cards this year, what's your current mailing address?""  I love the responses and cards sent back to me.  A small thing, yes, but worth the small amount of time and expense.",3

2019-12-01 00:18:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e4b8gf/im_back/,I’m back.,"I’m back from my wayward Thanksgiving week. After successfully quitting on Sept. 29, I went ahead with my plan to drink over Thanksgiving week while I was away on vacation with my family. I did that and nothing bad happened. I had a few drinks each of maybe four days this week, including today. I’m back home and ready to go alcohol-free again. Probably until Christmas.

I know a lot of you cautioned me about my plan. I really appreciate your concern. I have never wanted to be a teetotaler but I definitely needed to fix my relationship with alcohol. Right now I like the idea of drinking on special occasions, away from home. I do not think alcohol can or should be a part of my daily life right now.

So to everyone who shared their thoughts and gave me advice: Thank you. This community helped me make a major change in my life and I fully intend to continue participating in order to make that change permanent.
