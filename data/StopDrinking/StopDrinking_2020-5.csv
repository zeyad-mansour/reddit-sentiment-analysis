I've been struggling with alcohol addiction for as long as I can remember, I tend to binge to cope with my stress and problems, sometimes my binges have went on months at a time, with maybe a day or 2 here and there where I either couldn't afford to drink or was just so sick that I couldn't get out of bed, at those times I had it in my head that I had to stop and would maybe last a few hours in the day instead of waking up and immediately drinking but it never lasted cause I always thought maybe I could taper myself off so it wouldn't feel so awful but that changed recently, I had my younger brother wind up in hospital due to heavy drinking with cirrhosis of the liver at only 21, it was a bit of a wake up call and that along with a few friends voicing their concern made me seek counselling with a specialist in addiction during lockdown and the past 10 weeks now I've been skyping my sessions which I feel has helped massively just by talking about it. In the past 10 weeks I have managed to be sober for 11 days at my best(longest I've probably been sober in the past 6 years atleast) and every other attempt is maybe around 4-5, I've been feeling like such a failure and a let down to everyone I know and have been pushing people away because I just feel so ashamed that I haven't beaten this yet, I feel like anyone who tries to speak to me knows that I'm still drinking and they're just judging me the whole time( I know this is my own paranoia but I can't help it). 

&#x200B;

My problem is that I am trying to get to a point where I can still drink for the likes of special occasions/ going out with friends etc..( I have in the past weeks of counselling cut back my drinking and binges from months to only a few days at a time and it tends to only get triggered by major stress recently, such as a family member going to hospital, plus I used to drink about 6 litres of cider a day or a litre of spirits, pretty much whatever I could afford/ could get me blackout drunk quicker at the time to now only drinking at most 3 litres of cider and stopping there whenever I binge, I feel like I've made progress as I used to buy in bulk but now I only by one bottle at a time and leave it till as late as possible to do so as well, so whereas I used drink for the entirety of the day when I wasn't working I now only go to buy drink an hour or so before close so I can't get anymore that night, however over the past few weeks I've been thinking it might be wishful thinking to get to the point that I consider myself a normal drinker as I've been unable to resist the urge to go get a drink as soon as things get stressful or as I've been finding myself recently, lonely, I'm just wondering if there's anyone who could give me some insight as to whether there's any hope of getting to the point where I can go for a casual/ social drink and keep it to that or if maybe its better I stop all together? 

Atm I'm 2 days sober, going on to 3 now but I keep having thoughts and cravings to drink everyday I wake up, normally its a few hours after or sometimes it's immediate because I've had dreams where I've been drinking and having a great time and want to feel that again! I feel sometimes like I'm just going crazy and losing my mind and I just want it to stop, I want to be done with this feeling, I just wish I could feel normal again. 

I'm sorry for any rambling, I've just a lot I haven't felt comfortable to share yet and tried to express everything as best as I could, but one thing I can say is that reading through other's stories and posts has truly been inspiring and I don't think I would have been brave enough to open up without seeing them, this is truly an amazing community and I hope some day I can become someone who inspires the way you's all do.",1,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.52583474}"

I can go weeks at most without drinking but then I give in and it grows from there... I’ve been drinking on and off for over 10 years maybe more I’m currently mid 30’s female. But otherwise I’m a very health conscious person and no one would suspect my unhealthy addiction. I don’t know if anyone can relate to how crazy it is that I refuse to eat unhealthy and strict with supplements etc but somehow I can justify booze every time. Last night was a rough night once the alcohol started to wear off just like clockwork 4-5am the crazy dreams and thoughts start, fast heart rate and high aniexty.

For a bit of a backstory, this guy is one of two male friends I have and the father of my God children. He is a wonderful human and has been an avid brewer of beverages since I first met him about 4 years ago. He made his first ever good tasting mead according to him and as I was visiting for the first time in months I ""had to try it"" according to him.

Well I had the initial shock, but only a half second of indecision. I told him I had quit drinking and was really sorry but I couldn't sample his success.

You know what he said? ""sad, also good for you."" I mean, what a guy. No questions as to why, no trying to convince me just to have a sip. Just ""good for you"" and that was that. What is more, when I went over he offered me different beverages while still enjoying his beer and mead. I did smell the mead and it smelled amazing, but I did not drink today and I am so grateful. He is a casual drinker so all he had was one tin and a homebrew while I was there. 

The tin is one i turned him onto back when i was a heavy drinker and it has a distinct sound when it opens. Hearing that was a huge trigger. But I made it through without getting white knuckles and didn't think about drinking for 95% of my visit. 

In other news, I spent about 2 hours teaching my eldest godson how to play magic the gathering and he soaked it up. He built a WICKED 5 color + artifacts deck that destroyed the green deck I built two out of three games. And it was his first time building a deck and playing magic!

It has worked a lot staying sober for 4 months, and within the last two months, I've only had alcohol twice. Yesterday was the third time.

I'm not entirely sure what happened. It was Friday and pay day so my friend and I decided to hang out together. It was all chill, as it always is with this friend. He's pretty difficult to talk with though because he's always stoned as fuck so our hang outs are always kinda awkward. I've thought about telling him how annoying it is, because when he's not stoned, he's really sweet and easy to talk to. Regardless of this, we still hung out from time to time because we live in the same city and usually go back to our own apartment after hanging out for an evening.

So yesterday I made some smoothies with frozen berries and poured some vodka into them. My friend loved them so much, he asked me to make more for him all evening, which I did. This also resulted in me getting slightly hammered. Not drunk, but drunk enough to tell this story that I've been telling everyone for years when I reach story time drunk. I used to know a girl that I didn't really like. She was a girlfriend of my boyfriend's roommate. I woke up to a weird noise the first time I slept there. Sat up in bed and was all concerned because it was such a weird sound. Turns out, it was the roommate and this girl having sex and her sex moans were so weird, they were comical.

My friend got really offended about that story. He started acting weird and when I kept prodding for an explanation he finally said that he didn't think making fun of other people like that was fun. That was fair enough and I can totally understand that, but everyone I've told that story to before has laughed, so I did not expect this reaction. I kinda thought that was it and we could just move on with the night after that, but no. What followed was him being really rude toward me. He gathered up his things and pretty much stormed out of my apartment. I helped him collect his things but when I put them in front of him, he just hissed at me and was like ""not now dude!"" it was really off putting and I had to go into my kitchen and sigh really deeply because I couldn't believe him reacting this harshly to the story. He didn't say farewell as he left and he pretended to ignore me as he headed down the stairs of the building, where he usually waves at me. It was so bizzare

I have no idea what actually happened. I can't help but feel like my friend overreacted extremely and he should apologise for being so rude toward me about it all. I know I fucked up too but I just can't help but feel like he took his reaction to the extreme and disrespected me in my own home.

I sit back with a weird feeling that has lasted all day. I'm not sad about losing this friendship, I've lowkey been wanting to ghost him for a while because of how impossible it is to talk with him. Part of me can't help but feel like it was because of the alcohol that we both had. I wrote him a message today  asking if we're cool and he said yes, followed by telling me he was still mad and a really condescending ""cya around out there""

I don't know what to do. I've been thinking about this all day and I don't know if I should feel like a shitty person or be offended by the way he snapped at me.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44287154}"

I made it through new years sober and got to about 60 days. After the 60 days i decided now maybe id have my problematic binge drinking under control. It started with 6 beers at a time with friends and increased to 8-12 before moving to over 12 drinks in a sitting. The same old shit, doing things out of character and becoming the same old drinker i once was with reversing all my hard work. I was living with friends who were also big drinkers. Last Monday I had work at 7am tuesday whole they were drinking upstairs, at 11pm i asked them to turn the music down via messenger and one of them proceeded to say things about me along the lines of ""shes fuckin disgusting, we've always looked after her shes a fuckin mess and a liability and should run in traffic"" ""we look after her when she gets on the verge of shitting her pants and this is how she gives thanks"" notably in the morning after a sleepless night i packed my shit and moved down stairs at my aunt's. It opened me up to the fact that drinking makes people ugly, i want to look after my physical and mental health and no matter if i drink again ill never have it under control because it slowly takes over. It takes friendships, relationships messes up your ability at work and slowly takes everything away from you.
I had my last wine last night and am back to reset my clock and had rejoined this sub that did such a great job with helping me reach my 50 days of sobriety.
I'm now in an environment that supports that and remember how amazing i felt this year coming so far.
To those in the same boat that think that they may go back to drinking as they may feel control i advise not too. It creeps back up albeit slowly but with a vengeance.

[my story, as I told it a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/buuem2/two_years_ago_today_i_was_dying/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

[Three] years ago today, I was dying.

3 years ago today, my life began to change forever. 

My second to last drink was on May 28th, 2017, at a family member's out of state wedding. I was 35 years old. I drank. I blacked out that night, vomited all over myself, ruining my bridesmaid's dress... as I knew I would. The next morning, ashamed and desperate, I decided to go cold turkey until I got home from the wedding trip, where my plan was to try to self-taper a course of benzos. I needed to stop drinking, but I had tried so many times, and I simply could not stop. I was trapped and dying. My whole life was a cage, and I was the one who had locked myself in. In that moment, I hoped I could go 48 hours safely without a drink. 

I was wrong. I wasn't safe, I was withdrawing. My hands shook, I couldn't sleep at all, my heart raced, and I was clammy and sweaty. Things progressively became awful... And then, exactly forty-six hours from my last drink at the wedding, on the car ride on the way home from out of state, everything got terrifying. My heart rate shot up. I felt terror and these pulses of heat running up my body into my head and face, my face flushing red and then draining back to pale white as my vision darkened, over and over again. 

So I told my husband the truth for the first time, telling him at last, exactly how much I really was drinking every day (half a handle of vodka daily -- that is about 22 shots of vodka every day), that I was in severe alcohol withdrawal, and that we needed to pull over and call the ambulance immediately.

So as I first sobbed my truth to him at the gas station off the highway in rural Georgia, I chugged that very last beer, on May 30th, 2017, in an effort to try to prevent the almost-certainly-imminent seizure that I knew was coming.  Then there was the Ambulance ride, confused, my whole body shaking, and my blood pressure 205/100, pulse 190s, and I end up in a small town rural ER-- where hearing the gentle and understanding words of a (truly Higher-Power-sent) physician gave me a second chance, when (after I was stable) he gave me the phone number to the treatment center that he, himself, had gone to, years before.

I haven't had a drink since then.

Today, I celebrate 3 full years of sobriety. My life leading up to summer 2017 was full of agonizing grief, crippling depression, overwhelming shame, and utter and defeated hopelessness. My life since May 30th, 2017, has been an uphill road of a slowly and painfully increasing level of hope. Joy has returned. Self worth is back. My ""whole attitude and outlook upon life has changed."" Best of all... There is no more aloneness, that awful ache, so deep in the heart. I am beyond grateful for the healing that I have undergone, thanks to my family, friends, sober network, my treatment center, and my husband. 

I grieve still for my lost self 3 years ago, but today, I celebrate the dignity of my recovery.

Like many I started drinking at about 18 and thought it was great.  Alcohol got me into a few problems here and there, a fight or two, a broken wrist, some cuts requiring stitches.  But nothing that ever made me quit for more than maybe a month or two.  
          When I was 23 I met a girl that I instantly knew I had to be with the rest of my life.  We both drank, I feel I probably made her drinking worse but she was never as bad as I was.  Over the years we had our share of breakups and makeups.  We even tried to move in to an apartment together after we'd been together for probably almost 5 years.  I didn't last there long.  Blackout drunk fights putting holes in two doors and a wall, and she was some how still willing to be with me.  Basically for the next 4 years or so it was her apartment and I just stayed over.  
          Then just about one year ago she said she wanted to move out and into a house.  So I agreed wed buy a house together.  We found the perfect little house in a nice neighborhood and couldn't have been happier.  Me being who I am the first night we were there I was black out drunk chasing her from one end to the other.  I never did hit her but I would put my hands on her and grab her by the arms which left bruises.  So for that summer we pretty much lived like that, btw I was only working part-time this entire time.  
         Then on labor day weekend I blew up about one of her pets making a mess and got black out drunk again and put my hands on her, choked her and threatened her with a bow.  She left the next day to stay with her parents.  When hearing the next day what had happened I actually put the bottle down and completely quit.
          A few days later after apologizing to her parents and everyone involved I agreed to outpatient rehab.  It was a 6 week program that they let me finish maybe a week early because I had gotten a full-time job with the state.  The program was ok I guess, I thought maybe it would keep me from drinking just because I didn't want to go to this shit ever again.   Either way I remained sober for 7 months.  It was the happiest time of our lives.  I forgot to mention we got engaged right around the same time we bought the house.  So she was busy planning her dream wedding and we celebrated the holidays in our beautiful new home.  We planned on how many kids were going to have and just enjoyed ourselves.
          Then in March this corona crap came and I was promised 2 weeks off paid leave.  And right before it was about to start they said no and I was to report to work.  This sounds like nothing now but it did piss me off quite a bit.  That same night she invited a mutual friend over after I said no.  He brought alcohol of course.  It didn't bother me until I went to sleep midnight having been up since 5 am.  They stayed up drinking while I lay in bed angry.  When I woke up there was a half empty bottle of liquor on the counter without even a cap.  I downed it and didn't stop drinking for almost the next 3 months.  
           She knew at first but I'd like and promise to stop over and over.  I'd hide it until I drank too much and she'd know.  Then Id hide it and lie some more.  
         One weekend the same mutual friend came up and she decided they'd stay at her parents who were outta town because they didn't want to have alcohol in front of me.  So I got angry and downed a fifth of wiskey and begged them to come over and party with me.  When they did I pointed a gun at them and she moved out the next day.  Again I promised Id quit but at this point the wedding was cancelled, she wasn't living with me and I felt hopeless.  So I kept drinking.  
        Then last weekend came and she was suicidal and I decided to go fishing and drink instead.  Eventually after she did come over and we were both drunk, I blacked out and choked her.  She went home and that was it.  She cancelled the wedding officially and told me to make plans for what we'd do with the house.  Since that last drunken night she's made it clear that she will never trust me again and that I just need to move on.  
         I quit drinking last Monday and now all I can do is think about how I've ruined a 10 year relationship, wasted 10 of the best years of her life, the fact that I may have taken away her chance to raise a family which is all she's ever wanted.  I wanted these things with her too and now it's all gone.  I seriously just want to die.  We had all these good memories too and dreams for the future.  I don't feel I'll ever be able to forgive myself for this or ever be able to move on from her.

At the time I only planned to stop drinking for a month just to see how it would go, and immediately I noticed improvements in my sleep, focus, self-esteem, and anxiety. (Not to mention I had a lot more extra money now.) Anxiety is still a daily struggle for me, but it lacks a certain edge that was there when I was still drinking.

After a month of improvements, I figured there was no reason not to continue on that path. 

I have no cravings for alcohol nowadays; most days I forget about alcohol completely. Sometimes I'll have dreams where I accidentally drink a beer or something and then feel bad that I broke my sober streak. Those have been getting more infrequent.

My family and friends have been supportive of me, even the ones who drink pretty heavily themselves. The other day my mom told me I was an inspiration for her to stop drinking wine at dinner every night; she said if I can just quit alcohol for a full year, she can at least cut back too.

I consider this one of my biggest accomplishments in a year when I've been working full time and going to graduate school full time. At this point I have no plans to return to drinking. I don't want to let my guard down because I know plenty of people have quit for a year or more but then gone back to it. I've still been smoking weed, and to be honest I think that has helped me stay away from alcohol, knowing that I still have ""something I can do."" But smoking weed and listening to music on my own doesn't give me terrible hangovers, cause me to embarrass myself in front of others, or leave me feeling suicidal for days afterwards.

Some time ago I began dating a man who completely changed my world. He doesn’t drink and doesn’t use and has been such a positive influence on me. When we began dating it was so easy to not drink and to just be with him. Slowly over time the drinking has managed to creep its was back into my life. It started out with getting drunk about once a month, then once a week, until finally I’ve come to the point that I’m blacking out twice a week again. Last night I was so drunk that I started arguing with him for no reason. I told him that he doesn’t really know me and that relationships are fake so why are we even together. I don’t know why I said that to him. I love him so much and I want him to be in my life. When I woke up this morning he was so upset with me that he won’t even speak to me. I told him that I want to stop drinking completely and that I’ve sent an email to schedule an appointment with an addiction counselor, but I’m afraid the damage has been done. Does anyone have advice on how I can start to make this better? I hate feeling like I’m letting him down and sabotaging one of the best relationships I’ve ever had.

Quarantine made everything worse- literally getting hammered every single night, not interacting with my kids, avoiding my wife.

I’ve learned some things over the last year, mainly that a person can have a lot more money for things other than booze and financially speaking, I wished I’d stopped a long time ago. 

Health-wise, overall I feel about the same minus the hangovers. I worked out and ran before quitting so I was in halfway decent shape and still pretty much am. Sleep is much better, but occasionally going on 3-4 hours (I have a puppy now) isn’t nearly as painful as it was. Also I haven’t been sick this past year. 

One thing that has not changed is that I still think about it everyday. This doesn’t mean I’m craving a drink every day. It just means that the thought of alcohol has never left my mind. A lot of the time this feels like a burden, or a dark cloud that will hang over my life and something that I will never not have. I’m sure some of that has to do with checking in on the app everyday, and my slightly obsessive nature. But I think it also has to do with the issue of telling myself that there’s no way I’m going to never drink again in my life; I do always follow that up with “but just not today.” But trying to actually think about living a life without drinking any alcohol at all ever again is not only incomprehensible but also just a ridiculous notion to me. Alcohol caused some unpleasant experiences in my life but it also gave me a lot of pleasurable times. 

Honestly I’ve been looking forward to getting this year complete so I could tell myself it is ok to have a drink or nine if I want to now. I set a goal, achieved it, and now I don’t have to adhere to it if I don’t feel like it. There’s a pressure that’s been lifted and it feels pretty great to me, although I have a sense of sadness about it as well. 

I don’t know what to expect or what I’ll do in regards to drinking. Some people seem to have it all figured out and good for them. Others talk about being sober for years and suddenly one day just fall off hard. I don’t think anyone here really has anything figured out and to imply that they’ve got it licked is just proof they’ve fooled themselves pretty well. 

Wow, talk about a downer of a post, especially for hitting a significant milestone. I will say this sub has helped me keep on the straight and narrow when the thoughts got heavy over this past year.

according to my sober app i’ll reach 9 days in 5 hours but i’ve felt this whole time like it’s all a bit pointless. I’ve been having an even harder time sleeping than i usually do, i haven’t got any more energy than i did before, if anything i’ve been more tired than usual and i’ve had constant headaches for these full 9 days. on top of that i have this physical feeling in my chest maybe my sternum (?) it’s hard to describe but that’s always where i feel ‘empty’ i guess like it’s a tell tale sign for me that i’m craving something no matter what it is, i’m not sure why it shows itself in that way but that’s just me. I’ve been craving sugar a lot recently so i’ve been giving into that a bit to try to make the cravings go away (probably isn’t helping the headaches) but the more i’ve been trying that the more i know inside that it’s alcohol i’m craving, it’s a never ending feeling that i’ve tried ignoring but as the weather is getting hotter and i’m seeing everybody i know talking about and being out in the sun getting pissed the more i want it. I suppose i had higher hopes for how i would feel by this point and seeing others comments on the app i’m on, how happy they are, how much better they feel inside, the more i feel ‘what is even the point in this’ because whatever the positive side effects are, i don’t seem to be getting them. I also don’t want to always come across so pessimistic so i apologise for how many of my posts come across like ‘oh pity me everything is so hard’ but honestly that is how i feel and i’m not sure how to stop it.

I caved and have a small can of beer. I didn’t enjoy it, and felt sober by the time I went to bed, but my first badge reset has given me a chance to reflect on my 12-13 days, probably the longest time I’ve been sober since I was 17-18.

This is probably going to be a rambling, self-absorbed post so apologies - just want to get these thoughts out.

I started binge drinking when I turned 18, and carried on over pretty much the next 10 years. If I’m honest, I’d drink most nights, and binge at least one night a week, probably close to daily in my late teens/early 20s. I’d drink to get to sleep, to socialise, to have confidence, to lose myself. Over the last year or so, the overwhelming urge to drink has faded and I’ve enjoyed it less - it takes more work to get to a buzz, but I’d mostly carried on trying anyway.

So the first feelings that have come up over the last 2 weeks have been guilt and a little bit of shame. How dare I come here and post when I’ve somehow managed to wriggle through the worst of the addiction to a point where the physical urge is easier to fight? (I know that it doesn’t matter, that wanting to stop is what matters - but I feel like I’m cheating somehow). But I’m also aware that when things get tough, that desire to drink myself into oblivion will probably resurface. I don’t want to be there again. 

Something else very unexpected was feeling strong waves of anxiety and dread, for the first time in a couple of years. I’m not drinking damnit! That’s meant to get better! There was some very real fear that the anxiety is who I am, and the drinking was masking it. But I guess I’ve realised that the work on myself doesn’t stop just because the drinking has. Similarly, I haven’t found myself filled with energy in the mornings, or sleeping considerably better (though no more 3am sweats or hangovers is very nice). Maybe I’m just not a morning person after all! So I’m working on accepting that for me, this isn’t just about not drinking, but working on everything else too (exercise, diet, meditation, maybe more therapy). 

Someone posted a few weeks ago a timeline of the impact on your body of quitting alcohol. I want to make it further down that timeline. My memory over the last few years has worsened, and I struggle to focus when reading. I worry it’s linked to drinking.

So here’s to day 1 again. Thanks for having me along - it means a lot. IWNDWYT.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49933788}"

There is something about this birthday that makes me reflect more than usual. I have been drinking almost daily for 20 years at this point. Half my life. I can’t think of anything else I have  ever done so consistently. First it was beers in college at a big football school that celebrated each Saturday morning how much its students could drink at the tailgate before the game started, then a six pack of craft IPAs once I could afford them and all of their 300 calories. Next wine, red or white, then the liquor — mostly gin but sometimes tequila — and finally more beer. A big circle. 

I can’t remember the last time waking up without a hangover. I had become good at hiding it - chugging water when I rolled out of bed, Visine drops, under eye cream, 1000mg of tylenol and a lot of coffee. I would drink so much caffeine each morning that by the time I arrived at work, I was wired, full of energy, no one would have suspected I drank myself to sleep last night, like most nights, and my husband had to wake me up from the couch to tell me it was time to come to bed. No one suspected anything, even with my irritability and constant tardiness. I could still perform. I could still perform, but somewhere in some bottle, I had lost the joy of work, and the joy of my relationship with my husband and family and co-workers. I was just going through the motions until the end of the day when the first thing I would do when I got home was to open the fridge and crack open a cold beer. It would go down in seconds. My husband and I would joke, the first one was really just to quench my thirst. I would open a second and a third. Then it was about time to put my 5-month old son down to bed. I would warm up a bottle for him and bring along a beer for me. We drank together, reading nighttime stories, my son and me. 

As I blew out my candles this year, I wished to myself that this is the year I stop drinking for good. I had quit for one year previously, I can do it again. But this time for good, one day at a time. I will enter into my 40s next year, better. Sober. More in control of my own life. More present for myself and those who I love.

Back then it was a big part of my work culture and its just basically carried on. I'm ashamed to say in the 20 years I've known my wife her drinking has increased quite a bit too due to my influence.

&#x200B;

I've heard the term ""functional alcoholic"" and that may describe me well. I have a good job and have had a great career. Usually my drinking is confined to 3-4 beers or a bottle of wine before and with dinner and I stop and have water as soon as I've eaten, however this can sometimes be every night and is rarely less than 4 nights a week.  


I get seriously drunk only about once every 3 months and yesterday was one of those days. We went for dinner with a couple of friends then back to our place and during the evening a lot of wine was drunk. When they left I took the dog out for his end-of-evening pee, I was only out for about 3 mins.  


When I got back in the house my wife was lying face down in a pool of blood, she had tripped and fallen down the stairs, onto a tiled floor, she was taken by ambulance to hospital and has just been released from the ER having had 15 stitches in a head wound. She's had CT scans which don't show any serious damage but we need to be vigilant for brain bleeds for the next couple of days.   


Just typing the above and reliving it makes me very anxious.  


Anxiety, I know I've been self medicating for it all along and I know alcohol actually makes it worse. When I stop drinking for a few days I feel very nervous the first night and a bit better the following one.  


I know I should stop drinking as its doing me no good and last nights situation scarred me badly.  


The thing is, I'm also afraid to stop, alcohol has been part of my life for as long as I can remember, my longest period of abstinence was 25 days a couple of years ago.  


Basically it feels like having a few drinks is one of the very few things I now enjoy, it's also the basis for most of my interactions with my friends. I honestly don't know what I'd replace it with.  


I may read Allen Carr's drinking book, his smoking one worked like a miracle for me 17 years ago.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Last day of hosting the DCI for me. Thank you all for making me feel welcome and helping me really enjoy my first time doing this!

I was nervous for a couple of weeks leading up to last Sunday. I was really unsure if I should volunteer, or could even do it. Was I “good” enough? Am I qualified? What if I mess it up? Turns out, I am and I didn't. I mean, not too bad. It felt like school... do I prepare my notes, or wing it? Just like the old days, I began to prepare, saw something shiny, completely forgot about my assignment, then I improvise. But, it worked.

I guess I proved to myself that I am not the fuck up I used to be. That I had been when I was drinking. That's something I needed to find out after quitting. That I could be counted on, that my nerves and anxiety wouldn't get the best of me. They didn't.

What are you looking to prove to yourself, find out about yourself, show others about yourself... now that you've quit drinking?

If you are interested in hosting the check-in and have at least 30 days sober, let me or u/SaintHomer know! (I know a few of ya' that I might just nominate!) Don't forget to give my buddy u/doves-nest some love when he takes over the DCI on Sunday! If not love, definitely a hard time.

Day 1 for me was rough as I woke with with a hangover and all the bad that goes with it; the anxiety, shame, fear, guilt, etc. the only thing I could thing to make it go away would be to start drinking again. So I put some beers in the fridge and waited for them to get cold. I planned on drinking, but then I came to this sub and read so many amazing stories of struggle, triump, success, failure etc..
I knew I wasn’t alone and I knew it could be done. I just didn’t know if I could do it. 15 plus years of daily drinking. Heavy drinking for at least the last five. I’d just wait for the clock to strike “drinking time” and I’d drink until I was numb enough to not care and go to bed. Almost every morning was a hangover. Wash, rinse, repeat.
The first night’s sleep was tough but I got through it. A bit of melatonin and some extra sleepy time tea. I woke up a few times in the night pretty groggy and kind of out of it (melatonin seems to do that to me), but I got through it. And for the first time in a long long time, I woke up feeling....happy? Accomplished? Proud? All of the above. I wasn’t miserable, anxious, or ashamed. I knew I could tackle my day’s work without suffering the first few hours with a hangover.
And now, I’m about to put day 2 to bed. The beers were still in the fridge today. I sweat my ass off in there after work building a project. Did an ice cold beer sound good? Yes. But a tomorrow of waking up like I did today sounded so much better.
Don’t get me wrong. It wasn’t all sunshine. Still had anxiety and bouts of irritability throughout the day, but all in all, it was a success. Looking forward to day 3 and a dry weekend. IWNDWYT MY FRIENDS! And tomorrow is another day to try and get in the books.

I started to hear the wisdom people were sharing all around me.  Some seemed completely original, authentic, and from the heart.  Many were clichés I'd heard time and again which suddenly revealed their pearls of wisdom.  Some were about what it was like to drink like I did.  Some are stark reminders and cautionary tales of how I felt and sometimes feel.  And some are aspirational reminders of where my journey in recovery may take me if I keep at it.

My [most recent favorite](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gpiwlx/end_of_day_4_reflections/) came from /u/jamieface16

> This is your day to not drink. One day at a time.

These short statements are like pennies on the ground.  If I'm paying attention, I might spot one.  And if I take the time to pick it up and keep it, I become that much richer.

Early on, I realized that I wanted to keep a list of all the great things I heard in sobriety.  I bought a [""reporter's notepad"" and a fun pen](https://i.imgur.com/P2KRGVp.jpg) and I've used them for the last year and a half.  I've collected over 650 statements that have resonated with me.  I love each and everyone one I've written down.  I reread them on occasion and they continue to ring true and help reinvigorate my sobriety.

It took me well over an hour to whittle my list down to what you find below.  I'd have posted all 650+ but realize that even the 40ish below is pretty darn self-indulgent.  I just want to share them all _so much_!  I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.

Fast forward 2 hours later and my wife is exhausted and she wants some recoup time so i take my lil guy out to the swings and he plays ""Daddy I love you SOOOO much!"" Game, where we say that back and forth for 5 minutes. Way better high than anything alcohol could ever give me.

I had always been a heavy drinker, and I was starting to get worse. For months and months I was hard drunk every night, and had serious brain fog every day. I was starting to show the physiologic signs of alcohol abuse, and had early signs of withdrawal if I didn't drink daily. My heart was begging me to stop drinking. My work performance was starting to plummet.  I was on the edge of falling into a dark abyss. I was going to lose everything that is important: my son, my career, my marriage. Thankfully I saw the fall coming. 

Then I stopped drinking. 

It took a while. There where many false starts. There were many relapses. This sub is one of the reasons why I was able to move past. You all believed in me, accepted me, and cared about me (a total stranger) when I couldn't do that for myself.

The whiskey that had helped me get to sleep wore off and then I was up again. This has been going on every night for a couple months. 

There was a beat up looking younger guy with a thumb out walking about five miles in either direction from small towns. I was in a very sort of indifferent-to-living mood as I have been since I lost my job in February so I figured I'd pick the guy up. He was grateful and kind, just down on his luck. His wife had hit him in the face with her purse and left him at a gas station. 

He asked me if I smoked weed and I said no. He asked if I smoked cigs and I said I was out so I stopped at a gas station. We pulled up and, seeing him under direct light, it was apparent that he hasn't been sleeping in a bed or eating well. I told him to go get some food and water. I'm broke too but he was worse off. I gave him half the pack of smokes.

We got to the hotel and he asked if I'd stick around for a smoke. It was a bad place and there were a couple guys who had obviously just shot up walking like zombies toward the hotel door. I stuck around anyway because he just seemed really alone. A car pulled up and he said, ""oh hey, these are my people right here. Met em a couple days ago."" They were drunk out of their minds and on something else too, a downer but not as bad as heroine. The guy was 18. The girl was in her 40s and clearly had a history with meth.

The vibe changed and the hitchhiker started looking at his shoes while also telling me I was an angel and an ""empath"" as if to try and communicate that i helped more by asking him his story and trying to help him think through his circumstances than I did by buying him food. He looked ashamed that he couldn't be grateful in a more concrete way and he looked ashamed to be dependant on these two people.

The story of these three people in a slum hotel fell open like a book in front of me. And it struck me -- this was my childhood. I felt like I'd been there before and it scared me that it felt unnaturally comfortable in such an objectively sketchy situation.

I'm 23 and I've always felt like the bottom rung of society. Last night I realized that's not me anymore. I've progressed and I have something to lose. Something more important than a $13 handle of whiskey. 

The hitchhiker flicked his cigarette, rubbed his face with both hands, and muttered to himself, ""Fuck, I need a drink."" I opened my trunk and handed him an unopened handle of whiskey and the insulated water bottle I've been using to keep my drinking a secret from my wife. I knew if I didn't get rid of my means of drinking, then drinking again would be too easy. I said, ""if you don't want the bottle, toss it. I just don't need it anymore."" 

I've had a lot of wake up calls and rock bottom moments but they never stick. I felt like I lived on rock bottom, I was born on rock bottom. Last night I realized that's not where I am anymore. I've climbed out, I just didn't realize it. It's not a question of ""learning my lesson,"" it's a question of learning my value.

Ive got a few weeks under my belt and i am both astounded and scared shitless at all the murky trash i keep finding coming up to the surface these days. Oooof! Heaven help us all.

I am not sure what is different, but I have some guesses. I began to try sobering up this past September by going to IOP and support groups (both AA and SMART). I could cobble together a week here and there. Then I went to in-patient, then back to IOP, off the wagon for a few months, and now I am back in IOP and on DAY 30!!!!

I think I am doing better this time because I put sobriety before anything. This is where COVID isolation helps because if I need to step away from work for a moment, I can do that. It is also so easy to get on Zoom AA meetings. I am also doing the Vivitrol shot and I do think it is helping with cravings. 

I hope that this is a sign that I will never have another drink again. But even if I do relapse, I will never, ever stop trying to live a sober life. 

For those of you struggling through acute withdrawal, take good care. It takes about two weeks for the acute symptoms to subside. I frankly treat it as if I have the flu. Lots of movies, easy foods to eat, lots of naps.

The other big thing that keeps me from drinking is not wanting to go through the quitting part again. Those were some really rough days and weeks and months! My mood swings, cravings, awful sleep and high anxiety were enough (hopefully) to deter me from doing that again.

3. Sugar cravings and calorie intake surprise (hungry,sweet tooth)
4. TIME IN THE DAY (one of my favorite things, so much time in the day)

8. Leaving someone toxic behind was possible, it's not me, it's you. 
9. IT'S NOT ME. It's You. (left abusive relationship)

Day 11. IWNDWYT 

*Delete if not okay*

The last 11 days have been absolutely crazy. I have written this after the fact in diary form. Everything in this post is 100% true. 

5/18: I dropped my furbabies off to a fellow Redditor that answered a post in my area of needing someone to watch my animals so I can detox from alcohol. I have been a daily drinker for the last 15 years. Every day. 

I went to my insurance covered hospital (in a different city 40 miles away) and requested to be admitted for detox because I was afraid if I did it on my own, I would be putting myself at serious risk considering the amount I was drinking (1.75 litres in 2 days. I'm 5'3"" at a buck 20 for reference). 

My mid back was hurting so I thought I'd completely fucked my liver. I also had pain in my front rib cage and stomach area. I could not not drink each morning because if I tried not to, I would start withdrawing in the first 10-30 minutes of waking up. Shaking, vomiting, pounding headaches, etc. I told the doctor this. The doctor denied my request to be admitted. ""We don't do that here. You can go to outpatient CDRP"". I have already been there, done that in 2018. It didn't work.

5/19: I went to the local hospital that is not my insurance covered hospital. They wanted to admit me in ICU for detox. They were about to bring me upstairs when my insurance denied me receiving treatment there. They sent me to a different insurance covered hospital in a different city than the one I went to the day before. I had my car towed there. The hospital is 30 miles away, I have nobody that could pick me up. Seemed logical at the time but now that I'm writing it out, I dunno. They sent me in an ambulance. I get to insurance hospital #2 (30 miles away) and they do some labs and keep me in the ER. 
5/20: I fall asleep around 4:30 am. At 6 am, the doctor comes in shakes my bed to wake me up and informs me that they are discharging me. I begged him not to. I begged them to admit me. My pain is getting worse, something is wrong. This isn't normal. My pleas fell on deaf ears. 

5/21: I go back to local non-insurance hospital in the evening and ask again to be admitted. They don't even bring me back. A nurse comes out to tell me no and basically said that they would recommend that if I want detox, I go to the psych hospital. Scared that they would try to 51/50 me, I bolt from the waiting room. 

5/22-5/23: DTs are setting in. My pain keeps getting worse. Detox sucks. I can't stop shaking. I can't keep anything down. Vomiting and full on toilet usage (sorry for the TMI). I start to have auditory hallucinations in the form of hearing music. Not music I've ever heard before. Music that doesn't exist. Then the voices start. But the voices aren't talking to me, it's like walking through a store or mall and as you walk you overhear people having conversations. Can't really make the conversations out, just a few words here or there, a snippet of a sentence. 

5/24: (TMI: GROSS FACTOR HERE) 
A sober friend came over to visit and we watched Food Network for 4+ hours and then he leaves. Not long after, all the sudden, I'm sweating, my pain is at a 9.5, out of nowhere I vomit like I've never vomited before. I fill half my trash can. My vomit is black. I go to the bathroom. As I stand, I get so dizzy I drop to my knees. Everything is blurry. I'm hyperventilating. I feel like I'm going to pass out. I make it the half a dozen steps across the hall to my bedroom. I fall onto my bed and I am shaking like I've never have before. Something is wrong. Really wrong. 
I vomit again, filling my trash can. I try to stand and fall over. I call my best friend and beg him to come take me to the hospital. He lives 25 minutes away. He tells me to call 911, but he'll come right away. I refuse 911 because I cannot afford the ambulance bill. As I wait for him I haphazardly try to pack some semblance of an overnight bag. Every time I stand, I get dizzy, hyperventilate, and fall over. This happens every time I go to get something to put in my bag. The shaking won't stop. I realize that there's no way I'll be able to wait to go through the admitting process at the hospital and wait in the waiting room so I cave and call 911. 
My best friend arrives minutes before the ambulance and firetruck come. My landlord (a little old Guatemalan lady) freaking out as 2 paramedics and 3 firefighters come charging up the stairs. The way the stairs are they are unable to bring the stretcher up. They help me downstairs. My best friend double bags and ties off my bag of trash can vomit. They wouldn't admit me before, they have to now, right?
We go to the in town non insurance hospital. They refuse to treat me, no labs, no nothing. My insurance won't allow it. They call another ambulance to take me to insurance covered hospital #2 (30 miles away). 
At hospital #2, they do a chest x-ray and labs. All the sudden they whisk me upstairs and there's 3 (I think, I'm very confused at this point)nurses and 1 doctor. I climb into the bed and within what seems like seconds I need to use the toilet again. They ask if I'm ok to do it by myself. Of course, I can! 
No, I couldn't. I go to stand from the toilet and realize I'm about to pass out. I lunged towards the door and open it and a nurse catches me before I face plant. They get me into bed and I lose consciousness. 
I wake up in a panic. Something is down my throat. People are holding me down. I don't understand what is going on and try to fight them off. More hands holding me down; ""Calm down, thebrightorangedawn. We need you to stay still"". Then I hear someone say ""Wow, doctor. If I ever need this surgery I hope I get you as my doctor"". I lose consciousness again.

5/25: I wake up in a completely different room than I arrived in. It's 4 pm. I have 3 different IVs in me. Wires coming from my chest. I'm so confused. What TF happened? I ask for water and they said no. I cannot have anything to drink. Not even ice chips? No. You don't want to reopen it. Reopen what? I don't understand. I pass back out. I wake up again and it's dark. Late. I'm not as confused as to where I'm at, but why all these IVs? Why can't I have water? I'm just here for detox. I was not just there for detox.

5/26: 6:30 am. A gastroenterologist doctor that I've never met before (I had) comes in. Asks how I'm feeling. Tells me that I had a perforated ulcer that hemorrhaged. He went in and stopped the hemorrhaging. He said I was as white as the sheets on my bed and my blood pressure had plummeted but it looks much better now. He will order liquid diet and I can (finally!) have water and ice. He leaves. 
9 am another doctor comes in. He tells me they had to give me 5 blood transfusions. Says they didn't know if I was going to make it. I lost half the blood in my body. The look on his face said it all. I almost died. Doctor leaves and I call my best friend. He says that he called the hospital and at first they wouldn't tell him anything. Finally he got to a nurse that told him to notify my next of kin (I have none). It starts to sink in. I almost died. 

5/26-5/27: Stayed in ICU. Watched too much Food Network (no such thing). Liquid diet only. Very lonely and boring. No visitors due to C-19. 
Afternoon of 5/27 get moved out of ICU into regular room. 

5/28: FOOD! SOLID FOOD! It was the best/worst cheese only omelette I've ever had. Discharged in the evening. They arranged a taxi to take me home. 

5/29 - current thoughts:

The whole week I tried to get help while being in the first days of being sober, I had no cravings. No alcohol cravings, no sugar cravings, and I still don't as of today- I don't think I will ever again. I almost died. My whole outlook towards alcohol has changed.While my ulcer wasn't completely caused by my drinking, it definitely didn't help.

My first real temptation was last night.

The other uncomfortable part was my mother in law asking me why I wasn’t drinking and asking if I was pregnant. I just generally hate the pressure to have to explain my social choices.

It's almost impossible these days to have a nice dinner party without him getting unbearable at some point. Nothing insulting or violent, but argumentative, provocative, overall detestable. The party is usually over when he reaches this point, which also seems to get gradually earlier in the night.

He doesn't drink when he's alone, I think. However, he has constant access to alcohol when he's at home, and constant encouragement to drink (freely and unlimitedly) at dinner parties, work events etc. Drinking/partying is very much part of his 'creative/artist' persona; so many people around him expect him/encourage him to do so. Some of his friends even enjoy the 'fiery' debates late at night. I feel like that hides under the blanket a lot of issues. As his son, I see more clearly all the damage his drinking causes: tens if not hundreds of dinners/parties with a bitter end, multiple car accidents (luckily nothing serious, just lots of $ for car repairs), many arguments with my Mom, and 3 years ago he fell at the end of his birthday party and suffered a very serious head injury (he says he fainted for a different reason but in all likelihood it was very drinking-related).

It deeply saddens me to see him like this and I am worried for his future years. Just statistically, how long is there before he has a more serious car crash, an (even more) serious injury or he causes permanent damage to a relationship? I don't see how the problem will ever become better with older age if he doesn't address it now (he's 62).

I knew the day would come, I wasn't trying to avoid it. Lately I've been dabbling - glass of wine, bourbon.. it's all tasted horrible and just made me feel ill. But yesterday, in the sun, I started drinking, didn't even try to stop, and was right back to my old ways. I had a fun time (I thought), but I absolutely wish I hadn't drank.

Social distancing went out the window, drunken hugs and inapropriateness, stayed over with family. Feel like a fool.

Today, I'm hungover, feel sick, have a headache, and I'm VERY anxious. My heart's beating like crazy, I'm embarrassed by what I did, and what I said (and might have said). Can't calm myself down. Showed myself up with the neighbors - loud music and unfiltered talking. I smoked cigarettes. Ate things I shouldn't. I peed outdoors (one of the things I remember). Only got three hours 'sleep'. Checking all apps now to see what I have shared/messages I've sent. I need to drive home at some point today but will have to wait until I'm through the withdrawal, and even then will be worrying that I'm not fit to drive.

I am treating this as an experiment (as I kept saying yesterday whilst getting more and more out of it). Have GOT to remember this awful feeling, and realise it's always going to happen.

I'm not feeling upset because I broke my sobriety streak necessarily, but because other people will be disappointed in me - those who were pleased for me and my sobriety. Makes me want to cry. There's the anxiety again.

Hopefully, this lapse has taken the mystery and romance out of the idea of drinking.

Alcohol is gross, and never worth this. Try not to replicate the experiment yourself :(

2020-05-29 03:26:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gso8j9/failure_is_not_a_reason_to_drink/,Failure is not a reason to drink,"I knew as soon as the final had finished that I hadn't done well, but I figured I'd just about squeak by, as I've done countless times before. So when I woke up early this morning, rolled over to check the results on my phone, I was expecting to find a passing grade, and then I could roll back over and fall asleep again. Instead, I saw that I had failed.

I expected my first thought to be something along the lines of, ""I need a beer."" Failure is supposed to make you want to drink. It's supposed to make you want to self-destruct and not care about anything. Or at least I thought that when I was still drinking. But now, instead of wanting a beer, I found that I was afraid that I might want a beer. The thought wasn't ""I need a beer"" at all. It was, ""Oh no, now I might end up wanting a beer and that'll ruin everything.""

Because failing a final doesn't mean that the progress I've made in the past 8 months of not drinking isn't significant. I might not be perfect, but to get to where I am now from where I started took some doing. As sober alcoholics, a lot of us have to play catch-up for the time we spent being in dingy, dirty, and dark places. In my case, I'm trying to undo 12 years of bad habits and that takes time. One drink would undoubtedly ruin all of that work I've already put in.

Failure can appear to be a valid reason to drink, a license to throw everything to the wind. But there are no valid reasons to drink. When I was drinking, everything looked like legitimate cause for getting sloshed, but there is no real positive instrumental value to alcohol. It is always a net negative. So there will never be a valid reason to drink.

I'm sure I'm not the only sober person who will fail at something this spring and summer. Whether it's a final, with its binary pass or fail, or something more nebulous and insidious. But I hope we can all remind each other that failure is not a reason to drink.

I have begun to notice my mind racing with thoughts of how I am going to operate in this world socially without alcohol. My friends want to go out to the bar or club after work. I take a girl on a date and she wants to order a glass of wine or cocktail and get to know me (alcohol was always my social lubricant when talking to women). I go to a business lunch/dinner and everyone is drinking; will they think I’m weird because I don’t partake? I’m 30 and drank all throughout my twenties without taking more than a 1 month hiatus. Almost everything I did revolved around alcohol. “Hey man! Wanna go fishing? Grab a 12 pack and meet me at the lake house” “Yo I just bought the newest Xbox, come check it out on the big screen and grab a bottle on your way” I get it...I need to change my playground, which is what I am slowly doing. I’m doing my best to phase out the toxic people in my life, however I have several friends who can have just 2-3 beers and be completely content. I don’t get it.

On May 10th I finally hit my bottom and had a psychic change starting that day and I started my sobriety the next day, May 11th. I now realize that when even a drop of alcohol enters my system a million more drinks is never enough, and it affects me by turning me into an uncontrollable monster who hurts the people I love. I got drunk a few days before I got sober and tried to kick my husband's uncle, who has been living with us for 9 months, out of the house with no place to go. Well, that backfired. I ended up being the one with no place to go. I was kicked out of my own home (temporarily) and terrifyingly but by the grace of God I drove two hours in a blackout to where my family lives. I didn't get hurt and I didn't hurt anyone, thankfully. My sister shut her door in my face, my Dad shut his door in my face, and my best friend shut her door in my face (but not without plying me with more alcohol before sending me on my way with no place to go).

That is when the psychic change happened. That was when I realized that sobriety for me can't just be for a short time and then again after a ""relapse,"" but it must be forever or I will lose everything and die. I am an awful and horrible person who does and says things that I normally wouldn't when I imbibe in alcohol. My husband took me back after deciding whether or not to leave me, and things are really awkward in the house with his uncle. My husband and I have a strong and deep love which I am grateful for with all my being, but I'm afraid he wrestles with similar demons that I do and he can't help himself from bringing alcohol into the house. I know I never want to drink again, I have a sponsor, I'm going to Zoom meetings, and I've begun working the 12 steps harder than I ever have before. I had a toe dipped in the AA pool before and now I have fully dived in. With all that, I still don't trust alcohol being in my house right now because at the very least it makes me uncomfortable and triggers me. Despite all the drama right now, I've felt much better in the past 18 days than I have in years.

I don't want to be a drinker anymore. I can't stop being an alcoholic, but I can work my program and meet God halfway (if I ever find my own conception of God and stop feeling icky using that term). The things that are helping me so far are: 1) Sparkling water (Topo Chico is the best!). 2) Not talking to anyone in active addiction or anyone who is a toxic person in my life. 3) Talking to three sober women a day and my sponsor. 4) Going to a (Zoom) meeting every day. 5) Meeting with my sponsor once a week. 6) Attempting to remember who I was and how happy I was before my drinking started 13 years ago. 7) Attempting to figure out who I am now that I'm not drinking and how to be happy one day at a time.

Any words of encouragement, love, advice, or just a hello is much appreciated.

I will probably end up drinking it tonight or tomorrow, but I'm going to drink slowly since I only have 4. I'm cutting myself off for the day after I finish them. 


Here's the plan: 
- Cut down to 4 beers a day. 
- once I'm used to that, skip a day between 4 packs. 
- cut down to 3 and give the 4th to my roommate, while continuing to skip a day in between. 
- cut down to 2, continuing to skip a day. 


...and that's my goal! 


Cold turkey has never worked for me and I always relapse HARD on day 3, so I'm trying this new approach with gradually replacing the beers with sparkling water, and having a glass of water between  beers. 


I want alcohol to be optional so I can learn to cope with reality in other ways, and be healthier. 


Wish me luck! 


Any advice to make this plan more effective?",6,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.54901534}"

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

So, here in Minnesota we get nice weather, *extremely sporadically.* I'm not going to complain because it's nice right now (*looks out window),* and that's what counts. I know summer is going to be weird with continued quarantine and cancellations of events (**four fucking concerts and counting**), but we can still make the best of it. Golf courses are already open here, although I still need to get out sober my first time ever. I'll have that, kayaking, stand up paddleboarding, hiking and biking different county and state parks, as well as plenty of homebody time in our backyard, grilling, having a bonfire, playing beanbags and other yard games. Generally relaxing.

Any of these can be my Sober Summer Safe Space. Somewhere I can go, or something I can do where I can simply shut my brain off and *just be.*

Feeling grateful for sobriety, which I’ve remembered as recently as this past week takes perpetual efforts at renewal. 

I’d started to accept non-alcoholic beers when offered. At first I refused any that had any alcohol whatsoever. But over the past few months, I drank some even if they contained a small trace of alcohol (legally, up to .5%).  I told myself it felt good to just enjoy the taste. I told myself I could even vaguely will myself into the care-free feeling of a buzz, even if just via some sort of placebo effect.

But for me personally, I believe I was kidding myself. These were just very minor steps in the direction of addiction. Starting to mimic the old behavior. The creep is so subtle... barely even noticeable. Until the soul starts to feel dulled, polluted... the beautiful openness and freedom and fresh air of sobriety replaced by covering up, isolation, prickliness at loved ones because the well is poisoned. 

But the clear well of sobriety is always right there just waiting for you to cleanse and drink deeply from. And I did that today. Told myself and my partner that I no longer want to accept non-alcoholic beers when offered. I spoke with a mentor and don’t intend to reset my counter — “black and white thinking” and “perfectionism” can haunt us and be counterproductive in addiction and in recovery.

I've been alcohol free for 10 months. It's been a simultaneously difficult and joyous 10 months and I've gotten through it with the help of AA meetings. I've learned a lot and have cherished the relationships I've developed, but there have always been a few things in the program I just couldn't get behind. 

One of the major ""suggestions"" of AA is to avoid all mind-altering substances, but I've been smoking pot, so I've pretty much left that out of all AA conversations so it wouldn't get awkward. I felt like I was being dishonest and that withholding that detail was holding me back, so I bucked up, got a sponsor a couple days ago, and just told her the truth about my smoking tonight. She told me what I expected her to - that we could read the Big Book and I can go to meetings, but I shouldn't get more chips while I'm smoking. She was very sweet about it, but I'm really disappointed. 

I get the rationale and that it's a problem for some people, but I just don't agree in my situation that it's something that I need to stop doing. My life is so much better without alcohol and I don't have those bad experiences that made me quit drinking with weed.

Why can't I celebrate the time without alcohol that I've worked so hard for? Are there other communities out there that I can be open and honest with that will celebrate with me even if I'm a cannabis user? Does anyone else have experience with this topic??

Most days maybe a day or 2 a week tops that I dont drink. I no it could be way worse and I'm glad I never hit more than what i was. For the past couple months my depression and anxiety got terrible as I no alcohol lowers seratonin and can make depression/anxiety worse. And it even started giving me adhd I'm pretty sure I no it can cause that as well. So I said to myself about 5 days ago enough is enough. I don't want alcohol anymore there's so many negatives it has on me and its just not fun for me anymore. So for the past 3 days/72 hours I have only had 1 drink a day. The little 50ml shot bottle. I figured it would keep the withdraw down. I plan on doing that and keeping it at that rate for the next 3-4 days just to get my body used to that amount and when I stop completely it will be easier on me. I'm having cravings today and a little bit of anxiety. Along with slight dizziness and slight hot cold flashes. Sweating a little on the hands. But no terrible shaking or tremors or vomiting or anything of that nature. I should be okay more than likely right? Just give it another 48 and my worst of it will be gone?

I'm truly heart broken, confused, sickened, lost, and you name it. I've dropped 20 lbs due to the combo of little food and no booze. I'm concerned for her because she seems addicted to this guy that shes never met face to face.

While many of you may already know these things, I’m a list person and find it very helpful to see everything written out. I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice, and you should see a doctor if you do not feel it safe to stop drinking without medical attention. I’m also a strong believer that there is no such thing as being too prepared, and I found that proper preparation made things much easier. So, enjoy, and let me know what worked for you too! 


##Mental health


-**Get rid of any and all booze in your house.** Can’t do it yourself? Ask a partner, your roommate, or call a friend and ask them to come over and throw out your drinks. This includes empty bottles. Seriously, it’s harder to drink if you have to go out and get it and if you don’t have any reminders around you. 

-**Tell someone close to you what you want to do.** This could be a friend, partner, roommate, family member, etc. Telling someone else makes you accountable, and this person can hopefully provide some moral support along the way when you’re having trouble. 

-**Write down your big “why” and put it somewhere you’ll see it.** This is where you ask yourself “why do I want to be sober?” And then ask yourself “why” 2-3 more times. For example: “I want to be sober so that I can be free of my addiction to alcohol, because I want to like who I am as a person, because I want to have confidence in myself, because I want to be the best I can be for myself and for others.” 

-**Identify your triggers and create an action plan.** I cannot stress this enough. You will be tempted to drink, and it’s much easier to not do it when you have a plan in place. I liked to get lit while making dinner. My plan was to have lots of water and maybe even a fruity, non-alcoholic beverage close by while cooking. 

-**Have a mantra or saying to shut down negative thought patterns.** When your cravings hit, the worst thing to do is start a spiral of unhealthy thoughts. Mine was “I will not drink today for any reason at all, whatsoever.” My alcoholic brain couldn’t try and rationalize this and it helped shut things down. 

-**Set a goal every day and include steps for how you’ll get there.** I recommend setting a goal of not drinking that day. The obvious way to do that is to just not drink, but it’s not always that easy. Your steps could include driving home a different way so you don’t pass the liquor store, or planning how you’ll say “no” when you’re invited to go out for happy hour. 

-**End each day on a positive note and celebrate your success.** Posting in this sub is a great way to get some support and recognition. Even if you had a difficult day, if you didn’t drink, there’s something to celebrate. Tell yourself you did a nice job. Get a little smug about it to yourself. Be proud!!! You set a goal and you achieved it, which isn’t always easy. 


##Physical health 


-**Exercise every day.** You probably shouldn’t do a full blown cleanse and start intensive weight training during your first few weeks of sobriety. The goal is just to move more than you normally do. Maybe you take a walk during your lunch break, or do some pushups/sit-ups after waking up, or follow along to an online yoga video. 

-**Meal Prep**. This doesn’t have to be crazy. It could just be buying a few days worth of frozen dinners at a time. But I recommend preparing food when you feel good, because you may not feel very good in the coming weeks and could lack the motivation to eat. Your body is recovering from abuse of a poison. Help yourself out by eating and giving yourself the fuel you need to get through this. 

-**Have activities in place and things to do.** it’s a lot harder to focus on sobriety if you’re just sitting on the couch and praying the cravings stop (I’ve been there, NOT an exaggeration). When do you normally drink? After work? On weekends? What could you do instead? I would sign myself up for an exercise class online and pay ahead of time so I felt obligated to go. I filled my weekends with projects like getting rid of old clothes, painting my dresser, or taking my dog to do some off-leash training. At night, I would cook a complex dinner that required a lot of attention, or do some knitting to keep my hands busy. 


##Sleep


-**Prepare for the fact that you will probably not be sleeping well.** Setting this expectation made me feel a lot less shitty and isolated. This is very common and it’s ok. Can you take a few days off of work? Can a friend or family member watch the kids for a few days? It may be dangerous to do your job well if you’re sleep deprived.

-**Start preparing for good sleep during the day.** Have a caffeine cut-off time. For me, this is 3:00pm. Caffeine can stay in your system around 6 hours after drinking it and affect how tired you feel. Exercise earlier in the day rather than later. Eat enough food. Try to not have as much white sugar a few hours before bedtime. 

-**Get out of your room and do something else  if you can’t sleep.** This is SO important. When I was on the verge of panic attacks and sweats laying in bed, I would go and walk around my block a few times. Once I calmed down, I would do some other things that I’ve listed below. 

-**Have some non-electronic activities that you can do in another room.** You don’t want to wake yourself up by using blue light. Some examples include: knitting, coloring, jigsaw puzzle, drawing, reading a book, light stretching, low intensity cleaning or organization. I liked to read some of my old college textbooks because they’re particularly dry and would usually make me pretty sleepy. 

-**Keep a journal nearby to write down stressful thoughts.** My mind can sometimes race at night with things I have to get done the next day or general things I’m worried about. When these thoughts arise, I acknowledge them by writing them down in a journal and telling myself they will be taken care of tomorrow. This way, I’m not trying to just push everything out, but rather I’m putting that stress somewhere else where it can be handled at an appropriate time. 

-**Try something relaxing while in another room.** take a hot shower or bath, make a cup of herbal tea (sleepy time, peppermint or chamomile are my favorites). Try making an eye pillow out of an old sock filled with uncooked rice, and microwave it about 30 seconds. Invest in a lavender oil or spray to put in a diffuser, or apply a bit to your pillow.

-**Try a sleep supplement.** I’m always partial to natural sleep supplements because things like cold medicine make me feel more stressed. Melatonin is great, but check the dosage and start small if you haven’t used it. The highest recommended to start is 5mg taken an hour before bedtime. I used to take some that had 10mg and it gave me horrible nightmares. I also use marijuana when I have trouble sleeping (it’s legal in my state). Many people here advise against marijuana use or can find it triggering. I have found it to be extremely helpful and only recommend it to those who are comfortable using it. A few hours before bedtime, I’d have a cup of tea which contained CBD and a low dose of THC). I would also smoke a joint with weed that had a low THC content and some CBD right before bed to feel the effects sooner. CBD only supplements also have worked well for me. Remember that edible marijuana may take awhile to take effect, so plan accordingly. 


That’s all I’ve got for now! Let me know what you think and if you have any other tips I can add to this list.

My story: It just crept up on me; I never thought it'd become a problem,"I started drinking at 17, growing up in a culture where drinking is normal and often encouraged.

As for many, it started as a social activity; college friends going out together on pub crawls.  ""Getting bladdered"" was the operative term.  Not something we did often (we didn't have the money for it); just a few nights a year for special occasions, but I'd almost always end up puking up when we did.  This became something of a running joke among my friends, all of whom were more experienced drinkers than I was.  And although I generally enjoyed these nights, I merely tolerated the unpleasant taste of beer; drinking certainly wasn't something I missed when I wasn't doing it.

Today I am in my mid-30's.  I have a mortgage, a university education, and a decent job.  I live alone, far away from my friends and family, but I have plenty of hobbies and still regularly socialize via weekly video chat and/or online gaming.  Somewhat unusual circumstances, but I'm quite happy with my life.

I can't exactly pinpoint when my drinking became a problem; it somehow just crept up on me.

I recall a period of six weeks in my early-20's during which I didn't drink at all.  Not because I wanted to quit, but simply that I lacked any desire to drink.  I had a full case of beer in my fridge during that entire time, yet no desire to touch it.  How I wish it was that easy now.

But alas, I did drink again.  At first, I was perfectly content to drink a beer or two on the weekend just to relax in the evening while enjoying a documentary.  Not a problem, but over the years, a weekend beer or two gradually grew into four beers a night to relax after work.

I suppose I've been fooling myself for years.  I didn't drink to the extent of throwing up like I did in my younger days; just to the point where I felt happy, relaxed, and able to sleep.  I've never become violent or angry from drinking.  I think this is how I managed to convince myself that my drinking is OK.

But before I knew it, I became unable to go more than a few days without a beer.  Over the past few years, I've tried different methods to limit my consumption; tracking how much I drink, setting goals, not buying beer so there's none available, but none of these methods have worked in the long term, and my drinking gradually became worse.

And then this year, the lockdown began.  Prior to the lockdown, I could always manage at least a day or two each week without drinking, but I drank literally every day for over two months since the lockdown began.  With little supervision of my work, no need to commute, and some of my favourite activities no longer possible, I started to justify my drinking by telling myself that it was OK because it helped me to cope with the current times.  I still restricted myself to four beers when I was alone, but that limit was easily overridden whenever I'd socialise online.

So lately I'd been meaning to take at least one day off from drinking; to revert back to my pre-lockdown routine, yet I failed each time I tried.  It became the same cycle every day; drink a few beers and go to bed thinking ""I'll skip the beer tomorrow"".  And I'd wake up knowing that I wouldn't drink that day and believing it throughout most of the day.  But then evening would roll around after dinner, and nothing was more tempting than a nice cold pint, and then that other voice would pop up with ""OK, just a couple beers today, no different than any of the previous days, it'll help you sleep; how bad could that be?"".

But finally, on Monday I had my first success.

I wrote up a new set of guidelines and a weekly routine of activities on Sunday, including daily exercise and more healthy eating, and since then I've been following it.  I didn't exactly do this with the intention to stop drinking entirely (the actual guideline I wrote was ""no beer on weeknights""), but it's now Thursday, I've been reading this subreddit, I haven't touched a beer, and now I've decided to revise the guideline to make it unconditional.

The worst things so far have been headaches, tiredness, and insomnia.  I knew sleep would be a challenge; lockdown has been making it more difficult to get sufficient exercise, and I'm a pretty light sleeper as it is.  I've been trying to manage my sleep with melatonin, but I've ended up staying in bed for 10 hours a night, continuously waking up and falling back to sleep.  During the day, my head feels heavy and tired.  But I guess (hope) this will improve over time.

My other concern is how my friends and family will react, some of whom drink more than I do.  For now, I'm happy to just let them assume I'm still drinking during online social activities, but there will eventually come a time where we'll meet again in real life, and I will need to decline a drink.  I'm not particularly concerned about drinking to fit in, but as of right now, no-one else is aware that I had a problem, so it's definitely going to raise questions when they realize that I've stopped drinking entirely.

Anyway, that's my story so far.  Today is only the 4th day, and I'll freely admit that my alcoholism is far from the most severe.  But still I hope I can manage this.  I still have a case of beer in my basement that I bought last weekend that I don't know what to do with, but honestly I feel more comfort in knowing that it's there and that it's my own will to not drink it, than forcing myself by not having any beer in the house at all.",6,{'lockdown': 5},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.60445726}"

I have a stressful job in management and alchohol helps me forgot about it at night. I don't crave a drink weirdly until I get home and then BOOM. It's not even a conscious effort, my body will physically take me out to get food then somehow I end up at the liquor store.

I am realizing that I am out of control, I think I need to go to AA or something and do something different than the last several times that I have tried to stop. I last for 30 days maximum and when I don't drink I feel so happy, not sure why I can't  maintain it. 

Had crappy sleep last few days and just so fed up with it, have to go to work and I know that I can't concentrate at the moment.

I am a master at drinking just enough to get the buzz but usually can still get a decent sleep so I can normally function. No one else knows and my partner thinks that it's all in my head and that I don't drink that much, but to me I know deep down that it is becoming a real issue.

I have big challenges in my relationship and my work life (who doesn't?), and I'm not saying they've been magically solved but I am making real, tangible progress. 

Feeling my feelings is the first step, which I have never really done before. Even as a child I found different forms of escape and avoidance before I had access to booze. Being clear-eyed and reflective is the second step. And the third is having the resolve and confidence to tackle difficult situations instead of retreating into my alcoholic shell and pretending they don't exist.

As a longtime lurker, this community has been such an amazing resource for me to pull out of my tool box and use when I needed some guidance, so here I am finally sharing my story. 

 I first began my sobriety journey when I turned 30(am now almost 32) I had a few hiccups here and there of spouts of soberness and spouts of binge drinking however, each time I started and stoped I was one step closer to this year I now have under my belt.  With each relapse or “field research” (as Paul Churchill from Recovery Elevator podcast likes to call it) took place I saw more snippets of what it was like to live alcohol free and I became more and more self aware during those moments. During my last drinking days, I became sick and tired of being sick and tired. Towards the end every day I drank which was every day of the week, I would wake up sick as a dog, vomiting, head ache, anxiety, the works. It was a familiar feeling, until it wasn’t. When sober journey finally began to take flight and I was no longer waking up with a hang over and crippling anxiety, I knew this feeling had to stick. 

My life is completely and utterly different. When I first began trying for sobriety I decided to go back to school and continue/finish my Criminal Justice Degree. I dropped out at 21 with failing grades. I never thought I’d see the day I go back to school but I did, and I killed it. The four semesters I had left, I got straight A’s and I graduated last week with my bachelors degree at 31 years young. You guys... ANYTHING is possible when you loose the booze. You will do things that you only ever dreamed of once that weight is lifted off your shoulders. My family respects me, my boyfriend respects my dog respects me, and I finally respect me. Yoga has also been my lifeblood and I practice it daily. It has helped ease my mind ease my body and help me become more mindful while also maintaining patience and gratitude each day. I never thought I would see the day I became a yogi who looks forward to meeting their mat everyday to met new goals and reach new heights. 

Sobriety; it’s so worth it. Life is so worth being 100% present for each moment. If you are in the beginning remember, It DOES get easier... you WILL see changes in yourself and in your relationships with others. I finally have found who I am supposed to be. I’m no longer just coasting through life, but I now have goals and challenges that I look forward to. I feel like I have met my true self. The Katie that I haven’t been acquainted with since my drinking journey started on its training wheels 12 years ago. One major tool/ resource that really hit the nail on the head for me was Annie Graces, This Naked Mind. That book changed my perspective on alcohol, changed my mindset about how I feel towards alcohol and helped me uncover who I am today. 

Today I found myself listening Mew’s album “No stories are told today I’m sorry they’ve washed away...” that I used to love(and still love)  when I was younger and haven’t listened to in years. As I played it in my car from the first track forward I began weeping like a little baby with tears of joy and sadness and gratefulness and happiness it was a rush of emotions and I felt all the feels.... it was one of the most raw moments I’ve had since I stopped drinking. I felt like I was the person who first discovered that album years ago before alcohol took over my life. I felt free. 

Listen folks... this road, its the one you all should be on. Everyone deserves this feeling of freedom and this feeling of joy that comes when you cut the alcohol out. 
Thank you everyone on here for your stories and your wonderful energy that this community upholds...

I guess I will start with a brief beginning if I can tell where it really started. My brother has struggled with alcohol for a long time. I remember when he was maybe 15 or 16 years old. My parents had been searching all night for him. When the cops pulled him out of a known drug/party house at 7 in the morning he was still so drunk that he wet himself in front of the officer. My brother was always running around. Or running away I guess. My parents spent many nights looking for him. Calling any friend or friends parents that they had a phone number for. Visiting any address they knew in attempts to find my brother. He always drank heavily but managed to avoid legal issues. I started developing my own issues with alcohol. It took years for me to realize it was an issue. I did start having legal issues because of drinking. My brother was there to help me when he could. He showed up when I got my second DUI just a few minutes after the cops. He was going to help me pull my car out of a ditch so I could try to avoid the police. He was drunk as well but the cops didnt catch on. He showed up one bad night when an officer came over to do a health and safety check on me. I had destroyed my apartment. He stayed the night with me. Fast forward a bit and I have been to rehab and I am seeing a therapist along with taking meds and going to groups. I'm in recovery and while I do still drink my meds help me say no more often or only have a couple drinks so I'm not wasted. My brother however he has started having some major issues. And got into other drugs. He almost died of liver failure a little while ago. He lost custody of his kids. He got into heavy drugs. He is now on parole. He had a few months of sobriety. I was so proud. And so happy. My brother was back. He had stopped hiding and lieing. He was having overnights with his kids. He had become his kind and compassionate self agian. Then he slipped. We talked about it. But he kept slipping. Now he is gone. No one knows where. His PO is calling my mom trying to get a hold of him. My brothers phone is off and has been for a week. I'm so sad and so scared. My brother is missing in every sense of the word. I'm worried he is overdosed and truly gone forever. I'm so scared and so worried. And I just wish drugs and alcohol didn't even exist. I'm so worried and sad and angry.,20,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45660457}"

Three years ago I lost both my career and my marriage in the same week and since then I've used booze to get through ""survival mode"".

I had to take six weeks of mental health leave recently, but I know it was the drinking that's exacerbated my anxiety, depression, and CPTSD (history of abuse, trauma at a young age and in last ten years). I know I haven't done the emotional or grief work necessary to heal because I keep drinking to avoid the pain one must go through to get to the other side.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello friends!

Music has always been a huge part of my life. In my last couple of years drinking, the haziest times of my life, I completely lost interest in listening to *anything*. I would rarely turn on the radio while driving, would go for a run without earbuds, my favorite bands and Spotify lists were of no interest to me. (Although, I would still go to concerts, because, well... there was drinking there.}

I have **no** idea why this had happened. It bugs me know, because I absolutely HATED the self talk and anything coming from inside my head. What bugs me about it is I probably could have drowned out the constant chatter with loud music, instead of *literally* drowning the chatter with booze.

Since quitting I have fallen in love with music again. Absolutely fallen in love. I've been listening to new bands and artists, different genres than I'm not accustomed to, every sound, beat and lyric.

What are your favorite sounds of sobriety?

I will not drink with anybody, no way, no how, today.

PS - Please understand when I say music is a huge part of my life... I in NO WAY can play a musical instrument, sing, carry a tune or whistle properly. I just like music. From other people. People with a talent I do not share.",75,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5636112}"

TL;DR: Been sober since Jan 1 and wondering how to cope with my *inner monologue* and the urge to be so productive all of the time.

In the words of Nas, I don't know how to start this shit, so I'll jump in. Thank you in advance for any thoughts or relating of experience because honestly, I haven't shared it with anything and just typing it out is a bit cathartic.

I've always been stuck inside my own head. Described by some people as ""cerebral"" and others as a ""space case,"" I've always had a constant inner monologue that's always thinking of news things or having conversations that never took place. I actually enjoy taking long walks and talking to myself — so I don't see it as a negative, unless I catch myself talking aloud and look around to make sure nobody saw me.  I'm a creative and productive person, sometimes to an extreme. But frankly, it gets pretty exhausting.

The only way I ever really had the ability to let go and relax was when I was drinking. I was not a drinker in college, but I found out in the start of my professional life that a few drinks could help me relax (read: be less awkward) in after-work social situations. Of course, it expanded beyond that and through my 20s. Eventually I was drinking every weekend to let go, and not longer after, every day. I kind reveled in it too. I loved going to bars, meeting new characters, and the many weird experiences that you seem to get yourself into when drinking. I loved buying a brand new handle of Gordon's gin and knowing I was set for a couple of days, and keeping it with me at all times. I loved a 4 day bender. I loved watching movies — I can't pay attention to movies when I'm sober. I was a master at hangover prevention (apart from mental fog).

Over time, I took on the usual effects of that kind of lifestyle: Trouble sleeping, night sweats (when I didn't drink enough), practically shitting myself (practically? be honest with yourself bro), selfish decisions (drinking and driving), depression, and anxiety.

But the inner monologue would at least shut up for a while.

I hit my low point in November 2015, and I'll spare the details. Life seemed empty and meaningless, and it seemed like that was all it was ever going to be. Through this, I was always very functional and hid it all well, except in November 2015. But practically every alcoholic behavior I've come across on reddit describes me at some point (sneaking drinks everywhere, morning drinking, shakes, yada). And of course, this all runs through multiple generations of my family and none of them had ever seriously considered sobriety that I know of.

Anyway, I resolved to curb drinking until the new year (2016, sort of worked), get healthy, and quit for at least a few months starting in January. I made it until April 1 and although I'd lost 30 pounds and felt amazing, I couldn't wait to get to the liquor store. I started right up only to repeat the same shitty lifestyle until January of the next year where I also quit for 3 months. Rinse and repeat until 2020 when I decided to make it a full year, if not quit entirely. Part of the motivation was that I had my first son, who was born while I was completely inebriated from the bottle of Tanqueray I had in my backpack for the occasion.

My question for y'all, and I sincerely appreciate your input: **Is the inner monologue and productivity problem something you also experience, and how have you dealt with it?** I genuinely want to make sobriety a permanent lifestyle but sometimes I also can't imagine being so trapped inside my head or working all of the time. Also, my friends and family all insist that I'm a huge dick *when I'm not drinking* and they're right. I'm an intense and productive person, and even I hate it sometimes. They practically celebrate when I've ended these dry spells in the past.

Can anyone relate?

Need to be heard and get some advice I guess,"This will be a fairly long post. I will make a tldr paragraph at the end. I guess I should begin with a bit of background information. I'm almost 23 years old(nobody likes you right? Ha) I'm a soldier in the us army. And I have been developing an increasingly problematic drinking habit lately. It's gotten to the point where I cant go a day without wanting to get buzzed at least. I'm overweight I need to lose like 20 lbs. I'm a fairly strong guy, I lift a lot but I'm starting to look in the mirror and see a fat fuck with a beer belly and I'm sucking at running

It all started when I was 18 and my dad gave me my first shot of American honey. I love how alcohol makes me feel. I'm kind of an awkward person and I love who I am when I'm drunk. I can socialize, I can connect with people, I can laugh and have fun with people, I can flirt with a cute girl and not feel like she would be disgusted by me. I want to be that person when I'm sober. But I just don't know how 

Living with my dad after my parents divorced, drinking every day seemed normal. He owned a landscaping company. I was his right hand guy. After every long day in the sun, or cold day in the winter plowing snow we would go by the bar, he would buy me some food and drink his martinis. He would buy me beer or nips and let me drink it at home. Hes the one who taught me how to roll a joint. 

That was good for a while. I was living okay. Things were fine. Then at some point his health began deteriorating. He was a 2 pack a day smoker. He kept going through bouts with pneumonia. And still maintained his 10 drink a day habit. Eventually his mind started turning into jelly I guess. Maybe dementia. He lost his license, I had to start taking care of him at home, and going out and doing his work alone. Couldn't go to college. Struggled to have my own life. A girlfriend was out of the question. 

Then one morning I woke up and he was dead. I was 20. I still feel guilty about not getting him enough help, not taking better care of him. If I did he might be alive and I wouldn't be in this mess but that's besides the point. He was my hero. Or maybe an antihero because he was an alcoholic 

After he died something broke in me. I went off the deep end. Started getting into drugs. Started running the modest business he built into the ground because all I cared about was getting drunk or high at the end of the day, that was all that mattered. I fell behind on the bills. Started losing business. You can tell where this is going. 

I eventually lost almost everything. Including my license. All my money. My truck. My other job I got after the family business crumbled. It's a miracle they didnt take the house away too. That's only because dad paid it off. Then I went to my emergency contingency plan. Walked my bum ass down to the recruitment center. And now here I am.

In initial entry training I was dry for 4 months. I even had 6 pack abs. I felt good after that. Then I got out of there and to a permanent station. Stupid old me decided to start drinking on fridays again. That was 6 months ago. And now here I am again. Drinking at least a 6 pack a day again, sometimes nips as well. 

My fucking problem is I dont have any valid hobbies, still haven't got my license back, from before. Its lonely when you're a guy without a car and girls look at you like a pathetic loser when they find out. I have enough money now to get it back and of course the dmv is closed due to coronavirus. Sure. I've been able to bang a few girls but that doesn't help anything. I still feel unsatisfied and like theres a lot missing 

9 to 5 I'm playing dress up in a camo uniform doing mundane tasks that I feel no sense of importance out of. After that I go to my room and drink and watch dumb shit like family guy or play video games. I just want to fucking get out. I want my contract to be over, use my GI bill to get educated and go on and do something important with my life but that seems so far away. I feel like im so far behind. I'll be 25 by the time I go to college. My cousin is the same age as me and shes about to be a lawyer for fucks sake. 

Tldr; I know this was a wall of text but I have some kind of sucking emptiness in my life and alcohol temporarily makes it go away but then I sober up and it's back. How do I get out of this. How do I be a normal person again who doesnt feel the need to drink.

When you’re in the middle of it, hell yeah, this is why I came to this party! Here I am! Extra bonus if you have homies cheering because we’re all in this bliss together, right? Good times! 

And then the elasticity of time steps in, ever so gently. “Well, I gotta go piss, hold that thought.” And then when you get back, you or them forget what the thought was. 

So then phase 2 starts

Phase 2:  diggin’ this groove. Where’s another drink? Foremost in my mind, still listening, still engaged, making jokes with my comrade about where the drinks are. 

Back when I thought about whether I could live in this space forever, I had an imaginary conversation with my body. Ludicrous, because my body is communicating with me daily but I still think I’m in control, as most of us do until we die...

Anyway, my brain answers that, yes, of course I could have this feeling forever and if I did, my body would be our enemy but we would fight it until the end. And it didn’t matter who won, as long as it was worth it. 

Is it worth it? 
What is worth?
Do we even know when we are clouded?

Because, body and brain are secretly working against “us” and both know that “we” are going to lose. 

Listen to at least one of these things. Check your ego. Examine the outside thing that is a manifestation of our own doing.

I casually drink, so I don’t drink daily. But when I do drink - I don’t have control. I can’t have just “a glass of wine.” I end up getting drunk and just annoying myself even when I know I need to not be hungover the next day.

Lately, I’ve also been lying about my drinking. I tell my boyfriend I haven’t drank and completely lie about it to him because I don’t want to argue, which ends up to him finding out I lied and it being even worse. I feel like I need to lie about it. I think this is what is finally making me realize this is an issue. 

However, I recognized this fully about a week ago. And twice already I’ve told myself it’s fine and drank again. After telling myself I know I shouldn’t. But in that moment I’m like well I WANT to.

Is all this related to quitting alcohol?!,"So, about 3 months after significantly cutting back on alcohol, I had a massive panic attack.  On a massage table, of all places.  Ironic, I know.  I was feeling GREAT earlier that day, too.  It came out of nowhere.  I used to have panic disorder/anxiety as a kid but I hadn’t had one in probably 15+ years.  Then I wondered...

....was alcohol suppressing this anxiety and panic and some repressed trauma or something all these years?  What feelings has alcohol been keeping at bay? What the f&^% has it been numbing?

I was not OK for like 3 weeks.  Depersonalization, Depression, Anxiety, panic attacks, feeling smothered by everything, couldn’t control the thoughts in my head and also couldn’t interpret them either. Morning panic every day.  Felt like my brain’s wiring was just.. off.  My husband said when I looked at him it was like I could see through him.  I felt nothing like myself.  Like something else was inhabiting my body.

And now... 6 months into this journey, and I am feeling things I haven’t felt since I was 15.  Remembering memories that I thought were lost, both good and bad.  Remembering the smallest details about the wallpaper in the house I grew up in, the lockers at the pool where I swam - little things, but also I think the path back to myself.

This is is supposed to be my day off but I'm miserable.
Nothing interests me whatsoever so much so that staying awake almost seems pointless.
Not drinking seems kind of pointless.

2020-05-27 21:03:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/grwdyb/the_importance_of_honesty/,The importance of honesty.,"I've been on this journey for over 6 and a half years now.  Thanks to my HP I have not had to drink or drug since the day I earnestly decided to get sober and picked up that white chip.

Perhaps the thing I keep coming back to is honesty.  In AA they call it rigorous honesty.  You could say that my decision to get sober was rooted in honesty: being honest about the fact that I couldn't keep going the way I was and ever expect to live a healthy and happy life.  And the whole process since then has been about honesty, too.  Honesty about my defects of character, honesty about my weaknesses, and honesty about life and its struggles in general.  

The times when I have strayed have been times when I have been less honest.  Perhaps the biggest example was just over a year ago, when things started going really well for me and I came to the conclusion that I was ""finished"", in spiritual terms.  I really though I had nowhere left to go.  And that made me very full of myself.  That led to me committing some mistakes that harmed others.  Thankfully I realized what I was doing and was able to drop the big ego.

I was left very vulnerable, though.  I found this spiritual community online.  They advocated using psychedelic drugs as a form of meditation, imagine that.  Luckily I didn't, although to be honest I did consider it briefly.  A few months ago I started butting heads with them and their leader and thankfully I was able to listen to my heart and get out.  But that experience left me with doubts about what it means to be ""rigorously honest"".  The leader had seemed to imply that I was not being totally honest with myself... and that made me question what honesty really means.

But I'm starting to have an idea on it now.  I think there is what we can call micro-honesty and macro-honesty.  Micro-honesty could be something like, ""Why did I choose to send that text message?  It must be because I am looking for validation or something similar.""  ""Why did I get angry with my wife today?  It must be because I am causing her to pay for my bad day."" Or something like that.  Basically, it's nit-picking.  And to be honest I don't find it very helpful, or even necessary.

What I *do* find necessary is what I call macro-honesty.  Let me give you some examples of some macro-honesty in my life:

1. I can't expect to drink and live a happy and fulfilling life.
2. I am still a wounded guy with pains and traumas to work through.
3. Some of my behavior is still a result of my pains and traumas (although no need to nitpick which are and which aren't.  The important things tend to be clear without much analysis.)
4. I need support in order to deal with these things.
5. I am responsible for my emotional experience, not other people.
6. I am not better (or worse) than anybody else.
7. Everybody is doing the best they can.

Etc. 

If I lie to myself on any of these points, I'm in for trouble.  I don't necessarily need to know exactly why I sent a text message, or why I uploaded a photo to Facebook.  It's not important!  Who cares!?! But if I go around telling myself ""welp, I'm cured, and a beer would be nice right about now!"" then that's not OK.

It's a subtle difference, but one that makes a huge difference.

Finally, it's OK to be honest about the good things, too.  It's OK to be honest about the fact that, hey, I'm wounded, but I'm healing.  It's OK to trust myself.  If not, we'll constantly be pulled one way or another by people who think they know best for us.  People never know best for us.  The answers are always inside.

And lastly, the fact that I'm not nit-picking or trying to do the ""micro-honesty"" thing, IMHO, is a major sign of healing.

So many oh shit moments. So many ah-ha moments. But it never seems to stick for any length of time. The fear fades. I shame and guilt lessen. The transgressions slide into memory. The hangover stops. Days and days later but, it does. And all the negatives just don’t do it, until I repeat the cycle all over again when I inevitably binge. 

I keep hoping I’ll get this moment where it all clicks. Like so many people here have mentioned. But it just doesn’t seem to be happening for me. I keep getting blackout drunk. I keep texting/emailing/talking with people I don’t even remember. I keep driving when I shouldn’t. I keep adding to my depression. I keep putting my job in jeopardy. I keep scaring the people I love. I keep scaring myself. I keep playing with my life. 

A year ago around this time I tried to take my life. Alcohol was involved. I had been drinking. Not very much that night. But I had been on a bit of a bender. I was really struggling with depression. And I kept reaching for the bottle. That night I reached for all the drugs I could find and took them all in quick succession. I managed to make it through the night, somehow, and was found by a friend in the morning. I spent three days in the hospital. AND THAT STILL DIDNT STOP ME! 

Here I am a year later. Still struggling. Still trying, but starting to give up hope. I’ve strung together some days recently. But then my binges just get worse and worse. I’ve already gained a bunch of weight. I’ve been thwarting my meds. Now my pinky fingers feel numb, like when you sleep on your arm wrong and it goes numb. I know this isn’t a good sign. It’s all scary. And yet I just keep going.

A perfect recipe for a disaster.,"Ended up in the hospital after binge drinking vodka martinis, it was 6 days after I had a hysterectomy. I had never been to the hospital before my surgery and now I was there twice in less than a week. 

My husband found me and called 911 after being unable to wake me up. He realized I was unconscious. It was a huge scene at our house when the cops and EMTs arrived. The cops were questioning my husband because they thought I had tried to kill myself (definitely not the case). While he was answering the cops questions, I was rushed to the ER where they started an IV and medication. To make matters worse, while unconscious at home, I had fallen off the bed so I needed a CT of my head and since I had just had a hysterectomy I needed another for my abdomen.

After being at the hospital I ""woke up"". I was swearing, angry and pulling out my IVs. I was fighting the nurses and doctors who were trying to save me. Eventually they ended up having to restrain my hands and feet to the bed. 

They loaded me up with Ativan to calm me down and to make me sleep. I was there for a day before I came conscious and realized what happened. I was bruised, tired and sore. I was calling out to my husband to please take me home. I put my family and friends through hell those two days. Words can't express how guilt ridden I felt (and still feel). My husband was amazing and stood by my side the entire time I was in the hospital. I love that man so much. 

We were drinkers. It's something we did together. My husband was a daily drinker but I wasn't. Didn't really think I had *that* big of a problem. In fact, I could go 3-4 days without a drink but when I did drink I binged and that was my problem. Once I came through in the hospital we both vowed to quit drinking, something I thought we would never attempt to do. 

Today marks 100 days for both of us and I couldn't be more proud. Other than getting married this is the best decision we've ever made. 

Sober life is so much better than drinking. Sleep is amazing, I'm excersising most days, our relationship is better and my anxiety is almost nonexistent.

Trust me when I say, if my husband and I can do it, you can too!

My husband stopped drinking in about August of last year. He has had a few backslides. It took me a couple more months to get on board, but I am proud to say that I have been 100% alcohol free since November 2019. 

I have noticed that my husband has developed a fondness for alcohol free beer, which is fine. This product is available in pretty well all grocery stores and some liquor outlets. 

I have noticed that my husband has been going to liquor stores to purchase it, and I don’t understand why. This is extremely dangerous territory for him but he seems drawn to it. 

As a matter of fact, this has been the reason for some of his backslides… He goes in for alcohol free beer and comes out with vodka instead. 

I’m not sure how to approach this with him and I’m looking for some insight on what might be going on in his mind… Because it is very different from what is going on in my mind. I am terrified to go into a liquor store and intentionally will not.

I used to drink somewhat heavily (4-6 drinks per evening, pretty much every evening) but on the surface I was a ""normal drinker"" and no one really noticed. I was not a day-drinker, hard-alcohol drinker, or binge-drinker but I had obsessive thoughts about when I could pour the next glass every time I drank. I had no idea how to stop the cycle of waking up in the morning hating myself and promising to never drink again and then 5pm rolling around and being like ""fuck it, I'll have a glass.""  

I am so thankful to be sober and I am actually really thankful for my addiction, which may sound weird. Recovery has opened up a whole world of self-transformation and growth and I don't think any other life event could have stirred up this level of self-awareness and change. I started therapy. I meditate here and there and I just generally have an interest in learning more about spirituality (and as a drinker, I did not give a shit about spirituality and mindfulness). I actually like going outside. I read a lot of great recovery books and listen to self help and recovery podcasts. I now care deeply about my self-care rituals. I think in general, I just care about my life more than I used to. 

One thing I am still working on is secrecy and my tendency to bend the truth. My drinking problem was a huge secret and I was a fucking ninja at letting no one know that I had one. When I first got sober, my instinct was to keep it a secret or just keep it low key but I realized I am just doing the same shit that I was before. I was listening to Seltzer Squad podcast and Jes Valentine said that she is shameless and proud of the label 'sober' because she is doing what she is supposed to and shouldn't feel any shame about not drinking. I am not fully there yet but I am working on letting go of my shame/secrecy tendencies as that was a huge problem in my drinking years and I don't want to repeat that pattern in my recovery.

Literal chills went down my spine walking down the wine aisle (an aisle I’ve been avidly avoiding). I felt a rush browsing the various options but also caution. 

Now I have two bottles of wine sitting on my counter for the first time since I’ve been sober. When I see it I find myself fantasizing about pouring myself a glass. Red wine was my go to, was my warm fuzzy comfort.

I have been posting here a LOT. but I love to write and I figure this is a good outlet for me during the hard times of sobriety.
Recently, since quitting I have experienced the following that I have never had before.

Every night it is now a chore to fall asleep.

I experience sleep paralysis nearly EVERY night.

Last night it was especially awful and it kept me up until 3-4am or so.

When I finally did pass out, I woke up drenched in sweat despite keeping my thermostat low.

I also woke up extremely fatigued and had to force myself to get up.

Along with that, the dreams I have been having have been EXTREMELY vivid. 

They always seem to have lessons In them as well although I seem to forget them upon waking.

I can deal with this if it's just a passing thing. I have been a long time user of kratom as well, and I feel like tapering off of that will benefit me greatly.
I am not so worried about the night sweats because It is at a point where I am drastically changing my behaviors. It's really tough to think that my body is just trying to achieve homeostasis after me abusing it for so long. I am only 25 but I changed my habits for the worst when I turned 21. It's better to get this out of the way now than have to deal with it dragging on into my thirties. I feel a lot better than I did last night and maybe the extra sleep was just what I needed.

And for the next 6 months I rode out terrible withdrawal, mental anguish, physical discomfort, and embarrassing lengthy unemployment.  I spent 6 months unemployed, uncertain, and unhappy.  But I was sober, so there had to be something worth fighting for, if I could make it through all of that.

One year ago I walked into a low paying contract job.  It was my first job as a sober person.  I was confident that it was the best I had left to offer, and the most successful version of me had been left behind in a pile of bottles and cans.  Everything up until that point had been a scam, I was a fraud, and I never deserved any of the success I had.  And I had become OK with it.

For the next year, I lived my sobriety, and worked my ass off.  I spent my time being mindful of who the real me was, and who I could be without alcohol.  It wasn't always fun, and to be honest, there were plenty of times that I didn't believe it was worth it.  But I just couldn't accept that all of this would be for nothing.

Today, I accepted an offer for full time employment from the same company, for the highest paying and most challenging position of my career thus far.  I realize now that I didn't leave anything behind, and that the best version of me is the one that I'm still working toward tomorrow.  But I'll never forget Past Me, and the lessons he taught me about how to better live each day.

To those just starting out on this journey, or contemplating a change.. I can tell you that it absolutely CAN happen.  I am proof.  I was resigned to die on the bathroom floor before I reached 40 years old, holding an empty bottle, with a disdain for life and the gifts it brings.  But now I know, I don't have to do that.  You don't have to do that.  WE don't have to do that anymore.

Just for Today, be the best you.  And every day that you do that, the best you will get better and better.

The time has gone quickly… The main thing I realised, and this may sound cheesy, is that you don’t need alcohol to have a good time, or more specifically, confidence in social situations.

This was the one thing that I was convinced alcohol was giving me. However, my confidence has strengthened noticeably without it. Alcohol was doing nothing but holding me back. I know this because every aspect of myself has improved since I stopped drinking.

Also, sorting out life’s problems has become easier and they don’t feel half as bad. For anyone worried about quitting, I think the most important thing is to really realise that alcohol offers us nothing positive, and when I say nothing I mean nothing. This is difficult to comprehend because the industry invests so much money in trying to convince us of the opposite, as was the case with smoking... Once you get past that illusion, things get a lot easier because we are not wanting it on a psychological level, we get over the fear of missing out on something. That leaves us to deal with the cravings, which do get a lot better with time - I rarely even think about alcohol anymore.

Second, it’s done more good for me than any Aa/Smart meeting has. 

Y’all are giving me the strength I need right now. I recently went through the longest period without drinking in close to 6 years. And reading the stories and posts on here helped me to do that. I’m 26 and I’m not looking forward to dying early.

I’ve never posted before, but I just wanna say thanks. I went without alcohol for 4 weeks during this quarantine, and habitually read through these threads when i was feeling low. That is coming from between a pint and a fifth a day to zero (which took like 2 months of tapering off) and I was really proud of myself. I took the opportunity to isolate myself in a cabin in upstate New York and managed to gain some control over my life.

Now for the less impressive part. When I came back home to Maryland, the same triggers were there, including the liquor store JUST down the block, where I am friends with the people who work there. I would come in every day and talk about hockey with one guy or just bullshit with the others. It was a routine. And coming back to the same place, I fell back into that routine. I failed to avoid the cravings and relapsed like a shithead for an entire week. Not as bad as before, but consistently enough to remind me why I quit. Im disappointed in myself, but I suppose that it might give me the kick i need to try again. I’m starting from day one again today. 

Wish me luck, and much love to you all. I think I’m going to start posting from now on, and I hope you all will see fit to give me a kind word when I’m fucking up.

He would quit for some days, weeks or even a month, and then he'd be back at it. Please don't be like him, be stronger. Reach out for help whenever needed. Your family and friends love you, and would do anything to help, if only asked. Just ask. I wish he had asked and I wish I wasn't a stupid kid to not see his struggles as clearly.

The first picture was 13 days ago, my face was red, I was bloated. I’d been on a diet of alcohol and take-out, I slept terribly, ingested no water (my water came from Diet Pepsi), and my exercise routine involved pushing the ‘next video’ button on YouTube while on the couch.

Fast forward almost 2 weeks. No booze or takeout. Daily exercise, no sugar, only water as a beverage (besides my morning coffee), healthy well-balanced meals and snacks (all natural foods/ vegetarian), making time for outdoors, and working on my sleeping schedule.

I couldn’t have done it had I not found this subreddit. You’re all so amazing, and have helped make me feel amazing! 

My life is changing, and I am so excited for what’s next.

This time last year I’d decided to take a chance and try a 30-day reset – I had so little confidence of succeeding that I had to call it a reset in case I didn’t make it.

I was 7 stone overweight with bags under my eyes and although I had evolved into a peaceful drinker, there were instances of blacking out and waking up in hospital after a night out – relationships where I cared more about drinking, and friendships that were one-sided. Always having to worry about having enough alcohol was shaping my life choices and I couldn’t fathom a future without ever drinking again.

I knew it was the end of the road for me and alcohol – I had recurring pain in my back after drinking that was probably kidney problems and I wasn’t getting much effects anymore from my usual 3 bottles of wine or 6 Litres of Cider. 

The next step would have been moving onto spirits or strong 8% cheap cider and with a 24-hour alcohol shop around the corner, it would have been a quicker decline for me. I knew when all the shops opened and although I shopped around, I’m sure I was known as one of the local drinkers.

I drank 5 bottles of wine over that last weekend and thought I was doing quite well in tapering down before quitting, and I actually thought working all day - getting beers and drinking through the night while working made me more productive.

Anyway, I discovered Reddit and StopDrinking around this time and began reading stories and posts. So much resonated for me in these posts and I found myself nodding along and seeing myself in the same situations and problems. I planned the end weekend and grabbed This Naked Mind the next week.

The struggle for me was that I wanted to drink but knew in my heart that I couldn’t. This saw me through and was something my mind kept returning to when the urges came up. Just for today was a mantra that worked and as the urges died, I knew I was killing alcohol for good this time.

There are always urges but they have dulled – the curiosity will always be there, and it comes up sometimes - can I drink sensibly now? Obviously a thousand times NO!! I won’t be tempted down that road – that voice is alcohol.

I’ve lost 5 stone (70 pounds) and I’ve had so many opportunities opened up because of just being a part of society. I compose for games and am building a nice freelance business and have secured funding to upgrade my home studio. None of this would have been possible with alcohol and I worry sometimes for the version of me in the darkest timeline.

Without StopDrinking I’m not sure this would have been possible - and just remember that every post is reaching people out there who need to keep hearing positives. People like me that just needed a push.

I'm 30 days into a 90 day challenge I've set myself and it will be the longest streak I've had since before my drinking days began 30 years ago.

Not good. I'm aiming to get to a point where my brain rewires enough for me to be happily free from alcohol.

Now, I can hear my body saying ""don't eat a bunch of heavy food right before bed"". The stomach pain will pass, but the feeling of control won't. It's a great feeling, even if I'm going to have to take a nap today. 

I've felt the same thing about drinking water since I've quit dehydrating myself all day. If my mouth is a little dry, it's because I'm thirsty, so I have some delicious water, maybe even with cucumber. Seems obvious, but this process hasn't worked correctly for me in a long time.

It was the day that I got blackout drunk, passed out, woke up in the morning, drank from morning to night, freaked out at my roommate and called my parents to pick me up and drive me to their house where I lived for the rest of the summer. After this episode, I decided not to drink for the first time. I lasted about 12 days and drank at my boy friend's brother's wedding. That day was the first time I had to have a long, hard, look at my alcohol abuse. I was drinking to cope with friendship, relationship, family, and health problems. 

Thankfully that was the worst of my drinking, but I still continued to regularly drink more than I wanted to, blacked out, and had horrible anxious hangovers. I am so happy that this time (the longest I have gone without drinking since that point) i am 26 days sober and have no intention to drink in the near future.

I stopped for all of 2018 barring a wedding and an anniversary (intended to drink at these events from the start of the year, and intended to go back in 2019, which I did). I’ve lived with moderate depression for most of my life, and 2018 was one of my worst years for mental health.

Lately my drinking has gotten worse, especially during quarantine. I tried to take a month off earlier in the year and after about a week started feeling the depression set in. Convinced myself I’d switch to drinking responsibly. Didn’t work out that way. Tried the same thing 10 days ago and on Friday decided again to try and balance it yet again. Saturday morning woke up hungover as hell and dumped out the leftover cans. Decided I wanted to stop indefinitely, and I felt great, like something was finally starting anew. 

Cue today, and I’ve started to feel the dark fog of depression that had led me to “liven” up my days and evenings with beer in the past. wondering if anyone else in here deals/dealt with something similar, and how they take care of their mental health with out the self medication? (note: I do see a mental health professional on and off, and am not seeking medical advice, just mainly wanted to 1 say this stuff ”outloud” - so to speak - and 2 see what others who share the afflictions do to avoid falling off especially at the start)",3,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6991833}"

I've gone months at a time sober before, and so I think that is what makes committing to sobriety again so emotionally stirring for me.

Some context: The first time I decided to stop drinking, I was 22 and in my last semester of college. I was enrolled in 9 hours and worked as a lifeguard otherwise, and I so desperately wanted to make it to graduation. I intentionally took a lighter course load and spent the rest of my time working an aimless yet decent part-time gig so that I could focus on bettering myself and waning off alcohol. Reflecting back on this time, I am thankful for the loads of free-time I was given to focus on myself. I really think that having that time to focus on me helped me stay sober. 

Whereas I felt so in command of my life and schedule back then, I'm merely 2 years older now at 24, and yet things feel so out of my control. I'm not working part time enrolled in 9 hours anymore; I'm clocking in 50 hour weeks. I live alone in a city with few friends. Hell, I have to get up, wash my face everyday and make sure my apartment is clean. I worry that I don't have the mental bandwidth to commit to sobriety. I feel like in order to make this commitment, part of me is gonna have to go on autopilot, or something is gonna slip, and I don't know if I can afford either. I'm scared I'm gonna grow mentally absent or ""checked-out"" on things. I'm not a perfectionist by any means, but I don't want to let others and myself down. 

In the past, grounding myself in a vision for my sobriety and a reason for my life has helped me stay sober, but I'm just not experiencing that kind of emotional resonance right now. It's scary to me that I can't muster up those emotions, but that's okay. Earlier on this evening, I told myself that I might not know or really feel why I want to be sober today. What's important for the time being is that I try and take this one day at a time while I can still recognize that drinking doesn't make me a happy person. I hope that one day I'll be able to make sense of how I'm feeling and treat myself more kindly with love. I hope that that I'll get to experience--and not just bear witness to--the beautiful moments in life, basking in the feeling of being present. Alcohol has robbed me of the joy and care I once carried with me, and I just want to feel that way again.

Current situation: I only drink on weekends when I go out with friends. The problem is I almost always black out. If I don't go out one weekend, I don't drink, and it's easy not to. It honestly doesn't even cross my mind. It's only when I go out with friends to bars (or other social events).

I live in the heart of a party/drinking town. I literally hear the bars from my window. My friend group ALL drinks and that's how we normally hang out.   
So here are my questions for those that got sober....  
1) Do I have a drinking problem? Is it early stages of one? I'm not sure what it would be called or if this type of drinking problem is common, but whatever it is I would like it to stop. 

2) If I stop drinking all together how would I hang out with my friends? Do I have to get all new friends and/or do different things with them?  RIP social life is what I've noticed when I stop for a couple weeks. And going to a bar and not drinking is it's own form of torture, for me anyway, never been able to make it past an hour sober if I go to a bar.. I'd rather not go.

3) Dating...? I'm a 29M and in my case (and please don't bash me for it) but the reality is the way I meet 100% of the girls I end up hooking up with or end up dating is by going out to bars. And I know if I stop going out to bars and drinking, it's almost like ""I'm passing up"" on all of that opportunity. I know that sounds bad, but it's something that actually is in my thought process when considering to stop drinking completely. It's happened before where I don't go out for a couple weeks and I don't end up meeting anyone - shocker. How do you meet people sober?

When I stop drinking for a couple weeks I'm at the gym way more often, my business starts to drastically improve - it's obvious I'm better without it but social life just takes a HUGE hit.

He was so excited and proud of me, and very confused when after re explaining how big this was, I had no joy, not even for a second. The one thing I know brings me joy is making people laugh, and I'm good at it. Everyone at the comedy clubs I do shows at says how much natural talent I have. Really the only thing I'm confident and know I'm good at is my handle on the art of comedy. I've been sober for almost 2 months and have started to pull the demon's out of my closet.

I was a puking, suicidal, up-and-down-with-withdrawal mess.

https://i.imgur.com/cIKh3jx.jpg
This picture is in the ER. My friend brought me there and I asked him to take a picture of me, shaking and sweating on the gurney with an IV tube and EKG stickers all over. I'd had a withdrawal seizure a few months before and was terrified I was going to have another. ""I never want to come here again,"" I said. 

When the picture was taken I hadn't exercised in over a year. I skipped meals a lot then would eat a whole pizza at night when I was the right level of drunk to not feel nauseous. Before my drinking took over, I was in pretty good shape; when I started exercising again after getting sober, I could barely half-jog one mile and couldn't do a single pull-up. I was physically and mentally the weakest I had ever been.

https://i.imgur.com/PAJk1qu.jpg
This is a picture yesterday after I ran 7 miles and did 50 pull-ups in a few sets, which were my arbitrary, personal goals of being ""in decent shape"". I've lost 25 pounds total since I left rehab in November 2019. I know I don't look like a fitness model but, for reasons I'll explain below, I'm OK with that. 

Beneath the surface, my depression is finally manageable, and my motivation - while still not great - is better than it's ever been since I crossed the line into full blown alcoholic a few years ago.

In early sobriety, my one and only focus was to stay dry. I didn't have spare energy for exercise, or to turn down desserts and junk food. (I actually put on weight in rehab despite losing all the booze calories. I think it's because - apart from the lack of spare discipline - I was malnourished and had vitamin deficiencies from the booze, and was ecstatic to finally not be puking up food after I ate it).

Around 3 months in I started to feel a little more stable in my abstinence from alcohol, but I was still very depressed and had no motivation. I had previously been in decent shape, so I knew I felt mentally better when I did regular cardio. I knew it felt good to be able to trust my body to do basic things without throwing my back out.

Emotionally, I've always been insecure about my body. I got teased a lot for being skinny (then, after I aged and drank myself into a belly, skinny-fat), for not looking athletic, etc. I'd go through phases in my teen years where I worked out and ate obsessively, with fewer results than I wanted, then I'd quit completely (my sponsor recently told me ""that's the most alcoholic way to work out I've ever heard""). I'd previously aspired to one day look like a bodybuilder, as if that would fix all my self-esteem issues. 

In recovery I threw all that out the window. I decided my only goal for exercise was to support my recovery, my mental health, and to help heal my body from years of alcohol abuse. So, no counting calories or extreme dieting. No extreme workouts that would leave me wiped out and injury-prone. No aspirations of a picture-perfect body or of impressive athletic exploits. Just a moderate, sustainable program that I could follow for the long haul.

I started with my diet. I started eating a lot more vegetables and a lot less junk food. I started eating less overall, too. I didn't count calories, I just basically ate until I thought I'd had enough, which was always before I was full. Some days I eat too much. Some days, especially anxious days, I don't eat enough. I don't beat myself up and tell myself that general eating habits over the course of months matters more than anything I eat or don't eat for a given day.

Then, I started running. Very, very slowly at first, maybe twice a week for a mile, plus walking minimum 5 miles a day. Eventually it got a bit easier, so currently I aim for 3 runs a week, one 5+ miles. If I'm sore enough to worry about injuries, I skip the run and go for a long walk instead.

Once I'd lost some weight, I was able to do one pull-up. With the money I saved from drinking, I bought a pullup bar for my apartment. I did tons of sets of one pull-up at a time, until I could do two in a row, and then more.

I have a single 70 pound dumbell in my apartment (also bought way back when I was in shape). At the beginning I could only do deadlift and farmer's walk with it, so I did those only for a while until my grip and core improved. I worked my way up to goblet squats, then things like cheat rows then clean and jerk.

On days I had bad workouts (and there were many), I tried my best to not beat myself up. I reminded myself I was exercising to improve my physical and mental health, not to impress anybody else. I told myself the very act of going for a run when I least felt like it was a way to strengthen my discipline, which would help me stay sober.

Today I'm proud of my body. I know it doesn't belong on the cover of any fitness magazines, but that matters a whole lot less to me now. What matters is that I'm a lot healthier inside than I was back in that fucking hospital bed. What matters is that the exercise itself has helped my mental health, and the ability to set goals and stick to them has helped my discipline and self-esteem. What matters is that I'm approaching this with a moderate, sustainable approach, which means I'm growing emotionally as well.

Fitness is only one component of my recovery program. But, combined with therapy, antidepressants, and AA, it has helped me be where I am today.",413,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45306885}"
2020-05-26 19:58:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gr8ozt/thoughts_on_1000_days_approximately/,Thoughts on 1000 days (approximately),"So recently I passed 1000 days sober. I told myself I would post on here when that happened so here I am! I want to say I am grateful to still be sober after all this time and just recount a little about the experience. 

Mainly with the recount I want to focus on people who may be feeling like I felt during the process of early sobriety to hopefully give them an experience to identify with, for me identifying with other people's experiences always really helped. I will say this: about now, I don't think about drinking anymore. If I do it still scares the shit out of me but I probably only think about drinking every few months and usually it is just ""oh yeah, remember how bad that was..."" I never thought I would be free of the obsession when I was drinking. I remember wallowing in the hopeless feeling of impending doom as all I could do every few weeks was drink myself so sick I would be unable to do anything but vomit for at least two days. I tried for years to get sober, it just kept getting worse. I would rack up a month here, three weeks there, maybe even two months, but then I would drink and my health and my life would come crashing down again. For me what finally did it was fear. I tried AA and all kinds of methods of recovery (I have been to three rehabs), but nothing stuck. 

Finally the fear of death was enough. My health had gotten so bad, even though I was only about 24, that I was sure I would be dead within a year or so if I kept up the kind of binge drinking I was doing. I also moved to a new town to continue my undergraduate degree at a different college. That was it, I haven't drank since. For the first six months or so I was deathly afraid, afraid I would drink again, lose everything I had and die an alcoholic death. I was still obsessed with alcohol and only that truly mortal fear kept me from doing the same behavior patterns that had come to define my life. Slowly though, things changed, I can't tell you exactly when or why, but new habits of thought and action formed. Now not all of these were good, I replaced alcohol in many ways with food, where I would binge eat at night. I am still dealing with this, but the difference in the cost is incalculable. I believe there are few pains greater than being a hopeless alcoholic or drug addict, I lost my leg above the knee in high school and have felt a bunch of physical and emotional pains related to that in my life and I really feel that it does not come close to the pain alcohol caused me. 

For me it seems far away now, it is finally in my past. That said I actively try to remember that fear, to make sure that is always a bulwark between me and certain death. I guess my advice is that you need to find what works for you, whatever it is it doesn't matter and hold onto it. If you can stop drinking life does get better. Since all that I finished my undergraduate and am now in grad school. I am still dealing with health problems today that I feel are rooted in my past bodily abuse, but every year has been better. I cannot describe how bad I felt physically, how unhealthy I felt all the time and how long it took to get better, but it did. I didn't really feel better for probably a year, and even then I still felt bad, it is only recently, the last couple months that I feel I am becoming healthy again and what a feeling it is. There is nothing more valuable than health, without it we have nothing. 

So I wish you all luck wherever you are in your life and in your sobriety, know that if the most hopeless alcoholic like me can stop drinking and regain their health so can you. IWNDWYT and stay safe during this public health crisis.",19,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6272553}"

My health insurance dropped me on March 1st so after white knuckling a global pandemic without my therapist I figure now is as good a time as any to introduce myself.

I said something in passing last week that I haven't been able to shake. I told my friend that if I had known how miserable I'd be after two years sober, there's no chance I'd have gotten sober in the first place.

A big factor in getting sober was a deep spiral after yet another heartbreak, and realizing that it was bound to happen again if I didn't take some semblance of control of my life. I had never experienced romantic love, and it absolutely (and quite literally almost) killed me. It feels so pathetic to write that out.

Now, two years later, the only thing different is that I am acutely aware of my misery. No booze with which to disassociate with. I begin, and end, each and everyday alone. Dating in your 20's is  difficult as it is-- adding on sobriety is like playing the Halo 2 campaign on legendary with a Madcatz controller. Every romantic relationship that I've been in has gone astray, and the only common thread between them all is me. I don't think less of myself when we're not compatible, and don't think less of somebody else for not being into me. I understand that love can't be forced, and I threw entitlement out the window with the Tito's two years ago. 

I have many lifelong friends that I see regularly and am very thankful for. I have an incredibly supportive family that's always there for me. Friends and family have never been an issue-- it's always this unscratched itch to express romantic love. I've got so much to give but have never had anybody to give it to :(

I am thankful to be sober, understand how much worse things would be if I wasn't, and have no intention of drinking today, but what the hell y'all.

I remember worrying about things that other people weren't worried about as early as 5 or 6 years old. After seeing a therapist I was diagnosed with mild OCD. Although I am able to live a relatively normal life, sometimes it doesn't feel ""mild"" to me. 

A lot of people think of OCD as obsessive hand washing, but it manifests itself in all sorts of ways. For me, it's awful unpleasant thoughts--many of which surround the health and well-being my parents. I know most people love and are concerned about their parents, but I take it to an obsessive level. It doesn't stop there. I constantly have to check things like the door being locked, if the oven is off, you name it. 

I never really  drank in high school and started drinking in college. The same is true for medication to treat anxiety. I am on Citalopram and have been for several years now (I'm in my early thirties). 

I definitely use alcohol to self-medicate because of my anxiety. When I have a drink or 2, it's like whatever I was worried about before melts away. It's a great distraction. 

My drink of choice is usually wine. And the more I drink the more I want. I try and stop myself before I finish the whole bottle but have definitely done so before. My routine recently (especially during COVID) would go as follows: Buy a bottle of wine on Monday, drink 2/3. Drink the rest on Tuesday. Either wait til Wednesday to buy another, or go buy another one and drink it down. I'll skip a day here and there. 

Anyway, I could go on and on, but I have heard some people say their anxiety drastically was reduced after quitting drinking. I have only found minimal resources of this online. But I've seen it a few times on this board as I've been a long-time subscriber. 

Lately the anxiety has been so bad I can't get to sleep unless I drink a good amount or take a Xanax (I do not mix the 2). My boyfriend used to take Xanax for his anxiety but has tapered off so I occasionally take his (.5 or 1 mg). I am aware it's  highly addictive and that's why I limit it to taking it once or twice a week on a day I skip drinking. Otherwise, I am trying to walk as much as possible. I figure if I exhaust myself physically it will help me sleep, but there's been times I've gotten 20K+ steps in a day and a worry could keep me up. 

After a particular anxious few days, I am thinking of taking another break from alcohol. Can anyone share their experiences/stories about how their anxiety levels changed after quitting? As much as I love drinking, I am willing to quit if I could get rid of the anxiety. I just want to enjoy my life, family, friends, and boyfriend without being controlled by it and sometimes it just sucks.

Alcohol only makes things worse, not better. I am responding to this bad feeling by doing some physical activity outside, to get my mood up and get some sunlight on me. Then, I'm watching my favorite funny tv shows and comedies, and just waiting this out.

I have learned a few things over the years. Sobriety is definitely the best choice, but sober people can still have bad days or depressed days. Not every single day will be awesome or good. Some days are gonna suck and that is just a reality of life. These bad feelings are temporary, not permanent. 

So even though I've been depressed all day, I'm just gonna do my outdoor exercises, watch some really funny tv shows, and hope that tomorrow I will be back to feeling good.

I am wondering what motivates other people to stay sober or to get sober (if you are not quite there).

I am making the first real attempt to quit drinking since I got pregnant 3 years ago, I managed to be sober for over a year then. Obviously, pregnancy was my motivation then. This time around I have been thinking about my motivation and I came up with my top 3:  


1. To be a role model for my son, and create a better environment for him.  
This is my biggest one! I grew up in a family that was destroyed by alcohol. To keep things short, my father is now a dry alcoholic and a strong member of AA (thank god). Slip ups still happen and are very life threatening. My mom and her 2nd husband have poor drinking habits still, we recently moved in with them to save up money.. It's been an eye opening experience.  This toxic drinking culture my family has is awful and it has no place in my sons childhood! I want him to have a strong sober mom to look up to.   


2. Take better care of my mind body and soul!!  
This is pretty straightforward. I have A LOT of health problems, and they have always been my excuse to self medicate with booze. Unfortunately alcohol only offers a band aid and only hurts me in the long run.  


3. Save money and start reaching my potential

I didn't stick with AA - I gave it four months, weekly, but I didn't feel I belonged.  (I'm not knocking AA, it just wasn't for me.)  


What I wanted to say was this.  When I first turned up to an AA meeting, I had all these preconceptions and images of what it was going to be like, and I was walking slowly towards the church where the meeting was going to be held.  I won't lie, I was 95% ready to turn around, or just to keep walking to the shopping mall across the road.  What was I even doing here? Was I really an alcoholic? Why didn't I just sack it off?  Then someone outside the church made eye contact, walked over, and said to me ""are you new?""  I guess he sensed my general apprehension and fear.  


Anyway, that was John.  He was younger than I thought AA members would be - obviously I thought it would be 90% old men, such was my stereotypical view.  He told me to stick with him, he rolled me a cigarette and introduced me to some of the other members.  He sat next to me in the first meeting and helped show me the way.  He was kind.  He thought about me, not himself.  He told me about his wife and his young kid, and his plans to take them to the beach at the weekend.  


Because of John's kindness and his welcome, I lasted those four months, and because of him I am still kicking the habit one day at a time.  


I don't know John's friends or family, I don't want to go back to the AA group, and I don't know who else to tell this to, so I wanted to share it here and say that these little gestures of kindness mean an awful lot when you're going through hell.

It might not seem huge, but it sure feels like it is for me. There were many a time that I thought about caving, as life has not been a true walk in the park these past few weeks.

For the second time since my over 2-month quarantine, I'm cleaning it up. This time I am not stuffing empty bottles into the middle of the trash where they can't be easily noticed and I'm realizing I don't need/haven't been using the Dramamine, probiotics, asprin, and vitamins because I'm not rolling over in agony every morning anymore in need of relief. 

I'm still anxious and depressed af. My room is a mess and i can't even leave it because I'm living in a house of neat freaks who can't stand the sight of a cup on the goddamm table... I worry they are starting to take my avoidance personally. I just really really really really enjoy/need solitude. 

Sober me is starting to realize that maybe it's not them who are the freaks. 
It's not normal to let the litter box overflow and the plants dry out.
It's not normal to spend the day in bed.
It's not normal to have to keep a little pharmacy with you everywhere you go to keep your hangover tolerable.

I've lost my ability to gauge what is normal or socially acceptable anymore. Even as I write this I still haven't left my bed. I'm just smoking weed and vibin to good music. Nothing wrong with that...
Right? 

I question everything I do now. Is my laziness a personality trait or a symptom of being a depressed alcoholic? Or is it the pot?

Am I going to be like this forever?

Sober me and drunk me are equally miserable mentally, but at least I'm not destroying my body in the process of figuring my shit out. I romanticize ""going on a bender"" as a way to make my emo ass process tough stuff. Never works. I'm not Gerard fucking Way.

Anyway thanks for listening to me ramble.

From 2015 through about seven months ago I drank the equivalent of about a fifth every day. Knowing I needed to stop, blacking out daily, waking up soaked in misery and regret. Day after day after day. Drying out for a week only to fall back down.  Drinking scotch at 9:00am. Being five or six drinks in by noon. Day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year. Every day regretting my kids seeing me that way, knowing I was risking my entire life, leaving huge foggy blanks where my life should be, and living in a soup of self-loathing and growing despair. I’d begun to accept that I would die from it, leaving my wife to handle the fallout. I could stop myself from drinking for a short while, but I could not put a dent in my desire or compulsion to drink. Kept trying, kept failing. For years.

People would write that sobriety was better and brought happiness, and I kept hoping that would be the case. But I kept sobering up and not finding peace, but kept feeling the buildup of an irresistible urge to drink and growing dissatisfaction with sobriety. And so I kept falling down.

I finally found it. No idea what changed or why it worked this time. But I enjoy my sobriety now. It’s not some brave face I put on or an act of will to force myself into it. I’m not pretending to be happy sober while burying a burning desire to drink. It used to be that way, but it isn’t now.

If you’re drowning, keep trying. It doesn’t matter if you fail and fail and fail and fail and fail. Keep trying. The better life that you want, the freedom from the misery of alcoholism, didn’t come to me until I’d tried and failed more times than I can count or even remember.

I take breaks for a week or two and I feel really good about my increased productivity and decreased amount of times I've lost control of my filter and said/did things I ended up regretting. Yet, no matter how good I feel about that time of not drinking, I'm slowly pulled back to have one. 

Once I have that drink, all bets are off and suddenly it's normal to go to the liquor store again. Suddenly I'm losing my filter and saying things I never intended to share with anyone. Suddenly I'm kissing people I have no interest in. Suddenly things happen with a best friend of mine, regardless of the fact that none of us felt interested in each other before or after. Suddenly I'm saying stupid things and making a fool of myself. Also of concern..I go over to the apartment of a friend that lives in my apartment complex and then I drive back to my apartment after. (Ok, so it is a 1 min drive from one apartment to another, but it is a risky behavior that I intend to stop here and now.)

So when enough is enough, I take another break, I dump out the alcohol in the house, and the cycle begins again. I need to be free of this. 

I went almost a year and a half without drinking following an extremely rough year in 2016. I had developed problematic drinking habits prior to that year and my partner at the time gave me an ultimatum, which spurred me to action. That 1 year+ sober helped me realize all the things that I was capable of doing without the ""help"" of alcohol. Then I started dating someone new and I wanted to feel normal and have a drink while out on a date, so I talked myself into breaking my sobriety. That was nearly 2 years ago. 

I'm not sure where to begin, where to find the motivation to just STOP without having to have an ultimatum from a partner (currently single). This sub helped me out when I quit back then, so I think this may be an ok place to start this time.

Was feeling pretty good and enjoying the new found motivation and direction. I've been out of work and creating a post covid business of my own. Last week though I screwed up and drank a 6 pack and it's really tipped my body over the edge. Upper abdominal pains and Mini noises and spasms, not digesting anything properly. It's not subsiding like it has before.. anyways I rang the health advice Line and they said go to hospital.. kind of glad as I didn't feel up to waiting for appointments and specialists etc. Hopefully they'll just thoroughly check everything out and give me the good or bad news. I really can't imagine drinking again after experiencing this reaction.. my 43 year old body is not happy!

Update: Thanks everyone.. just got home and relieved to have had my bloods done and a diagnosis of mild pancreatitis and gastritis. They were glad I came in at this early stage and think it should settle in a few more days. Obviously no booze and I have no desire to aggravate my internals anymore. Diet changes too.. There were 2 other guys in there with alcohol related gallstones and  kidney stones and I realised what a selfish waste of expertise time and resources alcohol/ism inflicts on the medical and hospital community.",13,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.43279725}"

I've been one for nearly 10 years. It started with a divorce. I got self destructive and found work in a war zone... alcohol was a pretty standard cope in that setting. I survived, came back home. Did some therapy, was given a clean bill of health. Met a new partner, moved on with my life... but alcohol has always been there. As I've stripped back layers of pain over the years drinking became an increasingly regular crutch. I've decided to stop two years ago... but I can't seem to pull it off. Went to AA, but that didn't work for me. The religious thing is weird, and there's this strange sense of surrender that I just can't commit to. I haven't hit rock bottom, and that felt like it was held against me. I'm not fond of labels, and that too felt incompatible. I don't judge - it's a great program - but it's not for me. 

I'm fit, and healthy. But I'm scared about the stress I'm putting my body through. I'm loved and respected... and I'm happy with my connections... but I don't have anyone who I feel comfortable opening up to. I'm putting away 800 mils of spirit a day, most days. I really want to stop. 

What's wierding me out is that it really feels like alcohol was useful once. In war it fills the impossible time between moments of action. It soothes the immediacy of trauma. But now, in normal life, I'm not sure why I still reach for the bottle. It feels self destructive. 

Anyone else get that feeling? Like drinking is a form of slow suicide? Anyway, tips, support or advice would be appreciated.

2020-05-26 04:59:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gqthbr/mini_bottle_of_wine_experiment/,Mini bottle of wine experiment.,"So.... I did a little experiment last night.  For those of you who have read Annie Grace’s book This Naked Mind and The Alcohol Experiment, she actually mentions doing this and recording herself on video while she drinks a whole bottle of wine. She says she get sloppy, feels tired and- all in all - it was a experience that she didn’t want to repeat.

I will say here that this is obviously not recommended by Ms Grace nor myself for anyone to do and is completely unnecessary for your sobriety. 

However! As I’m a sucker for trying stuff out, I thought I’d give it a go - BUT with a mini bottle of wine
 (187ml/6.3floz a normal bottle is 750ml/25.4floz) as I didn’t want to feel like shit today and be hungover. 

Guess what!? 

Even with a mini bottle of wine - which I finished in stages but didn’t enjoy, especially the last bit, a creeping sense of dread still kicked in no less than half an hour after finishing it.  AND!! 

I STILL have ALL the symptoms of feeling like crap!!

I feel tired and slightly anxious. I had really dry eyes and mouth when I woke up and guzzled water this morning like crazy. I also awoke twice in the night and my heart was racing. I have been waaaaay worse and far more hungover before in the past but I just want to state for the record. IT IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH IT.  This shit is ☠️ poison, it is literally poison to your body and mind and especially when you have been away from it for a while, you can REALLY feel it for what it is. 

I think because my sobriety journey started around June last year and at that point I was drinking at least a bottle of wine a night, often more and vodka as well. I hardly ever drink now and I just don’t get the joy from it anymore. I am small 37F and what I was drinking was a LOT. I was anxious and worried all of the time, I barely got anything done. I am so much more productive now. I think it’s taken me almost a year but I am finally feeling different and I think that last night was the final nail in the “I want to drink” coffin. 

I have read almost all the quit lit there is. I have listened to podcasts and watched hypnosis online, I have massively upped my exercise and nutrition games, I have always been lurking on here I have been to AA meetings, I practise gratitude and I meditate and do yoga. Thank you guys. I am not gonna count this as my day one again as I had absolutely no desire to keep going. I hope that all the subconscious work is catching up with the conscious work. 

I guess I wanted to write this as I hope it speaks to someone who feels they are lost right now or all of their efforts are failing, or for nothing. They absolutely are not and I have beeeeen theeeere friend!! They add up, over time and become something much bigger and stronger. 

I don’t think every sobriety journey is a top of the class. straight A’s -direct line to success. Mine has been more of a meandering scribble across the page with all different colours. I am SO grateful for all the support on here and the chance to be completely honest and not judged. SD is really a wonderful place to be.

————————————————

My new mantra: Today I will not poison my body and my mind. Instead, today I will nourish my body and my mind. 

Alcohol is my gateway to falling deeper into my depression. When I feel like I need a drink, I need to write down WHY I need that drink. And to keep questioning why. 

Why I Need That Drink 5/25/2020:

Because [John Doe] hurt me.

Why did it hurt so bad? I only was with him for 4 months, I wasn’t seriously invested. We had a lot of differences even. Why did it hurt so bad?

Because I dropped my defenses and I was affectionate and caring and empathetic and patient with him, while he was just mirroring my own personality and being manipulative. While he was playing me. I showed him complete and total empathy and kind and gentle and nurturing through my affections and I never get vulnerable enough to do that. And I did it because he made me feel safe enough to let my guard down and be affectionate. I would talk about being in a relationship and he never shut the idea down, he entertained it even, not until the bomb dropped that he was in a whole other long term pseudo relationship with another woman that he was hiding from me. He kept telling me he was busy with work and his son, when he was just too busy to have two girlfriends. 

He never wanted me for more than sex and someone to vent to, but he assured me that he did want more. He said it in plain, precise language. We had sex more affectionate than I’ve ever had with anyone, and I held myself while I sheepishly asked him if that was all he wanted from me after it was over. And he told me no. He told me he wanted more. And for once I wasn’t being treated like I was only worth what someone could get from me. For once someone wanted me for me. And then he held me all night and we fell asleep together. It was the first thing I had asked and it gave me hope. And he made me feel like my love was safe with him.

And what hurt was to not only have that hope ripped from my hands, but to be lied to unknowingly for all that time, and then for that to be revealed to me not even by his own mouth, and to be humiliated and pushed to the ground in the process, and then invalidated, made to feel worthless, and suddenly in a position where I was second best, like always. But this time I wasn’t given any notice that I was. I was sidelined, and was delivered the news on a random morning through a vicious text by a woman who felt triumph over “winning” him in favor of him choosing me, and then rubbed it in my face and demeaned my worth to nothing. When I never even knew she existed. And now not only did I have to mourn the loss of suddenly not having him at all and suddenly being absolutely nothing to him, but also had someone to compare myself to, to add insult to injury. And I think what hurts the most is that I don’t know why these things happen to me. I don’t know why I’m always not good enough. Not wanted. Not lovable. And why it is that *every single time* I get back on my feet, and try to reach out, no matter how cautious I am, no matter how many different approaches I take, no matter how many preventative measures I take, somehow I am always shot back down. And even when I feel secure in it, even just for once, the rug is always pulled out from beneath me. And it becomes an option of either trying again to open up and accept others in and get vulnerable, or to close myself off totally, and don’t put the opportunity on the table so It’s a guarantee that I don’t get hurt. 

I’ve always felt like I wanted to hide myself away from the world. Like I wanted to be shrunken into a spec, so that no one would ever notice my existence. And I’ve always felt like I wanted to run, run far far away but never knew what from, or where to.

And life has always felt so UNFAIR. Like everyone else gets to have good things happen to them and I NEVER do. Like it’s somehow written in the stars. Because I can try so hard, I can try so hard to be a good person, to be humble, and patient, and self reflecting, and open minded, and kind and generous and loving empathetic and accepting, and try so hard to be the type of person that I believe wouldn’t deserve to suffer. And I get back on my feet and I settle back into being the generous person I’ve worked so hard to become. And then I take my chances and I open up and I do so hopefully and happily and then I’m shot right the fuck back down. 

And I’ve never been able to figure out what I did wrong. What I did to deserve never being shown any love by my parents and to be treated like I was nothing, like I was worthless. What I did to deserve to be treated like trash in comparison to my cousins when CPS put my brother and I in my aunt’s home. What I did to always be the scapegoat. What I did to be called a n-gger by my own mother. To be told she wished she’d aborted me and that she wouldn’t care if I died in a ditch with a needle in my arm. 

What I did to never be deserving of kindness or support or uplifting or guidance. 

What I did to always be second best. To never be worth it to someone. To never be the person that someone pines after for more than just my body. To never be someone who was someone’s first choice. To never even be shown affection. To just always be told that I’m stupid for even thinking I would be worth that. And then having to pick myself back up from the rubble, alone. Every time. And I don’t even know what love feels like. 

I’ve never known what it feels like. It’s like I get these little glimpses that are just right outside of my grasp and then as soon as I go to touch them they disappear into dust. And I imagine what life must be like for other people. Just for ONCE, to be able to lean on someone, anyone, and them welcome it with open arms, like I do for everyone else. Just for ONCE to know what it feels like to be loved by a parent. Just for ONCE to be able to feel wanted and safe and just for ONCE to not feel like the word love is like some kind of acid on my tongue, where I’m too afraid to even speak it because it holds so much weight and too much potential to fall right through my grip. And not even the romantic infatuation type of love. I just want the love that it takes to be reassured that I’m not worthless, or to be texted first, or to be complimented out of the blue. It holds all the weight to crush everything that I am and everything that I’ve built myself into. Just for once to feel like I’m not so alone. Like I am *something* to someone. To anyone. To not feel ashamed for wanting that. And to not feel small and insignificant. And to not feel like I’ve never known anything but. 

Just for once to feel wanted. And to feel like I’m a human. And to not feel like I’m just some bland piece of trash on the floor that should be expected to be kicked around. To not feel like I’m stupid for wanting to be kissed, or for wanting to be hugged, or wanting to be shown that someone cares, or wanting to feel safe or wanting to be able to be vulnerable with someone who won’t use my trauma to their advantage.

Why I Do Not Need That Drink: 

Because alcohol does not control me. Because I am strong. I might not be stronger than these feelings. And I might not be strong enough to climb out of this rut that I’m in. But I am strong, and I do not need that drink because alcohol is a poison. And I will not poison myself to make my pain go away. I will not poison myself to forget what I feel. I will sit and be vulnerable with myself and I will not poison my mind and my body. Instead, I will nourish my mind and my body.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47561347}"

It has to do with spirituality and values and how through my abuse of alcohol I gave my values awayin exchange for the next drink.  Its's a tad long so please bear with me.

I am named after my uncle Larry, who served in the US Navy during WW2.He was stationed on a destroyer escort, the USS Underhill, DE 682 in the South China Sea.  On July 24, 1945, the Underhill was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine.The ship was blown in half and the crewmen on the stern section of the ship were rescued by other ships in the area. The sailors toward the front and on the bridgelost their lives that day. My uncle was on the bridge with the captain and was one of the sailors who died. As the ship was sinking, Uncle Larry started singing Irishsongs in a last attempt to raise the spirits of his ship mates even though he was going to die.As the youngest of 8 cousins (he had no children), I received all of his medals. 

Fast forward to 1968. I was a young naval officer. In June, I was at Annapolis, theUS Naval Academy to be best man in my cousin's wedding. During down time,I strolled the campus. I came across a small building which was the tomb of John  Paul Jones,the founder of the American Navy. I went in to look around and saw a large glass case.In the case was a book about a foot thick. The book contained a few hundred pages and each page was dedicated to a ship sunk during WW2. Each day, a Marine color guard would open the case and turn to the next page which listed the ship and crew members.That ship was then honored for the next 24 hours. There were enough pages to go for about a year and a half before starting over at the beginning. The day I was there my uncle's ship was the one being honored. I told my mother about it and she  contacted the Navy Public Affairs Office which sent her pictures of the page.It was written up in my local hometown paper. 

Fast forward to 1994. I am a drunk. I had been kicked out of my house and was living in an attic in another town. I had no money because I couldn't work. Who's going to hire a guy who drinks 24/7?? I was ""borrowing"" money from my mother to buy ""food"". Food was Ruble vodka. I was desperate for money so I got my uncle's medals as well as copies of the logbook page from Annapolis and a family photo of him in uniform. I took all of these heirlooms and sold them at an antique store. I got enough money to keep me in vodka for about 3 weeks!!! I felt like I hit the lottery!!! That was a long time ago and I am not the person I was back then. I have changed a lot but the memory of what I did is a reminder that I am an alcoholic and always will be. I believe in heaven and in my mind Uncle Larry is a lot happier with the man I am becoming (becoming because I'm not there yet)than the drunk I used to be.

Finally got the (lady) balls to admit I have a problem. 80 days sober and this shit isn’t easy.","I decided I had a problem with alcohol 6 months ago.  I didn’t drink for 3 weeks after that moment, then sort of forgot why I quit in the first place... “it’s not THAT bad!”  I said to myself.  “There are tons of people worse than you!”  “You can sometimes control alcohol!”  “You haven’t hit rock bottom yet - what’s the rush to quit?!”

Yeah.  Sometimes I can control it.  And sometimes I blackout.  Sometimes I engage in risky behavior.  Sometimes I’m ashamed of who I am when I’m drunk.  Sometimes I’m hungover for 3 days. Sometimes I lie about how much I drink.  Sometimes I pretend I don’t want it.  Sometimes I pretend I don’t need it.

Logically, it seemed like a no brainer to quit drinking.  But the further away I got from that “moment” when it made total sense to quit, the more it seemed like a foolish thing to do.  Turns out, not hitting rock bottom made me question if I even have had a problem to begin with. 

So then I had a drink after 3 weeks of saying I wouldn’t, then I felt guilty, so another 2 weeks went by with nothing, then I had some wine, then 1 week went by, then more wine, then I was sneaking alcohol without my husband knowing because I said I would quit - but I couldn’t.  I wanted it.  I NEEDED it and I didn’t even know why.  And I couldn’t actually believe it.  I could NOT believe what was happening to me.  Surely this substance did not CONTROL me.  

But it turns out alcohol had been slowly intertwining itself with me for years to the point I couldn’t tell who was really in charge of me anymore.

I was feeling a lot of negative energy this afternoon, which I typically get the night before a work week. Previous tricks to solve this uncomfortable feeling include drinking a bottle of wine, or drinking a bottle of wine, and sometimes even drinking a bottle of wine. You get my drift. I had one solution. But not today dammit. Because it’s my day 10 and I committed to you beautiful people that I would not drink with you today.

So instead, I decided to clean my closet. That lasted all of three minutes when that voice inside me said, “You should really try sweating this out. That might make it feel better.” And holy hell did it.

I signed up for a free trial week of this online workout I’ve been wanting to try. The session was 52 minutes long. “I’ll never finish this. But I’ll do some of it.” And wow it was a lot of weights. And moving my muscles in a way they haven’t been moved in well over a year, maybe longer. 

And about halfway through, the magical miracle that is the endorphin rush hit me. And it. Was. Beautiful. I started crying. Because I was back. The inner me that I had tried to shut down with alcohol popped her head out of those beautiful endorphins and welcomed me back with love and I just fell to my mat hugging myself and crying.

And what a feeling overwhelming gratitude. For this gift of the life I want. For all of you.

It. Is. WONDERFUL. However, there are certain things that come with sobriety that aren’t often spoken about. I’m referring more specifically here to regaining your memory and with it, new perspective. 

	The other day my family decided to get outside and, socially distancing themselves, walk at low tide to hunt for Giant Moon Snails. I was ready to go and my oldest Daughter asked me something I hadn’t been asked in quite a while. She asked if I would be coming too. This used to be the norm. That question was really asking: are you too hungover/filled with anxiety/tired and grumpy from the night before to leave the house and spend time with us. 

	As my memory comes back, my perspective changes. I see the damage. It’s hard. Hard to not get lost in the negative which leads to self hatred which ultimately ends in wanting a drink. It frightens me to think of how my life choices have had a negative impact on their development. However...

	I’m fighting NOW. They can see me FIGHTING NOW. They’ve seen first hand how bad it can get and that turning it around IS possible. I’m sure they’ll have their own issues as they grow just as I’m sure that I’ll have had a hand in some of those issues. Maybe most. After all, they’ve seen you at your worst. They also see the strength it takes, the strength YOU HAVE to seek out help and FIGHT.

	I’m lucky, my family stayed. They decided that I was worth the fight. Not all of us have been that lucky. But if you’re here, you’re fighting. Don’t give up the ghost. You can do it. Your family has seen the bad, but they can also see the good.

It was my longest streak - 53 days - since I started drinking. It has been a gorgeous weekend in the Bay Area and I decided to have a socially distanced picnic in the park with an old friend. I brought the snacks and he brought some champagne and wine. I thought I could try to moderate but that plan failed miserably. We finished both of the bottles over a few hours and on my way home I thought it would be a good idea to buy some white claws and a bunch of sugary crap. I finished about half of them before feeling gross and throwing the rest out. I fell asleep around 10 PM and woke up every couple hours. My sleep was disrupted and I woke up abruptly with anxiety and full of regret. 

Today I feel bloated and gross. I not only have an alcohol hangover but also a sugar hangover. Drinking wasn't even that fun. It was nice to see my friend but the booze just slowed me down and made me feel lethargic and stupid. It's crazy to think that I used to drink this poison for weeks on end previously. I'm trying not to beat myself up for this lapse in judgment and to look at all the progress I've made lately. I've been putting in the work to train my subconscious to reject alcohol and have been seeing a myriad of benefits to my mental health and general well being. I'm going to use this experience to reaffirm my commitment to not drink and treat it as a kind of experiment and keep continuing on with what I was doing before.

I was always sick. If I did not have a drink in me I knew that I would soon be violently ill for the next day or two and probably not sleep for about 4. I would promise myself that I would get through the withdrawal, and remember how terrible I felt while going through it but I never did. I tried so many times to stop. Last year I was hospitalized for a week with jaundice, I had rapidly lost about 40 pounds. I had difficulty swallowing. Vomiting everyday was totally normal. On a different occasion, after having been violently ill, my hands seized. I totally lost myself. Every time I began to feel sick, which was every time I went like 4 hours without a drink, I could feel my hands start to lose dexterity and worried they would seize again. I had auditory hallucinations often, and a weird buzz thing in my head while on the verge of sleep that would cause me to jolt upright. I was scared all the time, but now that i am sober i am realizing how much more scared i should have been. Doctors telling me never to drink again for the rest of my life. No 'in moderation'. You just need to stop now. My husband was hesitant to go to work often because he did not want to leave me alone in case I had to go to the hospital again. I went a year after my week long hospital stay still drinking. I decided many times in that year to stop but was always unsuccessful. The last time i had gone about 5 days without drinking, five days also of being awake in a total stupor. I had a seizure, not just my hands this time I was in the floor and I dont remember,  my husband called an ambulance. 
That was it.
Every time I tried to stop drinking before the thought of alcohol was always right at the front of my brain. If it was mentioned I would need to have a drink or I would be super angry and worried that I would soon be really sick. 

My ambulance seizure was in March. I have not had a drink since and the way I think about (or not think about) alcohol has completely changed. I know this probably sounds stupid, I understand that because I have totally been there too. It is so difficult to stop, it is always right at the front of your brain. And I know that a lot of people reading this, and my friends feel this way as well, will think that I am totally full of shit and will be totally skeptical, but I just know that I am not drinking ever again.  I dont want it. It grosses me out. I feel so good, I actually feel things now. I'm not sleeping all the time, unable to do things with my friends, wasting money on booze. My body and my brain are getting back to normal. My hair is no longer falling out. I was very close to dying, and thinking back I can't believe I didn't place more emphases on that. 

I dont have advice about quitting and I'm sorry for that. I do not go to therapy or AA or anything like that. I did not ween myself off, and I know cold turkey is really dangerous which I'm sure is why I went to the hospital in an ambulance. So I guess in that way I am lucky.  I wish the best for everyone and hope that people reading this may read it before they get incredibly Ill.  Like, poop your pants in front of your friends ill or vomit in a garbage can at your desk in front of your boss.  (Incontinence is a symptom of severe liver damage).

I've posted previously about how I drank heavily for the first month of lock down and now have over a full month of sobriety and going strong. I was talking to my husband yesterday about his anxieties and stresses amid the  pandemic and realized that not drinking is actually what is helping me get through each day. Here's why: I have something to focus on. I have a goal. I have this little, easier every day, thing I'm doing that no matter what else happens that day, no matter how much I do or do not accomplish, every single day is a gold star day if I didn't drink. Every single day I don't drink is a win.

And that little gold star every day stacks. I recently started running every other day, something I've always wanted to get in the habit of, but have never stuck with. And it feels very similar to not drinking, for me. I just have to do this one little thing, don't even have to go very far if I'm not feeling up to it, just have to do it. And then, no matter what else happens that day, no matter how I perform at work, or if I got in a silly fight with my husband because I was hangry, or if I ate a plate of nachos for dinner, I did the thing. I did the run. Gold star. And I also didn't drink. Two gold stars! Holy crap am I killing it! As not drinking got easier and didn't need my full focus, I was able to add this running thing. As running get easier, I can start to also do something else if I want. Maybe getting up with my alarm every day. The possibilities seem endless.

These little goals, these little projects are what is keeping me sane and getting me through each day. When I was drinking I felt like I was on the verge of drowning every single day. Struggling just to keep my head above water and get through. Everything was terrible and stressful and the best I could hope for was maybe a ""good"" drunk night where I could pretend everything was fine and maybe not have too bad of a hangover the next day. Not anymore. I don't have to sit and read the news and wallow in fear and anxiety. All because I have something not pandemic related that I can focus on. It's an amazing feeling.

And you know, even if I don't stick with the running. Even if I never add another thing. If I still don't drink, gold star day. If I stumble and I drink, but then get back to not drinking again, each not drinking day is still a gold star day.

I got sober a year ago, before some very devastating news threw me backwards, so this time around I knew what to expect. Which was nice I guess because this time my anxiety hasn't been through the roof. I feel good, and have noticed a definite change in my sleep and in my skin! Not only am I sleeping better, but the skin on my face looks so much better. No more weird red blotchy spots on my cheeks. The whites of my eyes look remarkably better, and just my overall appearance looks like I actually give a f\*ck. I'm in a better mood lately, especially in the mornings. I have more energy and more motivation. Yesterday I actually cleaned my walk-in closet and bedroom. It took hours upon hours but was worth it. Waking up to an organized closet felt fantastic. I'm glad I made this decision to get sober... even if it is ""again."" It's worth it. The amount of support I have found online is absolutely amazing, and my husband at home has been amazing as well! Incredibly supportive and motivating. I woke up grumpy as hell on Saturday and while we were in the car he just looked at me and said ""You're doing great. I'm proud of you."" And that! That right there, just by itself, was worth everything. To hear those words from someone who means so much to me. I hope anyone reading this who is on the edge, unsure if they can quit, scared of the change: It's worth it! It is so worth it! YOU are worth it! And don't be afraid to ask for help, to tell people this is what you want. There is support all around you, and sometimes in places you'd least expect it. And most importantly; do not be afraid to fail. It happens. This is my second time. Nothing is set in stone. You can do it. Even if it takes more than once. Don't let is discourage you!

I've also wanted to stop drinking pretty much the whole time, but as silly as it sounds, it's hard to make myself care enough to do it.  

When I was a freshman in college, I did drink and party a bit too much on the weekends, but after that first year I swore it off, and was successfully sober for the rest of undergrad.  Once I got into grad school, I started struggling with a lot of stress (a bad breakup, heavy research load), and I regretfully turned to alcohol.  I was drinking four lokos at 9 in the morning before classes, getting black out drunk almost every night of the week, and long story short, I haven't stopped since. 

Even when it started taking a medical toll on me (vitamin deficiencies, pancreatitis, anemia), instead of motivating me to stop before it's too late, my initial reaction seems to be ""good, you deserve it"".  I haven't been back to a doctor in years and am needless to say in very bad shape.  Despite all this, I've managed to stay employed in a very good job.  In my postdoctoral research positions I got to travel around the world and experience more than I ever dreamed.  By all accounts, I should have been happy and living an interesting life, but instead I wasted it and it's all a drunken blur.

Almost every day is the same.  I wake up thinking I don't want to drink anymore, I feel awful, but inevitably it switches to ""actually I don't feel so bad, I can definitely fit another fun night of drinking in, but tomorrow I'l take a break"".  Except it's never a fun night of drinking.  It might start out that way, but it usually ends the same way - crying alone, wondering how i'm going to wake up for work tomorrow/wishing I wouldn't, and wondering when I'm going to get my shit together.

Basically, I only seem to care about myself in those first few hours of a hangover, or when I've already downed a liter of vodka, and when I try to take steps toward getting better like making a doctor/therapy appointment, I always end up backing out.  It always feels like different parts of my brain are going back and forth with each other and the part that doesn't give a shit always wins over the part that doesn't want to live like this anymore.

I don't know what I'm hoping to gain from making this post, but I'm giving it a shot and I hope I can last.  I've poured out all my liquor (something I haven't had the strength to do in around 8 years), and I think I'm too hung over to go get more even if I wanted to, so here's hoping I can say I made it to day 1 tomorrow.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.53913605}"

It feels so good. Don’t have to avoid the light because I have a hangover and my head is throbbing - instead I feel great. Also - I’ve lost five pounds! In a week! It seems insane that I could lose so fast, since I’m not even technically overweight, but I guess when you add up the calories in a bottle of wine per night plus all the calories in late night drunk munchies every single evening... it makes sense. 
Also... yesterday morning while I was running errands, a random guy stopped me outside Trader Joe’s and said “You’re really lovely.” And I was wearing a surgical mask at the time! It sounds silly, but I just can’t imagine that happening when I was hungover and puffy and dead-eyed. I feel like I have the light back in my eyes.

That’s not much info but I feel like my age might have an impact on some responses. 

I wouldn’t consider myself an alcoholic or even a heavy drinker really, I used to drink a lot more my graduating year with buddies after school/work ( probably 3-4 times a week ) and we would get absolutely shit faced. I now only drink once every week and rarely black out. But everytime I drink, even if I remember absolutely everything and didn’t do anything embarrassing I feel this deep stomach guilt the next day. Sometimes it’ll last for a week or sometimes it’s only a day. I’ve done my fair share of stupid things while drunk or blacked out and didn’t really feel this sort of guilt at the time, maybe that’s because my buddies we’re doing the exact same stuff. Regardless, I find myself laying awake at night remembering stupid shit I did over a year ago while drunk or blacked out and it sweeps me into a depressive state. I’ve turned my life around for the better in some very big ways but I can’t seem to get over the stupid things I did while I was drinking. ( I should say that I never put anyone in danger or committed a crime while drunk, I’d just get too drunk and get emotional, stuff like that). I feel almost alienated. People re assure me that it’s not a big deal, I’m 21 and most people my age drink a little too much occasionally and make an ass out of themselves but i still get this horrible gut feeling. 

I don’t know what I’m even looking for out of this post, I just feel like if I can tell someone how I’m feeling about it that maybe I’ll feel better about it and less alienated. I’m tired of constantly feeling depressed about some stupid thing I said drunk a year ago. Maybe I don’t completely forgive myself for the drunk stuff I did in the past and I’m not ready to just casually have a beer with my friends yet. I want to be able to hangout and have some garage beers with my friends but maybe this subconscious guilt post drinking is my brains way of saying that it just doesn’t like drinking and I should stop all together. I did quit drinking for a solid 6 months after a particular embarrassing night, but even now that I only drink on the weekends and only about once a week to every 2 weeks, I still feel like I’m just as bad as I used to be though I know I’m no where close.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7399676}"

It was a fun day at the park: long boarding, meeting girls, and lots of drinking. 

I drove for a while, hit a snag on the exit and swerved across four lanes of traffic. Thank god I didn’t hit anyone. The second I looked up from the steering wheel after the airbag went off I’ll never forget. It felt like a second chance. Like for all intents and purposes, I had no reason to open my eyes again in that moment.

After exiting my car, two guys pulled up and picked me up. They were total strangers. They dropped me off at home. Talk about a guardian angel. I passed out.

The next morning I went to the hospital with a broken shoulder. I just got surgery the other day. My parents found the car in the junkyard and sent me a photo. It wasn’t just totaled, but burnt to a crisp all over. The explosion must have happened shortly after I left the scene.

I talked to a lawyer and apparently the cops are not pursuing the case. 

I’m lucky, right? I feel too lucky. This could have been so much worse. And frankly this broken arm is the most I can handle. Jail, DUI, serious injury, I can’t handle that. Not at all.

I’m an atheist but I have a profound feeling that this was nothing but ‘divine intervention’ that I wriggled my way out of virtually any serious consequences. I also feel that every moment I’m alive after opening my eyes behind the wheel of that car is a blessing. The time for being reckless, being depressed, being lazy is over. I’ve never faced my own mortality so discreetly as I did last week. I’m going to die one day. We all are. I’m too young for that right now.

54 days since my relapse and I found two empty wine bottles in a shoebox in my closet. I think these were the two bottles I drank before I stumbled to the convenience store to buy an entire box of wine. The governor had just declared my city on lock down.
I took my 4 year old with me. I let her pick out candy.

I’m so upset. I think of her little face; she is crazy for candy and I can only imagine how excited she was to be able to pick out whatever she wanted. I can’t remember what she got.

I think of her little hands. I wonder how many times she has called out for me at night and I was out so hard I didn’t hear her? I thought I was more fun after a couple glasses. I thought I was that goofy mom. I would wake up to the kitchen a mess with macaroni and cheese and spilled apple juice.
What has my baby seen?

Awkward.

Well, that’s okay—at least i’m sober, this has to be the right path because the path with alcohol was killing me. Alcohol is still on my mind almost 24/7 but with no strong cravings. I am allowing myself to do what feels right today. I don’t want to be social (haha except on Reddit), I don’t want to even see glass bottles or think of the bloating and extra calories. I don’t want to be reminded of how drinking looks fun. It isn’t fun for me, I don’t like the taste and I will never reach the high my mind imagines without wrecking my life in the process. 

Sooo...celebrating two weeks by just maintaining and sitting with the discomfort because I am strong enough to and by doing so hopefully my body/mind discovers something new. After all; the newness of sobriety is temporary, might as well ride the wave.

I unzipped the bag and found two empty Coors Lite bottles that I had stashed there to keep my boyfriend from counting the real amount that I had drank one night a few months ago during lockdown. 

Wow, I thought to myself. I just sat there for a minute. 

This is not normal. I feel like I am uncovering a lot of my abnormal behaviours with alcohol since I stopped drinking. I never thought I had a big ""problem"", just that I would embarrass myself when I was drunk and that I got horrible hangovers. This has just opened up my eyes so much. People who have a good relationship with alcohol probably don't feel the need to hide empty bottles in backpacks so their boyfriend doesn't see the amount they drank when they stayed up til 5am ALONE.

Last drink meaning I hope to never drink again, ever. Sounds a bit drastic eh? Well, at least once per year I drink far too much and chaos ensues : destruction of property, public nudity, bodily injuries, police involvement and huge negative impacts on relationships. Thankfully never any violence towards people. I never remember the things I've done. I've tried moderation but always slip back into my old ways, the only way to solve this is total abstinence.

I've also stopped smoking weed. I've never caused any chaos while stoned but I think the time is right to clear my head for at least 3 months. I sparked up my last doobie on May 7th. One day I may return to occasional social puffing but right now I'm enjoying the clarity of thought, I smell better, and I don't have to hide anything from anybody (it is illegal here.)

  I'm finding it very easy but I don't know why. For the last 30 years I've been drinking heavily, and/or puffing heavily and/or using other substances, and 95% of the time I've enjoyed every blurry moment. In the past I've found abstinence very difficult, usually short-lived, but this time feels different. Perhaps reaching 50 years of age has had some kind of impact on my unconscious mind? Perhaps separation from my wife of 18 months has significantly reduced stressors? So many factors.  Wonderful sleep and 2 months of amazing weather have helped.

My abstinence right now hasn't required any conscious willpower other than avoiding the alcohol aisle in the supermarket, in the parlance of addiction therapy : I'm ready to quit. Somehow all my stars have aligned after a 6 month hurricane of wet shit and given me the right circumstances to stop. I love the COVID lockdown, I can't just nip into the pub at the end of my street for a sneaky Sambuca+Disarrono+pint of strong cider combo. Also important is that I've been able to avoid daily weed smoking, that's usually what I do when I stop drinking, they call it substitution. I'm not totally sure why I drank so much for so long, or why I abused all possible substances too. I always felt I was doing it because I enjoyed it but I reckon I just used that as an excuse.

Sometimes I read about people who have been sober for *x* years and think : hmmmm, that's something to aspire to, I hope one day I can say the same.

Sometimes I read the words of somebody who drank less than I did for a shorter period of time and created far less mayhem and think : HA! You pussy, that's nothing. In reality they're just like me before the damage started and they have the self-awareness to see that they're headed for damage and mayhem.

We both moved back home to GA. I came from NY after finishing college and she moved back from Cali after getting into some trouble. We’ve both had our struggles with drinking. I thought it was normal behavior to black out constantly after joining a frat while in college. & being in NY made it easy to handle cause to get home you’d just call an Uber or stumble to the train station like everyone else. My friend on the other hand has always been a badass - skipping class, drinking from a young age, stealing, etc. As a young sheltered teenager, she was idyllic to me. Long story short she ended up getting a DUI in California and is now dealing with the repercussions of her actions - ie drinking every day.

We meet up on the weekends. It’s kinda nostalgic to reminisce about the old days as kids, trying new things etc. & I try to keep it to the weekends because I know that if we hung out every day it’d be problematic. However, I’m finding that even during the weekends we sort of enable each other to drink more and more. Most recently I’ve had these paralyzing fears that I could get caught drunk driving and I’d be in the same boat as she is, throwing away all I’ve put into my life in the last few years. Yesterday we made plans to hang out with another old high school friend and when she got to my house she was plastered. She didn’t remember what we had planned, she made sly remarks about my home in front of her new friend (the person who dropped her off), & nearly got into a fight with some random folks at the gas station as I went to fill up. I wasn’t drunk and it gave me an insight into what I’d been a part of myself.  Her behavior isn’t uncommon though. I just thought that because of our long friendship that I could somehow control it or curb it. It ended up eating me alive, nearly killing me or/and destroying my life.

Ultimately, I’m scared that her neglect of her own life can cause harm to mine & she wouldn’t care whatsoever. I guess misery loves company.

Anyway, I decided to stop drinking that night and prioritize our safety, because I realized she was in no position to take care of anyone - not even herself. I cut the night short and dropped her off. As I look back over these last few months, I realize how much danger I’ve put myself in by chasing the buzz. I didn’t even realize that our relationship was noting more than nostalgic parasitism. I’m worried for my friend, but I’m also worried for myself. Naturally, I’m a caring person, but I feel that if I continue doing what I’ve been doing that I’ll end up worse than she is now. (Not to mention that both my parents suffer from alcoholism)

I’ve been on this sub for a few months, and I always see the encouraging stories - even the ppl who fail but try again. I really appreciate the community. Everyday I try harder to quit, and I think realizing that the relationship Ive had with my friend is toxic is a really meta step.  I’m worried that I’ll be losing a friend, but if she can’t see/care that I’m also struggling then I feel like it’s futile to try. Anyway, I would love to talk to someone about quitting - dealing with friends who continue to drink excessively.

The problem I just can’t solve.,"Hi, this is a really hard thing for me to do - I am not used to telling anyone how I feel about this topic, let alone a group of strangers - the thought of bearing my problems to the world is devastating. But, *big breath*, here goes.........


I have a single burning question. It’s the thing I think about the most........when I’m not thinking about alcohol or drunk.

Before I pose the question, a little about me to help with context:
I’m in my early 30s, I have a good job that I love, a wife that I love - and a baby on the way. 

My schedule:
- Mon, Tue, Wed = almost never drink 
- Thu, Sun = often drink
- Fri, Sat = always drink until I pass tf out or the alcohol is gone.

For clarity I never drink in the morning, always evenings or sometimes from the afternoon on a weekend.

The reason I barely drink Mon to Wed is because I’ve drunk so much over the Fri to Sat that I feel damaged - and I tell myself in the days that follow that I will stop drinking.

The reason I start to drink again is that by the time Thu comes around, I feel good again - and I forget everything I’ve told myself earlier in the week.
A little voice tells me that “this weekend, you’ll control it”. But I can’t, because as soon as that first drop touches my lips - it’s over for me. 

Over the course of those 2 to 3 drinking days I will usually consume: 12 to 18 beers, 2 to 4 bottles of red wine, 1 to 1.5 litres of spirit (vodka or whisky). 
I like to drink alone at home, I sometimes hide my drinking from my wife.

This has been going on for 5 years. 

Here are the problems it causes me:
1. Financial 
2. Motivation to exercise
3. Motivation to complete life admin
4. Performance in my job
5. Mood (shorter fuse, mild anxiety)
6. Impaired motor skills
7. Dry cloudy skin 
8. Weight gain
9. Serious crippling hangovers
10. Bad sleep

I could list more, but you get the idea.
I fully and completely recognise my situation, the problems it causes me and ultimately what I need to do. 

However, and here is “The question”: 
Despite all that I’ve acknowledged and recognised above, why when it gets to Thursday can I not prevent myself buying and drinking alcohol? Why (in that moment) am I blind to the problems, pain and damage it causes me?

I’m sorry for the long post. 
I wanted to provide context as I’m really keen to hear from those that have been on (or are still on) similar paths.

It’s the longest I’ve gone since October, so I’m definitely proud of myself in that respect.

Towards the end I was drinking 4 or 5 times a week, on average, and going through 3-4 bottles of liquor a week. Finally realized I was fucking my future, my friendships, and pretty much every aspect of my life over. Made the decision to go back home instead of staying in my college town over the summer to get sober (much easier in my home state than my college one, as I have a place that doesn’t ID in the latter).

I’ve still used weed since I quit, although my ultimate goal would be to stop that as well. But my main goal at the moment is to stop drinking for the time being, as that is by far the most destructive of my habits. The thing is, I’m realizing nothing can compare to the feeling of relief alcohol provides, and it’s hard for me to stay committed to not drinking as a result.

My goal is to make it until mid-August without drinking, and if I decide to continue with this past then it will definitely require a lot more effort. It’s hard to accept that I’ll have to go to AA meetings (or something similar) to prevent myself from relapsing. Not to mention the social events I’ll have remove myself from to ensure I don’t drink. Thinking about how I won’t get to have that 21st birthday experience, etc. if I continue to not drink also eats away at me, even though I know a stable life is far more valuable than that.

The 20 days felt amazing! I am thankful to have caught myself within a couple of days of breaking sobriety and excited to get to day 30 - then 60 - then 90 - and more. 

My question is if anyone has advice or experience on how to handle chasing a relationship that ended due to alcoholism, but you are now in recovery and feeling confident you are not going to break sobriety again? 

Long story short, I am M/32 who was in a relationship with F/36 (single-mom) for the past 2.5 years. Serious, committed relationship, with tons of attraction from both ends - physically and emotionally. Strong compatibility. I have had several alcohol related embarrassments in the past, but never really cared for it as those were in partying moments primarily, until a few months ago when I really admitted moderation might not be for me as the embarrassing moments were starting to sneak into my relationship and career. Then, fully decided that sobriety is the only life-style choice I want to pursue about a month ago due to another alcohol episode leading up to my break-up. Alcohol is simply not for me. I have been going to therapy for years, have a life-coach with daily check-ins as of a month ago, was sure I was going to stay sober, and just when my ex-girlfriend started seeing signs of improvement and started getting closer to me, I relapsed. Lied to her I had relapsed at a dinner earlier this week, which of course was caught as she could smell it, and she has distanced herself again. It was demoralizing that I had exactly what I wanted due to not drinking and I still decided to drink alone as soon as I got comfortable. Overall, I guess it had to happen sooner rather than later if I was to make lying a habit. 

Now, I am back on day 3 again thankfully - this time, taking it even more seriously, and understanding I have to remind myself of this disease of alcoholism everyday. I also have to seek sobriety solely for myself.

Feeling confident in long-term recovery, can I still chase the relationship while recovering for myself alongside, or is that a lost cause?

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This is my first sober holiday. Well.... I guess that *technically* was St. Patrick's Day. But, that was the first real day of shutdown here, so I was busy kicking old lady ass,  grabbing the last rolls of toilet paper at Target, preparing for the upcoming apocalypse. I didn't have time for green beer.

No... today is the first holiday I am spending sober. What many call the first day of summer. Last year, the weekend prior to Memorial Day, we helped our friends move into a new house. With. A. Pool. They had a housewarming party the following weekend on Memorial Day. All their family, all their friends. And me. Now, these are two of our closest friends, my drinking buddies. I've become friends with their friends. I've drank with both of their Dads and brothers, uncles, etc. That day, as always, I pre-gamed at home prior to heading over to the pool party. Drank vodka in the basement while my wife was getting ready. By the time I had my first couple of IPAs poolside, I was half in the bag. It wasn't long before I was in full blackout and having to have my wife load my ass up and get me home before further embarrassing myself, and her.

I tell that story for two reasons.

One: to show that it still took TEN MONTHS of nights, weekends, events, and dinners like that before even trying to stop drinking. I hated that guy, but I couldn't shake him. Anyone with a bit of common sense would have. But, common sense sometimes can go out the window when you have problems with alcohol. Why did I have to have 10 more months of days like that before trying to quit? YOU HAVE TO WANT TO. And, I finally did.

Two: to show that once you want to, it is possible for anyone to quit. Today, and everyday for the last 105 days I made the choice not do drink. I didn't have to quit drinking, I WANTED TO. I want to spend today not drinking. I'M EXCITED to spend today not drinking. By choice.

Today I could go to a pool party and enjoy myself. I could have fun talking to everybody, and remember the conversations. Today I could go to a baseball game, sit out in the sun and enjoy every inning and NOT embarrass my wife. Today I could do yard work and grill out and not be too hung over to do anything, or worse yet, be to drunk to do anything. Today I could go pay my respect to my two WWII veteran grandfathers graves and make them proud.

Today I will enjoy Memorial Day.

What are all of you doing on this Memorial Day?

December 8 2012, I joined AA, and lasted 60 days.  

April 8 2013, I quit again, and this time it stuck. That was 2,603 days ago.  

Every 100 days, I come back to r/stopdrinking, and offer some words of encouragement, and commit to another 100 days of sobriety. This time I thought i might try something different.

I've made it a month once before, but now, every step past 30 days is a new record for me. And I am feeling particularly proud of, and protective over these days. 

It has given me many gifts, like peace in my home and in my own mind. And it may have saved my life. 

About two weeks ago, I started feeling not well. I've spent a lot of time not being in tune with my body, and pushing through physical or emotional discomfort, ignoring pain and exhaustion... Why I honestly don't know. And alcohol used to really help me do that. 

I ended up in the ER last Friday, after a week of feeling like absolute hell and before I knew it was whisked away into emergency surgery and a two day hospital stay.  My gallbladder decided to stage a coup. Words like ""blockage"" and ""massive infection"". 

Granted, in a sober state it still took me a week to let my husband take me to the hospital. But I'm certain it would have been worse in several ways had I still been drinking.... 

My partner remarked when I got home (not allowed visitors during the pandemic) how grateful he was that I had stopped drinking when I did because odds were good that I would have used alcohol to help me ignore that pain too... He is right. And I shudder to think what condition I would have been in if I decided to white knuckle through that over the weekend or longer...

This journey into sobriety also gave me the presence of mind and sense of caution to decline heavy duty pain meds. Which I think might have been the third best decision I've made in 33 days, next to putting down the wine and agreeing to get in the car when my husband insisted on driving me to the hospital. 

Coming home after that, sitting with my loves on our back deck, in the sun, dog at my feet, not in pain (or at least in far less and substantially different post surgery pain haha) made me realize how grateful I am to be able to experience all of this. And experiencing it sober lets me take in so much more of it all.... 

Anyway. I wanted to share my little victory, the gifts I've found this past month and one hell of a wake up call. 

I find so much support and encouragement here. This group is a huge part of why tomorrow's going to be 34 days. Stay awesome, y'all.

Me: I’ve never smoked a cigarette before.
Him: Ummm. Yes you have.
Me: No. I haven’t. I don’t smoke.
Him: You smoked every night with me that one summer. You don’t remember, do you? 

Guys. I’m dumbfounded. I have absolutely NO recollection of smoking. Like, I can’t even force myself to recollect those moments. How crazy is that. I was blackout drinking. And then driving home from his place. Every. Single. Night. For. A. Whole. Summer.

What made me prevent a big mistake? I don't have any major words of wisdom to share except for the fact that I cannot keep making the same mistakes and expect my life to improve. I am behind in my career, my health, my overall life goals. How am I ever going to achieve success and peace of mind if I keep taking the easy way out? My overall long term health and success is much more important than getting drunk for a few hours. It's that simple. I am a realist. I know that I might never achieve my goals, but I want to be able to honestly say that I tried. If in 5 years I am still not satisfied with my accomplishments, I want to at least know that I really did put in an effort to change and was just unlucky. Rather than knowing that I have not been successful in life because I keep choosing to give up and take the easy road.",81,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4826588}"

Metastatic breast cancer, she’d fought it for 12 years and it finally won. It took her very quickly at the end. I was able to be with her when she died, and as hard as it was, I’ll always be grateful I had that opportunity and she didn’t die alone in the hospital. She died very peacefully, holding my hand, and I’ll always be grateful for that too.

I’m executor of her estate, which has been an overwhelming process. I’m all alone out here. I came to her condo the day she died and saw she had a bottle of vodka and another of vermouth on the mini bar. (She very rarely drank but she kept alcohol in case she had guests.) I wasn’t tempted but I poured them both out immediately just in case. (I used to be a vodka girl.) While clearing out the cabinets under her mini bar yesterday, I found several sealed, dusty bottles of liquor. I poured those out too. I didn’t want them either. I just wanted them gone. I didn’t even want to risk a chance for temptation. Tbh the thought of drinking turned my stomach. The smell of the alcohol was revolting to me.

I’ve been drinking sparkling water when I get stressed and staying busy clearing out her place. I’ve been so busy I haven’t had a chance to really grieve or process the fact I watched my aunt die. Today I packed up a few more of her things and now I’m finally taking a break. I’m going to rest, and read, and cry if possible, and remember my aunt. I’m going to be grateful for sobriety. I wouldn’t have been able to accomplish even half of what I’ve done had I decided to put those bottles to my lips.

I’m lonely and sad and not sure what I’m looking for with this post. Understanding and support, I guess. I haven’t been able to feel much yet but I know those intense feelings will hit eventually. I do feel some pride in knowing I made the right choice when it came to alcohol. I don’t know what happens when we die, but if my aunt can see me, I hope she’s proud too.

I’m 30 years old and have struggled with alcoholism for many years. I seem to have this “all or nothing” mentality with a lot of things in my life, and alcohol is definitely one of them. Last night I went to a friends house for a birthday and brought my La Croix because I knew everyone would be drinking and I didn’t want to. As the night got later they started pouring shots to cheers for his birthday and I gave in and had a shot. Then a beer. Then several cocktails in a very short period of time because my friend offered for me to stay the night so I had to play “catch up” with everyone else. Long story short, I woke up this morning on the floor of my friends house and a severe limp. I called a friend who was also staying the night to see what happened and he said I fell and then passed out. I’m so ashamed and embarrassed of myself. I don’t know why I’m like this. My mom divorced my dad when I was 6 because he chose alcohol over his family and now he has cirrhosis and diabetes from drinking. I’m so scared that I will end up the same. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I feel so powerless over my addiction. I’m choosing to not drink anymore. The longest I’ve been sober in the past decade was 30 days. I rewarded myself at the 1 month mark with a 6 pack. I can’t do this anymore. Today is the day I choose to take power over my addiction and not let it run my life anymore.

I recently relapsed and am wanting to get back to being serious about my sobriety. Open to advice!

Some of the tactics I’m using:
- “play the tape” of horrible times to remind yourself why you want to stay sober.
- calling a supportive person in your life when you feel the urge.
- opening up about struggles with alcohol (this is something I used to actively talk about, but over the past few years I got too comfortable and confident with my sobriety).
- listen and connect with others 
      - not a huge AA fan, but also not opposed to it. So I’m attending zoom meetings.

Weird experience with a spirit, can anyone relate?","Evening from Scotland. I'm a 1 litre a day vodka drinker and this morning when I finally got up feeling a bit rough I had a weird experience. I felt the spirit of someone I know in my kitchen (still living) embrace me and this encouraged me to pour out the last of my vodka and go about my day differently.

I had a similar experience around my 31st at the end of last month when I distinctly felt this same spirit come up behind me (after having some unusual focused thoughts about going to her for help with the drinking) and got the impression a hand was placed on my shoulder. I feel like I'm being helped in some way.

So this morning I poured out the last of the litre bottle then cleaned up my flat and self for 2 hours and transferred all my funds over to my partner who lives in England. I have plenty of food, electric, gas etc. And really do not need the cash at present given how dangerous my drinking is. I don't know why but when I've transferred cash away from my own account (and so booze habit) it helps me significantly. It's a boundary of sorts. I cheat a bit whenever I get paid, but on the whole it's a helpful strategy for me. I know it sounds a bit crazy, but, the drink situation itself be crazy. I cannot sustain living like this.

Literally every single one. Isn't that strange? It's like none of us want to be living this way, but we all continue to..

For example, look at the daily newcomer posts in here.. everyone is like ""Fuck, enough is enough! I hate this! I have to stop!"". Alcohol really is an addictive, fucked up drug. It's so manipulative because it's friendly as fuck and everywhere you turn. Sometimes I wonder if the government made it legal just to keep us addicted to it and avoiding actually sitting down and thinking about how fucked up shit is, or how fucked up the standard of living has become.

This first week has been a bit difficult, but pretty manageable and I've learned a lot already. I went to a few meetings for the first time (big deal), even letting myself indulge in sweets and shitty food, but I'm hungry all of the time (I think my stomach shrunk from only consuming half a meal a day and a shit ton of vodka so I could ""save calories and get drunk faster""). I'd say the only downfall so far has been the insomnia. I'm awake most nights, facing lots of my lovely childhood trauma. Ugh.

And finally, my favorite quote about alcoholism, and a few of my favorite pieces of advice from this week on this sub, r/crippilingalcoholism, r/dryalcoholics , and r/alcoholicsanonymous

Favorite quote; ""I'm an alcoholic. I don't have one drink. I don't understand people who have one drink. I don't understand people who leave half a glass of wine on the table. I don't understand people who say they've had enough. How can you have enough of feeling like this? How can you not want to feel like this longer? My brain works differently.""

Advice from fellow redditors;

""I learned about a thing called H.A.L.T early on when I first quit drinking: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired. When cravings hit, ask yourself those 4 questions. Are you hungry? Angry? Lonely? Tired? Most of the time you *are* feeling one of those things and addressing whichever thing/multiple things it is, often solves the craving/problem.""

""Remember that you still felt like this after 10 beers a night, and didnt feel any better. ""

""Playing the tape forward, and realizing nothing cool ever happens by drinking way past a normal amount... I just wake up fatigued, feeling like death.""

""Every time I miss alcohol, I remind myself that's the addicted part of my brain talking. Because I don't want it - so how can you possibly miss something you don't want?! My brain's dopamine wants a hit of what's familiar, but the logic part of my brain knows better. Learning the chemistry of my brain really helped.""

""There is no shame in wanting to drink. It's normal...its an addictive substance. Just notice it and let it pass.""

""Maybe the boredom is painful, but who cares. The drinking is painful too.""

""I just remind myself that alcohol never added anything to my life. It only took things away.""

On May 10th I finally hit my bottom and had a psychic change starting that day and I started my sobriety the next day, May 11th. I now realize that when even a drop of alcohol enters my system a million more drinks is never enough, and it affects me by turning me into an uncontrollable monster who hurts the people I love. I got drunk a few days before I got sober and tried to kick my husband's uncle, who has been living with us for 9 months, out of the house with no place to go. Well, that backfired. I ended up being the one with no place to go. I was kicked out of my own home (temporarily) and terrifyingly but by the grace of God I drove two hours in a blackout to where my family lives. I didn't get hurt and I didn't hurt anyone, thankfully. My sister shut her door in my face, my Dad shut his door in my face, and my best friend shut her door in my face (but not without plying me with more alcohol before sending me on my way with no place to go).

That is when the psychic change happened. That was when I realized that sobriety for me can't just be for a short time and then again after a ""relapse,"" but it must be forever or I will lose everything and die. I am an awful and horrible person who does and says things that I normally wouldn't when I imbibe in alcohol. My husband took me back after deciding whether or not to leave me, and things are really awkward in the house with his uncle. My husband and I have a strong and deep love which I am grateful for with all my being, but I'm afraid he wrestles with similar demons that I do and he can't help himself from bringing alcohol into the house. I know I never want to drink again, I have a sponsor, I'm going to Zoom meetings, and I've begun working the 12 steps harder than I ever have before. I had a toe dipped in the AA pool before and now I have fully dived in. With all that, I still don't trust alcohol being in my house right now because at the very least it makes me uncomfortable and triggers me. Despite all the drama right now, I've felt much better in the past 14 days than I have in years.

I don't want to be a drinker anymore. I can't stop being an alcoholic, but I can work my program and meet God halfway (if I ever find my own conception of God and stop feeling icky using that term). The things that are helping me so far are: 1) Sparkling water (Topo Chico is the best!). 2) Not talking to anyone in active addiction or anyone who is a toxic person in my life. 3) Talking to three sober women a day and my sponsor. 4) Going to a (Zoom) meeting every day. 5) Meeting with my sponsor once a week. 6) Attempting to remember who I was and how happy I was before my drinking started 13 years ago. 7) Attempting to figure out who I am now that I'm not drinking and how to be happy one day at a time.

I went 55 days in the Fall without drinking. I then thought one drink wouldn’t hurt. I thought that because I had broken the cycle of drinking everyday that I could control it better. And you know what, at first I did! It was false affirmation that I could keep it under control. At first I would drink one night and then go a week without. 

I started to make rules again in my head. I was allowed to drink one night a week. Usually a weekend. Slowly that became Friday, as soon as I could. But then Saturday would hit and friends would be getting together so I changed the rule to two days a week.

Then I would have a hard work day and because drinking makes me tired and a little down, it was so easy to just say eff it and drink on one of the other days too. 

Here I am almost 6 months later and I am back to drinking a bottle of wine every night. I have mini periods where I decide I am going to stop but I can’t get past three days. THREE DAYS! and if I’m being honest, I am always so proud of myself after those three days because it feels like a huge accomplishment. But It’s only three days!!!

Last night I went over board. Restrictions are starting to lift in our area and a couple of friends came and distanced in my back yard. I didn’t want to run out of wine for everyone so I ordered a bunch of bottles. We drank almost all of it.

I woke up with so much shame. I hate this. What is it going to take for me to just surrender. I don’t want to do this anymore. I need to figure out a way to get through all the moments of weakness though. If someone offered me a drink right now it would be a resounding no but what about 4pm two days from now? How do I continue to carry this same resolve in that moment. All it takes is one moment for this whole thing to go out the window again and find myself back in this guilt ridden head space.

 Yet I'm fighting the feeling to be so sad. This past month has been easy and felt natural.  Why the fuck did I get stuck for over 20 of my best years? Why don't I have more everything by now? How did I get stuck for so long!? I could have easily had grown up kids by now, maybe even grand kids on the way. I could have retired by now with the money I've made and be living the dream instead of still driving myself so hard to work more.

 I wish I could go back to 20 year old me and beat the living shit out of him. I wish there was a way to go back and start over from that point.

 Jesus though, decades that accomplished so little and are hardly even remembered when it turns out quitting drinking was so easy all along. That's fucking sad.

My days consisted of going to the store, even in this lockdown - and getting beer, wine or whatever felt like a good idea at the time. And I'd be stressed in the store. Will 8 tall cans be enough for tonight? How about a few shots as well? I better buy milk and bread as well so the store clerk doesn't think I'm just here for alcohol, after all, it's a lockdown.

Today I'm drinking cold Coke Zero's in the garden, reading a book and I'm not as stressed. Sure, I feel groggy and my brain will tell me it's a good idea to drink this evening or tomorrow, or the next day. I'm prepared. I've been here on Day 0 many times before and always ended up drinking again by Day 4 or 5. So I'm not saying I've got this.

I’m male and now 27 years old and just wanted to let anyone who is in the early stages of the journey or struggling to maintain their resolve know that if you persist and stay disciplined, one day or one weekend or one social event at a time, you’ll get better and the urges will eventually be so rare and weak that you hardly notice them. I still occasionally get very mild urges, but literally just think about them and almost laugh at my brain and that’s it.

I can wholeheartedly say that stopping drinking alcohol was the best decision I made and would implore you to stick to it. Life gets better when you can’t hide from your problems and have to sort them out. Being sober makes that a lot easier to do and with time and work those previously insurmountable problems will be resolved. Also not having to deal with the aftermath of a heavy binge (as was always the case with me) is beautiful and leaves your mind and conscience with more time to enjoy life and improve things.

I never really liked drinking but since I was stuck at home and didn't have my other vices, I would get mildly drunk every 3rd or 4th night at first to kinda celebrate. Usually play online PS4. 

But for about a month now I've been getting pretty drunk every single day. Some days ill start drinking after a few hours awake. I wanna give it up so I can go back to my positive stuff, I felt happier then. I haven't even worked out in like a full week now. 



Problem is I wake up feeling like this but the withdrawal if you call it that makes me really depressed, I think a lot of negative thoughts about myself and my life. I feel really low energy. I don't know what to do besides just lay there thinking about how all this goes away with a drink. 

So for those of you who changed, I'm really looking for some kinda motivation that can help me get through those first few days until I start to level out again. I don't have that huge of a habit with it it's only been this last month. I don't want it to become one though. Please give me some reassurance that if I stop and get through a few days of being bored and feeling low energy that it'll come back again.

He was losing control of his bowels, literally pissing and pooping himself during the day. And all my aunt was saying was “I don’t think he’s going to last much longer.” It is difficult to get sober and stay sober not only because of not drinking but also because eventually you will have to separate yourself from enablers. And I know from experience that there are people who don’t give a damn if you live or die. My aunt told us yesterday that he had died, my sister told me today that he had actually died today. My aunt couldn’t be bothered with people blowing up her phone. The truth is she had already counted him as dead, probably years ago. People who see you have a problem and enable you have already counted you as dead. This is just another story of what drinking can lead to. He was an alcoholic but he was a kind man and I really wish that I had been in a position to help him because I know there were things in his life that he needed to dealt with. I did not drink today and I hope you’ll join me. If you’re struggling with relapsing please I urge you to consider who you call your friends. Do they know about your struggles?

I have been right on the edge waiting for the fates to cut my thread.  I was really good at finding something cynical to voice in all situations.  I was taunted by that voice and I used liqour to silence or become one with that voice.  My intuition was in shambles and the whole world was against me.  And you know what.... I was right!  My entire experience gets filtered through me.  I chose those thoughts that lead to actions.  I chose those actions, even when I got to reflect after...it was me who did it.

The point I wanted to release is that the same affects are in play right now.  I am not a religious person, but having walked through my own hell;  I would continue to be ego driven if I didn't atleast admit I am spiritual.  That part of me is growing everyday.  It all started with a positive spin.  That lead me to a new voice.  One that guides and nourishes me.  In many moments all day long.  This new perception given me compassion for people in my life.  It's opened my eyes to all the beauty I wake to each morning.  Everything that melts my heart and keeps me alive inside has been here from the start!

It's me.  It's always been me.  My higher power recently has been my future self.   My higher power was my meeting folks, but I'm all alone at home being safe.  I have me, my future self with completed goals and growth from failure.  He has the wisdom to inspire the proper intuition in the moment for life to work out ok.  I have wants and needs and neither of the can be satisfied with out proper communication.  I have to think before speaking, and it's hard!  Taking 10 seconds to formulate a proper response has turn my nightmare job into a dream job.  I wanted this when I was a teenager dreaming of the future. It just took proper eyes and emotional control to realize it.

""You are living the good life"" - fellow over worked cohort.

This hit me hard....  Because I am.  That taunting voice is telling me it's going to be over soon... It can't last.  The other side is louder and says I worked hard for where I am and I deserve to give my family more!  Those voice are both right.  I've tested this before.  One drink can take all of this away.  This is the hardest and easiest thing I've ever done.  All I have to do is give, stay positive and have faith, my future self will continue to guide me to heaven on earth.

I use a phrase and it reminds me of canting monks in a video game.  When reality happens and I find it to be lucky or fortuitous, I respond with a ""thank you."". (side note: I had a hard time expressing gratitude).  When I need a little faith, or a reason for an event, I say ""blessed be"".  Doing that as crazy as it sounds, has helped me accept what's happened.  Acceptance calms me down, gives me an out so I can move on.

I didn't mean for this to get so long.  I could keep blabbing too. Thank you for reading!  Be safe out there!  You can be sober and live an amazing and fun life!  It's really everything I could have hoped for and more!  I am truly a lucky man.  I bet there is that inside you too!

I've always been known as a heavy drinker, and I've made a fool of myself plenty of times; but I never had a crystalizing moment of ""I need to stop this"" (or if I did, I ignored it). 

Well -- I landed myself in the hospital with severe dehydration and withdrawal symptoms after a 4-day bender last month. I sweated. I shook. I heard things. I sweated some more. 

The doctors told me that my liver was okay, but I've suffered nerve damage: I have alcohol-induced neuropathy. It's not debilitating right now, but it will only worsen if I continue to drink. I'm 28 years old. 

Lying trembling in that hospital bed, hearing that news, that was my crystalizing moment. That wasn't my only bender, or my longest. I'm probably lucky that I got away with ""only"" mild neuropathy. My nerve function is supposed to improve over time, but I won't get back all the days and nights I forgot, or the dumb things I did, or the chances I missed. But that doesn't have to be my whole life; it doesn't have to be the whole *me*.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

First off: Can we get a round of applause for my friend, ALL of our friend, [u/Cheebyl](https://www.reddit.com/u/Cheebyl/) for doing an incredible job hosting last week? Maybe toast her with a cup of coffee? I knew we could!

Secondly: This is my first time hosting the DCI, so please no catcalls or throwing rotten tomatoes, I've got some big shoes to fill after last week and with all the seasoned veterans who host week in and week out.

When I stopped drinking a little over 3 months ago, like everybody (or at least most, I would guess) I was scared shitless. The first 2-3 weeks were tough. **ALL** I could focus on was simply not drinking. Not any other tasks, just not drinking. After that, I got really excited about not drinking. I was like a kid with a new shiny toy! I was just so proud and happy to look at it and play with it. Now I didn't have to exert all of my energy trying to get out of the mud, I could actually *enjoy* some things. I was bouncing off the walls with new energy and and an excitement I haven't felt in, I don't know... forever.

My problem was, that feeling went away. Some call it a Pink Cloud. I'm not sure I've experienced that, because at the same time I was still struggling through my daily life trying to make sense of everything else. I was bummed when that shiny new feeling disappeared. But, it was at that point that I realized I could deal with real life a little better. I could deal with calling the vet when something was wrong with our dog. I could call the furnace repair guy when our furnace stopped working on a cold day. I could deal with the idiots (sorry, I mean wonderful coworkers) at work.

As much as I missed the shiny new toy of sobriety, I really dig the ability do ***deal***. It kind of feels good to finally be an adult and do all the adult things now that I am not in a blackout cloud anymore.

Did anyone else feel this way sometime along the line? Where are you in your ""shiny toy"" of sobriety?

It's more because I *don't* have a serious problem, but have good reasons to quit anyway. If you're on the fence about it, maybe this will be helpful. 

I guess I thought I'd embark on an experiment to see if hedonism had anything to offer. I never really drank much before, but I was kind of frustrated with some things in my life and wondered if there was some viable alternative in pursuing pleasure and not giving a shit about anything. It didn't really work out. All the things that I'd hoped would be better while drunk or buzzed were the same or worse. I actually kind of like hangovers (/r/hangovereffect), or at least the aspect of the hangover where my mind is actually quiet for once. The occasional sleep paralysis is interesting too. I don't really like any other aspect of it.

I brewed my own alcohol, so it didn't really cost anything significant. But it was almost always vile and gag-inducing. Can't recommend it. My drinking was probably something north of moderate, but wasn't anything crazy. I never had blackouts or withdrawals or anything.

Nothing terrible happened. I drove kind of drunk-ish a couple times, without incident. I vomited a few times. I pissed on the Roomba and broke it (why?). Bent my glasses, badly bruised my toe. Mostly I just did nothing. I gained probably 15 pounds. Fuck that. It's not that much, but I don't like looking in the mirror and seeing puffy eyelids and a growing gut hiding behind my shirt. I used to be fit.

Mostly I'm tired of expecting something enjoyable and just getting the same boring shit again.

I got sober for about 18 months after a very dark time in my life. It felt so good and normal for a while. I left my partner of 7 years, which I still feel complicated about. Shortly after this decision I began drinking again. It felt like I finally had some autonomy in my own life. 

At first, I kept it together. I kept up with the fact ""I'm not a big drinker,"" I wouldn't drink alone and could casually have a drink here or there. I felt like I was on top of it. Then of course as we all know, COVID-19 came and changed everything. I went into intense depression and self-medicated completely with weed and alcohol. I've been working from home and isolated. Over the last month I've had at least 1-2 drinks every day, and within the last two weeks I've been drunk every night. I'm catching it early enough though. I've been through this before, I've watched how alcohol has destroyed me in the past.

I haven’t had 30 consecutive sober days since I was a junior in high school (so about 12 years). I want to thank this sub for helping me particularly through the first few days. Y’all are awesome and inspiring, and I would not have been able to get to this point without your stories, words of wisdom, and reflections. 

I posted about halfway through when I hit my longest sober streak in a long time and someone asked me if I planned to extend my sober time once I hit 30 days. I told them yes, and that is still my intention. For now, I plan to make short goals, the first being another 15 days. Eventually, I hope to moderate, but I know I’m not there yet. My view of alcohol has begun to shift, but I need more time.

I want to share what’s happened over the past 30 days, because reading things like this from others has helped me. So, over the last 30 days:

- I lost 8.4 pounds, about half of which I attribute directly to eliminating 1000 calories of wine per day from my diet. Another bit I attribute to my ability to workout twice a day, because I wasn’t hungover in the morning

- My face has finally “de-puffed” (a combo of weight loss and no alcohol) and I feel like I look like me again!!!

- I faced my absolute biggest fear, the thing I used alcohol as a crutch for more than anything: I voice chatted, and then Skyped, with a new guy I met (yet another thing to thank Reddit for lol) absolutely sober. A bit over a year ago, I went through a traumatic breakup with my fiancé, and dating was just the worst. Every single first date I *HAD* to pregame. I thought I wouldn’t be funny or interesting if I wasn’t already a bit tipsy before I got there. I actually managed to talk to this guy the first few times sober, and so now it feels normal and I don’t even have the desire to drink before we chat

- I still say plenty of stupid stuff when talking to people (like aforementioned guy), but at least now I can just cringe at the dumb things I said and hope they forgot about it, instead of not remembering or having to ask what I said because I was drunk. It’s a weird win, but still a win

- My rosacea has almost completely gone away. The crazy expensive whitening/red-reducing makeup I had bought last year is now saved for when I inevitably get sunburned this summer

- Speaking of my skin, it’s almost completely cleared up of zits, and my acne scarring has never been less noticeable 

- My teeth haven’t been this healthy in a loooong time. Now that I’ve stopped passing out in bed with wine left on my nightstand, I’ve consistently been brushing and flossing every night. I still have some damage that I’ll have to take care of, but it’s crazy how much the consistency has repaired my teeth and gums

- I still have bad headaches, but now I know they’re not just from the hangover, and as soon as I get insurance back I can go to the doctor and work on getting that issue figured out

- My blood pressure has dropped from hypertension stage 2 to just barely above average, and that’s usually only when I’ve had a ton of coffee. Most days it’s juuuust about normal

- The weird head and facial tics have stopped, as have the shaky hands and just the general haze I felt I was living in

- My apartment has garbage AC, and last summer I thought I was going to die from the heat, ran AC all the time and had huge electricity bills, but today my apartment was 75 degrees all day and the only time I cared to turn the AC on was while I was doing my workout! I can handle these temperatures now!

Howdy friends. Short of the long of it I had been a functioning alcoholic for about 10 years, around a 5th a day. I’ve made attempts to stop drinking before, only getting to about day 5.

Anyhow, and there’s more details, but due to cv19 I lost my job, and education. Things were on slim margins anyway so we decided to lose the house and move with her parents on the coast using what savings we had.  Pretty much everything we had built was just given back without any return. Been having more problems adjusting to that than I thought. 

Her parents are “box a piece” of wine, or half gallon a day. Day drinkers that keep beers in the cup holder while they drive. Obviously coupled with what baggage I had this sort of behavior started to rub off on me. Day drinking, blacking out, breaking shit.  I said enough after blacking out the first time.

It was day 3 into it and then she had the dreaded bbq. I was doing fine, on edge, but then her drunk mother started to ask me to drink, “cmon there’s a time and place to drink and I think this is one of them” she knew I was trying to quit. I wanted to use this opportunity moving out here to start anew.  

So i drank.  Got so drunk I fell down the stairs. Two days later i pass out in the shower, rip curtain out of the wall, and drunkingly drove into garage door.

I’m back up to day three and trying everything I haven’t done, and being around drunks like this has put my own drinking in perspective. I think that this one is going to be a good run.

Anyway, they’re having the Memorial Day bbq tomorrow, but I don’t really know how to handle it since they’re not on the same page as me and might not take well to me skipping out on it.  I don’t really know how to handle it because even if I leave the room when the bac gets too high they get pissed

I don’t have a job yet out here, and I know things will be better when I do but I still don’t want to be an alcoholic here starting anew.  If I get kicked out I will be royally fucked.  It seems drinking and breaking shit is better than not drinking. 

Does anyone have any insight on how to handle this?  Maybe fuck off before the BAC rises sooner?  They don’t really seem to agree with what I’m doing...",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5682553}"

I am proud of myself for what I have achieved. These words are hard to write down and to believe, even more. But they are important.

I’ve been struggling with addiction my whole life. Started abusing substance at 13-14. I’m now almost 30, two years clean of cocain and chemicals and more than 3 months alcohol free. 

I’m overweight, I still smoke tobacco and weed daily. I still “need” a red bull from time to time to try and trick me to think I’ve “taken” something at least. I’m disappointed it’s always so hard to part with this side of my identity, forged around rituals and very strong desire to not be stuck with my sober self. 

I’ve been doing trainings for two days and really enjoy it. I knew sports would be a great help in this transition to a better life and better future but it’s so hard to actually do it. 

I feel like everyday I remind myself that it’s not enough, that I’m still an addict, that I can’t claim that I’m healthy or even “normal”.

But f**k. I’ve come a long way. I never even imagined I would stop drinking, never even thought about it as a drug I would want to quit. 

I’ve managed to pay all of my cocain debt in the past two years, stop drinking, drastically change my understanding of my future and what I am working for on the daily. This is huge and I must not forget it. Even though I understand it, feeling it from within and being proud of myself is SO HARD. 

That’s why this group is so helpful to me. I am so proud of all of you, I have to be able to be proud of myself too.

2020-05-23 18:02:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gpdm51/a_long_road_and_read/,A Long Road (and Read),"I only recently discovered this community and I feel so thankful that I did. I have found posts that I relate to, people sharing from a place of authenticity, which seems to be uncommon (while not completely foreign) in my day-to-day life. I have found strength and resolve in this community during these first few days of sobriety (from alcohol). I feel moved to share my own story in the hope that someone else may find truth and understanding.
 
I have been a weekly binge drinker for the better part of 16 years, on average I would say that I drink intermittently, but heavily, on 2-3 days per week over this period. Sometimes more frequent, sometimes less frequent, but constant. For the past few years, I have attempted dry January a handful of times and I was successful once. I have always had the notion that I could stop if I really wanted to and I have tested that thought and considered myself successful after a weekend without drinking. With that sober weekend under my belt, the slate was wiped clean and I could keep doing whatever I wanted (because I was in control).

I have been married now for 7 years to a wonderful spouse who has always been supportive. We have a beautiful 19 month-old child who is nothing short of a miracle. I am fortunate to have found success through in my educational and professional endeavors. I don't share to be boastful, I share these things because I have come to the realization that I do not believe I deserve to *feel* unhappy due to the positive/healthy things in my life. But depression, anxiety, self-destructive behavior, and hopelessness can thrive anywhere if they have the right environment. For me, alcohol was the fertilizer (that feels silly to write, but I'm going to keep it because it feels accurate).

It wasn't until quarantine that my drinking really started to spiral. Everyday, multiple drinks, not remembering the last few hours of being awake, hungover mornings - a viscous cycle (that, frankly, I looked forward to). But mind you, I was still in control. I knew I was still in control because I didn't let myself start drinking before 330pm each day.

After the first few weeks of quarantine sluggishly passed, I recognized that my drinking was getting out of hand - it was beyond where I wanted it to be. I felt like shit.

I decided I would limit myself to 7 drinks (using my own generous definition of a drink) per week and, with the moderation, I would get back on track. Well, I had my 7 drinks the next day and then decided I would deduct some drinks from my next week on the following day. Needless to say, moderation was not working. So, since I was in control, I decided that now actually isn't a very good time to try to limit my drinking - after all, its really the only thing I have to look forward to at the (middle) end of the day.

I had recently started to see a therapist because, in all honesty, I was trying to get a prescription for Adderall. I felt like amphetamines were the only way I could stay sharp a productive at work. It is embarrassing how long it took me to admit that my main reason for seeking out the pills was to counteract the perpetual hangover - I truly did not allow myself to connect the dots.

Two weeks ago my therapist asked me if I had ever considered going to AA (man your battle stations, all personnel on full alert). 

""Well sure, I've considered it, but I don't really want to to go.""
""Why not?""
""Well, I'm pretty sure they would just tell me that I need to stop completely and I don't want to stop completely. My friends drink, my family drinks, my spouse and I enjoy drinking together. Drinking is fun, I'm able to BE MYSELF.""

Be myself.

Wow - I hadn't said that out loud before and it washed over me like a wave. Who am I? Have I really let alcohol define who I am? When did that start? Is the *me* that I have become only a product of the substances I consume?

I'm droning on, but if you're still with me, I will wrap this up soon.

I have always been introverted and these last few questions really triggered some soul searching. I am not just an alcoholic, I am substance abuser in the general sense. I am addicted to controlling my environment, including myself. I have now realized that I have been using various substances to control exactly what, how, and when I feel the things I do. Alcohol just happens to be my tried-and-true, always there when I need it, companion.

About a week ago I finally allowed myself to see the truth. I am not in control and I have let the demons in my life *control me*. That was my first step.

I want to stay sober from alcohol (I can't cut all my vices immediately) as long as possible, maybe forever. I'm walking down that path and I don't know where it will lead, but it has to be a healthier place than where I'm starting from. I'm starting with alcohol, but depression/anxiety/self-loathing...you're next.

For anyone who actually read this far, thank you. I hope that some part of my story resonated with you. Even though I don't know any of you, I feel a sense of support from this community and I hope that I can help others feel the same.

* Walked on the beach, soaked up vitamin D.
* Slept. Holy shit did I sleep this month. More than I have in years.
* Got back into running (to distract/release good chemicals in my brain/listen to music loudly).
* Cut ties with negative things in my life, instead of just drinking and not dealing with anything at all. 
* Really contemplated what was best for me. * This is a big one. When I wasn't at work I was drunk, or getting there. I never had sober time to think about anything. I feel like the longer I go without drinking, the more in sync I feel with my own mind. 
* Made cookies and ate cookies.
* Drank water. I don't know how my brain isn't the size of a fuckin raisin from years of dehydration. 
* Watered my plants consistently. Now we're all hydrated. 
* Started reading. Haven't picked up a book in about 2 years.
* Filled up my sketchbooks whenever I found motivation.

I am struggling to stop drinking and I think it's because I'm surrounded by people who normalise heavy drinking. I'm not using that as an excuse not to stop, but I wanted to share some of the things that have been said to me that make sobriety hard for me.

My dad (an alcoholic): ""It's great to be able to cut back on drinking, but remember, you should never fully stop. Everyone is entitled to a drink and you have to be able to look forward to one.""

My friend: ""Sometimes I wish I didn't drink so much but stopping is not realistic. I'd never want to stop, imagine how shit life would be without it.""

My housemate (after we got onto the topic of alcoholics - she doesn't know I am one): ""I had this friend who was an alcoholic. He went into treatment and he's doing really well now. But god, imagine knowing you could never have a drink again. Never have a fun night out with your friends. I see him at events and he always leaves early.. what a horrible life.""

These statements tend to swirl around in my head when I'm trying to make a plan to get sober. It makes it so hard and I think it's a big part of why it's hard for me to stop.",18,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.66492903}"
2020-05-23 15:54:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gpbetg/my_intro_to_acceptance/,"""My Intro to Acceptance""","“My drinking was not the root cause of my pain, it was only a symptom of the overall disease”.

There’s a lot of wisdom in that quote, but it was some heavy shit to throw at a 24 year old kid fresh out of detox, still shaking like a leaf from alcohol withdraw. Leaving detox btw…it was like I being “re-delivered” into the world, as a grown ass man-baby. I was a lost puppy, bright eyed, bushy tailed and completely helpless. It felt like I was seeing the world for the first time. I now had a whole 4 days without a drink in my system and already I felt like Captain Recovery! Clearly, I was extremely naive to the difficulties that lie ahead.

“What do you mean I need to do more than just stop drinking? Drinking is what caused all of this, that’s exactly how I got here?!”.

That was my initial reaction when the addiction counselor first dropped that revelation on me; “my drinking was nothing more than a symptom of a larger issue, the disease itself”. She was trying to convey that just because I had stopped drinking, it didn’t mean I was cured of my alcoholic tendencies, quite the opposite in fact. “Just because the circus left town, it doesn’t mean the monkey’s off my back”.


It was the wisdom of acceptance that I came to understand gradually….as in years. With 12 years sober now, I still fight the notion of acceptance, typical of a stubborn Taurus, it goes against my very nature. I refuse to read instructions to anything and stubbornly refer to them as “recommendations” . Letting go of the desire to control all aspects of my life is so hard for me to do, but the rewards have always outweighed the effort!

My alcoholism will never disappear. As they say, “Its alcohol-ism, not alcohol-wasm.” I knew there was no cure and so did the alcoholic inside me. Not only would I be living with this disease my entire life, I’d be responsible to manage it every day as well. The same way I accepted that Lyme’s disease will be with me forever is the same way I had to acceptance my alcoholism. It’s coming to the grave with me, and me with it. The gravity of that truth was so much to take on at such a young age. How will life be the same? Drinking is everywhere, it’s involved in everything!


The answer to that question is in the question itself, “acceptance”. With a lot of counseling, meetings, new friendships, more counseling, sponsors, mistakes, learned lessons and time, I began to accept the fact that my brain was just a little different than others. Meaning, I could never drink like a normal person because quite simply, I wasn’t normal.

Accepting I’d have to live with this disease for a lifetime gave me an overwhelming sense of despair at first. It was a stark admission that made me feel like an outcast. My entire life I’ve been looking for acceptance from those around me, mistakenly I might add. How will I ever be accepted by my friends and family now? More importantly, how can I accept myself without alcohol to hide behind?

The pressure was unexplainable, it made me want to die, and I say with zero sarcasm. The thought of not having another drink at a birthday, wedding, barbecue, a Philly sporting event?! I wanted to scream out at the counselor, “Oh hell no lady you can’t be serious?! Oh shit, I see that you are…”. I say this in full sincerity, it seemed like the end of my world to think of future scenarios like that. I did not know how it could be done. In my saturated brain, it was an impossibility.

Not being able to have another drink for the rest of my life? I remember thinking to myself, I’m all for recovery because the help is long overdue, but forever is a long time! The weight of those thoughts alone were almost enough to send me into a downward spiral, with relapse as the bottom floor. The negative thoughts and “stinkin thinkin” used to destroy me. Always believing that I was broken or damaged goods inside.

The questions I’d ask myself were never-ending as well. Why couldn’t I drink like everyone else? Why was I so weak? Why couldn’t I ever just have one, or two, or even three or four? Why does the monster inside me help justify all my bad decisions? Why am I here anymore? What is wrong with me? What’s the point of all this pain? I could go on and on, but they don’t get more positive from there.


Questions like those plagued me every day while I was out there drinking. I just never told anybody…because why would I? If I told someone close to me that I had a drinking problem, I’d risk being exposed. The alcoholic/addict in me was not willing to let that happen, no matter the cost. After all, a smart criminal would never turn himself in! The alcoholic voice in my head kept insisting that he and I still had lots of good drinking to do, and I always believed him!

After sharing my plight with a “wise old owl”, a long time member of the program who was in rehab with me. He said some powerful things that have stuck with me all these years later. Therefore, it’s my responsibility to pass on that knowledge in the same way that someone once passed it on to him.

He said, “J.C., you don’t need to worry about not having a drink at future weddings, birthdays, funerals, sporting events, tmw….none of that.” I looked at him sideways and immediately figured he was fucking with me. He continued, “Truth is, you can’t control that, you can’t control any of it., and trying to do so will be a massive waste of energy. Maybe you will have a drink ten years from now, but hey maybe you won’t. The point is, you can only control the now, the right now, as in this minute”.

Then he asked, “Did you have a drink today J.C.? Seeing as we were both sitting in a rehab lobby together, the obvious answer was no. He said, “exactly, you didn’t have a drink today. Now stop looking into a future you can’t control, live in the moment, appreciate the minute, stay thankful for the day, and then go get yourself another day tmw.”  IWNDWYT",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.66469383}"

Now I feel like it’s time for a new goal. I want to get healthy. I’m miles ahead of where I was last year just because I stopped drinking but I’ve also been compensating with junk food. 

I love ice cream. That is an understatement. I should have bought stock in Ben and Jerry’s before getting sober. I’d be a rich girl today just from my own consumption. 

I eat at least one large bag of popcorn every week in addition to some kind of frozen pizza (during COVID times) or takeout (regular times). 

And this one is the worst. This week, to celebrate my year of sobriety, I bought a cake. A delicious, fabulous Oreo layer cake. Omg this thing was incredible. It was gone in 4 days. 

But I’ve had it. I want to do better. I’m going to have one last hurrah this weekend and eat like I always do over the weekend, not more, just how I usually eat. On June 1st I’m going to meal plan and eat foods that energize me. I’ll still enjoy sweets but maybe try some oatmeal cookies instead of an entire pint of Half Baked. 

I’m really excited about this new phase. After quitting something that nearly defined me for a decade I feel like I can do anything I set my mind to. We’ll see how it goes, just like when I started here. I’ll take it one day at a time and find a helpful, supportive Reddit group.

I a new to this site and can relate to so much of what you all are experiencing.   I had recently gone about 6 weeks without drinking (my first time really trying to quit) and then out of nowhere with no real urge I bought a six pack and drank them at a park while I was supposedly hiking.  Told myself it was a one time thing I could go right back to not drinking.  Up until that day quitting had come somewhat easy.  I felt like COVID19 was a blessing in disguise for me because it took away my favorite bars and with my wife and kids at home all day there really wasn't an opportunity.  Well, that was until I created one.  I think my temptation started when the ""highs"" of being sober started to taper off so to speak.  I started to no longer appreciate how good I felt in the morning, the weight loss had stopped, a good nights sleep was now the norm and not something I treasured like in the beginning.  

Slowly I found myself checking in with acquaintances from the bar.  Just checking in I would say.  Looking back my slip up had been coming on for about a week and I was in denial about what was happening.  Well, the one time has now turned into a 3 week period.  Almost half as long as I had quit.  Just really frustrated when I thought I had this thing under control.  And eerie how quickly all the bad side effects have all come back.  Phone conversations I do not recall, cringing to look at my credit card charges, using text strings to determine when I came home, and the worst being the insomnia and morning anxiety.

So here I sit now venting here when I should be enjoying a long weekend with the family.  Instead I am hiding out in the bedroom feeling shame and anxiety about starting again.  Thanks for to you all for being here and I hope my message can inspire to stay sober.  If not, all the bad things we left behind are more than happy to welcome themselves back into your life.

I'm 25M.

That's the longest I've gone willingly without drinking 

I was on house arrest for a DUI for 30 days so that TECHNICALLY is the longest but I don't count that.

Anyways, I stopped drinking because I didn't like being hungover (who does) and I really wanted to lose this extra ""pudge"" I've accumulated over the last year or so.

I used to starve myself all day to make room for vodka and diet soda, then I would INEVITABLY get the drunk munchies, and consume like 1500-2000 calories in food at night. This led to a 20 lb gain over the past year. 
I have stopped all that but I am snacking more than I ever have. 
Mainly on sweets. 
I was obsessed with Butterfingers and would eat like 4-5 fun sized ones daily.

But the interesting thing is, I have been dropping weight like crazy. Even my coworkers have noticed I don't look so ""puffy"".
I feel amazing and I have also been walking 4-5 miles a day daily.
I've lost 8 lbs in the last 3 weeks or so and continue losing more.

I'm so glad I made this lifestyle change even if it was originally for vanity purposes. I definitely have a problem with alcohol though hence the dui. 
I have tried moderation but after the first drink I get a high that I want to push even further.
It's kinda dangerous honestly.
It's better if I avoid it all together.
Plus, I have also found that I have WAY MORE stamina in the bedroom, which my girlfriend really doesn't mind.
I hope to keep this change permanently because I haven't felt this great in a long time.
In the meantime, I'll have to find healthier swaps for Butterfingers.
I've found that kind bars and fruit really hit the spot. 😊

I started drinking when I was 16, I was at a house party and showed up with a 4 pack of Stella, I think I drank 3 of them and I felt so free. Like I could talk to anybody and say anything, it was great. I carried on just drinking every couple of months but I fell in love with the sensation. I went to a house party later on that same year and consumed more alcohol and experienced my first ever blackout. I didn’t think anything of this, just considered it a part of growing up, but then as I got older alcohol became more involved in my life and I started drinking more frequently, and blacking out more. Saying and doing things that would make me unhappy, blacking out and waking up having no idea how I’d gotten home.  There are a few nights I’ve ran away from my friends and been found screaming at nothing, cutting myself by crawling through hedges and stuff like that. This was not enough for me to stop drinking. Concern from friends and family didn’t stop me. As years have passed by I have come to accept that I do have a drinking problem. I can’t pace myself and I can’t stop. My problem has only been with binge drinking in the past, but now that I’ve been in lockdown it’s really opened my eyes to how abusive my drinking is as though it’s not the first time I’ve gotten drunk on my own at home it’s definitely the most abusive.  It’s really gotten out of control. If there is alcohol in the house and I’ve had one drink, then I must drink everything I can. I will sneak away from my partner and chug cans before I fall asleep if I’m drinking. Last night was the worst night for me, and has finally gotten through to me that this problem is quite serious. I bought 18 cans of lager and 70cl of jack Daniels when I was out shopping. I don’t know why I kid myself and act like I’m going to drink responsibly when I’m justifying my purchase to myself down the alcohol isle at the supermarket. I drank 4 cans of beer and then poured myself a double jack Daniels, then another double jack Daniels, until I’d had about 4 drinks in total. Just before I decided to go to sleep I thought I should have just one more drink to ‘relax’ even though I was already clearly drunk. I went to the kitchen and poured 3 shots of jack into the glass and mixed it with coke. Drank about a third of the bottle in total, Went back to bed and drank it at around 10:30pm. I woke up this morning with a horrific hangover went to the kitchen to find the bottle was completely empty. My girlfriend has told me she found me drinking the bottle in the kitchen at 2 in the morning. I can’t believe I’ve gotten to the point where I’ve drank an entire bottle of whiskey to myself for no reason. I’m disgusted and ashamed of what I’ve become. I want to be so much better. 6 years after starting drinking I’m finally ready to stop. This stopped being fun a long time ago, I can never be a responsible drinker so here I am. The last few years of my life have been peppered with depressing episodes most of which directly relate to me drinking too much and feeling shame. I’m done with it, I want to be happier. I want to make the people who love me and care about me proud. I know this isn’t easy but reading the stories posted here give me hope and inspiration that I can be somebody better and not hate myself anymore.

Everyone was there. I showed up plastered with plenty more wine tucked away in my purse to get me through the evening. I got through presents & cake without making too much of an ass of myself (although I'm sure everyone was keenly aware of my intoxicated state). We decided it would be a nice treat for the kids if we fired up the hot tub. Drinking alllll day plus the hot tub, excellent idea!

By the time we were changing into swimsuits I was at blackout status. Thank god there were other adults around to care for my children (ages 3 & 4). From what I've gathered from my mom, I chugged 2 more mini bottles of wine before going out. That's very scary that even when blackout drunk it does not register for me that I've had enough. 

Shortly after getting in the hot tub with my kids, parents & spouse, I passed out cold. They say I hit my head pretty hard & took a few more nasty falls as my husband pulled me out & carried me in with my kids (worried, crying & confused, without their mom to console them) watching the whole thing. 

Damn, it's difficult to even write that. But I know from personal experience how powerful these stories can be. This was the result of me thinking I could moderate. 

My husband has (understandably) left me. I feel like this may be my last chance to get my shit together.

I've been meaning to find some time to sit down and write this for a while now, but I always felt I needed to be in the right mindset to give it the full attention it deserves - after getting up early, doing my chores, and eating far too much cheese, I feel like I'm in that mindset. Nier: Automata soundtrack on in the background, coffee in front of me, let's go... 

*(Sorry, I've just finished writing this and realised it's a bit of a long read! TL;DR - been through recovery twice - first time in 20s, second time in 30s. Second time around feels different, and you guys are awesome.)*

**140 days sober today**. I last had a drink on the 4th of January 2020 - me and two friends went out for a farewell drink. They were two of the few people who knew that I was planning on stopping, and for some reason it felt like a good thing to do - toast my sobriety with one final drink.

A little bit of a chronological history of my drinking.

**14 years old** \- parents split up, and me and my younger brother move out of the family home with our mum, leaving our dad and older brother behind. It's the first time I really notice any particular drinking in my family - my mum taking a glass of wine to bed with her each night. My parents never encouraged us to drink, but if they felt it was a safe environment and they were around to supervise, they would let us have the odd one here and there. So, when I asked if it'd be OK if I had a glass of wine once an evening every now and then while I studied, she had no problem... Until she started to realise that I was helping myself to more than one glass and she'd come downstairs the next morning and realise that the bottle was nearly empty.

I don't really remember getting drunk back then, or feeling hungover. I must've done - I was a skinny little teenager, so no doubt it would've hit me.

**18 years old** \- head off to university, but only last a couple of months because the course wasn't what I thought it was going to be. Manage to get a late placement on a one year college course where I make some good friends and we start to go out to clubs, bars, etc. I never really had an issue with binges so going on a night out wouldn't necessarily end messily (maybe the odd time here and there where I'd have to make a detour on the way home to throw up in an alley, or decide to leave the club and fall asleep in a bush only to be discovered by a road cleaner the next day). Also came out at gay at this point, and began to explore the gay scene - being a newbie gay, I would have a couple of drinks before heading out to give me a bit of courage.

**21-23 years old** \- I think this is when things began to spiral. I'd gotten a place at a different university, and was living with housemates in the second year. We'd always drunk together most evenings, as I'm sure most people do at university. You're free to do what you want, pretend you're adults, and have extra money coming in that you decide to waste on booze instead of rent. The whole time I was at uni, I'd made friends with someone who I considered to be my closest friend, but without being aware of it at the time, people were starting to distance themselves from her for a variety of reasons, and eventually our circle of friends went from 8 down to 2. I wouldn't hear a bad word said about her, so when people fell out with her, I would take her side. 

In between terms, we decided we would move into a student house together, just the two of us. Long story short, we did, and she used the house as her base of operations for dealing drugs. I've never been into the drug scene, so when my home is filled with strangers who are off of their faces on drugs, my friends have cut off from me because of my association with this one person who I chose over them, all I could do was hide in my room and try to focus on my work. 

This is where alcohol became a daily thing.

On the way home from class, I would stop by the off-license, buy some food, and a bottle of wine. The wine would last the evening, and then the next day I'd repeat the process. 

Eventually I told the landlord everything that was going on, and that night they came round and evicted her on the spot. I was hiding in my room, with the housemate, her boyfriend, and her family all downstairs shouting up at me. Never spoke to her again, and ended up moving into a place where I would live with someone who would end up becoming a friend for life. The drinking continued daily - one bottle of wine a night.

**24 - 26 years old -** Graduated and moved back home, start working full time whilst wondering what I'm going to do with my life. My nightly drinking continues, but this time I need to keep it hidden because I'm back living with my mum and she's clocked that I'm getting through a bottle a night. So to avoid having to deal with her issue about it, I'll keep a glass in my room that I wash out in the bathroom, and hide the empty bottle somewhere until I can dispose of it without her realising. Didn't think of this as too much of a problem.

Around 25-26, I moved into a flat with my younger brother who was in/out of university because of term times, etc. I no longer needed to hide my drinking from anyone because I was effectively living alone for months on end. My routine was the same each night - drive back from work via the off-license, pick up a bottle of wine, and quickly polish it off when I got home. Things got worse when I realised that my brother had left a stock of liquor in the kitchen... once my usual bottle of wine was finished, I would then move onto his liquor. I'd try to be sneaky about it, making sure that any amount of clear spirit I had, I would add that same amount of water back into the bottle to make it look like it was as full as it was before.

Well this didn't work and I eventually started finishing his spirits. I'm sure you can imagine the hangover the following day from a bottle of 14% wine, followed by copious shots of gin, vodka, whiskey, so I ended up speaking to my manager at work to rearrange my shift pattern so that I could start work at 1pm instead of 10am to be able to sleep of the worst of the hangover (I can't remember what lie I told to be able to get them to agree to it).

Fast forward about half a year of this living alone, rarely going out socially, drinking at least a bottle of wine and a couple of shots each night, and wasting the mornings because of how rough I felt. I was in a bad place mentally, and started self harming, which was something I had done since I was a teeanger. This got to a dangerous level because it ended up being a nightly thing. I was so drunk that I was barely able to stand up, and I was using a carving knife from the kitchen. I'm lucky that I didn't slip or do any major damage. 

But this was my turning point. I'd spent an evening drinking and cutting every piece of skin that I could reach, went to the bathroom to throw up (which was by now almost a nightly thing), and then turned around and caught my reflection in the mirror. 

I will never forget how I looked, but I'm grateful for that. It's a visual reminder of how bad things had gotten. I look like I had been in some kind of accident. I didn't look alive. That's the main thing I took away from it. I looked dead - no colour to my skin, red eyes, cuts and blood everywhere. It's still so fresh in my mind. 

I picked up the phone and called my brother in tears. I told him everything, and I remember him telling me to just put the knife down and he would be back from uni soon and we could sort it out.

We always fought as kids, and I couldn't stand him growing up, but that one moment where he was there for me when I needed him changed our relationship.

I fessed up to my manager at work and told them why I actually needed my shifts changed (we were quite close, we'd worked together for years). She was shocked, but she was such a powerhouse of a woman and basically forced me to get some help. 

I went for an assessment with a local council run support group, and went to 2 hour long meetings three times a week (this was their attendance requirement if I remember correctly - if you didn't adhere to it, you lost your place in the group). I was lucky in that I was still working late shifts so I could go in the mornings.  I went to these sessions for six weeks, and then they lessened that amount you had to attend to just once a week, which I continued to do so until I'd been going to the group for three months in total.

I remember feeling like I didn't belong. It was always the same faces there, and we all shared out stories, and I remember hearing theirs and thinking 'Wow, they've really hard a hard life. What do I have to complain about? I shouldn't be here, I'm taking up someone else's space who needs it more than me' Because the way I saw it, I hadn't been through any tragedy or trauma like the people in my group, so why did I deserve to be there?

After three months of sobriety and meetings, I went on holiday with my friend, and the first night there we went to a restaurant and I decided that I now had everything under control. It'd be three months, I'd gotten through it, I was clearly out of the woods. 

I had a glass of wine.

Oops.

**26 - 32 years old (now) -** It was a much slower downfall the second time round. It started off as just the occasional glass of wine in the evening. I'd buy little mini bottles so that I wouldn't be tempted to continue drinking when it was finished (this should've been a sign that I wasn't as in control as I thought I was). 

Every so often becomes every night, and one little bottle becomes a regular bottle, but I feel OK because I'm functioning fine during the day. I'm going to the gym in the morning before work, being productive during work, and building up my social life. I meet a guy, fall in love, move in with him, and he doesn't question my drinking. I even start to persuade him to drink with me in the evenings with dinner, which makes me feel less guilty about drinking by myself.

I knew in the back of my mind it was out of control again, but I didn't want to face it. I'd put the glass of wine down as quietly as possible while I was making dinner so that he wouldn't know I was already two drinks ahead of him. I'd make sure I was the one taking the recycling out to the street so he wouldn't see how many bottles were in there. But again, I figured I was doing OK because I wasn't cutting myself every night and my daily life wasn't interrupted by it.

Eventually, we split up and I moved out, and the reason I decided to move into the place I am in now is because when I came to view the place and meet the housemates, one of them offered me a glass of wine as soon as I arrived and I knew that I would be able to drink without being questioned. 

You'd think that would help me realise how far I'd slipped... that the deciding factor on where I chose to live would be that I could get away with drinking.

It was a boozy household, and there was always wine on the side in the kitchen, so I drink freely and with others. I'd be getting through two bottles of wine a night, of if there were sold out of the wine I'd usually buy, I'd replace it with beer. Sometimes if I was really feeling fancy, I'd drink both! 

I can't really remember what made my turning point was this time round... I think it was a combination of things: deciding to buy wine instead of food because I knew it'd hit me quicker if I was hungry, borrowing money off of friends at the end of every month because I'd run out and couldn't bare the thought of not drinking, hearing the sound of the bottle bin being collected every Monday morning and praying that it didn't wake the neighbours... there was a few things.

I was also single at this point, and alcohol made me feel bold enough to go out looking for some sexscapades. Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights would be spent getting drunk in my room, looking through my phone for people to meet up with, and then stumbling around the streets at 4am to meet them. There's a reason people are up at that time of the night looking for sex - they're drunk or they're on something. At the time, I thought it felt great - I thought this is great, I'm living my best gay life. The walk home each time though was filled with so much self loathing and shame.

I decided to take action after a weekend spent looking for sex and sh\*tting myself on the street more times than I care to admit.

I contacted a support group that was conveniently located just down the road from where I worked. It was a group run by members of the LGBT community who themselves had worked through their addictions and now helped others to work through theirs.

They booked me in for an informal chat, and told me how the place works. Basically you come in once a week for three weeks for a chat with someone to talk about whatever you feel like, and then once you've proven your dedication they'll assign you a key worker to help you work through the issues you have on a one to one basis.

I started attending just before Christmas, and I knew I wasn't going to be able to not drink over the holidays. It was too soon, and I knew myself well enough to know I just wouldn't enjoy it if I wasn't drinking - I'd be bitter of those who were, annoyed at myself, and just miserable. So I decided I'd stop in the new year. I told them my plan at the support group, and they were all for it - why put added pressure on yourself at a time that's pressured enough as it is. See the new year in, and then see how you feel kind of thing. 

Once Christmas and New Years was out of the way, there was nothing left to celebrate. No more socially acceptable opportunities to overindulge. It felt like the right time to stop. I'd been going to meetings, a few people knew about it, and 'new year new me' kinda BS felt cliche but true.

4th of January 2020 I stopped drinking. 

The few days prior to that I'd reduced the amount I was drinking, so that it didn't come as such a huge shock.

I'll try to keep my experience with sobriety short, as the rest of this post has been far longer than I intended!

**Sleep** \- Jesus, my sleep was awful for the first month. It would take me forever to fall asleep, I would wake up continually, and wake up feeling rough. Eventually though, the bad nights gave way to good, and after about a month every night I was sleeping far better than I had in years.

**Nausea and headaches -** The first couple of weeks, nausea and headaches would just wash over me for no good reason. I tried to steer away from painkillers where I could to allow my body a chance to get through it by itself, but after a few weeks they subsided.

**Money -** I never knew I was wasting so much! Whenever I would buy my nightly booze, I would always buy additional food and snacks along side it, mostly so that the regular workers at the store wouldn't see me coming in every night and just buying alcohol. Now that I'm not going out to buy alcohol, I'm not buying all the extra crap that I was too. I've managed to pay off debts and start saving since I stopped drinking, which I was never able to even fathom whilst drinking.

**More social -** I was worried I would be less social when I stopped drinking. I've always been introverted and felt uncomfortable in social situations, and I assumed it would be difficult without drink. Maybe it was just circumstance, or maybe it was a subconscious effort to go out and enjoy life more, but I have never been more social (obviously prior to lockdown...) and I didn't even mind not drinking. The best part I found? When everyone else starts getting drunk around you and the fun starts to lessen, you can just head home, read a book, and wake up feeling fine the next day!

**Alcohol free options are extortionate -** I'll never understand how a 330ml can of Heineken 0% costs the same in a bar as a pint of beer.

I'm not sure how I feel about alcohol free options. There's some times when I just miss that twang on my tastebuds from a glass of wine, and I've explored a few alcohol free options to see if any of them hit the spot - spoiler: they don't. Recently though, I've just seen alcohol free options as a waste of money (for me anyways) - I don't really enjoy the taste, they're empty calories, and I feel like by drinking it, it acts as a bit of a buffer. I'm not sure if buffer is the right word? I guess I mean it's like I can pretend I'm drinking without drinking. But I'm now coming to realise, what's the point in that? 

**Health -** Being clear headed and alert in the mornings has meant I've been able to have harder and longer sessions in the gym each morning. The first month of not drinking, I lost about 3 kilos of weight. I can only assume this was down to the calories from the wine and snacks that were no longer being consumed nightly. I've also managed to quit smoking recently, and I won't lie, but to say that I don't drink, I don't smoke, and I go to the gym 6 times a week really does make me feel quite smug!

**Pride -** I'm so proud of myself. It's not been a huge amount of time since I stopped drinking, but looking back to who I was at the end of last year, it seems a lifetime ago. I was wasting time, money, energy and my life, and through this journey of recovery I've discovered so much more self respect, appreciation for who I am, and pride. 

It's going to be an interesting journey. 

I couldn't imagine my life without alcohol before, and now I can't imagine my life with it. I know it's not going to be an easy ride, and there'll be some bumps along the way, but you guys have no idea how much strength you have all given me. To know that there is an abundance of support and advice in this little community means the world. I only hope I'm able to give it back where I can.

I'm enjoying rediscovering who I am, and I'm finding out that you know what? I'm not bad. The things I used to worry about would make me stand out, I now fully embrace. I don't think I would have come to this realisation if I was still drinking. I can spend my evenings playing video games, watching anime, making artwork, seeing friends, or just enjoying my own company, and that is so fulfilling. I'm excited for what I can do next, and who I can become.

I'll forever be grateful to the people who have helped me through this, and you guys are included in that.

I verbalized the craving to my husband (who was having a beer). He acknowledged my feelings as totally normal and unsurprising given the weather and offered his support. I then went and grabbed myself a can of seltzer and drank that while I read my book. When I finished the seltzer, the craving had passed.

Overall pleased with how the whole thing went and definitely going to remember the strategy for the future.

It’s hard for me to sit with that discomfort but I just have to remind myself that it won’t kill me. My last two relapses have made it apparent that drinking will, however.  Whether it’s falling off a building in a blackout, or suicide during a relapse or getting murdered by a random stranger I met in a bar I am absolutely convinced that drinking will kill me soon.

A powerful motivator is for me to visualise the grief on my sister’s face. She has been through enough and I would never do that to her.

Historically I have a very erratic drinking pattern where I am on the wagon, then I let up a little and start drinking but do so responsibly, until I totally let go and fall completely off the wagon. Which makes me go back on the wagon.

So far I am one week sober and it has not been hard, but this is mainly because I have a little voice in my head telling me that it’s not forever and that I can break my sobriety at the next acceptable social function. In the past I’ve gone completely dry for months so I know I have the resolve. 

But I post on here because I wonder if anybody has experience with knowing when it is time to decide to completely abstain from alcohol? Some of my friends don’t think I have a problem because they know I can stop if I really want to, some other friends know I have a problem and have even said that they are starting to associate me with alcohol (broke my heart).

I can’t imagine anyone ever advocating drinking even in moderation as nothing positive comes of alcohol. It’s literally poison. So the rational answer I know is to give it up and go fully sober. And I want to do that. But I love making a good drink and I love it’s taste, I love having a margarita at a nice bar, and when I drink responsibly I love how much of a great time I have—so the finality of fully giving it up scares me. 

In a year from now I will be in a demanding profession, and although alcohol has never been a problem with respect to my responsibilities, I know it can be a slippery slope. I can imagine when people get in trouble with alcohol on their breath at work they never imagined it would be a problem for them either, so it’s non-negotiable for me to ever put myself in a position where I could somehow do that or be hungover at work. It terrifies me actually.

Im sorry for those of you out there who have struggled with drinking and have had issues at work because of it. I hope you know I mean no offense and am merely trying to be as transparent about my anxieties as I need advice.

UPDATE: thank you all kind people for your thoughtful responses! It gave me a lot to think about, seeing that I’m already 10 days into my sobriety, I have decided to keep going.

Now I’m trying to kick this habit but have no one to vent about over embarrassment.,"Told myself I would never be like the old version of my parents(being huge alcohols for years) and I ended up landing in that boat.

 I was in a super toxic relationship for a year with a best friend of mine for 10+ years. When we started she was downing about 6-10 100 proof nips and got into it because of her ex. I joined the boat drinking lightly for fun with just menthol mgillicuddies drinking a few every couple a days with her.
  She got really really bad and I stuck around hoping to get better but as time went on I started drinking more and more. Eventually drinking every day(I used to hit the bar maybe once a month, very light drinker) We both became daily drunks and said I would never drink Smirnoff nips but I did...one here one there because it was easier. That lead up to me switching 100% to those drinking every day(5-10)
  I gained 20lbs, my face puffed up, I started smoking 2x the amount(almost 2 packs) and I became so lazy. It’s affected work, relationships and I’m doing stupid shit that I would’ve never done before with a 6 figure income at the age of 25. I’ve lost control of myself and never knew how bad it was until we finally cut it off. She stopped getting shitfaced but still drinks a couple a day.
  My dad knows about it and he’s super worried about me knocking up the wrong girl, getting a DUI or worse killing someone. I don’t really have anyone I can talk to about this and I’m not sure how to really handle it. At the moment it seems like one of my main issues is patterns like if I go down the same road to pass the store I go to I cave in or I get bored at home and just randomly decide to go grab some. I’ve seen what alcohol has done to my family, how it destroyed my family(parents got sober 8 years ago) but yet I’m still dragging myself down this road.
  I’m not sure how to break free from the same continuous habits or beating myself up for the shit I’ve done over the course of almost a year. What did you guys do?

My come-to-Jesus moment was 20 years in the making.   As a teenager, drinking and smoking weed was a social sport, a rite of passage- something we were *supposed to do.* This was reinforced for me by older siblings and the alternative scene of the 90s that I was wrapped up in.  By the time I got to college I was a seasoned booze hound.  Still, I kept it enough in check to not stand out too terribly.  I would get annihilated Thur-Sat in the company of friends, but I would mostly temper the habit during the week- enough to maintain decent grades.  After college and throughout my 20's I maintained the weekend binge pattern.   Along the way I landed an awesome job in a fun/interesting place (New Orleans).  There I made great friends and met the love of my life.   We married.   For a while I felt like I was winning in the game of life.

By my late 20s, my wife and I agreed to move near her family in the Northeast US.   When we arrived in late 2009 the economy was super shitty.  Not only did I have trouble finding my career footing, but building a social network and adjusting to 6 months of Winter suuucked.  I was no longer winning in the game of Life.  I felt like Jason Siegel's character in the *Five Year Engagement*.    Eventually with the help of a job recruiter, I landed a decent enough job.  Problem was that the recruiter pumped me up, inflated my credentials- in a profession that is very difficult to ""fake it 'till you make it"".  I was found out.  This killed me.  My ego was battered on a daily basis.  But somehow I managed to not get fired.  Then my wife got pregnant.   This is when my weekend habit snuck into the weekdays.  Things got hard and I gave in.   

By the time kid #2 came around some years later I was a seasoned, functional alcoholic.   Weeknights required 6-10 drinks of whatever I could hide the easiest.  Weekends were a shit show.  My favorite was picking up these cardboard wine boxes that each held approx. 3 drinks.  I would sip one on the drive home from work, saving the biggest and final slugs for the last mile.  By the time I greeted the family, it was the best I felt all day.  I did this for years without pause.  As the years went by though and my tolerance increased, I began to realize I'd be lucky to see 45.  I started having strange body aches, regular exhaustion, and the 3am wake-ups that I just chalked up to some sort of unique insomnia.  Then I found this sub.  It forced me to recognize the destructive behavior and gave me hope that a better life was possible.  

Over the last 16 months, I confirmed to myself that a better life was possible for me, and I'm now so grateful to be living it.   Sure, it's not all roses, but it's pretty darn good.   Stopping drinking has allowed me to connect not only with my own kids (now ages 2 and 5), but has also allowed me to connect with the kid I used to be.   Things that are boring to a daily drinker have become quite fun and thought provoking.   It's like my brain has reconnected wiring that I started dismantling in my teenage years.  

I remember playing flashlight tag on summer nights in the old neighborhood as a kid.  Huddle quietly in your spot in the dark with your friend.  Hot, sticky, and buggy.  Peepers are peeping.  You try to settle your throbbing lungs.  The excitement is almost overwhelming.  Pure, clean joy.  Sober, before it was even a concept in your brain.  For me, those types of feelings have become possible again.  

Sunday morning. Wake up before everyone.  Making pancakes. Listening to my Bob Dylan, or whatever.  My family trusts me.  They can rely on me.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**Coffee (AKA, nectar of the gods) is delicious.**

It’s a peaceful spring morning here. I’m usually found sitting on my deck, holding a cup of coffee.☕

I enjoy coffee as much for the deep, rich color and aroma as I do the feeling of internal warmth brought about with each sip. To me, my morning coffee is a snuggly, warm, fuzzy bear hug in beverage form. 🤗

There are sounds of geese (and peeps of babies if you listen carefully), birds flitting from tree to tree, cranes silently fishing the shoreline, an over-industrious beaver and woodpeckers, frogs, toads, and an occasional ‘plop’ of a turtle sliding off a log. This beautiful surrounding view is accompanied by the crackles of a small ambiance fire overlooking the lake. 

*This is my home. My haven in the woods. My serenity.*

Now, free from the hangovers, the guilt, the shame of ‘why did I do that again’, and the broken promises that I'll never do that again, free from the exhaustion, the fear, the denial of my problem…I can see the beauty in life. There are colors again. There are flavors again. Literally and metaphorically. 

My eyes, my senses, my mind, my thoughts are no longer blurred by the soul sucking, life draining substance that is alcohol. **This is happy. This is JOY** This is how it’s meant to be. 

My hope is that each of you find your home, your haven and your serenity. Don’t stop till you find your sober happy place.

Don’t stop till you [**find your rainbow.**](https://youtu.be/V1bFr2SWP1I)🌈🌈🌈

Hosting the DCI this week has been an honor. To you, all the SD people and community…You are all warriors in the arena! I am proud of each, and every, one of you!!! 

**Just like my coffee, this Life is Delicious.**

Counting out the days on my calendar, I knew I could make a new record if I could wake up sober this Saturday.  I can't believe I'm going to do it. Day 11.  


I really feel no desire to drink, none.    


I had an incredible week-- I cleaned out a storage unit I've had for 3 years and needed to get rid of for just as long.  More importantly, that was my last tie to a person so toxic I don't know how I got so deep with them.  That sort of thing is embarrassing--the way a woman wouldn't want to advertise that her boyfriend is hitting her-so only a few people in my life know how bad that situation was.  The 2 people who really know have my telling me for the past 2 years to cut her off, to put an end to it.  She goes ballistic and stalks me so much whenever I pull back that I thought I could ""manage"" her & reduce my ""punishment"" (I am 35 years old and she is 36, and yes, I get ""punished"" by this person claims to be in love with me? If it were a man who wouldn't take no for an answer and goes to the extremes she does this would be restraining order/LE territory and I'm no fan of LE.)  


I can't believe I did it, it's gone, no more wasted money down the drain every month, and at long last-- zero reason for this person to contact me.  I've worried for years if she would really explode if I cut her off completely, and you know what? She flips out, I'll go apply for a restraining order, humiliating as that will be.  What else does a reasonable person do?  


That's the other 'superpower' I feel like finally being (mostly) clearheaded is letting me do things I desperately need to do. I need to file for --get started filing for- unemployment & pandemic relief, whatever I can qualify for.  I've been so terrified to do it & you know what?  I found a site that seems to walk you through step-by-step & I'm going to do that tomorrow!  


That, and sorting through what I brought back form the storage unit, I'm actually looking forward to! I wish I could have gotten started on the unemployment today but I am beyond beat, physically.  I did 8 miles yesterday & 5.9 today, and 17 flights and today 9 flights, but I FINISHED IT!  It's done & I am free!  


I've always had a rough time sleeping and would actually drink to fall asleep many, many times.  Or I just had to get 'drunk enough"".  I always take a unison, but yesterday I experimented and took only a half, see if I was more energetic in the morning.  Maybe? But not really?   


What else can I expect?  Will I start to sleep well soon (and feeling incredible the next day-- I always feel like I can take on the world & everything is going to be ok when I get great sleep and have a few days off booze)?  I'm female, been drinking unhealthily (alone at home, to even go to bed, or to get through really sad, depressing days and times in life) for ten years, and a real alcoholic for a solid 7-8.    


Thanks so much.  I keep reading about quitting drinking but I feel like my research results have been kinda dark lately?  Saying I might not feel 100% or even great for months, even? Thank you so much.  I think only 1 other person on earth knows what a problem alcohol is for me.

The routine of a daily drink -             G andT, Manhattan, or martini was very pleasurable. What we began to realize was that it had become usually three drinks (free poured) a bottle of wine with supper and later a night cap. We reflect and realize how deep into it we were.

I was fine all day, happy even - looking forward to a date night of takeout and ice cream with the husband and dogs. I went to go get my blood drawn later in the afternoon and fainted unexpectedly (I guess it's never expected) - something that's never happened before to me ever (blood draw or otherwise). I know it's happened to countless people who have gotten their blood drawn, so I wasn't embarrassed at all by it at all and even made a few jokes, but when I was done and back to normal, I just went home and sobbed on the couch.  
   
Nothing was wrong - nothing had changed during the day, and nothing bad had happened - it was like my moon went completely sideways for absolutely no reason, and my gut reaction was just that I wanted to have a drink and be alone.  
I feel sad that after more than 6 weeks without a single craving, even during times that are normally triggering for me, my gut instinct was to think about alcohol when I didn't know what to do or how to feel for a few minutes. I briefly day dreamt about grabbing some wine with dinner to take the edge off - an excuse for feeling stressed out. Kind of makes me feel like my progress in mindset just slipped backwards, even if it was momentarily.

I'm not even sure why I'm rambling. I still am just feeling empty and sad for no reason I can identify. The good news is I won't be drinking, but the bad news is that you just read a bunch of my nonsense because I didn't know what to do with myself right now. :( I'm still going to go get the ice cream though.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.60873896}"

I knew I had to stop and I was almost waiting for an outside stimulus, and her leaving really broke the glass on when to pull the trigger. 

After a few days a coaxed her back with the promise of one last chance and I took that and ran with it.

Alcohol is been a part of my life since I was 18, (I'm 26 now) finding its roots in my many years in the restaurant industry. Had its Ups and downs but I always found myself in a bar slurping away my life on 'my' stool. My depths even led my to incarceration spending 5 months in county jail. 
Quite literally seconds after my release with a shiny new felony record and 30K in restitution owed, I was back at the bar.
With the deeper shame my drinking only compounded on itself.

Some how in the midst of all that self loathing I met a wonderful girl, one that wasn't scared off by all the pain my heart was holding.  We lived apart for the first year or so of our relationship and I was feeling pretty sly living this little double life. 
Moving in together was something I really wanted, but subconsciously I knew it would lead to the end of my daily abuse. I think deep down I really wanted that tipping point to come, to choose which path; I damn sure wasn't going to be able to stop on my own. 
Well that tipping point came on April 20th with the contents of the trunk of my car telling what she had long since suspected.

It has been *hell*, but I haven't let it win and I have dived into a bunch of new hobbies. 
I bought a pressure washer, something about blasting things away is so soothing to me. I also bought a stand up paddle board and have been getting active and stronger exploring the many bodies of water near me.

Postive things I have noticed in the first month:

Im most surprised about what it feels like to live a life with a clear and sharp mind, I feel superhuman without the constant fog.

My fingernails a longer, straight and healthy; Im not biting them off with every nervous tick of shame and anxiety.

I can drive anywhere without crippling anxiety of being pulled over.

I don't have to pee every 9 minutes.

I can work through a full shift with focus an work either without spending my lunch trying to remember which gas station in my ""rotation"" to pickup my nightly 6-pack. 

SLEEP. Appetite. And not having a headache every moment of every day.

This feels great guys and the spiritual relief of just being free is the biggest reward in its self.

oh and La Croix is the new hotness in my life.

It also felt really good to get out of the house today. I have been self-quarantining for a few months and haven't even been out and worn a mask yet--not to the grocery store, not anywhere. Luckily I live with my husband and uncle who get things from their essential businesses for me, but I had a much better day today getting out and taking care of my needs on my own.

So, I post about memoirs a lot.  But, tonight really thinking after reading Sing Backwards and Weep by Mark Lanegan and All I Ever Wanted by Kathy Valentine.  I mean, part of it is hero worship because I am a Gen X'er and I do like dreaming about that time in the 80s, especially about LA and they are both musicians for bands that I like.  

So, both Valentine and Lanegan had really laid back parents -- well, I generalize, but just to say there was a style of parenting common in the 70s where you were simply exposed to things at a much younger age, be it sex, drugs or rock and roll.  My parents thought they were being cool because they let me do what ever I want and basically treated me a like a roommate sometimes more than a kid!  But, both my parents' youth, they were hounded incessantly about how to act, how to be and how to think.  

Just to think, I saw a lot of behaviors I wish I hadn't seen.  And that is not to blame it all on them. But, I can see how it created a lot of insecurity in me and the drinking helped fill and address that insecurity.  And both of those books speak to that.  

And the thing is, I am grateful to both of them for other reasons.

2020-05-22 18:50:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gotnm7/memories/,Memories,"I've only recently learned about social binge drinking and its terrifying effect on memory.

Most experts believe information must first pass through short-term memory before it can be stored as a long-term memory.

I already knew alcohol disrupts memory through blackouts, when the night before is a mystery. I've had plenty of them. That's due to memories not making it across that bridge between short and long term memory while you're super drunk. 

Not great, but not a surprise. Piecing together the 'crazy' night before is so common, there are movies about it. 

But what I learned is regular alcohol use/abuse can also affect short term memory even without drinking to total blackout stage. Even a few drinks can affect memory and cause fragmented blackouts. Of course these are partial so you might not even know there are gaps in the evening. 

Most worrying for me was discovering regular drinking can adversely affect memory even when you're sober, with memory deficits lasting 3-4 days after a binge drinking session. 

Even a couple of binge drinking sessions each week every week logically then means a persistent state of impaired short term memory. This leads to less memories making across the bridge to be stored as long-term memories. 

During the decade of my heaviest drinking/partying, my 20s, I have almost no recollection. I actually thought that was normal. 10+ exciting years of being a young adult, gone. I can't look back on it. Can't reflect on it. Can't learn from it.

Some people forget their entire lives like this, then look around and it's over. Wasted. The fear of that hit me like a punch in the stomach.

Stress led me back to the wine in February (in-laws stayed with us for 2 weeks and OMG, it was painful) but once COVID-19 hit, I just... stopped. I went back to my quit lit and this time it seems like This Naked Mind stuck. I feel like there's been a real foundational shift in my relationship with alcohol. 

Yesterday, I thought I'd conduct an experiment. We stopped by friends to pick up some toilet paper (yeah, you read that right) and they offered us a glass of wine. (socially-distant, of course) We sat by the pool in the sunshine, gazed out at the mountains and chatted.

And for the first time IN MY LIFE, THIS HAPPENED: I really hated that feeling of getting slow from the booze. ONE glass and I felt lethargic and generally just bluuuurrrgggghhh. I still liked the taste (sort of) but I intensely disliked the disconnection from my new normal -- my new normal being fully-present and more energetic than I've felt in years. 

Previously, that unwinding of shoulders and slight blurring of colors was my absolute favorite part about the first glass of wine. But yesterday, I couldn't wait to get out of there and back to my sparkling water with ice and pomegranate juice. 

Why the change? Here are my guesses: 

1) Since my relapse in February, I've done a SHIT TON of therapy. I finally found an extremely effective therapist and he's helped me resolve a lot of trauma. I LIKE myself a whole heck of a lot more and I've gained perspective on who I am and my journey through this life. 

2) I think I'm starting to reset to my original factory settings. Somebody used that phrase on here and I LOVE it. Will I ever be an alcohol virgin again? Heck no. But I'm starting to feel like that person from way back when -- the woman I knew before she started to rely on booze. 

3) Quarantine. It sucks donkey balls but it's helping me stay sober. No backyard BBQs, no bars, no reason to feel like I have to drink to fit in with the crowd. Plus, I don't want to do a single thing to compromise my immune system. And alcohol, you insidious shitty poison, you do that. 

4) I am fully present for my kids, and my lord, is THAT nice. I don't want to EVER not be there for them again. EVER. And alcohol, you insidious shitty poison, you do that, too. 

5) Sober sleep is the physical equivalent of sitting in a field of sunflowers in Southern France surrounded by frolicking puppies while eating a never-ending bowl of your favorite ice cream. It's THAT good. And I now realize ANY amount of alcohol messes with my most-perfect ZZZZZZZs.

So I finally feel comfortable enough in my skin to post a photo and share my story of my weight loss. It began when I developed a drinking disorder at 21 and my liver exams came back extremely high (AST in the 500's ALT in the 300's). My doctor told me I needed to quit drinking asap as it was indicative to liver damage as well as having a resting blood pressure of 160/100. Well, I didn't quit and kept drinking and never went back to the doctor. When I was 23 I had an epiphany that I would die before my parents and couldn't put them through it so I quit cold turkey. With a few slip-ups I am finally closing in on one full year sober (neat). I went down to 250 and stagnated their while using eating as a craving suppressant.

After a few months of being at 250 I was talking to some friends about losing weight and they convinced me to sign up for a spartan race and the rest is history. I follow OMAD and IF and eat around 1200-1500 calories a day and track all my food to see my macros. I run about 6 miles a day (3 fasted in the morning and 3 miles in the afternoon) and do about 90 minutes of body kinetics a day to tighten my core and arms. 

I also want to make a shout out to the IRC channel from this subreddit. Without them I could never of accomplished the sobriety I needed to start this new chapter in my life. Much love to everyone here! oh and; IWNDWYT

I want to stop drinking. I've been trying to stop for over a month now. I've started talking Io a therapist and that's helped a lot but I don't feel like I have enough support. 
Before I was even old enough to purchase, I had a problem. As soon as I could purchase, the problem only got worse. I don't know what brought me to stopping then. For a year or two I detested alcohol, knew it would only make me feel like I was dying. 
Last year my mom died, I was deep in hard drug addiction during this time. I stopped because my family sent me across the country to live with my dad, and I don't know anyone out here to get stuff from. It's been almost a year since I've used, and I don't want it or feel cravings- unless I'm drunk. 
Upon getting clean, and moving somewhere practically new, I somehow managed to get a job in childcare as a preschool teacher. My dad drinks a lot, stepmom too. Every day. Ritualistically. 
I started drinking again on the weekends. It was around, normalized daily drinking. ""Can't hurt to have a drink on Friday night, right? I'll spend Saturday recovering"" quickly turned into drinking Saturday nights too. Then Sunday nights, too. Which means hungover at work, sick in the mornings. I've almost lost my job. 
Now that we're in quarantine, I just spend my days in my room or with other people who are alcoholics. I start going back from 8-1 next week. Which means I have 3 days to detox and be okay to work again. I've been averaging about a pint a day, of tequila. I'm about 105lbs, give or take. 
It's killing me and I can't do this anymore. I'm tired of hurting. I'm tired of feeling pain and hurting others. Tired of the drunken rampages, the fights, the accusations, the lies. I'm tired of pushing everyone away from me. I'm tired of poisoning my body, of always feeling foggy in the head. Tired of feeling depressed because I'm hungover or craving. Tired of wasting money on buying multiple small bottles because I think I'll just drink 1, but I know I will probably drink it the same night. I'm tired of lying to myself about my condition. I'm an addict and I need help.
I'm not very religious, so AA stuff hasn't exactly.. stricken my fancy. I don't think it's for me. My friends.. have all distanced themselves. I understand and respect their choices, I wouldn't want to be friends with me when I'm like that either.. my family, is pretty indifferent about it. Can you guys point me in the right direction?

I'm new here, a little anxious to post. I drink because I hate my job. I went from going to my favorite bar on lunch break to drinking at home, all day every day with quarantine. I'm in counseling as of 2 weeks ago, but as we can only chat 1x a week I came here for additional support. I live alone, my family actually doesn't know about my problem, but it's affecting my relationships across the board. They don't know what's going on and I can't bring myself to tell them. 

I've made a commitment to finding a new job, but we know the market is poor right now and that may take a while. I don't want this to get worse. I hate how much weight I've gained, throwing up each morning, and the never ending hangovers. 

My questions for anyone who reads this: 

How did you find the willpower to stop? What is your motivation?

Have you found that subbing drinks like kombucha and the newer, non-alcoholic spirit replacements have helped, or did you go cold turkey with water?

When you have that overwhelming feeling that you need to go to the liquor store or you'll lose it, what do you do to cope?

The first 2 weeks of sobriety were very difficult, especially being in quarantine, but seeing as my roommate isn't much of a drinker that made it easier. Weeks 2-4 were a piece of cake, didn't even want alcohol. Now weeks 5-6 have been worse than the first 2 weeks.

I am back to work now bartending and with working at a bar comes almost an obligation to stay after your shift and all drink together. Two days ago I did that and opted for a non-alcoholic ginger beer. Its nice to know I can still socialize and and have fun without drinking, but after just about an hour I couldn't stop thinking about the buzz I was missing. Watching all my friends get round after round made it harder for me to say no. I chose to leave after only an hour and a half of hanging out because all I could think about was getting a drink. 

It's made me very depressed recently thinking of all the good times I'm going to miss because I don't feel like I have control over my urges. Had to decline going to a friend's house yesterday knowing that we wouldn't be doing anything other than hanging out and drinking. I feel like it'd be easier for me if we went somewhere where there's an activity to keep me preoccupied, such as bowling/golf/movie theater, where they can drink but I won't be focused on it. However, bc of coronavirus and most of these places still not being open and available, it's getting lonely and alienating. I didn't have many craves before being alone, but now in week 6 and home alone the cravings are getting harder to deal with.

What’s life without booze making everything from movie watching to camping more fun?

But after 5 months or so of not drinking, I’ve started to realize that drinking was the thing that was actually restricting so many things in my life. It made me feel bad about what I ate (drunchies are too real), what I drunkenly said, how I acted in social situations... it got to the point where the anxiety and depression caused by alcohol made me feel like I was trapped in a tiny box. 

Now that I don’t drink, I can wake up every morning to exercise and then later house a cheeseburger, Coke, and fries with no guilt. I can be my weird silly self with friends and feel confident that this is just me, and it’s what people love about me, too. I don’t second guess my decisions to buy a new bikini, to play video games for hours, or do literally anything else I want to do. I feel free. I own everything I do.

I hope if you’re reading this and you felt the same way I did that you considering doing a little experiment and try not drinking. It most likely WILL feel restrictive and shitty at first.

Worse yet, why do I care? Why oh why would I ever tempt it?? Damn it. 

Here are thoughts I have now but they aren’t all connected, just individual insights. 

The alcoholic mind has old neurons that may not have died off entirely and so when given alcohol the neuropathway might light up and resume as if you never stopped drinking so you are not starting from the beginning. 

My ego is a pompous platypus adapting to circumstance. My LDR kinda thing going on...I was invited to go to stay at a friend’s cabin with them when travel is safe (we don’t live that far away from each other). I technically broke it off before COVID because LDRs are dumb AND my life was falling apart. Obviously I will have to tell them someday. But my brain is like, “oh no I’ve got that handled bruh. Just sip ONE slowly or like dump it out and fill it with water, then just don’t really ever drink!” Simple right?

I have very low standards and limits because I am an alcoholic. I KNOW how bad it gets. I KNOW I lose control. I’ll go to work, school drunk. Shit, I’ll walk to the playground with my kid slurring. Not okay but alcoholism takes over.

Why do I even want to? Is it really just pride and addiction? What’s weird to me is that I stopped smoking cigs like 8 years ago and never crave them. Plus I never daydream about having “just one”, I just don’t like them anymore. I hope this happens with alcohol. Ohhh, is it because alcohol is still so socially acceptable and “cool”? Hmmm...

TLDR; what’s the science behind the reality that “just one” drink is an impossible for alcoholics, even years later? Or is it not science but psychology and wanting to “be cool”? Or something else?",2,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.823071}"

It was normal and encouraged for all of us to just get shit face and enjoy the nights. Later in life i became an EMT in the city of flint and would have some harder days than most and we would all go drink our feelings away. soon after i didnt realize i started to go down a hole that i wasnt aware i was digging for myself. I wouldnt drink often,  maybe once a week, but when i did, it would be a heavy amount. 4 tall boys some days, 14 beers others, i would drive and crack one open, leave the bars drunk with my friends, and finally the worst thing with my drinking  was i was dishonest with myself and others about it. i was ashamed of who i was becoming and didnt like the man i seen in the mirror.

 Now i didnt crave alcohol, run into the trouble with the law,  lost my job or family,  or even have withdrawl symptoms, but what i had was a lost of control when i did drink. I never drank for the taste, i actually dont like the taste of beer or liquor honestly (i just said i did bc it was the man thing to do), i just wanted to chase that buzz and enjoy the ride that came along with it. i felt more open and free when i drank. i could socialize easier and just loosen up.my real friends and significant other showed me however that i was traveling down a dark road if i continued this journey.

 I hit my lowest point and came to the realization of things when i lost the girl i wanted to marry. She was my everything; my best friend, my heart, my smile, my soulmate. I broke her heart..the love she had for me and seen the pain in her eyes. i felt awful... i felt a deep knot in my stomach  making me feel sick every minute,  my heart physically hurt for the first time in my life. i took the happiness out of her eyes and the joy out of her smile. i broke my promise to her about my drinking and was dishonest. ive done many stupid things in my life, but that was the number one thing that hurt me the most . that was the moment i knew i had a problem and needed help. After our break up, i vowed to never touch a drop of alcohol again. Not just for her, but for myself. it was destroying my body, my mind, my happiness, and would eventually transition into real problems with the law and my career. It was a slow poison seeping into my veins, slowly taking over. I was very foolish for thinking of it as just a fun social thing, a cultural thing that i grew accustomed to. Its not a game but a sickness that can fester and grow until it devours you whole.

the week after our breakup was the worst. i looked at my engagement ring constantly, spinning it around my finger wishing to take back time and life choices to have another chance with her. i looked at old photos and videos of us, feeling more depressed and sick as i wish for  that time to come back.

 However, unlike other people's journey's, my sorrows didnt make me want to chase the bottle. i didnt have a desire to drink my feelings away, i didnt want to even look at a bottle. i wanted to feel every emotion, the raw painful agony i had because it reminded me and showed what my life would be like with alcohol.  i didnt want to drown my feelings away, but i  wanted to embrace them,  and learn from them. i wanted to face who i was and defeat that man in the mirror. i wanted to get my girl back, marry her sweet ass and live a long life with her. I vowed to give up alcohol and the life i had with it because i was stronger than that, i chose her.

A week later, my Girl and i ended up meeting and talking about our feelings. she expressed deep betrayal and anguish about the things i had done. she told me how i hurt the love she had for me and and how bad her heart ached. That sobbering talked crushed my heart even more because the woman i loved hit rock bottom because of me. We talked and i expressed how much i loved her and how wrong i really was. how stupid my life choices were and how i chose her instead of another bottle of beer. Im not much of a religious man but i prayed for her forgiveness and one last chance. She was my everything and i finally seen the error of my ways. 

I swear i could played the lottery that day because with the slighest smile, she agreed and took me back. We have a long journey to recover and mend what we had, but we are slowly getting there.  I joined an AA group and now attend once a week regularly to focus  on being better.  We have new ground rules but our trust is slowly starting to build back. I have been clean ever since the day i broke her heart with my dishonesty  and continue to live my vow to never drink again. 

i wrote myself a note when i was feeling that deep pain without her to remind me what life could be like if i take another sip. i read it every day to remind myself that i dont need it and that i am better with out it.  i cut cold turkey and i  feel blessed that i  stopped before the cravings or desire to drink became a physical dependence. i feel clean, i feel happy and i feel like a better man. i feel like i am becoming the man i needed to be and wanted to be from the very beginning. she doesnt know it, but thank her every day i wake up because that strong woman showed me  i could do anything as long as i had her by myside.

Now im not perfect in anyway, i fuck up like anyone else, but to anyone who made it this far in this long ass journal, just know it gets better. It doesnt get better over night or by just sitting on your ass though. you have to make a conscious decision to get better and chase after it. You need to find things that make you happy and vow to constantly improve. Life is a beautiful thing and you dont need alcohol to enjoy it. Yea it might make things fun and wild in the short term, but long term your just drowning in it. every day is an achievement when you stay clean and stay focused. we have only so many days on this planet before we die, dont speed it up with alcohol and regret.

 In time, things will get easier and things will get better. never forget where you are going because thats how you fall of the path to where you want to be.

There is one thing I have noticed though. Whereas I was quite passive to insults and wrongs done to me while I was still drinking I am now noticing that I will get extremely defensive and challenging at what I perceive to be slights against me. I've thought it may be an increase in self-respect which is great but a big reason for reaching sobriety was/is embracing positive thinking so having this flood of 'fight' emotion seems odd to have appeared. I put a question mark after anger as I'm not sure it's 100% the right word to use for the feeling.
I'm posting here wondering if this is a 'stage' or if people have experience with this. I get flooded with this emotion to defend myself but it's not made me physically violent but if it washes over me so fast who says it hasn't the potential.

There is some light at the end of the tunnel.  The lockdown, I've heard from reliable sources (like the media and the guvnor), but I'm not sure how reliable these are as I'm weary to have faith in them.  And as Zizek says, maybe the light is an oncoming train! 
 =0

I've learned a lot over the last two months.  The last 24 hours I've had a Capstone experience, which I'm not going to go into right now as I'm still trying to process it.

One thing I've learned about is fear.  I wrote about it a few weeks ago.  I reasoned that fear isn't always a bad thing.  There is much to learn from fear.  If we try and ignore it, or suppress it, it's not good.    

On the other hand we shouldn't live our lives in fear.  It's easy to say that, but what I mean is that it's okay to be afraid.  We(I) need to learn how to incorporate the fear into our lives.  Fear can have an influence in making our decision, BUT, fear should not make the decision!  Choose love and light!  Growth and abundance.  

Things are definitely going to go sideways.  When we hit those rough seas, we've got to focus on balancing the ship, keeping the boat upright, and not taking on more water.  It's not time to hide below deck with the bottle.  

Then when we get to the smooth water, it's also not time to go below deck with the bottle.  It's time to take inventory, time to fix the leaks, and learn.  

What could I have done differently?  I'd have thought at one time that this was defeatist.  That it was rumination and living in the past.  But it's not.  It's preparing.  

Because one thing's for damn sure, there will be rough seas again!  

I'm about to go to eat some ice cream and then off to bed.  Then when I wake up, maybe mow the lawn, maybe do some yoga, definitely going to go to work, and definitely not drinking!

I'm in Canada with no priors. I drove drunk a few times in high school. I have respect for the law and understand why they're in place. People die every day from drunk driving accidents. So I have always been sure to be responsible and not drink and drive. I dropped the ball in February getting charged with a DUI. I was under so much woe from personal life events that I was basically already in a stupor before I even drank anything. 

I fortunately had no accident and caused no injury. I was relatively far over the limit and once I was pulled over I accepted the full wrath of what had happened, did the breathalyzer. I spoke to a lawyer but was so hammered I don't remember what he even said to do. Today was my hearing and I have a fine and 1 year prohibition. I accept this entirely as my punishment.

I was very brief and painless, and I know I'm on the road to forgetting about this... but I still feel like... I don't deserve to smile. Or laugh. That kind of stuff. I'm just kind of sitting here completely unsure of what I should do with myself. Anyone else find this? How long did it take for the waves of shock and guilt to fade? I don't mean to say that I should be able to just forget this, pretend it never happened, and expect EVERYTHING to go back to normal because I deserve it. I'm just wondering if you at least found yourself able to forget about it for a bit, and if so, how long until you reached that point.

Is there anyone here who has experience bartending while being sober? I'm not super worried about being tempted because I'm confident a drunk life is not one I want to live. I'm more worried about if it would keep me from being good at my job. Like tasting cocktails or recommending whiskey or wine.

Ive been reading this sub a lot lately. I dont think I am alcoholic yet but lately ive been seen it coming. I started drinking around 15 and in the same time came weed together with the booze. Every weekend in the houseparties and the point was to get as wasted as possible. I started playing drums in punk band. And in that culture drinking and drugs and givin a big F to the world is a big thing. I lived that punk rock life for years and harder drugs came in also. Around 21 I started to work my ass off to get money and then quit work travel europe and festivals for months wasted everyday then back to work and again couple months later. I was thinking I am young i can do this its fine everybody around me does it also. I have broken bones broken relationships broken family only becouse the ""rocknroll"" life. I almost once a week get black out drunk that i cant remember anything. I might be sober for a week or two then I drink one night and realise ive been drunk for a month but its cool becouse its rocknroll? Right? In middle of all this i got super depressed and even tried to kill myself couple times and as a medicine i started to live the rocknroll life even harder.Anyway this year I have been thinking about this. I should quit before something really bad happens and before I am an alcoholic. Ive been trying and realised its hard. Its really hard. I wanna change my life I wanna be sober so much! And there is this thing I am stilla young not alcoholic and everybody around me drinks. So people say I am not allowed to stop drinking becouse of that? The idea is that you need to ruin your life and be alcoholic to get the good look for gettin sober.

A few years ago she was getting on in years and less able to get by in a state with no nearby relatives. I moved her near me—not too near though. My mom was best taken in small doses. 

I’d been drinking since my divorce several decades ago, sometimes too much. Having her nearby was often a good reason to drink. But on the first day of 2019 I’d had enough and stopped. It wasn’t easy, but every week was a bit easier. Then every month was another layer of armor. Once I hit a year I was invincible. 

When she died there was no one else in town to help settle her affairs. My sister helped as much as she could by working the phones, and a far-off cousin served as a conduit to the rest of the family, but I had to do all the footwork myself and, because of the pandemic, the complex wouldn’t let anyone but family in to move her stuff out. 

Though the apartment looked neat, she was a hoarder: lotions, meds, vitamins, keepsakes, .... and booze, squirreled away and jam-packed in every nook and cranny.   It took me a solid week to get everything out. On the last day three of my boys that didn’t live *too* far away helped me move the furniture out.  To ease selling it off, I stuffed every bit of it into my garage. 

I intended to give the booze away to friends and family but, for the first week at least, it was buried behind all the furniture (and out of sight.) Once I was able to get some the furniture to sell though, there it was.

A couple of them were open. If I’d noticed that before I’d boxed them up I’d have dumped them down the drain. As it was though, I had a couple drinks one night. The next night I did it again, that old familiar buzz was nice. I never thought I could moderate, that’s why I never had alcohol in the house once I quit. I still knew I wasn’t going to be able to moderate, but I drank anyway. 

Fortunately, I haven’t imbued bed enough since that first drink to actually get drunk, but mornings were unpleasant again. 

The night before last I finished the last open bottle. Last night I opened one, and mixed a couple drinks. I’d become more and more angry with myself over the last few days and last night I’d had enough. I took that nearly-full bottle and dumped it down the drain. 

Today I’m boxing them all up and letting some friends know what’s available. Whatever is still here at the end of the weekend goes down the drain too. It’ll take an hour at least. 

Today is Day One again, the start of my second Memorial Day Weekend in a row without drinking.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**The Farmer’s Market made me cry.**

Years ago, I was wandering through the farmer’s market and I became overwhelmed with emotion. An emotion I wasn’t even sure how to describe…forget figuring out how to handle it. I cried...right there…somewhere between the tomatoes, the flower arrangements, and the lavender scented goat milk soap. Tears, rolling down my face. Not out loud. Just abundant tears.

WTF? Where’d that come from? What was that? It would take another decade to fully understand. 

The following, from Brene Brown’s debut TedTalk, The Power of Vulnerability provided the answer for what happened at the farmer’s market that day. 

“You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other […] emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we also numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness. And then we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle.” - Brene Brown 

In that single moment, I had a vision of what my life could be like. A life in the country, a garden, simplicity, and nature, with like-minded friends and a community. My future. Those were *tears of joy, gratitude, and happiness*. The toothpaste was out of the proverbial tube and it wasn’t going back in. I knew what my life **could** be like. I just had to put in the work. 

The “dangerous cycle” took 16 years and there was significantly more than a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin involved. Lessons had to be learned. Tools added to the tool kit. Strategies acquired for life’s battles. Here I am today. There's enough room for all of us. 

No longer numb.

A little backstory; 
Problem with binge drinking, off and on since I was 20 (I’m 28 now). Suffered from a severe eating disorder for years, and as a result a bit underweight.
It’s gotten really bad in the last year. Personal family problems has kind of driven me to the bottle. I’m not necessarily a “bad” drunk, but it got to the point where I knew it was going to be a problem. It was an everyday thing, instead of occasionally, and I would drink until I was drunk. I wanted to be, like, not in the present, you know? 
These past few weeks I’ve been locked up alone, and I’ve been drinking to inebriation for the past month. I’m worried of experiencing severe alcohol withdrawals in the next few days.
Am I being silly?

I made a lot of big decisions before deciding become sober (namely moving home, leaving the service industry, and deciding to go back to school full-time), but I find that cutting out the two major emotional/distraction comforts I've had a habit of turning to in my life - dating and alcohol - have allowed me to fully realize my goals, and to grow as a person in ways I wouldn't have been able to otherwise.

I started running again, and ran my first full marathon in five years back in february (and in my old college town, no less - and I didn't drink once that trip!). I've read 22 books since the start of the year, have gotten a nutrition certification for work, and am currently getting another certification. I started writing again - a lot of it's journaling, and even some fiction, which was a hobby I abandoned years ago. I go to therapy every week and regularly meet with a psychiatrist. I've saved a shit ton of money for school, and am set to go three out of four semesters of dietetic school totally debt free.

I sleep better, and I overall take better care of myself, both physically and mentally. I'm kinder to myself. I actively watch my self-talk, and on the days I feel down, I talk myself through it instead of reaching out to some guy to stroke my ego. I'm in a place where I genuinely love my body and all that it does for me, and I don't need someone else to validate it or to validate me.

It's wild to think that this time two years ago, I was fresh out of college and working full time as a bartender, probably just downing my third drink of the night, knowing full well I'd be going out partying after work and sleeping in until noon the next day. I didn't have a clue what I wanted to do professionally, and knew deep down that I had to grow up. But at the time it seemed like too hard of a decision to make - I wasn't in therapy, I wasn't exercising, I wasn't taking care of myself, and I wasn't thinking about my future. I was just trying to get from one day to the next and numb myself as much as I could in the process.

I'm finally growing into the person I realize I was always meant to be. I had my missteps and setbacks along the way, and I'm still a long way from where I want to be - but I am so grateful I made the decision to go sober when I did. And I wholeheartedly trust now that when I eventually stop being celibate and decide to start dating again, I'll know full well exactly what I deserve from a partner, and won't settle for anything less.

Bit by bit, those habits dropped away - in the past, that has *very* often, almost invariably, preceded a relapse.

I feel like crying from joy!,"First and foremost I would like to thank everyone in this sub-Reddit. I come to read everyone’s stories and you all have given me confidence to finally quit.

The past five years I’ve been a heavy drinker. Off days I’d drink five tall cans throughout the day, maybe more. I was always sweating at work, hands shaky, and always nauseated. I was afraid to admit to myself that I actually was an “alcoholic”. I went from a casual drinker to “the night cannot end until I’m heavily buzzed”. Within the last two years I went from 160lb up to 240lb which I know was alcohol and a Jack In the Box diet.

During the start of the Covid-19 pandemic I was very depressed and financially struggling and since I was and still am on furlough, I had all the time to drink myself silly and that’s what I did. I would start at 7am and end around midnight, barely eating. Then about a month ago for some reason so many symptoms started showing up like heartburn, acid reflux,  constant dirreah, randomly vomiting our the blue. I could barely finish a tall without almost vomiting every ten minutes. I’ve had these symptoms before but recently over an extended time they all hit at once.

On May 14th I told myself in the mirror that this would be my last day drinking and that next day I would start my journey of being clean and sober. Even with my pep talk to myself I knew I wasn’t ready, but I knew I had to try because I was a complete mess. The first day was a struggle because I was used to a pattern or a certain time would remind me that I should be drinking. I almost crumbled but I got through the day, although I didn’t get any sleep that night.

But to my surprise everyday got a little easier. I started going on three mile walks around my neighborhood, I started going to the store to buy groceries, cooking my own food, anything to keep my mind occupied. Now up until I thought about writing this post, I didn’t even think about alcohol this whole day.

I want to end this by saying thank you once again to everyone who has encouraged me through their own stories and to those still struggling, it actually is possible. This is the first time in I don’t know how long that I feel I have control over my health and well-being. I’m going to continue to eat clean, workout, stay active and be alcohol free.

I have to go to the store anyway...I could easily sneak over to the liquor store and no one would no.  When I start thinking this way an odd feeling starts to creep over me...it’s kind of this insidious type of happiness.  Almost as if something is saying ‘I’ve got you...you’ll be fine’.

I don’t know what I’m expecting by posting this. I already made the decision to quit. I am 21 years old, have been drinking daily for about 3-4 years. Up until about the beginning of this year, I would only drink at night , then throw it up to try to avoid the hangover. Eventually as I increased the amount I drank from 250ml of vodka closer to 500ml , I’d forget to throw up and end up passing out. Then in order to subside the feelings of being hungover in the morning I would sporadically drink more again. This turned Into full fledged physical dependence on the alcohol and over the past week I have not eaten anything and practically the only thing that’s been in my system is vodka and beer which I use to chase. Being that I keep throwing up all day my stomach has shrunk. I feel like I’m going to die. I finally went my first day today without drinking. Hardest day of my life. I contemplated killing myself because I don’t know how I can return to normal physical health. If I can’t hold anything down I can’t eat or drink. Has anybody ever gotten this bad?

Because I was drinking nightly at this point I was worried I was but on the off chance I wasn’t I wanted to be stocked up. So I would buy a pregnancy test then drive to another store and get booze.

Some background, i’m a 19 year old female, i live in the uk so the legal drinking age is 18 before anyone comments on that, and i’ve been seeing a psychotherapist since september who has, on multiple occasions, said i have a problem with alcohol. Now, i understand ‘a problem’ and alcoholism aren’t the same but this is sort of where my problem lies. I always convince myself that i’m not ‘bad enough’ to go sober as if being sober is some sort of final solution that i should be reluctant to be a part of. I guess another preface although i’ve been ranting for a while is that i’m not sure what my point is with this post, i guess i just want some support. 

to put it as simply as i can: I still drink often, i’m sort of 50/50 in my wanting to be able to drink in moderation (i know doesnt everyone convince themselves of that at some point) and wanting to stop completely. I suppose i just always come back to the idea that i don’t need to stop, that i’m too young to have experience of anything nevermind something so severe (again, in my mind i feel like i need to have a serious issue to ‘need’ to go sober) that i need to quit drinking. I’m not sure where to go from here as i’ve always found alcohol to be both a comfort and a curse but it’s like nothing bad ‘enough’ has ever happened for me to focus on the curse aspect and i still feel as though it’s a friend who i find comfort in and don’t want to let go.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4823028}"

Just hit my 1 year sober-versary on May 19th, after about a 10-11 year relationship with the juice. I'm a 28 year old male living in Oregon.

**My history of alcohol use**

I grew up in a middle class household with mom, dad, and brother. We never wanted for anything financially, my brother and I had many opportunities provided for us. My parents drank beer/wine for as long as I can remember. I have an image of my dad blasted drunk listening to piano music on our home desktop computer. I was an obedient little boy and made good grades in school, I love school.

The first time I got drunk was @ 16 years old on a snowboarding trip and I thought it was the tits! Loved the drunk feeling from the first moment and continued to drink socially from then on. Experimenting with alcohol with friends, and sometimes alone cause why not. Also loved weed & cigarettes but thats another story. Looking back I always drank to excess compared to my peers. I was typically the one to black out at parties, have ""funny"" (embarrassing) pictures taken of me, and occasionally piss on someones couch. I was a fun-loving drunk, never violent or driving. This continued through college, occasional during the week drinking, heavy binge drinking on the weekends because it was socially acceptable and widespread. It all seemed ""normal"" when everyone else was doing it. My parents expressed some concern but no frequent or serious enough to gain my attention, I was never seriously injured or had major consequences.

2 years after college I met my now girlfriend, soon to be fiance. We drank lots of wine and beer together, again in ""socially acceptable"" circumstances and amounts. But I always craved excess and have been hungover to the point of debilitation for large family events, vacations, birthdays, 1 christmas, and many many weekends since we met 5 years ago. At one notable wedding in the middle of a remote forest, I got blasted as usual and decided to ""lay under the stars"" for a while by myself in the woods. For a while no one could find me and I must have woken up because I magically returned to the party (per my girlfriends story the next day.) I cringe at the thought of dying in these situations and get very scared of my past behavior. Another notable event. On Christmas Eve 2018 I was home with my brother, getting blasted together as usual. We made the genius decision to go to the strip club, which was closed, so we ubered to the one across town. We were 2 out of 3 patrons there, with one stripper. We drank more and got a dance, returned home, and continued to drink. The next day I had to lay down in my grandmothers spare bedroom while my immediate and extended family enjoyed a 30 year long tradition of christmas morning together. I napped til 2pm, then threw up from 2pm - 10pm, then to bed.

In summary, I thought I was drinking within the realm of normalcy, alongside all of those who drank around me that I respected; brother, mom, dad, extended family, friends, girlfriend, girlfriends family. Literally all of these people drink to some extent and it started turning into every occasion as a reason or opportunity to drink.

**When I realized it wasn't serving me; How I quit**

I have journal entries from at-least 5 years ago where I ask myself ""Is drinking all there is to life? Do we ever do anything else interesting?"" Well it took me another 5 years to finally get fed up enough to take action. After yet another Saturday morning of feeling like shit, feeling anxious, feeling pissed off at myself and my girlfriend for drinking again I decided it was time. **Not everything is this simple, I had been going therapy for about 7 months at this point, which was integral to this process, I would highly recommend.** 1 week before her birthday and I couldn't stand the thought of another birthday, I knew I would drink and feel horrible the next day. I told her my concerns and said I was going to stop. She supported me 100% and we got through the birthday without incident. I went to a bar with her & family and drank liquids at the same fast rate as before, this time bubbly water & coffee.

Day 1 and I felt great that I made a change, but alcohol remained a huge part of my life and the life of those around me (Brew pubs anyone? Beers at every family/friend gathering anyone? Beers in the fridge calling your name anyone?). I started to read voraciously on the subject of alcoholism, I needed to understand what I had been through and could expect from the future. I highly recommend this too, because knowledge is power in this situation. You can get just about anything sent to your public library. The book that was my saving grace was **This Naked Mind by Annie Grace**. In this book she explores the basic science of alcoholism, how it affects a person, and works to shift deep seeded though patterns about alcohol that kept me coming back to it. Most notably I though alcohol made me 1) less anxious and 2) more social. Looking back it increased my anxiety a shitload when I wasn't drinking, and when I was drunk I just got quiet and focused on getting drunk, so really no that social. I struggle with insecurity and alcohol was a great equalizer, a shitty one at that. After reading this book my perception about alcohol shifted 180 degrees. I no longer craved alcohol, or thought it would be fun to use. I wholeheartedly saw it as something that added nothing to my life, and frequently made it worse.

One thing that helped me stick with not drinking was being open about it with others, especially those who I did most of my drinking with (family, girlfriend). It held me accountable and responses were overwhelmingly positive. In reality, me quitting drinking has planted that seed in others minds. I continued to see my therapist. I have been eating way more sweets than usual by the way.

Summary: Got fed-the-fuck-up with alcohol robbing me of life all the time, went to therapy, read a book, quit and told everyone about it, ate a lot of sweets.

**Lessons from the Last Year**

* I Can do it and so can you!
* My perception is that the hardest part of quitting is if you have to battle your unconscious mind about it. If your unconscious mind is telling you ""Its fun, you dont have a problem, alcohol helps you socialize, alcohol feels good,"" then you're going to have a hell of a time battling this disease.
* Most people are overwhelmingly supportive of your decision to quit alcohol, don't be shy about telling your support people. If they aren't supportive then they might be struggling with their own alcohol issues, or are just unhappy or something I don't know! Not your problem.
* Underlying emotional / psychological problems are widespread and common in our society. Insecurity, debilitating anxiety, depression, etc... You are not alone. Asking for help is the first step to change. Furthermore, alcohol makes these problems worse, even if it numbs you for a few hours.
* Probably saved a shitload of money!!! Have not calculated it but undoubtedly saved money (and time).

**The future?**

* I've toyed with the idea that I am okay now, and can return to drinking. This happens especially when I'm stressed out. During this time I remember that drinking to reduce stress was an absolutely horrible idea for me, with a proven track record of negative outcomes.
* I plan on being sober for good, but as they say, Its always one day at a time.

If you read this props to you, I hope you get something from it. If anything it was cathartic for me and thats what matters most! I'll do my best to reply to posts or private messages if anyone wants to chat. Thank you to this community.

I began thinking about how perspectives on the statement differ. I’m sure, for most people, it means they want to sit down, have a drink (or two), and unwind. It’s a throw away comment. 95% of the time, it’s likely not an invitation to get out of control. 

On the other hand, I’ve almost always considered it an invitation to get out of control. Depending on the person, I can force myself to keep it together until it’s polite to leave, but then what am I doing? Heading to another bar, heading to the liquor store, heading home and drinking more. More, more, more. If it’s someone I know will be up for a “good time”, then the brakes are off immediately and god knows where the evening is headed. 

So, what to do with this suggestion? I feel that I can’t decline them, and that once I’ve accepted them I’m obliged to show my guest or host a “good time.” Back to the perspectives. If they aren’t asking for someone to get three sheets to the wind with, then they’re not going to care that I’m not drinking.

Well quarantine got to me and I thought I’d try and moderate again—“wouldn’t it be nice to drink champagne on the roof?”—and it was mostly fine because I’m STILL good at drinking.

I won’t drink today either and in a way I’m kind of grateful for that month off the wagon because now I know it truly does suck and that champagne or beer or a cocktail or whatever doesn’t actually make the view any better.

On those streaks I’d always be so vocal about my progress, which can come off as a little boastful or undesirable to those who still regularly drink.  My girlfriend pointed this out, and I realize I was mostly talking about it to verbally process and cope with such a huge change in my habits and lifestyle.

\-remove isolation. Find someone to talk to. One single conversation about my problem with my doctor gave me a huge momentum boost.

\-be gentle with yourself. don't expect too much too soon. Eat the candy bar, just don't drink

\-stay frosty. Just yesterday at 5pm I had an unexpected craving. I know now that these cravings pass quickly

\- be grateful. Every night as I turn the light out and go to sleep I take a moment to recognize the fact that I'm sober, and that being sober is NOT a given and that I should in that moment see how great it is

\-journaling. I have 10 years of diary entries that detail the pain, illness and anguish of my drinking. going back to these from time to time bring my former days into sharp relief. That world is still out there if I choose to drink again.

One of my many motivations for quitting drinking has been rediscovering what it means to be kind to myself. I've had what feels like countless attempts at sobriety (sorry for the constant PMs, badgebot), and each time it was rooted in self-hatred. ""You disgusting alcoholic, you have to quit."" ""You fat fuck, can't you see this alcohol is making you flabby and gross?"" ""Why are you like this, you sloppy, irresponsible idiot?""

A decade ago, before my drinking started, I was in the depths of anorexia. The parallels that I've noticed between the two addictions have been eye-opening. Both addictions keep my rooted in behaviors by making me hate myself, forcing me to keep my behaviors secret, and setting myself up for failure by putting some idealized, unattainable self-image up on a pedestal.

I thankfully have not have any eating disorder behaviors for over five years, but I can tell that instead of truly recovering, I have replaced my self-hatred outlet with alcohol. 

Previous attempts at sobriety were incredibly unrealistic. I wanted to quit drinking, lose tons of weight, start an intense exercise program, fix my sleep schedule, take up four new hobbies, learn meditation, completely change my routines... all at the same time. The minute I slipped up in one area, I would say, ""fuck it, guess I'm irredeemable, time to drink.""

I want to stop this cycle. I want to learn what it means to be *kind* to myself - mind, body, and soul. I need to learn to forgive myself, the same way I would a good friend, when I slip up. I wouldn't expect my fiance to change every single aspect of his life in one day, so why on earth am I expecting that of myself?

In some ways, I'm still exploring what this kindness means. Self-care is important, but bath bombs and face masks won't fix deep rooted issues, and that self-kindness is probably different for everyone. One important area I'm working on is changing the way that I talk to myself - rather than berating myself, I want to speak to myself with kindness, the way I would a loved one.

I'm only on day five - but this is the longest that I've been sober in a year. And changing the way that I treat myself is, ultimately, the only way that I am going to shake off the chains of addiction and move forward.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.78818536}"

I’d be filled with debilitating anxiety, feeling like a dumpster fire every morning, brain fog, bloating, nausea, self hatred, worry, judgment, guilt, shame. 

500+ days in I’m free. Free!!!! So damn happy to be free. Never to return to the prison of drunkenness. 

Today, I was reminded of the Buddha’s parable of the second arrow: 

The Buddha once asked a student, “If a person is struck by an arrow, is it painful?” The student replied , “It is.” The Buddha then asked, “If the person is struck by a second arrow, is that even more painful?” The student replied again, “It is.” The Buddha then explained, “In life, we cannot always control the first arrow. However, the second arrow is our reaction to the first. And with this second arrow comes the possibility of choice.

Life is challenging. Especially now. Drinking to deal and numb the fear, suffering, worry, anxiety, clinging, aversion, sorrow, sadness and anger of this pandemic is the second arrow that leads to so much more suffering. No more second arrows in the quiver here.

Turned out, when I drank I sent VERY nasty emails to colleagues and made questionable social media posts (nothing ""bad"" per se, just not professional). This went of for a while with a few reprimands, and finally a final warning.

My loaded gun sitting next to me, I texted two friends that this was the end. I chickened out, texted my friends that all was well, and that I'd see them tomorrow. The two friends are my best friends and we taught together. Unbeknownst to me, they talked to our principal the next morning. Because I'm a teacher in questionable mental status with a gun, they called the police to see what to do.

The police told them that someone needed to take me to a hospital, and if they didn't the police would. My buddies convinced my principal that it should be them. After school, I get called to the principal's office (I don't care how old you are, your stomach drops every time!), and they tell me that they've talked to the local hospital, and they have a counselor waiting to meet with me.

Two hours later, I voluntarily checked into rehab. I took my time in rehab very seriously, hoping a good report would save my job (it didn't). Got out of rehab and continued heavy counseling. Attended two AA meetings per day (luckily it was the summer break had just started, so I had plenty of time to focus on just this. Eventually found a new job right before school started (actually missed the first day!).

Five years later, and not a drop. Not even tempted really. In talking with others at meetings, I feel like my recovery was ""easy"". I was never tempted to drink again. Never had a ""white knuckle"" night. Never needed to call a friend to talk me down. I feel like because of that, I'm constantly on-guard because I didn't struggle like so many of you have. For me, a switch just flipped. That was it; no more drinking. Sure, there are days when a beer sounds good, but I have learned that the ONLY control I have is over whether or not I take the first drink. After that, my choices aren't mine.

It were the best months in my life, with a lot of mental and professional growth. But then I relapsed. I fell in love with a guy who drinks a lot, and went with him down the rabbit hole. Partly it was fun, because I was so in love, but it was also terrible. My mental and professional growth stopped, I just lived for my boyfriend and the short term moments of pleasure we had with booze and sex. For some reason men always trigger self-destructive parts in me, and I don't seem to care anymore. I started taking drugs again, and lost all my passion for my creative work. Until 3 weeks ago: I broke up with him and realised I didn't want to live this way anymore. I want productive, creative days, I want to go for longterm happiness and growth, I want to feel my feelings and build my future.

 I am three weeks sober now, and feel beter than ever. I am starting a business, picked up my hobbies, eating more healthy, got a role in a shortmovie. I am thriving again! There's absolutely no rational reason to start drink and use again. And still, theres this terrible addictive voice again, this beast in me, a voice that gets louder every day. Somehow this beasts makes me believe that drinking again is a great idea. That I need to ""treat"" myself. That social contact without booze is boring.

It's also not helping that the studenthouse I am living in, got more into drinking and partying thanks to all the corona-rules. Theyre convincing me everyday to party with them, and even though I know this will not make me truly happy, it looks so appealing to me.

This evening I was on the edge of a relapse, I got asked for a party and was like: fuck it, I rejected so many parties, now its time to say yes and go crazy! In the same ""fuck-it-vibes"" I almost wanted to call my ex. But then somehow a voice of self-discipline stopped me. But I get the creepy feeling that this discipline will not last a lot longer. How are you dealing with this? How are you are coping with these voices?

I immediately ate some good fresh food and within the hour I was almost back to normal. 

I've set alarms on my phone to remind me to eat, as my body still doesn't tell me I'm hungry, and the effects hunger plays on mind can be confusing...

I recently made up a way for myself to start drinking less, without quitting cold turkey. So last week, I went for 4 days without drinking, comfortably. (I was comfortable not drinking because Inwas drinking every night before that for a week) Then, on the 4th night, I got a craving and drank a pint and a rockstar. I satisfied my craving and that was it. The next morning I felt horrible and was bullying myself because of my slip up. Then I realized, the morning after I satisfied my craving, I felt no need to drink again. So I thought, “well, you easily stopped drinking for 4 days, maybe this time, you can shoot for 5, and reward yourself once on the 5th night like you did on the 4th last week, then work your way up to 6 days, to 7 days, and see how far you can go.” And I think that’s a really good way for me to drink less. Today, it’s day 2, and I had nothing to do (quarantine, duh) and I was aware that cravings can easily come around if you’re not keeping your mind occupied. So I googled new recipes to try out and I made my family a beautiful dinner (it took hours, I didn’t mind, I love cooking.) By the time I finished the meal, ate, and did the dishes, I realized so much time went by that I didn’t even think about drinking. If you think the method I thought up is something you can handle, go for it and good luck. Make sure to keep your mind occupied with the things you love and remember there is always going to be a reward at the end of every weekly challenge. That reward doesn’t even have to be alcohol. It could be ordering take out, it would be buying yourself a reasonably priced and thought out gift, just make sure there’s rewards that you’ll be excited to work toward. (I chose alcohol as my reward because I know cold turkey doesn’t work for me, with alcohol at least.) Just a thought. This is my first post so please take it easy on me. Respectful opinions and constructive criticism are welcome and appreciated :)

The last two years has been a slow descent into utter hell. The self loathing and emotional torture I've been through. The countless mornings I've woken up not remembering how I drove home. The evenings spent drinking thinking ""what. The fuck. Am I doing.""  It nearly came to a head in early March so I finally got my jacket on, walked to an AA meeting, only to find it closed because of covid, early on in this pandemic. ""well fuck it. Can't get into too much shit when the bars are closed anyway, I can stop when AA starts up again."" 

Since then I have learned in such a hard way how much damage you can do with about 30 beers and a fully charged cell phone. Altho I am married (open relationship) with kids... I was flirting with someone and I completely misread the situation. I ended up being completely inappropriate. I looked back on the conversation when I woke up, still half drunk, a few hours later, and realized how off base I had been. I apologized but the damage was done. She has decided to publicly blast me and call me and my business out on Facebook and now I'm trying to weather an unbearably embarrassing pr disaster to save my business which was already in dire straights due to covid. I acted in a way that is so completely opposite my moral compass. To a person who didn't deserve it. And now I am fully paying for it. 

Truth is over the past few months I have told myself repeatedly, ""if you dont stop, something awful is bound to happen."" and stupidly, I didn't listen to myself. And here I am. A person who prides himself on treating people well, a public face, who now has to accept this shame. 

It's too late for me to take that back. As much as I close my eyes as hard as I can and wish to open them to the day before that happened. Or the month before.... I can't. I can only change what happens going forward. It's awful not being able to go to a meeting.  But this sub helped me before, before I allowed this darkness back in. And I'm here with you, not drinking.  Today, and every day after, universe willing.",9,"{'covid': 2, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8658999}"

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.
This post goes up at:

US—Night/Early Morning

**After the quarantine**

I’ve read a saying, attributed to multiple people, in various forms…

*“The more you Practice in Peace, the less you Bleed in Battle.”*

Many of us have been in a holding pattern since the COVID quarantine. Some of us have been going full speed because of the quarantine. I have no idea what a regular day will be like or what the new normal will be once the restrictions are fully  lifted. 

So I PRACTICE while I have time...We have each other for support. We have endless reading material, recovery groups, podcasts, meetings available to us. We have hobbies or new skills to learn in our free time. We have emotional and spiritual practices for our mental health. 

All the above to be used during the difficult times. The times when life is challenging. The times when the Nob-head in the parking lot cuts you off. The times when Mommy and Daddy need a freakin’ break. The time when tragedy or trauma overwhelms us. The time when the urge is creeping in.

**What strategies do you incorporate into your Practice that boost your strength to succeed in the Battles life throws your way?**

Community reminder… in the r/stopdrinking forum, please remember to sort by NEW and give some encouragement or support to the member posts. 

**Please consider volunteering to host the Daily Check In.** If you're interested and have 30 or more days of sobriety just let me or u/SaintHomer know. THANKS!

I've been alcohol free for (just under) 3 years now. Lately I've been having a hard time remembering why I stopped drinking, and I've also been missing alcohol a *lot*. Intellectually I know that my life was a f**kin mess and I'm leagues better now than I was before I got sober. 

I'm ""dual diagnosis"" and am having some problems with med side effects, so I'm not 100% sure my current struggles aren't just the other parts of my brain that don't work right. **That said, how do you all remind yourselves that problems will only get worse with alcohol?** I've been working through my coping mechanisms, but they aren't working as well as they used to. 


I hope this doesn't discourage anyone who has less time without alcohol than me. I also hope that doesn't sound self important, since I don't have a ton of time compared to a lot of people. I will say that I have had some great times in sobriety, it's just the last few months that have been rough. I'm sure I'm not the first person to run into the roadblock and obviously people do figure out a way to keep going.

Thanks for any help anyone has to offer, and for having a great community

I started drinking casually at parties when I was 16, and although I would get pretty drunk at those parties I never had any desire to drink at other times. This past year, during my sophomore year at college, I began to drink more frequently as I joined a frat and went out many nights a week. While my drinking was still limited to parties and social events where everyone else was drinking, I began to drink more to cope with stress and emotions. At home, I live solely with my dad (who I barely talk to) and most evenings/nights can be severely lonely as I thrive off of social interaction. I've begun to normalize drinking at home, and some weeks I drink 4 or so nights, which causes some alarm. While I do not believe I'm an alcoholic because I do not feel the need to drink during the day and do not find myself craving alcohol when I don't have it, and I never see alcohol as more important than academics and my relationships. I believe boredom/loneliness and easy access to alcohol has manifested into something that can develop into alcoholism down the road if I don't take caution. I am not looking to cut alcohol out of my life, but I want to stop drinking while at home during this pandemic so that it's not normalized when I'm in college.

But I try my hardest to pay back the love and support I have been given in this community. There isn't a chance I would be hitting any milestone or celebrating a sober birthday last week if it wasn't for you. I owe you all a lot. Because we are all anonymous strangers, this is sort of a thankless act that we are all performing. But it makes it more real to me. Even though I only know you by your handles, I have much love for all of you. This is the community of people that I was craving over the past several years and I'm glad I found you.

For those that are still lurking, pop in here and pull up a chair. We are all here to help in any way we can. This is completely judgment free. Chances are very good that whatever you are going through someone else here has gone through the same thing. And you never know when you might be able to help someone else as well.

It wouldn't help with the emotional pain, and it wouldn't help with the weight problem. Alcohol is almost entirely empty calories and stupidity in a glass bottle. I don't need either one.

I can generally get back on track once I realise what I'm doing is self destructive and in direct opposition to what I want for myself and I'll start back with the routines that keep my mind of the cravings (running  gardening, riding my bike and reading) but I feel like it's often just a matter of time before the next slip in a few months when someone innocuously offers me a drink and I say "" fuck it why not?"" and start the whole process over.

I guess what I'm trying to get at is that I need some help hardening my mental fortitude in situations where alcohol is going to be prevalent that I cant palm off and say no to (this last one was my sister's birthday and restrictions allowed people to have family affairs where I live).
I know I don't want to get drunk anymore but it's almost as if I go on autopilot and hard reset all the work I've put into not drinking when someone says ""would you like a beer, mate?""

Thanks again for being the support group I need to help keep me sober and healthy. I'm set to hit 142 days sober and I just wanted to share some incredible progress with you. Instead of drinking, I've taken up gardening, running, and yoga. I have more time to recover from workouts and build the life I've always wanted for myself. I was scared with lockdown that I would fall into bad habits, and some days, it's a huge temptation. 

I have found that overall, I have been able to ween off even near beers with some success, having more water and maybe a refreshing cup of tea in the evenings instead of what used to be several beers. I am able to focus on work better, my relationships have improved and grown, and I just enjoy life more. I find that the farther away I get from drinking, the less I want anything to do with it.

I have read more books than ever, slept better and I am dealing with my problems in more helpful, character building methods instead of drowning myself in booze and solving nothing.

Thank you for being here. Thank you always for your kindness and support. If you are struggling today, know you are not alone and there is light at the end of the tunnel.

My lifestyle is very stressful (full-time graduate school, working multiple jobs) and I also suffer from multiple mental illnesses which makes life hard. I was self-medicating through alcohol, and drinking to relax at the end of the day. One drink a night turned into two, then three, then four. I never felt I had a drinking problem because I could stop any time I wanted, the only thing was, I never wanted to. Occasionally I'd realize my drinking was getting out of hand and I'd stop drinking for a few days to even a couple of weeks. Inevitably, I'd always pick it back up. 

This year it began to spiral out of control. and Earlier this year I went through a very deep depression I was drinking multiple bottles of wine a day to cope. Then I moved onto hard liquor. I was able to maintain my busy lifestyle, but only barely. After about two months, I decided to drop the one class I was taking because I just couldn't get up early for it because I'd spend the entire night drinking. Did I quit then? Nope. I continued knocking back drinks every night. 

My drinking really took a turn for the worse when the pandemic hit and we were ordered into a shelter-in-place. Suddenly, I had an immense amount of free time. I began day-drinking to cope with the boredom. 

I reached a point last week where I was just sick of it. I was tired of feeling sick every morning. I was sick of always being tired. I hated that I needed to drink just to feel normal.

I am four days sober. The first three days were rough but today I'm feeling much better. My record for sobriety this year is four days and I know I will be beating that. I don't know how long I'm going to be sober. It should probably be forever because I really don't want to go down the destructive rabbit hole of alcoholism. I'm just taking it one day at a time. 

I do want to say that this subreddit has been very helpful so far. I needed to grocery shop yesterday and reading this beforehand stopped me from making an alcohol purchase.

Eventually, I got on top of it. With the same beautiful woman I am now married. And have three wonderful kids.

I drank throughout the first two growing up but it was never as much of a problem, only on a few occasions. On one occasion I blacked out, full of anxiety and vowed to never drink again. Nothing happened during the back out, just crippling anxiety the day after. 

Anyway, stayed sober for a year plus and during that time the third child was born. All good. Went on holiday, all inclusive, started to drink again. 

Since then, no black outs, no real anxiety.. Just excessive drinking. I can put the booze away and I don't black out and I don't  get any real hangovers. But it's creeping.

My wife can tell, I'm scared my kids are picking up on it. Nice weather and lockdown can mean i can put away a crate of beer during the day and vodka at night.. Get up in the morning and do it again.

I have a day off drinking and I get agitated. Just a few beers, I think. Like a crutch for the boredom, when in reality, it's all the same. I have a wonderful family and I don't need to drink.. I just feel like I'm losing grasp on it all and it's becoming a major problem again.. Which, I think it is. My self control is horrendous. My wife is really supportive, too supportive, maybe.

My new year's resolution was to wean myself off of drinking and be sober by summer. 3 days ago was my nexus and I have been done since then. Prior to this, I drank IPAs (high ABV like voodoo ranger) to the tune of 6-12 per week. Starting in January I cut down to sub 5 percent ABV and three days ago I made the leap to full sobriety.

My reasons were based on family history of addiction and fitness related. Military members need to pass fitness tests to remain in the service and alcohol is literally nothing but empty calories. 

It doesn't seem like I drank a lot because truthfully, two six packs per week isn't. But I wanted to get ahead of this before  I find out the hard way if I picked up the addiction trait. I wanted to make the decision for myself while it is still my conscious call to make. Also I wanted to do it while I still have no risk of withdrawal.

My marriage has been good and bad, then very bad and has been amazing the past few years. My home and my family are stable and safe and an absolute fuck ton of work, and I'm working myself to death to maintain everything I can. 

I put myself second to my family, in terms of priority,  so I don't take very good care of myself rn,but I still don't drink.

But when I did drink, I could sleep. When I  did drink, I  was functional, and could make things happen. I wasn't aware that I was falling apart because I could just avoid dealing with it because I could drink.

I'm still paying for all the damage drinking did, and how bad my health actually had gotten. I'm playing catch up with a lot of life lessons I didn't bother learning because I avoided emotional consequences. 

This had been the single biggest test of my willpower. The past 2 months have been a daily (some times hourly ) test of my resolve to stay sober.

More than ever, I need to help tomorrow-me cope with this. Today-me is temporary, but tomorrow-me is very real. Tomorrow still doesn't deserve the day long hangover. Tomorrow still needs clean clothes and a clean kitchen. Tomorrow deserves to be given a fresh start,  and not have to pay for my lapse in judgment today. 

I'm still not drinking, and I still won't tomorrow. 

I refuse to give up on having a good day I'm proud of, regardless of how far and few between the good days are, and how burnt out I've been. Today may be fucked, but tomorrow has a chance to be better, and I'm not going to ruin those chances.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5267149}"

My friend was insistent in coming to visit me this week and I welcomed her despite my fear of being tempted to drink.

I told her about my sobriety and she was supportive.

However, yesterday we were going for a bike ride when she was wanting to stop and get a beer. I joined her because I didn't want her to feel weird. I drank about five sips of a Corona before dumping the rest out (feeling guilty might I add). 

Flash forward to dinner. We were cooking steaks and having fun and she was enjoying some wine throughout. My mind was racing wondering ""what's the harm in one glass?"" Especially since I had a few sips of beer earlier in the day...
I obsessed over this until she finally asked me if I wanted some wine.

Out of instinct, without hesitation, I replied, ""I better not!""

And that was it. The rest of the night was easy and I stopped obsessing over the boose!

I had a previous stint off it for 5 months then moved to New Zealand for a working holiday, fell off the wagon on day 1 and spiralled for 2 months to the point of losing my job, almost losing my family and close to suicide. During the previous attempt I was a 'dry drunk', hiding my attempt to change and shutting myself in with limited social interaction, but this time decided to keep it going in perpetuity while making a conscious effort to keep an active social life. Not an easy task by any means (especially in lockdown) but long story short - best decision ever by miles. I've never felt sharper or had better mental clarity, I've avoided a lot of classic antics that come with travelling (haven't had to buy any new passports, wallets or keys), and the connections I've made with people feel a lot more genuine not relying on booze to socialise. 
Like others I'd drink to relax and ease social anxiety, even though it has the exact opposite effect on your mental health long term. Since abstaining that anxiety has been 100% eliminated; emotions are far more real, good and bad ones, but being so present is a gift in itself my overall self esteem has skyrocketed since. I initially felt self-conscious that people would judge or view me differently for not drinking. Two things; I was totally wrong, the response from almost everyone was overwhelmingly positive, and secondly, it doesn't even matter because other people's opinions mean absolutely nothing against your own inner voice. 
I could go on but I just want to highlight how this one change has led to a total reverse on some previously shitty aspects of my life. We all have our vices, but making just one change can bring out gifts and other aspects of your character that you never thought you had, or had in the past and thought were lost. It's helped me to rediscover the person I'm supposed to be, and embrace it with absolutely no apology.

I'm still here in New Zealand having a wonderful time (especially now that lockdown is over), happy at work, met some amazing people and feel I've transformed into a new man.

I don't miss it and so far I am ok to be around alcohol generally without issue.

However, with this new knowledge and perspective I am unsure how to manage my husband drinking. He is a ""normal"" drinker, able to have just one and be done. We used to have drinks together very frequently for the last 14 odd years.

However, because I now see alcohol as the a poisonous drug it is, I am struggling to be ok with him drinking booze. Say I am getting myself a beverage from the kitchen and he asks me to grab him a drink whilst I am there, I just wanna pour it all down the sink!

I don't want him drinking something so terrible! I wouldn't get him a needle full of heroin so why would I want him drinking another highly dangerous drug!?

I have been keeping my sobriety and newfound perspective quiet as I don't want to come across as a judgemental asshole. It's been business as usual and because he knows I am also dieting he doesn't bat an eyelid about me being teetotal. 

How do I balance not wanting to enable him drinking that shit, without being a holier-than-thou dick? I don't want to force him to change or anything, I just need to figure out how to manage the cognitive dissonance this is causing me.

***Edit: Thank you to those who have commented. Seems like the best way would be to just focus on improving myself right now. As some of you noted, my husband isnt a problem drinker, so it's not him I need to worry about ***",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.42525014}"

Alcohol hasn’t ruined my life, it hasn’t damaged my relationships or my career, my health seems fine. But I’m still an alcoholic. I’ve never said that aloud and I think a lot of people that know me would laugh that off and say “nah you’re just a fan of beer” or “you just like a few drinks on a night out” but that’s just because they don’t know about the bottle of wine I’d pick up every night on the way home from work that I’d hide in my bag. The empties I’d stash away in my room until there was no-one home and I’d take bags of bottles out to the recycling centre. They don’t know that I mostly drink wine over beer because it’s easier to hide. That I can slip a bottle in my bag without people noticing, that I switched to red wine so I could keep it in my room rather than the fridge. At work drinks I’d subtly smash back a few glasses and then head home and pretend I’d only had one and open another bottle. I stopped reading almost completely because I always drinking. A tricky morning at work would result in a glass of wine or two at lunch. I’d always justify it.

During lockdown I stopped drinking, I went a month without a single drink. I felt quite sick and woke up with blinding headaches every day for two weeks and I tried to justify that away as other things but I think it was withdrawal. It’s the first time I’ve gone more than a week without alcohol since I first started drinking at 17. And I’m proud of myself for stopping - it’s so much harder than when I quit smoking a year and a half ago and I still get cravings for cigarettes that keep me up at night so I know this will be a long round but I’m proud that I’m taking that first step even though I haven’t been able to tell anyone IRL.

I relapsed though on Sunday night. I’m at my parents house while they’re away for the week and my dad left two mostly full opened bottles of white wine in the fridge and said they need to drank in the next few days and I should’ve poured them down the sink but I didn’t. I waited until my dad left and I drank it all. I felt awful the next day, I was hungover, I’d stayed up half the night, I didn’t want to work and ended up taking the afternoon off sick. I don’t want to be that person. I need to stop for good, I can’t just have a couple of beers because I can’t stop. 

I’m done with this part of my life, I’m done with being an unproductive person who spends their evening getting drunk by themselves rewatching sitcoms on Netflix. I was so productive without it, I got back into reading serious novels rather than the trashy romance ones which were the only ones I read last year because they’re the only thing I can read half drunk.

Alcohol is 99% all this guy talks about. No matter what the subject matter is in a conversation with him he'll find a way to bring alcohol into it. Every single day he talks loudly with his internet buddies about drinking. As soon as I came in from work today he mentions how he felt betrayed that my bf poured his drink out last time he got drunk and fell asleep and 6 am. 

He drinks every weekend and always keeps booze around. This normally wouldn't be such an issue but no matter what I do I don't have a safe space, it's like when I'm at home I'm always surrounded by booze and constant chatter about booze. He is always talking loudly and excitedly about it every day of the week as long as he's awake. It's just getting to me more lately... 

It isn't even that he's an alcoholic like me. He never gets ""wasted"". He drinks a lot and you can barely tell I'm assuming because he's such a large man. Maybe if he did drink like I drink it would be easier to not be tempted to drink from watching him, because then I'd see what a train wreck it is. It's not that he drinks that's the problem, it's that drunk or sober it's all he talks about all day every day. 

I just feel less confident in my sobriety right now. The pull towards ""fuck it, drinking isn't even that big of a deal"" is getting stronger. I'm scared...

I tried to quit on New Year's of 2019, and I failed after two weeks. Somehow, I found this corner of Reddit full of fallen, broken, triumphant, and caring individuals struggling with the same fiend known as alcohol. I pledged and tried and failed, all the while gaining strength from this community. There's a line in an ancient Buddhist mantra: ""I go to refuge in the Sangha."" My visits here have been like that. By the end of 2019, you helped me know that I had the ability to let go.

My grandma--a mother figure who had shown me so much love--died on January 1st, 2020.  I still felt ready to quit, but I found myself steering toward the liquor store every day, despite my desire to the contrary. The age of 40 loomed, and I still hadn't found a way to stop depending on booze for everything. I wanted my three kids to grow up with a dad, and to see me as I truly am. I  did not want them to think that having a drink in their hand and a drug on their mind all the time was normal and inevitable--as I did.

Love for my kids, and a gift to myself, helped me stop drinking on February 7th, just about a month before I turned 40. I don't buy gifts for myself, but sobriety was the one thing I could give to me that I truly needed. I gave myself 30 days for my 40th. Now, day 100 happens to be on my son's 7th birthday. Maybe it's a poor gift because he should have had it in the first place, but I still feel glad to give my sober self to him. He and my family don't know about my offering. You do, and I thank you. 

Stephen King was right about how the recovering boozers of the world tend to have big hearts and caring souls. Maybe it's the struggle that makes you that way. Maybe a heart and soul like that is just more prone to injury to the point that we think poison is a balm. All I know is the correlation can't be a coincidence.

All these tricks, and all day long I am still so inescapably sad. I am tired of this violent emptiness. I’m tired of taking deep breaths before everything I do. Drinking doesn’t make me less sad; it makes the sadness feel relevant and gives me a hangover tomorrow to worry about instead. But it’s not a fix. Drinking makes living irrelevant. The sadness comes from somewhere else and drinking never helped me find it. It’s a well worn path I won’t walk anymore. So I didn’t drink tonight. I’m just going to sleep.

Long story short, I ended an 8+ year run with alcohol, and a pretty intense 1.5 with cocaine. I set clear and defined intentions about how I would proceed through life, and have now found myself in the situation I had always wanted for myself, but was so sure that it wasn’t possible for at least another 20 years. It’s been a whirlwind of a ride rediscovering the tiniest things in everyday life and how intensely I can feel emotions again and the wrangling of my ego. Recently, I’ve been struggling with the realization that in my conscious effort to be the person I want/choose to be, I’m not the person I used to be and my social life doesn’t connect with me any more. In fact, keeping up with it feels like it brings me down (on a day to day average). It’s not that they’re bad people, but I think the thing we all bonded through was the bar, and all the things that come with that alcohol centric life. I know after more time has passed this will seem more trivial, but it kind of just sucks right now. 

It makes me incredibly grateful for the few close friends I have made and reconnected with in this process.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

That I had pounded vodka drinks in a grocery store parking lot and come up with a bright idea that smoking pot in secret was a better alternative than drinking. Had a two day talk with my family and how I was going to do something different. I really thought I was going to and then COVID comes along and I delay going to AA or seeing a counselor.

I'm a student struggling with alcohol dependence. I've been in an in-patient program for 30 days about two years ago. Since covid and the quarantine, I've found it difficult to maintain a lifestyle with minimal drinking. I'm very close to losing friends and someone I love and am looking for support groups that may help at this point. I think I'm too stubborn to re-join AA as I am an atheist and have had genuine problems with AA's fundamental philosophies.

Mostly because I was out of my mind reaction wise and also because I was drunk and kept drinking and responding. Not good. 

My boss is also a really good friend, who since this all started has been absent in my life since I’ve backed down hours because of Corona. It’s a loss and it hurts. Abandonment is a huge painful point for me and I’m worried this is the end of our friendship. If not my employment. 

My coworker got called back in starting this weekend and I haven’t heard anything. It makes my life less stressful in some ways, because I don’t have to worry as much about putting myself in harms way and because I’m getting regular pay via unemployment. But I’m worried as to what this means moving forward. And I don’t even know what I want for the future either, which complicates things. 

I’m just depressed. I’m aimless in life. I’m confused and lost for direction. It’s a decently nice day and I’m just holed up inside. Been staying up until 2/3am and sleeping in until noon.

 Today I experienced a known trigger (anxiety) so I told my SO that I was going to head out to pick up a drink. She encouraged me to get smaller shots instead of something bigger. I appreciate her attempt at that but for me it’s either go all the way or don’t go.
So I left the house and parked in a parking lot 2 blocks from the liquor store where they know me far too well.  I sat there for a little while thinking things over. I knew walking out to my car that I didn’t want to drink, I wanted to ease my anxiety (drinking makes this worse of course I know). I thought to myself “what is it I’m after right now”? “Am I after the poison or am I after the release of this sensation of temporary desire to drink and my anxiety”?
So I ended up going to a head shop where they sell CBD gummy’s. I thought it was still shut down due to the closures but I thought “ I HAVE TO TRY”! Maybe I’d get lucky right? I knew that if I couldn’t get in I was gonna drink, fully aware that I didn’t want to.

No idea how long this will be, I've never written my thoughts out before and don't know how to start. 

I've been on a work trip for 9 days now, and I'm heading home tomorrow. I drank everyday while out here and I'm tired of this lifestyle. 

I met the love of my life almost 2 years ago, and the last few months have been rocky (both of us have personal issues to fight through right now, and Covid hasn't helped at all). The day before I left on this trip we broke up, and we've agreed to continue our lease together. I'm not sure what I will be getting home to, and that uncertainty has killed me this whole time. 

Alcohol has been a huge aspect of my life since I've turned 21, and its had nothing but negative effects. Any ""breaks"" I've had are always short lived and I fall right back into old habits and I'm sick of it. I've lost all motivation for the things I love, and self progression has been impossible. All of my relationships (romantic, friends, parents, professional) have suffered because i rely so much on numbing myself. All through my adolescence I've suffered with anxiety and depression, and alcoholism has inhibited my self growth. I've always known that, but apparently I haven't cared. 

When I get back home, I'm done. The woman mentioned before is worth everything to me, and if I don't kick this then I know I don't deserve her. Things between us may already be gone for good, but I'm holding on to the fact that I deserve a better life than what I've given myself regardless. I want to be happy again. I want to learn new things and be open to new experiences. Not just focus on the negatives and numbing the pain. 

I really hope this is the start of something new for me. I'm already scared of the damage that has been done to my body and I'm hoping it's not too late to turn things around. I want to live a healthy life. I know pretty much everyone else on this sub is trying for something better, and my heart feels for you. This shit is hard, but there has to be more than this.

Our first date was 03/13, right as the pandemic was really picking up. At the time, I had just gone 30 days without drinking so I figured I’d let myself kick back and drink. It’s a date right?

She didn’t know at the time but I had pregamed on an empty stomach. Drank 4-5 drinks during the evening. We called it a night at midnight and I went home to sloppily pour a few more drinks before texting her that I wanted to come over (I don’t remember this tbh.) I drove while blackout drunk and made it to her house.

Apparently I wasn’t a complete nightmare because she wanted to keep seeing me. We essentially started living together beyond that since the pandemic pushed us closer together. I started working from “home” and my drinking kicked right back into high gear. It was so much fun drinking with her! But I had no control. I began sneaking pulls from the vodka bottle at 10am due to work stress. By 3pm I would be gone. 

One night I was completely obliterated by late afternoon. I vomited all over the bed and myself and my clothes. I was gone behind the eyes; she knew at that point this was an issue. She had to give me, a grown man, a bath.

Since that point I’ve been alcohol free, am in DBT for my borderline personality disorder, and am honestly just kinda taking it one day at a time. I miss drinking a lot. But I “miss” myself more. I miss being in control of what I think and say when I’m drunk.

The first few months were really hard to transition because a lot of my friendships were based around drinking. Covid 19 lockdown came about just around the time I stopped drinking so it was really easy to commit because I didn't have social situations to tempt me (I'm very much a social drinker). But now I'm starting to struggle with the fact that the only socializing I do get is from my old drinking crew that wants to meet up for a drink and old friends that give me some crap for not drinking. And because of this whole pandemic it's not easy to get out there and make new friends.

With this sobriety has also come tons of realizations about myself, my family, my relationship, my friendships, my work and how I need to stop chasing money but instead chase fulfillment. Because of the pandemic I feel like I'm spinning my wheels with this new sobriety and way of thinking. I wasn't ready for the loneliness of a lockdown to coincide with the loneliness of sobriety. I've had a lot of good days since becoming sober, but the shitty days are really shit because there aren't many options for me to distract myself now that I can't drink.

Still drive by the spot relatively often so it’s never completely gone away. What a difference 24 months make. Seems like forever ago and just yesterday at the same time. 36 months ago, that’s when shit was real real. I honestly blocked a lot of how I felt during that time out. “That” time, the time before I almost died, seems like two lifetimes ago. That first hell was one thing. The hell of being an alcoholic. Everyday I’m hustlin’. It wears on you. And your health. And when the health gets worse, the hustle gets harder, and then you’re barely treading and then you know you’re drowning. At that point, where I was, drowning, I couldn’t hold my secrets together or my health; you have two options. One; admit you have a problem, admit it to someone else, and then begin to want to get better. Or, two; wait until your liver or some other vital organ forfeits your secret and you end up in an emergency room, if you’re lucky. I chose B obviously. So after that wake up call I was clean for a few months. I almost died. It scared the shit out of me! I figured I’d never want to drink again after that. 

Begin another chapter. People encouraged me to get help. I said I’d be fine. Well I wasn’t. In a few months I was back to it. Wtf!? And of course I got caught on to by my work and finally admitted to my wife that I was struggling with the bottle again. At which point I went and got help. 

Outpatient program. That was great and I thought I’d be okay... And I wasn’t. But I was. And then I wasn’t. It was that part, after rehab, which itself I honestly loved, I still had a few small relapses, quickies. Just a handful but those are the ones I can’t get over yet. I had it. I was there. But I just couldn’t finally say ENOUGH. I’d feel so terrible after those little slips. I had everything I want so close but I just couldn’t let myself go grab it. I still don’t know what was wrong with me. Anyways, one day, one last, it finally clicked in my brain and everything Changed. I’ve never been the same since. But it took almost 9 months after I first got sick. I wish I was celebrating my two years a few months ago. But I’m not. And that just fine. Because as long as I continue not drinking, I’ll be able to live whatever life I’m able to create for myself. It’s all right out in front of me now. That’s the thing about sobriety. It’s a fucking Rush. I feel so much more capable. Like I can imagine the kind of life I want and actually have some control in making decisions to help actualize it. That wasn’t possible as an alcoholic. 

So today I’m grateful for the Sun and Clouds that are keeping me cool and warm, pretty well balanced, on this fine Spring day.

Truly ready. I’ve done way to much damage to possibly think that it’s a good idea to keep drinking. A lot of you will never believe this, and I don’t think I do half the time because the only evidence of it actually happening is the police releasing me to my boyfriend. 

I started the night drinking with an old friend of mine, as the night went on drinking more and more. To the point of obvious black out. Apparently after making to the place we were going to pick up my boyfriend (friend driving, not me), we decided to stay and hang out with some other friends. 
I ended up (for god knows what reason) throwing myself on to the floor, rolling around, crying, screaming, the whole shebang. So I get kicked out. Kicker is, my boyfriend was aloud a ride home but not me. Keep in mind the walk would’ve taken me about 8 hours and I was absolutely obliterated. Never would have made it. So luckily my boyfriend said f*ck you guys, I’m not letting her walk home alone. So we began walking and I would take 6-7 stumbling steps and fall on my face. This continued for about a mile before I eventually just passed out on the pavement. My boyfriend then made the piss-poor decision to leave me there on the sidewalk hoping a Good Samaritan on their way to work would call the police and have me escorted home. Which of course he apologized for because, he too, was quite trashed. 
Here comes what I’d say is the “best” part of the story. I walked up to a house, (perhaps thinking it was mine?) and climbed in through a window after realizing the door was locked. I then found the closest bedroom, took off my shirt, and then began to cuddle with A 16 YEAR OLD GIRL. I’m a 21 y/o female, which might have been the only thing that saved my ass. I guess me and the girl laid there and talked for about 5-10 minutes before she went to go get her dad to come meet me because I was “cool”. So in comes dad, we actually talked for about 5-10 minutes too and he liked me as well. What we talked about, I’ll never know. He called the police to escort me home and never pressed charges.

I had an app on my phone that I used to keep track in the beginning.  I've used it less and less but look in occasionally to see where the tally is. I hit a year in March and I figured it would be a while until the next milestone of 18 months.... Then it popped up and brought me a smile. 

I do remember when a year seemed impossible. I wouldn' t even want to figure out how long 10,000 hours was. I also remember thinking I couldn't last a few hours, I check in and read stories on this thread to keep that memory fresh. 

It hasn't been the easiest time to stay sober. I don't want to throw away the time I have but man, its hard not to think it wouldn't really matter because I don't have a job to go to anyway. I know that it would matter. Its scares me to think about getting all of that anxiety back, those horrible feelings about myself and constant sense of everything is shitty. Life isn't perfect, far from, but I wouldn't be able to handle it in my old habits. 

I do struggle with a partner that still drinks and isn't always the most respectful about it. He hides it from me (partly bc I asked it not be around). I can always tell when he drinks. Plus, anyone who is an alcoholic knows, its about impossible to think of a hiding place that we haven't used. I still push forward, I still check into AA meetings on zoom, I still keep perspective and my biggest help is I still keep looking for the positives and practice gratitude.  I'm another one of those ""if I can do it, anyone can"".

Most of my friends use or drink in some capacity. Some more than others. I cut off the ones that are not supportive of my sobriety. I still feel a lot of strain though because the ways I connected with my friends and the ways they’re staying close with eachother during quarantine does often involve drinks and I just am not in a place to be around that yet. They’ve connected with me in other ways and when they’re sober, but I tend to have to ignore a lot or leave hang outs because it’s too hard for me to be around. 
It leaves me feeling really lonely. 

I am sober now because moderation never truly worked for me even though I thought it did. One out of every two “moderate” nights where I told myself I would only drink when I was with friends and only have a few always turned into something painful for everyone involved. 

The other connections I could reach out to... also make me want to drink. There are a few people in my life I no longer/minimally talk to (cousin, ex girlfriend, childhood best friends) that I know love me and would do everything in their power to support me but for some reason that just hurts me rather than makes me feel good. They just seem to exist in a different world than I do and seeing and talking to them reminds me of everything I don’t have, everything I threw away when I was lost in addiction, and everything I am not (even if those are just stories I tell myself, it’s the feeling it brings up and I cant help it). I know how badly I hurt them and what my decisions before I got clean and now sober did to them and can’t talk to them without being reminded even if I apologize and they say they forgive me. In trying to help there was a lot of hurt but I know they were trying their best to understand something extremely foreign to them and didn’t really know how to handle it. Even though these are the people I want the most, I can’t bring myself to make this connection.

I’m coming out of a long term relationship and I’ve been mulling over quite a lot of things about it as you’d expect. I thought alcohol was fine for a while in the relationship, but it sunk its roots in and became more of a coping mechanism for me, to avoid the issues that I really needed to address. I didn’t even realise this until the relationship ended and I’ve had time to reflect on it, sober. 

I’m a few days sober now and I honestly want it to last forever. Being sober has helped me reflect on my alcohol dependency, on my unhealthy coping mechanisms, and ultimately has helped me look at myself and who I am. 

Alcohol dulled my emotions for so long, but right now I’m feeling emotions stronger than I’ve felt in 10 years. They’re overwhelming and they’re terrifying but I wouldn’t change that at all. This is what it’s like to be human, and feeling these things mean I’m healthier.

I'm a professional chef and I drink.... a lot.

On the 1st of April 2019 I began what ended up being a 68 day clean streak. With all my newfound freetime and energy I began to really take exercising seriously and for bonus points I began eating a  \~%80 plant based diet. Needless to say I dropped weight and felt 10 years younger.  My sobriety didn't last and in October when my girlfriend left me for a coworker to put it simply I sort of spiralled out of control and began drinking on a daily basis constantly trying to fill the hole she left.  It dawned on me that my drinking (as I had suspected before this girl) had a TREMENDOUS amount to do with my pursuit of the opposite sex. When I'm together with someone my desire to drink is, or at least can be, greatly reduced....because I no longer need to constantly sell myself as charming and funny but also I simply don't see the need to go out and party as much.  As soon as I'm single it becomes *one and only* solution.

Today I woke up with blood on my face, I had lost my phone, and pissed off my roomates. Its clear I can't keep using this as my tactic to find a partner. Admittedly this ""tactic"" has been somewhat hindered in the last 50ish days for obvious reasons but I'm done with alcohol for a good long while starting today. It's simply not working and it's ruining what little self respect I have left.

She’s watched my dad abuse alcohol for decades, even though he’ll never admit it, and has worried about my drinking ever since she found out I started. And she was right to worry, I totally escalated to drinking a half a fifth of vodka almost every day for a few months.

I have known I needed to quit for years and never made it past a few weeks. I lost a really good job because of my resulting hangovers and poor health right before COVID and started doing the same thing again with my new job. I also fucked around on my derby career for two years because instead of working out and building my skills, I’d get drunk and eat garbage. I don’t like being unreliable. I definitely don’t like being so out of shape. 

So I started a “SobrieTEA” challenge where every day I post about the tea I’m drinking instead. It allowed my family and friends to see my commitment and support me even though we’re distant. It has worked out so well for me, highly recommend!💕🤘🏼💕

I’ve posted a couple of questions about successfully tapering - I know it’s not for everyone, but for health conditions, I feel it’s important for me. I’ve been dropping the amount by about a drink each night - I’m down to 3 oz that I WAY dilute - and have been pushing it later each day (5 pm used to be like the starting gun at a race for me, drinking until I passed out). Yesterday I had a HORRIBLE allergy attack (the farmer behind us mowed his field) - I was able to wait until 8 pm, then headed to bed a bit after 9.

But here was the small success I am pretty happy about - around 5 pm I was listening to This Naked Mind (with my tissues & tea, miserable), and I had family come in and interrupt me like half a dozen times. My kids are older and very supportive of my efforts, as is my husband - I’ve explained I just need the 30 minutes uninterrupted to focus on listening - yet my teens needed me over & over for silly stuff (“where is an embroidery needle?” Really?!). I was REALLY irritated - now, normally this would be my excuse for “screw it” - and I’d BS myself and say “I’ll do my taper right now”, knowing well & good in that brain-space, no way would I have stopped at just the taper amount. But I didn’t do that. I finished my chapters, then calmly (actually calmly) reminded each daughter & husband that I REALLY need to be able to concentrate while listening. So, yay for that.

Next - allergy headache still sucking (would love suggestions for a tea for headaches - because I took more Tylenol yesterday than I’d prefer), I tell my husband that I’m going to go ahead and just make the drink - this was a little past 8 (I was shooting for 9:30, but just wanted the day over I was feeling so crappy). We watched TV a bit - I took the hormone I’m supposed to take each night - about 9:30 I said I was headed to bed and just needed a bit of time to be able to fall asleep. 10 minutes later he comes in (I was about to doze off), starts all the “getting ready for bed stuff” that is banging doors, fluffing pillows, etc - I’m solidly awake now - I just sat up and stared at him - he stops....picks up his pillow, said “I’m going to go finish that show...I’ll let you fall asleep”. Ok, here is victory number 2 - normally I would have laid there for the 10 minutes it takes him to fall into a deep sleep, gotten back up - headed to the family room where I would have drank probably another 6 oz easily before passing out on the couch, feeling justified because “no one even considers my needs” I didn’t do that - I did a bunch of the deep breathing, calming stuff I’ve been reading about, and fell asleep. I vaguely remember him coming to bed a while later - much quieter. Slept all night.

My behaviors are changing - my thoughts are changing. I have never actually wanted alcohol out of my life before. I have hope! I did have show my husband actual medical articles for him to believe that tapering is actually a better option for me (I know it’s still going to suck for a few days/weeks - I need to avoid the hospital).

My family pissed me off repeatedly, normally I’d use that as an excuse to drink until passing out - I didn’t!",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44077796}"

I was newly divorced single dad and started working for a new company which is where I meant Archie. I was a big drinker and so was Archie nad it was discovered that we like to drink a shit ton everyday which is what we did. He was a dad as well though not single. We did end up having get togethers with the kids weekend camping boating trips, cook outs etc. So our friendship grew our drinking grew where we would try to outdo each other with the drink. Though after time our get togethers could become heated and at times volatile never physical but very heated verbal exchanges in which I can become very hurtful and cut through you with my words. After a few years of this we started hanging out less and less then I moved to Alabama for personal reasons. My drinking started to become more and more of a problem, I was depressed lonely, new job sucked, my daughters were not in my life as much it was a very dark time for me and I started drink myself to death on purpose, my daily thought was I do not care and even welcome the fact that I am ok. with not waking up the next day. There was nothing positive in my life at this time and I chose to make it much worse by drinking more and more. 

Jump to 2007 I started using positive thinking and being in the present something I saw on Oprah so I thought I will try this, well in the matter of a few months little things started to change, work got better, drank less, lost weight, got a huge raise, and meant my current wife on Myspace of all places. Anyway so many things changed within 6 months and trying this new process I took from watching Oprah. Now jump to 2015 I am still drinking just somewhat controlled now I don't want to mess up the good relationship I found and we were planning to marry next year she excepted the way I was and perhaps enable it even more. Well at this time Archie because or work moved a few hours from me and we started to reconnect every few months he would come up to my area and vise versa. These always ended up in 2 lost days and an argument that was not very pretty. My wife was scared of our friendship and wondered why we were even friends to begin with. I would tell her that I really did not know, only that we had this bond in the past back in Austin. So now jump to 2017 got married life was going well at home I still did not think there was a huge drinking problem I just drank everyday after work like my father and chilled out each night, I was a chilled happy drunk and did not cause any problems at home with my wife or on the outside in bars, restaurants etc. But I started to get really scared for myself and what I was doing and Dec. 2017 I decided 40 yrs of this was enough so I had my last drink Dec. 29th 2017. I told my friend Archie about this and he stated well its about time ok. I let that slide, felt like he was being judgy and how dare he. He kept wanting to get together and I told him when I am ready I will but it probably will be a year or more, I was in no rush to see Archie. In 2019 we meant up a couple of times for very brief visits and they went fine. I was not interested in reconnecting on a deeper level feeling that our friendship was most likely because of the drink. 

Recently he invited down to his place which is a few hours south of me but close to the Florida beaches I thought after being locked up in the house for 8weeks this would be a good time to reconnect and get on the beach for a day. I know this has been very long leading up to this but I do not have an editor in my life. Things went very well in the beginning Archie is a very good host and just a friendly guy. So catching up was nice it was good to talk to another human beyond my wife. Archie did start to have cocktails which does not bother me at all to be around it anymore but the beach day I got to see more of it, he got really loud when he talked, played music way to loud on the beach with folks right next to us, needless to say he had gotten pretty drunk and obnoxious throughout the rest of the day. To the point where I was saying in my head I need to leave and go home early and not see this guy anymore etc. It just got really bad and I could not hold my tongue any longer so I ripped into him and let him know what a loud obnoxious shit he was being. So yes I probably hurt his feelings and damaged whatever was left of this friendship but on the other side I am not sure if there was a friendship to begin with if it was not for the drink. Anyway the tag TWO OLD DRUNKS is right I am just not drinking anymore a day at a time. Being around him and also being in a beach bar with a bunch of other mostly loud  drunks put a fresh perspective of why I choose this sober life over my drunk life.

My sober tools right now are primarily this subreddit and a lot of podcasts while I hike. I keep hearing about how important community is on the path to sobriety. I haven't really told anyone in my life about it. I mentioned in a previous post about being in my own little sober quarantine bubble and how it's working for me.  I mentioned to a few friends I was just doing a month sober to ""reset."" That was to avoid  dealing with other peoples' feelings and justifications about their relationship to alcohol. Really, I don't want to drink again. I define whether or not my drinking is a problem and IT IS. 

I'm not ready to share my whole story but I need some support! I quit smoking cigarettes and drinking on the same day.  I had been weaning off cigs for a while and with a respiratory illness going around/ not being social it's been easier. However, my body is definitely having an adjustment period. Cigarettes and beer shits are a thing of the past :). 

I am super sensitive to body fluctuations. I had a severe eating disorder in my early 20s. My original drug of choice was food and I'm struggling not to transfer back to it. I went from food (quit that for a while) to being a pot head- quit that for good to alcohol and here I am. I realize there is an underlying mechanism happening here. I have done a lot of therapy in my life and know it's time to go back.

The good news is I am creating space to get in touch with my body everyday. I did a two week HIIT workout challenge which was amazing to see how much stronger I feel in just two weeks. I am training for thu hiking so am hiking around 30 miles a week plus walks for my dog. I am slowly getting into yoga and deep breathing.

I am trying to count calories but don't want to get neurotic about it. I remind myself being sober is the priority right now. Trying to be patient with my body and not freaking out about putting on last summer's clothes that are more snug than I remember. The whole I quit alcohol and lost weight thing is definitely not happening over here.

I have a million houseplants in every room & a million bird feeders on my patio. I have five aquariums, four cats, & five ferrets who run around freely & are potty-trained (mostly! 90%...haha).

No one knew but that doesn’t change a thing.,"I need to be real and write this down so if you read this I hope it helps you check in with yourself in a similar fashion.

When I quit (this time) my gut got really bloated and my upper abdomen was hurting. I thought it was food poisoning. Then I realized it was just my organs hurting. My pancreas in particular. I have not gone to the doc about it because I know, I know I can’t drink anymore.

Over the last two years I’ve eliminated any other health issues so I know it isn’t a rare disease, it is alcoholism. My nervous system is twitchy and my mind is depressed. It is alcoholism. 

I know because I didn’t enjoy drinking but I was drinking round the clock to stabilize my system. The last week, or maybe month, of drinking I was rotating from beer to wine to liquor to sake because I didn’t like any of it anymore. 

I woke up today feeling better about my situation but for me this is where I have slipped in the past. When I conveniently forget all the paranoia, the depression, the time spent googling diseases and the shaking. The time googling signs of an alcoholic so I could mask mine. My God the shaking. . . Fuck that noise. 

One drink isn’t a thing for me because my body has gone through enough. My mind has gone through enough. By not drinking I am healing myself and I never want to go back. Knowing how bad it can get I want to be an example to others to show a good, happy life without alcohol. I wish more people were examples of that in my past. I can be the example moving forward. I love myself and alcoholism was holding me back from being myself. 

Well, that was a bit depressing so. . .things to look forward to:

-spending time with loved ones without the fear and anxiety alcoholism brings with it

-playing music without the shakes

-drawing without the shakes

That’s it for now. If even just those three things happened in my life I would be ecstatic! The way to get there is the path I am on. I can’t see around the next bend so just for today—IWNDWYT",16,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5743936}"

I have been happier than I have been in years even with personal struggles and this friggin' pandemic. 
 
So anyway, here is my bitch list (and I am only complaining because you all mention these as positives of stopping drinking. Had you not told me, I wouldn't be upset!!) -
- My face is breaking out worse now that I am sober
- I now have restless arm syndrome (iron supplements have helped but it sucks)
- My bowel movements still suck and I have had a lot of IBS.  
- Only 3lbs of weight loss (although that is my own fault as I have been letting myself indulge when a craving hits. I thought you all were crazy talking about ice cream so much.. but ya'll know your shit)

Positives-
- I don't embarrass myself anymore!
- My husband seems more laid back around me!
- Sex life is improving
- I jam out to music again and dance while cooking.
- I have started walking every night I can and being more active overall
- I am not bloated anymore!  Although I haven't lost weight really, my face does look slimmer and my clothes fit differently!

I have problems with moderation, but it isn't so much the way that I behave when i'm drunk (Although that can be often be an issue), it is more the way the drinking affects me afterwards. I only drink on the weekends but the psychological effects of the hangovers last days, even weeks after the physical discomfort passes. It affects me in every area of my life.

I think about the amount of depressed Mondays I have taken off work because I got too fucked up on the Saturday. When I do show up to work I can't think properly and work well below my potential. It has made me an unreliable employee, especially in the last 2 jobs i've had.

I think about the Christmas days i've spent in bed instead of with my family because I had been drinking with my friends the night before. 

I have very little patience and snap at the people I care about. Things that aren't big issues seem like major issues in the moment and I end up blowing things way out of proportion and I lose my temper. My relationships suffer.

Any routines or positive gains I have made mentally are lost. It's like my mind gets wiped and I have to start all over again to regain the things I had worked so hard for. I'm letting myself down.

I'm feeling lost in life and I think that drinking has a big part to play. I'm in a dead end job that I hate. When I live to drink in the weekend and suffer for it during the week, of course i'm not going to feel ambitious enough to change anything.

I'm 25 and it feels difficult to imagine a life without drinking. I have been in a few different friend groups since high school and one thing that they have in common is that they all drink irresponsibly.  Binge drinking seems to be embedded in our culture and I find it strange how widely accepted it is. 

Drinking too much has always seemed to affect me more than my friends and because of this I find it difficult to communicate with them how serious I am about it. They seem to think it's funny when I try to explain to them whats going on because after a big night they can continue life as is if nothing happened. Its just normal.

I have tried to quit numerous time over the years but no matter how hard I try, it always seems to creep back into my life. I begin to feel like i'm missing out on something only to regret it when I spiral back to where I started from.

I can't say I wholeheartedly want to quit and this is a problem. Even though i'm aware of all the negative effects, I feel like if I were to stop drinking it would be ""social suicide"" but i'm starting to think thats a myth I have created. I think that maybe it is time to evaluate what is important to me.

&#x200B;

I have booked myself in for alcohol counseling again next week. This will be the second time I have tried this. I have a painting of a cowboy on my wall as a reminder; you've gotta get back on the horse that bucked you. 

If anyone around my age (or any age) has advice around some of the things I have mentioned, that would be greatly appreciated.

Let's talk about fiction world's as escape alternatives to chemically altering our consciousness. I think this is especially important now while so many of us are stuck at home all of the time and I hope you guys are able to find some relief there. 

Onee reason I became such a big reader in my childhood was that it helped me mentally escape from the tiny and smothering household of religious fundamentalism I grew up in. My TV habits were scrutinized closely and I wasn't allowed to watch a lot of stuff that other kids were, but my parents, who had never been big readers themselves, didn't seem to be aware that books had a lot of content that wouldn't pass muster if they had bothered to check what was in them. So I read a lot, not necessarily to read ""naughty"" things, though I'll admit I enjoyed that aspect of it, but because having a library card and it being the 70s/80s and not being allowed to watch much of the tiny amount of TV that was on, there was simply a LOT more available in books. 

In sobriety, I'm also able to use books as an escape and I feel very grateful for that. Sometimes it's important for us to sit with our feelings, do the work, all that jazz, but sometimes we do just need to give our minds a break. 

Yesterday I had the worst day at work I've had in years (and if you know my post/comment history, you know this is saying something because I really struggle at that job). I had a shouting match with a vicious co-worker who has treated me terribly the entire 4 years I've worked at this place. I'm not a fighter, not a shouter, and it scared me to death and rattled me to my core. A normal person would have dreamed about getting home to make a stiff cocktail, and believe me, it crossed my mind, but I dreamed about getting home and into a book and I believe having that sort of alternative escape makes days like that bearable. 

During this quarantine I've really enjoyed escaping reality into good books. I see a lot of amazing things online lately to help with the psychological burdens of quarantine like virtual tours of museums or architectural gems and I think those are awesome, but they don't work for me. I need to immerse in a fictive world, get into someone else's head entirely, to feel like I've really gone somewhere else. It doesn't have to be a glamorous world-- I read Knut Hamson's *Growth of the Soil* last week which was decidedly unglamorous but I really felt like I was in late 19th century Norway and as such really far from reality-- but sometimes any world other than this real one will do.

   I guess it takes something really painful physically and emotionally for me to take sobriety seriously. My badge says 599, it's not true. I'm awaiting on a reset. 

I've got fucking GOUT! I'm 36yo and have had 2 massively painful flare ups in the last 3 months lasting for days. It's so unbelievably painful. I can't sleep, I can barely walk, and my foot is on fire 24/7. I've been taking Ibuprofen, massaging it, icing it, and drinking tart cherry juice. My main concern is the frequency I've had it now. 
I feel like it's my punshiment for ignoring the signs and pretending I can drink like this forever. My body telling me what everyone else in my life has been telling me for years. I am committing slow suicide. 

I'm diet isn't the best either. I drink so much sugary vodka that I'm hardly eating. At least 5-6 nips a day. Maybe a beer or two as well. For years. I have night sweats and shaking morning hands. Constantly hurting myself or feeling sick. I can't fucking take it anymore. 

Aside from that, my wife has pretty much resigned herself to the fact that I'm going to drink till I die. Which might be a lot sooner than I thought based off my own diagnosis. She's terrified but she knows there's nothing she can do but support my want to get sober. Our sex life has become a shit show because I'm always too drink to have sex or give her what she needs. Attention, affection, energy. I sneak around the house sipping on nips after work and by 8pm I'm always drunk. I'm done with this shit. I don't want to die. 

A lot of my drinking stems from bouts of depression and anxiety all going back 18 years to after I was violently sexually assualted in college. There's probably less than 30 days of not drinking in all those years. Depression makes me drink, the drink makes me more depressed. Never ending cycle. And I can't take depression meds while drinking so it's obvious what I need. I need a truama/substance abuse  counselor. I need to taper off so I don't die of withdrawals, and I need to quit drinking forever. I don't want to die yet. 

So today's day One again. My longest streak of sobriety was 9 days. My goal right now is just Today. Followed by forever.

There are probably hundreds of these posts on this sub, but I hope it will help me in the long run to create my own. I am very worried I am becoming a full blown alcoholic.

So here 's my situation. I am in my twenties and still living at home with my parents. I failed colleged when I was 18 and started working after that. Next year I will go to college again so this really is the time to sort things out.

I started drinking around the time I failed college. In hindsight it was probably to deal with the anxiety and stress of not knowing what to do next. As every problem drinker, it started small. Maybe a few beers more then I usually drank. I also lost my friends around that time, so that meant I started drinking alone. 

Over time this quickly spiralled out of control to where I am right now. I now drink every day until I am in a buzz and forget about pain in my life. I prefer Vodka or Whiskey but I drink whatever is around. The strange thing is that my family probably don't realise I have such a big problem with alcohol. I am one of those people that can hide being drunk very well. They also drink more then average so I guess that's also a reason they don't notice.

The reason I post this right now is because yesterday I completely passed out after heavy drinking again.  I drank around half a bottle of vodka and a few glasses wine. I am so very sick of my inabillity to control my drinking. Every morning is hell and I feel awfull and embarassed. I want to stop drinking alltogether because I just can't limit alcohol to a few drinks. When I start with one drink, I can't stop.

Today I got stressed out so I drove to get a bottle of tequila. I didn’t need to buy a bottle, but drinking to alleviate the stress seemed like the only option. 
It did the trick that’s for sure. 
I’m 24 and still live with my parents and my sister. My sister’s girlfriend lives with us also. The household is a toxic hellhole created by my narcissistic father. And my mom and sister both are chronically ill. 
I absolutely hate being intoxicated around them. It feels so shitty to wake up in the morning after heavy drinking and not remember what I said or did. I’m not an angry drunk by any means. However, they have seen me stumbling around and slurring my words etc. to many times.

I’ve also been a daily smoker of thc concentrates for the past 5-6 years. I’m attempting my best at quitting cold turkey so I can find a better job. 
Currently fortunate to qualify for unemployment due to the COVID pandemic. 
I don’t want to go back to my previous workplace because it was such a big cause for drinking. 
I want to move out desperately but can’t because I’m currently jobless and usually that is a deal breaker for renters or property managers. 

I can’t seem to be able to stop drinking and it’s a cause for concern. I have read tragic stories about others on this sub losing loved ones due to alcoholism. 
Hell, my best friends cousin passed away earlier this year due to liver cirrhosis. And yes it was because of alcoholism. 
Anyway, just wanted to vent I guess.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**Daring Greatly…In The Arena**

Many times, we see people upset they’ve had to reset their badge, post after a relapse, or taking criticism from unsupportive people in their lives while struggling to stay sober. Seemingly the rest of the world is at odds with our goal of breaking free from the chains of alcohol. 

I believe those of us fighting for sobriety, our health, our relationships, and our futures are the brave, the strong, and the courageous. We dare to defy the odds against us. Our failures fuel our resolve. Our resilience is obvious, if only to those of us in the arena.

Today's words for thought:

>”It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The **credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,** whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, **if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly**, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” - Theodore Roosevelt, (also within *Daring Greatly* by Brene Brown)

You, my SD Friends, are #**Daring Greatly. You are IN. THE. ARENA!**

But right now I really have a question regarding somebody else. My family member is a very combative and very emotional and sometimes violent drunk. He stuggles with a lot of sadness and anger that he tries to hide in his day to day, but 9 out of 10 times it all comes tumbling out in some form or another when he's drunk enough, and he does really terrible things. I think that he needs to talk to somebody, and he needs to quit drinking and I think he knows that too because he said he does to another family member a few weeks ago when he was blackout, but when it was brought up again the next day he was adimently against it. I think he's terrified of the stigma, and he's so guarded that it comes out in just ""fuck you"" arrogance if somebody gets too close to the topic. All I can do is be there for him when he's spiraling out and let him know that I care when he says nobody else does, but I'm so worried about him.
I guess I'm asking if theres anybody else here that either has delt with a similar situation, or used to be in this person's shoes/mindset and how did you deal with it or what finally got you to let down your guard and take that first step?",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7045636}"

A few things happened at the beginning of this year where I acted really shitty to people while blackout drunk that helped break some of the appeal of alcohol for me. Still, I kept drinking nightly, partially to avoid facing the shame. I've been to detox before, but I wasn't committed at all and I went back to drinking almost immediately after. I've faced some consequences for my drinking, although I've gotten away with a lot more than I should have and have been able to mostly hide my problems and keep drinking.

Then, quarantine hit and it became harder to access alcohol. I felt guilty going to liquor stores when I'm not essential and can mostly avoid leaving my house (obviously groceries are different but most grocery stores don't sell alcohol where I live). It forced me to suddenly cut back on my drinking and start relearning how to have a night without alcohol. I noticed some of the perks of sobriety, like how much longer my days feel and how much better my skin is. I also began to see a path where I won't need alcohol every day, which brought me here.

A few days ago I was having a shitty day, went out to buy alcohol, and have been binge drinking since. I started waking up again with horrible hangovers to quickly check my phone and make sure I didn't text anyone while I was blacked out. One of the scariest things I've found with my drinking is that I can blackout and still keep drinking more. 

Last night was awful, so now I'm here, hoping to try to get sober longterm for the first time since I first started drinking. I haven't had a healthy relationship with alcohol since the first sips as a teen. With that in mind, I'm just going to focus on drinking an absolutely excessive amount of seltzer and finding other things to look forward to. 

I hope everyone is having a nice night. IWNDWYT.",1,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5581523}"

But here's my story. I've been heavy into drinking, like chasing vodka with beer every single night when I get off work. My girlfriend of 2 years has been sober for about 6 years now but she said she didn't mind that I drank at the beginning of our relationship so I thought it was fine that I did.

This past weekend, I got some jealousy issues because one of her exes was wanting her to go over to his place, I just shrugged it off like I normally do. The next day, she went to hangout with her best friend and it was about 1ish in the morning and I was wondering if she was coming home soon. I called her and she said that she was at her exes with her best friend which consumed me with rage since I was already drinking. I kept drinking more and she eventually came home and I completely lost it and said I was done with this she never shows me affection and all these horrible things.

The next day, I couldn't even remember everything I said and she comes to me and tells me she doesn't want to do this anymore and deal with my drinking every single night.

I've been wanting to quit and I am now 48 hours sober, I'm trying to patch things up with my girl but I think it's a lost cause at this point. Any help or advice about anything would be much appreciated",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42791265}"

Always alone in my own head.,"I drink because I'm bored. I drink because I'm anxious. I drink because ""Well, there's nothing better to do, is there?"" I work in the alcohol industry, and I drink because that's what we do.

I've tried to read books on the subject. I was alcohol free for almost 6 months once, working retail. Then I went back to working at a brewpub and there went sobriety.

Now I'm in the middle of an extremely stressful period and living alone without roommates for the first time. I was dry for two months after being furloughed and staying with my boyfriend, then in 5 days after starting to live/drink by myself, I drank two fifths of vodka and a twelve pack of hard seltzer. If I don't stop, I will definitely die. I can't do it alone and my boyfriend doesn't deserve to have to support me like he has.

I called and left a message with a therapist this morning. I'll try again here in a bit, and again in the morning. If he doesn't call back then, I'll go to the next on the list. For today, I will not drink with you.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.76077515}"
2020-05-18 19:27:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gmcw74/made_it_six_months/,Made it six months!,"Today marks six months since I stopped drinking. My brand of alcoholism is binge drinking; when I stopped, I was drinking entire cases of beer, smoking almost entire packs of cigarettes, over the course of a few evening hours, two or three times a week, and spending the rest of my time totally fucking miserable. I started spending a lot of time on this subreddit, mostly reading about everyone else's experiences and learning. One important thing I've learned here is that while our particular manifestations of alcoholism are often unique, our subjective emotional experiences of it often seem remarkably similar. I made many ""attempts"" at sobriety, and all failed after about two weeks. Some after a couple days. It was impossible for me to believe that I was capable of stopping, and I frequently considered suicide just because I was sick of being a slave.

But I started talking about it a little bit to my family and friends. Nothing serious, but everyone knew I was a heavy drinker so I think nobody was surprised when I would make little ""jokes"" about being an alcoholic, or suggesting out loud that I really needed to stop drinking. After some months of being just a little more open about my struggles with those closest to me, and having been met with care and offers for support, I was starting to feel more comfortable with the idea of giving sobriety a real shot, and I had my ""last night."" I didn't know, as I put back drink after drink that night, that those were the last drinks I would have. I think the best way to describe what was different about this time was that I was just so totally sick of it, sick of how it made me feel, sick of how it seemed like I was willfully destroying my own life. Every sip I would take, I hated it. I was so over it, man. So over it. I know that many people here know exactly what I mean by that; some of you are probably in the middle of that feeling right now. I also think that being a little more open with my family and close friends made me start to care about not ""letting them down"" by continuing down my path of self-destruction. I think highly of those people, and I wanted them to think highly of me as well. I remember reading posts on this sub from people in their 50s, 60s, even older, who said that they wished they had gotten sober when they were younger. That it would have saved them decades of pain. And I realized that that was where I headed, so six months ago, at 30 years old, I stopped.

I started exercising a little bit. Every other day, if I could bring myself to it. Fifteen minutes, literally. If I felt like drinking, I pigged out on some junk food instead. Entire case of beer? No. Entire bag of chocolate mini-donuts instead? Hell yeah! I smoked cannabis as well, which went great with the junk food and I think helped take the edge off a bit on those inevitable darker days when I would start to get notions of abandoning the plan. I focused on my studies as well as I could, but I made staying sober my Main Priority, and allowed myself to blow off certain academic responsibilities if I felt like it, as long as I didn't drink alcohol. Grades this semester weren't my finest, but I am still sober, and I am still here.

Yesterday was the last day of my first six months without alcohol. Today is the first day of my next six months. My skin is clear. I've lost >30 lbs. I'm still doing my every-other-day basic exercise, a 15 minute run. Any amount of exercise feels like a little victory and makes the whole day easier. I haven't been in such good shape (or such a good mood) since high school. Next year I will start earning credits for a PhD.

I do miss it sometimes. Often, even. I think it's important to acknowledge that. I do get these thoughts in my head from time to time, that maybe the battle is won. That I have proven that I can in fact control my drinking, and I am therefore cured. But I've seen more than enough ""field research"" posts on this subreddit to fall into that stupid trap. All those brave /r/stopdrinking pioneers who have gone before me and asked the question, ""Am I still an alcoholic?"" by resuming drinking have come back with the same definitive answer: ""Yes."" I choose to learn from their experience; to believe and accept that abstinence is the only freedom from alcoholism that folks like us are able to know. And that's okay.

Who needs alcohol anyway? Nobody does. You don't. I don't. Alcoholism is a really hard thing to have to experience. It can make you feel worthless, hopeless, powerless. I get it, and probably so does everyone reading and posting here. If you're reading this and struggling to stay sober right now, please believe me when I tell you that you're stronger than you think you are, and if you want to be free from it, you can be, and you will.",56,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.60157675}"

This attempt feels different and I'm doing a LOT of work to resolve my issues and explore impulse control/ cognitive behavior modification, but let's move onto something less heavy.

We all know the critical reasons to stop drinking: mental and physical health. Relationships and family. Career. But what are some of the less serious yet compelling reasons you're trying to get sober? Or what are some of the goofier, more light-hearted benefits of sobriety? 

Here are some of mine:
- My dreams are BUCKWILD and memorable if I'm able to actually sleep and not wake up to run to the bathroom or have a panic attack
- My dirty laundry doesn't smell weird
- The dogs are more affectionate when I'm not lurching around like Frankenstein's monster
- I love playing with makeup and my face looks a lot better when there isn't a shaky hand working on a bloated canvas
- Being able to throw around heavier weights while working out sober is so rewarding. I've never set a personal record while hung over (if I even feel capable of exercise)
- As I drift out of those horrible detox symptoms, my energy comes back full force and it is such. A. Gift. Can't believe how much shit I get done around the house in sobriety. The garden looks amazing and my windows are so freaking clean
- More disposable income = not feeling guilty about buying a fun summer dress or a block of fancy cheese old enough to have a driver's license

I have thought about them on and off since then to varying degrees. I wasn't sure if I was more afraid I would use them or dump them.

This past week has been especially difficult, and even though I cried while doing it, I finally dumped them today. I knew I was gonna take them if I didn't. It was hard to get rid of them and part of me still thinks it was stupid to waste them, but now they're gone and I can't take them if I wanted to and part of me really wanted to.

But during this pandemic, things got to a whole new level. I have been having a bottle of wine or 2, to myself, per night. I don't remember the next day and I feel like shit. I smoke a pack a day. Everything just slid so far down, so fast. 

My boyfriend and I have been discussing a family for a while. Since this pandemic he said he wants to see me quit smoking and drinking before we consider even trying for a child. He is worried that if these are my responses or mechanisms for dealing with high stress situations, what can happen with a pregnancy? I know he's right, but it hurt so bad. And I hated myself for it, for him being right. 

What did I do? I drank. 2 bottles. I fell asleep but woke up in a panic attack mode screaming I wanted to die. I went to the bathroom and I took my haircutting scissors and just wanted to feel something sharp on my skin instead of pain in my heart. It was a long cut, because I went too deep the skin pulled apart, he came in, I got scared. It was still bleeding this morning through the bandages.

All I know is..the more I hate myself, the more I want to destroy myself. But not at the cost of my future, and family. I have to replace the ways I cope. And please dont say exercise and walking. Id like something to do to cope during stress that i dont hate with a passion.

I had done a year previously but it was a sort of ""there's lots of shit going on and I'm just going to cut it all out."" kind of year. After that year I thought, ""you know, I did a year, that was a pretty good show of control so I'm just going to do one or two NICE beers instead of 19 bud lights"" and that well, didn't work. So after a break up and an alcohol fueled rebound I decided enough was enough, and May 1 2019 I decided to stop. Not for a year, just to stop. I don't like to think of it in terms of ""forever"" because forever is a long time and thinking of it gets overwhelming. So one day at a time.

This is when the honeymoon phase of looking good and feeling good kind of went away and I realized I had no idea who I was anymore.

I was averaging 15 beers a day, so it was a big part of my life.  

Fortunately, I've found that I'm actually more fulfilled without than I was with the alcohol.  

I've found I'm happier, calmer, more level headed.  I feel a hundred million times better physically.  I've lost 18 pounds.  I've learned a lot about myself in a different frame of view.  Way more productive. 

I still have some stressful days.  On rare occasion I think ""maybe just a drink""...then I realize all I went through.  I still battle with that constant fidgety anxiety that was half the reason I drank I'm convinced.  I used to use soda as the fix.  Not as interested in that anymore now that I'm almost 40.  Times are tight or I'd probably have a CBD dry herb vape and try that.  That fidgeting may be my next big thing to try and overcome because it has led to some poor habits to try and satiate it.  

The other half of drinking was trauma.  Fraud, relationships, career loss, hoarding.  I've been able to work through 90% of that.  The weight was so incredibly heavy.  It all took years off my life in dealing with it.  

I looked back through old fb messages the other day.  The alcohol was doing a lot of talking for me to people.  Some I've told.  Some probably figured something was up.  Some probably don't know and just assume I was being an ass.  It's probably time to start letting some of them know what happened.  

If you are still drinking yourself, you wont regret stopping.  It wont magically fix everything right away, but it certainly wont make it worse either.  You have to have that moment that says ""this is the time"" or you probably won't make it.  I remember saying a couple times ""this is the last 18 pack then im done""...but I never made it past two days sober then.

We couldn’t get through to him, he left our messages on read and wouldn’t answer the door. 


At the same time he relapsed, I got sober, this happened 6 months ago. I keep thinking of that Robert Frost poem “two roads diverged in a yellow wood” where he went down one path and I chose the other. There’s zero doubt if I kept drinking, I’d be dead, the damage to my body was building up and I entered psychosis (I have many mental illnesses). What saved me was medication, while stabilized me enough to get sober. 


I keep thinking of what if’s. I know he read my messages and he knew if he reached out we would all answer, we’d take him to meetings, detox, or even just listen to him. He was in so much pain, and very very sick. Something I learned in rehab, which is how we met, was that you can’t expect something from someone who can’t give it. I’m not angry at him because I know that if he was well, he’d have sought help. But he couldn’t, and that’s because of how evil alcoholism is. It stole everything from him. He was in a healthy relationship, had just started a business and was actively volunteering to help newly sober people find their way. He’d give you the shirt off his back if you needed it.


He died alone, in a dark house surrounded by empty bottles. It was drawn out. He suffered the whole time. How long did he lay there, dead on the floor before someone noticed? Before he was found?


Today is a nice day out, great weather, warm. I wish he was here to see it. I had held out hoping he would eventually reach out, that something might change, that he would be saved.

27F, and have been drinking every night for about 7 years-usually a bottle of wine, or 2, but anything would really suffice. I have alcoholics in my family but I never thought much about it. It started socially in high school and college, gradually turning into binging on weekends. I started drinking alone when I moved out, and when I moved back home is when my drinking turned into a nighttime routine. I would lock myself in my room with a bottle of wine, turn on a show, and pass out on my bed. I didn't care if my mom found me the next morning on top of my covers, in yesterday's clothes. I hated myself. A bottle of malbec was familiar, dependable, and always put me to sleep. I started calculating my route home from work, making sure I had enough time to stock up at the liquor store before closing time. I could tell the staff were looking at me like I was a regular, but it didn't stop me from going in every day. I was still functioning, held a job, had a relationship (and kept my drinking a secret from them), went back to school, and put myself through a degree. And here I am; recently laid off, self-isolating. I'm now with a partner who loves me to bits, and still drinking 1-2 bottles of wine a night. Recently, I've been drinking box wine (so nobody can see how much I've actually consumed) in the morning while he sleeps in..I know I need to stop. I'm not happy, I depend on it for so many things, and having this time to myself without the responsibilities of work has put a lot into perspective for me. 

The last time I didn't go to bed drunk and stopped drinking was for a week in 2017, and before then was a week in 2016 because I was on medication. I remember feeling great, no withdrawal symptoms besides anxiety, moodiness, and some trouble sleeping. I broke my sobriety because some college roommates were in town for a reunion. I remember going to the wine store and buying it 'just in case'. I didn't even want it. I had a few drinks and went to bed, but the next day I returned to my old habits. 

If you made it this far through, thank you for hearing me out. If you have any advice I would love to hear it! I'm a little nervous about potential withdrawal symptoms...I've been up for hours now and haven't had a drink since last night.

Regardless of the fact that I've been vocal about drinking being a problem for me and that I don't want to do it anymore, I still find an excuse to drink as soon as the weekend comes around. I'm having a lot of trouble creating and maintaining boundaries and sticking to them. I feel weak. I feel scared. I feel like I can't stop, and like it's the only thing that will make the grief I'm feeling silence itself. And I know it just makes it worse after. I KNOW that. But this disease isn't logical. 

Ive been drinking heavily almost every weekend for the last three months, after the death of my friend and the split with my partner, which happened a week after. Over the last week, after I heard about my eviction, I drank every night. Im working from home at the moment, but I was so hungover midweek that I couldn't even manage to work from my couch and had to take a sick day... something I haven't done since August of last year when I first embarked on my journey toward sobriety. I felt so ashamed. 

On Friday, I finally found a place and signed a lease, but what did I do? I ""celebrated"" all weekend instead of packing or being productive. I prioritized my addiction. I drank all day long each day. Each day I woke up with a terrible hangover, and each day I drank it away. I feel like absolute trash today - anxious, shaky, depressed, nauseated, overwhelmed. I haven't slept properly in over a week and tossed and turned with hangover anxiety the last 3 nights. I hate feeling like this. So, here I am. Day 1 all over again, and just hurting so badly - mentally, physically, and emotionally. 

Wish me luck. And thank you for listening. ❤

2020-05-18 09:03:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gm1231/i_quit_i_feel_weird/,I Quit. I feel weird.,"I come from 2 long lines of alcoholics. I've always known I should be careful with it, and held off until 21 to start drinking, which evolved to ""social drinking"" and then pretty much ""functional alcoholic.""

I'm 33 now, and a wife, and a mom. My husband is also a drinker but he's not on the same journey I am. I significantly slowed down on my binge drinking last summer after a particularly bad night that led to a nasty fight with my husband (both of us were drunk) and a 2 day hangover. I no longer felt like I had control over ""who"" would come out when I was drinking - would it be happy to lucky me? Or maybe brave adventurous me? Or mean, nasty, angry me? 

I found this subreddit the next day, and I considered quitting, and I did for a week or two. Then I decided to try to moderate my drinking instead. It worked! It's been almost a year and we haven't had any more drunken fights. I haven't had more than 3 drinks in a day except for once or twice in very happy situations. I haven't been hungover. I have been so proud of myself that I have been able to say no, and stop myself, even when we're out with friends and I desperately missed that social lubrication. 

But now, my dad is sick. The doctors were looking at maybe some sort of gluten allergy, but as they rule things out it's looking more and more likely that it's liver cirrhosis. Possibly moderate damage, which is probably irreversible. COVID-19 has slowed down the speed of all the testing, so we're still waiting on the scan to help confirm the diagnosis. 

My dad has always been the best type of functional alcoholic. At his worst he was probably drinking 15-20 beers a day, plus shots. But he is the most loving, generous, friendliest, nicest guy around. He's my best friend. He's been slowly cutting back over the last few years, but has been told he needs to quit drinking completely - and thats when I decided it was my time to quit too. He's still working on quitting completely, but he never drinks more than 2 beers a day now, and does not drink most days. I am so very proud of him. 

Today I am 18 days alcohol free. I have not committed to this being ""forever"" or ""never drinking again"", but taking it day by day. My biggest motivation is me telling myself that dad could need a liver transplant, and we'll both need to be alcohol free if I want to give him part of my liver. I'm honestly not sure if that will be necessary or possible, but making it ""bigger than myself"" makes it easier. 

I'm not noticing any health changes, likely because I had already significantly lowered the amount of my drinking over the last 10 months. I had pretty significant ""cravings"" on Saturday because it was gorgeous out and I was having a stressful day... but I resisted because I don't want to ""give in"" on a bad day - I know it's not a healthy way to deal with things, and I need to be able to handle a stressful day without going straight to the fridge.

I'm mostly worried about the beautiful weather approaching and my love of craft beer. I enjoy the taste of beer, and I love sitting in a sunny beer garden and trying fruit beers. But I've found that I also love lime soda water with lime, and that gives me something fizzy to drink during the summer. 

The best thing I've learned from this subreddit is to continue to take it one day at a time. That's all I can do for now.

Thanks for listening. I felt I needed to get some thoughts out to people that ""get it"".

I was sober for three months a while back. Started again because boyfriend missed the nights of drinking together. Stupid. Those fun nights turned very quickly to grabbing every straw as an excuse to drink, drinking massive amounts alone. It's embarrasing.

Trintellix aka. Vortioxetine),"I'm a 29 year-old guy who has struggled with drinking and mental illness for a long time. I've always had issues with anxiety, depression, body image, etc. and i've always been a big drinker.. but it all became a lot worse when I witnessed a very violent crime 5 years ago. My mental health and my drinking got rapidly worse. I started self-harming, I was hospitalised several times and I was diagnosed with bipolar and PTSD. I went on and off different psych meds and ""got better"" and then slid backwards several times. It's been a tough time. Ruined relationships, financial problems, blah blah blah.. you've heard it all before!

Flash forward to May 2020 and I've decided to embark on a journey of sobriety (yet again!), but this time i'm much more serious and much more determined. I've started back on an antidepressant (Vortioxetine, aka. ""Brintellix"" or ""Trintellix"") on top of the mood stabiliser i've been on for quite some time (Lithium). I've been on many different psych meds and they always advise to abstain from alcohol whilst taking them, but i've never really taken that seriously. My addiction has been far too powerful. But this time I've decided to stay completely sober for the duration of my first box of the medication (28 doses = 28 days). I'm using this as a catalyst for trying my best at sobriety for the first time in years. I'm 4 days in and I feel great! No cravings yet, a few odd but manageable side effects from the meds, feeling optimistic but obviously still very fearful about the future.

Does anyone else have any experiences with quitting drinking and starting a new psych medication at the same time? Do antidepressants (or similar) make it easier to go sober? It's going to be very hard to tell whether i'm feeling better because of the meds or because of being sober, but I don't really care. I just NEED to feel and BE better...

After many times of quitting drinking for a few months at a time and then for one reason or another quickly falling back into my old habits and routines with drinking destructively, I realize that I am an alcoholic/general addict and that this cycle will continue without outside intervention and work of some kind. This is a huge revelation for me and I feel vulnerable but proud to be admitting it ""out loud"" to anyone, but I know it to be true and this is the first step to legitimately working on sobriety instead of making excuses for myself or sidestepping the issue.

My problem is that I'm not sure what form that outside help should take. A close family member has found a lot of success with AA and is taking great steps in his personal life through the program, and I am grateful it exists for the people it works for, and it's the biggest game in town when seeking help for alcoholism... but I personally find many of the ideas in AA to be alienating to me at best, which is one of the reasons I have never felt like I could seriously approach it, have sometimes outright avoided it even when I knew I needed something like it to help me get sober and stay that way. One of my biggest issues is and has always been the idea of having to believe in a higher power and then giving my power over to whatever that is. I know that a ""higher power"" doesn't need to be God and doesn't need to be necessarily religious. I have heard it can be the concept of nature, a tree, AA itself, and even things like ""your higher power can be a doorknob if that's what works for you!"" I am staunchly atheist, and beyond even that deeply held belief that there is no God or higher powers at all, I have serious problems with the idea of giving over my power to anything else. At this point in my life regarding my addictions (and a lot of other personal life stuff) I have never felt like I needed to believe in my OWN power more, and have spent much of my life trying to reclaim power, not surrender it. There is other stuff too, some are a bigger deal than others, some are nitpicks, but every time I have been in a program surrounding the 12 steps or read parts of the book the higher power thing has always been the biggest deal breaker, the one I cannot get around, and then I inevitably give up on AA and have yet to find something else either. I can't force myself to believe in something that I just... don't believe.

Long story short, what are some alternatives to traditional AA? Is there a program where the higher power thing doesn't seem to be such a key part of the concept that it is mentioned on nearly every page of the book? I have thought about going to a drug counselor or switching to a therapist that specifically treats addiction issues, but I do also think a group setting would be helpful. I'm not really sure what to do when it seems like there aren't many alternatives and AA just doesn't seem like it's the right thing for me.

I have to face the fact I have a severe binge drinking problem that I am really struggling with and its been getting a lot worse particularly these last 5 years. I am a 36 year old male and have been drinking most weekends since I was 13. At first it was fun, I would hang out with friends and we would get drunk down the park and wake up the next day feeling fresh and laugh about the stupid things we had done the night before. The enjoyment of drinking alcohol kept going until around my mid twenties when I started blacking out more and more and would be crippled with severe anxiety the next day. I have continued to do this right up must of  to my current age, its like my mind remembers all the good times I once had and I always think ""this time it will be different, it will be fun and we can control how much we drink so we don't black out"", it's never fun and I would always black out, I HATE the person I turn into when I am drunk, I can come across quite creepy and I end up messaging girls late at night, sending dick pics, wake up with random strangers etc and I always regret it, it has got me into trouble a couple of times but I am no way like that when I am sober, I am very respectful towards females and come across kind natured, new people that I become friends with are surprised if they hear about the way I act when I am drunk. When I get drunk I just have a blank look on my face, unable to process information and half the time unable to speak. My ex once told me she was scared of me when I was drunk, not because I turn violent but because I turn hollow and its like there's no one there, I just have a glazed blank look on my face, like its not me inside and I have no idea where I am and what I am doing. I don't drink everyday, I usually just drink at the weekends and once managed to stay off the drink for 7 weeks but when I do drink its all or nothing, I am either not drinking at all or I drink until I pass out. I have lost numerous relationships, jobs, job opportunities, cancelled plans with friends and let people down because of my drinking, every bad thing that has happened to me in life has been a result from drinking too much alcohol, I generally believe I would be a much more successful person if I had never touched it. My ex split up with me over a month ago and she never really gave me an explanation as to why, she just told me we were in different stages of life but I think my drinking was the main reason as we were very open with one another then one night after a heavy drinking session I woke up on her couch and she was being very closed up and not saying much then a week later she ended it, I still have no idea what it was that I had done that night.

This Friday I really fucked up and really have to get it off my chest as its eating me up inside. I can't tell anyone I know as I don't see how it can make the situation any better, it would just make it worse for me but I feel I need to tell someone which is why I am hoping for some advice off of reddit users. I had friends round and we were drinking like normal, they must of went home at some point and I must of continued to stay up myself drinking, messaging girls trying to get sex, at this point I am completely out of it and don't know what I am doing. I am guessing I didn't have any luck with the girls on my fb as I downloaded Tinder and tried there, I must of got chatting to someone and convinced them to let me come round, I remember getting an uber round and turning up to realise she was a pre-op transexual but I was so out of my mind I didn't care at the time and ended up receiving/giving oral sex, next thing I know I have woke up in my bed feeling disgusted with myself. I have never done anything like this before, I don't see myself as gay, I have never been attracted to men, I have gay friends and I realise there's nothing wrong with being gay but I just felt really dirty and disgusted with myself for doing what I did. It has been a real shock as I feel I have hit an all time low, I use to be very proud and had high self esteem and dignity about myself but that has been slowly disappearing because of alcohol and I now I have feelings of low self worth and general lack of pride within myself. I spent the last couple of days in bed with severe anxiety and depression, missed work today, started smoking again after quitting over a month ago, consuming junk food to make myself feel better, unable to sleep and continually freaking out and over thinking ""what if the person had secretly filmed it?"", ""what if they see me out in the street and expose me in front of friends or coworkers?"", I could be sitting beside the person on the tube and wouldn't have a clue it was them, I have no recollection of what they looked like. I know I have hit an all time low and need to just stop consuming alcohol for good, there's no moderation for me and I just have to accept it as one of these days I am going to end up doing something that could potentially ruin my life, my biggest fear has always been that giving up alcohol leads to not having fun, even though it hasn't been fun for years, I feel I will be missing out as I am not the most outgoing person when I am sober, I can be quite introverted.

I am hoping that someone out there has been in a similar situation and came out the other side ok because as of right now I feel like this is the one that's really going to fuck my life up for me and if people found out they wouldn't see me in the same way again.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset.

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Now, in this time where we are stuck at home, locked away, quarantined, isolating to a level even us Hardcore Isolation Loving Introverts weren’t prepared for…we have each other. Strangers on the internet. 

Early on, for me, here at SD someone commented with the words “I’m proud of you”…it was a connection. A virtual hug. 🤗 A validation.👍🏻 A welcome. 🤝 A kindred, knowing response. A response that said…THIS SHIT IS HARD WORK and I KNOW WHAT YOU’RE GOING THROUGH. It made all the difference. 

If you’re inclined, take a moment to welcome someone. Make a newcomer feel included. Say a THANKS to those who inspired you. Give a shout out to your Badge Number Twinsie. Tag your username neighbor in the DCI comments to say Hi. Let that person know they’ve been seen, heard, and have a place of belonging in this world.

I've always found reaching out isn't only helpful, but sometimes a necessity when I'm feeling low. I wouldn't be here today without have done so on multiple occasions.

I little about my back story. I use to be an everyday drinker. I use to start drinking by myself around noon. I wouldn't finish work till around 4 o'clock most days. Id go home and continue to drink by myself till around 8 or 9 until the girlfriend had finish work. We'd than sit at the bar at her work and close it down. That had become my life. Everyday. Most days I didn't know if I was coming or going. Whether I was still drunk or hungover. My last thought before deciding to get sober was being unable to remember the last day I hadn't blacked out from being drunk. It had been a couple months. This had been a process that has taken over 15 years of my life and successful become completely unmanagable through alcohol. My actions through addiction had put me on the streets through my late teens and early twenties. Through living on the streets I've also done a lot im not proud of because of my addictions. I'd tried quiting several times, but like a moth to a flame I kept coming back. Burning myself everytime.

I feel likes it's the first time I've really shared my story on here, or with anyone really. I don't share it to be pitied, but so others can hear it and know we've all come from some dark places and still deserve to walk in the light. To be happy, and to be able to manage our lives. Obviously there is so much more to that story, but the long and short of it is that I was done with being that person, I sick and tired of being sick and tired, and if my self destructive behavior continued I wouldnt be here today(and I am glad I am here today) It took multiple tries, a touch of stubbornness and determination, and an entirely knew outlook on life that has brought me so far into sobriety. I had to really want it. There is no half assing this. That was lesson took my years to learn.

A bit on why I needed to post today. I was working with some new contractors couple days ago. Cool guys invited me out for beers after work. Didn't know about my sobriety. I so badly wanted to say yes. Funnily enough not just for the beers, but to get to now them as people. They are cool guys and I'd like nothing more to make friends in a social contrast  over beers. However that's not possible for people like me, and no matter how much you try to explain it to someone without a problem they'll never really get it. I said no to the guys and kind of explained I don't drink anymore. They thought it was odd, but didn't press to much. Unfortuantly it easy to make friends over alcohol, but so much harder to do so sober. Oh well my sobriety is more important.

I super excited for my six month mark. It will mark the longest I've been sober since I was 13. I almost got to six month last time I truley tried to get sober in my early 20s, but I know I didn't quite make it. Hell I may of already broken my sobriety streak. Its odd to say, but im proud of myself either way. Sorry for the long post. I'll leave you as I started with you and once again wish you all the best on your journeys.

I recently went on an 8 day bender that was baaaad. I was probably drinking more than a litre of 40% a day and not eating. My (ex) girlfriend had been trying to contact me for a few days and I wasn't responding and if I did, I was flat out lying to her or just not making sense at all. I wound up in the hospital and the very bad stage of withdrawal lasted for a few days as well in which she broke up with me over the phone since I had been unreachable in person for so long. 

In the state that I was still in when she broke up with me I was trying to piece together all the lies and convince her that I wasn't to blame but the longer I've been sober and out of withdrawal, the lies don't even make sense to me and I feel so much guilt and shame. Just thinking about it or looking through my phones call logs makes me feel flush and anxious. I texted her a sincere but half ass apology that barely acknowledged all the lies about what happened and she was supportive and said I can reach out to her for help if I need. 

The more days that I get away from this binge the more clarity I have that she won't take me back and I don't even think she should given the circumstances. All I want to do now is apologize to her in person and come clean about everything that happened because I know that I hurt her beyond words. 

Any advice on how to go about getting her to agree to meeting me in person so I can apologize? I don't think I can do it properly over the phone. It's not even about getting her back, it's about telling her that I am genuinely sorry and giving her the entire story without any of the lies so we can both move on a little easier.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6954938}"

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

My AoK for the week is one that is currently in progress. I moved into my new house on Friday. I'm really tired. I hit a wall. I haven't even started unpacking anything. Anyway, tonight I put a load of laundry in the washing machine, came up to do a Zoom meeting on my phone (because I moved without getting internet set up which, I dunno, I'm not on my game right now), and then went back down to the basement to switch the laundry into the dryer and found sludgy water covering the laundry room floor.

I drew a blank. We just had a bunch of rain dumped on us, so I assume that it had something to do with that. I texted a photo to my sister who lives locally and asked if she thought that it would be okay to leave it until tomorrow, because I just can't deal right now. I'm done. My brain is done. No more house. No mas.

She's performing a tremendously appreciated AoK and heading over with a big industrial sized fan and some old towels to help me clean it up and assess what's going on. Home ownership is for chumps. But I'm grateful for my sister, she always has my back.

Anyway, that's me for this week. How's everyone else doing, any AoK or [housing disasters](https://youtube.com/watch?v=5Of-P_m-GyI) that you'd like to share? I'm all ears!",21,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4889675}"

After a bad dissociation weekend I called my dr and got meds to help me get sober (ativan - which i have taken in the past usually for tapering off booze or flights. I've been mostly sober. I take a super small amount when I am anxious or day after I slip up and drink wine. I am back on my prozac again too so hopefully that kicks in soon and I can taper off the ativan. I am finding its been easy and some days hard. Like not feeling anxious or shitty and sleeping well when I am sober. I had a situation 2 weeks ago. I moved to a new place, but the roomate turned out to be mentally unwell. I moved back into my friends sublet shes letting me stay at (shes with her parents) So living alone. I struggle with often. I am finding myself having extreme anxiety, dissociation, to the point of being out of body and feeling like a dream. I take my ativan to help when I need. I do yoga and meditation and the anxiety still comes. I feel depressed and its hard to get my hobbies going (draw, read, watch a movie) I have panic attacks all the time when I come home from a bike ride. After 5 days sober I drank last night at a friends nearby (she isolates too) I had 3 glasses and fell asleep. I bought fake wine today to feel somewhat better? I am really scared.

Long story short I’m living with my parents and sober and I don’t understand why I couldn’t stop before now. I haven’t had a craving and I never really liked drinking in the first place. I started Zoloft a year ago and the higher my dose went, the more I drank. So I went off of alcohol, weed, and all of my meds (along with the withdrawals of losing a partner), and I don’t feel different. The main thing I’ve noticed now that I’m back with the parents is that I hated living in a city, all the people, all the suffering, and all the anger.

Clearly none of the medications and self-medications helped, but the temporary change in my headspace was the relief I wanted. I’ve been diagnosed with every variation of anxiety/depression a doctor can throw at me and it seems like the more I try to get help the more my brain pushes back - to drink more, to hurt myself, to drive recklessly, to cut myself off from others, etc.

So yay I’m sober, but it feels like I made drinking a problem for myself just to give my (now) ex an excuse to leave me alone so I could kill myself. And for what?",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.87700886}"

My drinking was going to kill me, or someone else, or cause something so bad to happen that there would be no coming back from it.  But somehow, someway, I had a moment of clarity.  A moment of grace.  And I've been sober ever since.  A second chance.

I hope everyone is keeping well during the lockdown (depending on where you are of course - I’m in scotland). I’m now 14 months sober and whilst I’m proud of how far I’ve come and how many awful situations I’ve avoided by not drinking - I am left with constant guilt and self-loathing. I knew my journey was never going to be easy and was under no illusion that as soon as I stopped drinking, I was instantly going to feel better. I just feel horrible about all the pain I’ve caused to other people as a result of my self-cantered attempt to escape repressed trauma. I’ve hurt my family, severed friendships, embarrassed past employers and hurt/scared many strangers. I’m sure there’s a lot more pain I’ve probably caused that I don’t even know about. I take full responsibility for my mistakes but I think I need to find a balance between that and self-hatred, as self-hatred will inevitably lead to a relapse (it was my primary reason for drinking before). I know self love and forgiveness are a journey and reflexive and sometimes I will feel self-love, sometimes I won’t but the guilt does get a bit much. I also think there’s merit to the best apology being changed behaviour but I still feel horrible for the pain I caused. Does anyone have any thoughts/experience of guilt in sobriety and how to cope?

I angrily and drunkenly emailed my ex wife, I likely ruined it with someone I was sort of seeing, I ranted and raved at a coworker about our job, I drunkenly rambled to my mom. God damn. The swath of destruction this shit has brought me. And yet I still keep doing it! The hell. I know, I know, that’s addiction right? I equally want out from underneath it and don’t know how to live without it, but also the known is safe (no matter how shitty it is) and the unknown is scary. I finally got out of bed today, after a full day in it yesterday. That’s my level of hangover now, extreme depression and lack of anything to even get out of bed. I still feel depressed and shaky and I have all this disaster I left in my wake. Ugh. Makes me want to crawl back under the covers again. But then I’d feel even more guilty about that. Can’t win. How do I keep doing this to myself? It’s insanity. Back to day one. I guess I’ll give it another shot. I just feel so defeated and helpless.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.91165376}"

Its rare I would go a day without having multiple drinks. Lately I've started drinking before breakfast, or even having a glass of water in the morning. I tend to forget everything that happened the previous day, and I've noticed it take a severe toll on my mental / physical health and relationships. 

Last night I took the first serious step of by telling my girlfriend about my issues (before this, I've been trying to battle my addiction by myself as that's the only way I've overcome other addictions of mine in the past). I told her I've been hiding alcohol around the house, and lying about how much I've been drinking. I tend to have horrible anxiety mixed with hypochondriac thoughts that make myself feel I've gone too far to turn back which makes me want to drink more. But I know that's not true and I've got to make an effort before that becomes a reality.

I gathered up all the alcohol in my house and poured it all down the sink. I'm hoping the depression subsides and the thoughts of me being sick disappear. I swear I feel pain in my liver from time to time but I'm not sure if that's just the hypochondriac thoughts or if there is really something wrong. Anxiety hits hard when I think about tests at the doctor may reveal, so I tend to avoid going. 

It feels good to let others know about my issues and my girlfriend is offering great support. I'm happy to be on the road to no drinking and I'm excited for the future. I can't wait to start being creative again and building my future. But I'm afraid of how easy It is to relapse when it's such a social thing to do.

That old friend who reminds me of everything I've ever done wrong and not all that I've accomplished in the last year of recovery.","I broke up with my abusive ex following a revelation after Christmas.  That's when my recovery really got into full swing.  For the first time ever, at 27 years old (turned 28 last month) I had my own apartment, I was taking care of myself, and had a great job.  I was furloughed from that new job in March.  Now they're not really sure when we'll be going back...

When I broke up with my ex I pretty much didn't have anything except my parents, sister, and therapist.  I'd given up my whole life for this guy.  I even started using drugs and drinking because of him.  His rent was paid by me for years.  I went from being ranked #3 in my Junior year of college to failing out because I was always getting wrapped up in what he was doing.  I wanted someone to find me worthwhile who wasn't forced to know me...  Like I thought family was forced to do.

I used a lot of the time at the beginning of quarantine to start taking care of myself and get a good routine going for when I go back to work.  Walking 2-3.5 miles daily (I still am doing that), keeping things clean, reading daily, meditation, prayer, keeping up with my family.  But I still have no friends to chat with...  This isn't exactly a great time to meet people.  The only people who want to talk to me at the moment are men who are trying to sleep with me.  And they make that pretty obvious...

I ran out of my psych meds at the end of last month due to some issue with my pharmacy.  I finally got them about a week later but I'm still feeling the effects of it.  I had some terrible panic attacks for the first time in about five months that lasted a few days.  I went from having 25-50 per day to having 1-12 per MONTH.  On one of these recent days I had over 25 panic attacks before I decided to go to the liquor store.  I bought three bottles of wine, a couple of tall beers, and a 750ml bottle of vodka.  I woke up feeling even worse two days ago with about five or six shots left.

The guilt demon tries to get me to rationalize drinking again.  ""You already fucked up.""  ""You've got nothing else to do, why not?""  Yeah...  And I just had something happen with a stranger at the grocery store and ended up buying two tall beers and a sparkling drink.  Much less but that's how we all end up sliding down the slippery slope.

It's been an hour and a half since I bought it.  I haven't drank anything yet.  I called my parents instead but didn't want to let them down by telling them I want to cut myself and drink.  I figured I'd reach out to you all since you can probably relate better.  I've worked so hard for what I have now.  Please help reassure me that one slip up it's just that...  One slip up.  I know I can learn from it.  But after the men hitting on me and following me at the store earlier and the panic attacks that came from that...  Ugh.  It just makes me want to give up.

Anyone else on here in a place where they decided to stop drinking for a while even if they don’t have an addiction, per se, just because alcohol is getting in the way of something in their life?

I started thinking about the last year or so. I graduated college right before my birthday last year, got a fun job, but haven’t really done a whole lot in terms of intellectual development or learning anything new. I think alcohol has gotten in the way of the “boredom space” in my life. I’d rather fill that space with a new hobby or knowledge. Instead, I’ve been drinking every night to fill that void. I feel like when you drink every night, life just goes by in a blur. 

It’s funny, because it’s only been about a year or so that my drinking habits have been particularly bad, but I think that one year was enough. I mean, I drank at parties in college, but it’s been the last year or so that alcohol has become a daily part of my life. I’ve also gotten embarrassingly blackout drunk more times than I can count. I don’t want to live my life like this. 

I live really healthy in every aspect of my life - running a few times a week, eating a clean vegan diet, not smoking, etc. so alcohol just seems so out of place. 

Anyone else in the early 20s decided to give up drinking? Did your friends and family look at you like you had 12 heads?

And in spite of my passive disdain for the construct of civic duty, it fills me with a small pride to pay for my own cost of living. The anarchist within me coils at the thought 😅

I’m very grateful to have made it four weeks today. I almost can’t believe how much time has passed since I had a drink. I’ve done my fair share of whinging and foot stomping to be sure, but it’s all part of the process I suppose. I can’t say it enough, thank you to everyone here.

One day many years ago I ended up at the psychiatrist cause I am having intense anxiety. She told me to quit smoking, drinking and drugs. At that point I started to cry, and that is when I realised I was self medicating with alcohol. Does that mean I am an alcoholic?

I stopped drinking then. Things improve and after three years I started reintroducing alcohol into my life, but often choosing non-alcoholic beers and wine.

We moved to a new country - from one where drinking non-alcoholic beverage is normal to one where drinking alcohol is not only normal, but expected. Non-alcoholic wine and beers are harder to find.

Alcohol has then been reintroduced, but I am certainly not an heavy drinker, so I wasn’t worried. I had rules.

This week my partner has been irritable and uneasy. She finally told me that she was worried about my drinking. I bought a wine on Friday, which I never tend to do unless we had a dinner party. We just finished a bottle on Thursday. I told her we had a zoom-party on Friday, but the wine was not in the list to buy. Me buying wine, like I buy chocolate, scared her.

Should I be worried too? Looking back to this year, to this lockdown, I realised that drinking has helped relieve the stress - we are more at ease when we have a glass or two. I have been drinking more now, and buying more alcohol than usual. Often forcing my partner to drink, so I don’t drink alone.

Been a while since I checked in, last time was super helpful and your encouragement made all the difference. Lurking here has been a godsend during the quarantine.

I stopped drinking on New Year's and have held pretty strong in my sobriety. I dabbled in AA, revisited my mental health resources, and haven't had too many urges during this time. I've 'come out' to friends and family, all of whom have been supportive. I'm very grateful that this has been a mostly smooth transition.

On to last weekend...I know NA beers are somewhat controversial in sober circles, but I genuinely miss the taste of a beer and so I've had a few here and there over the past few months. My brother came over with an 18-pack of NA Heines (he doesn't drink either and they're hard to find so he went for the big pack - just to clarify I'm not pounding back NA beers like I do La Croix). As I was on to my second, a few sips in, I felt a buzz coming on, which I originally attributed to smoking (can't quit all my vices at once...). This felt different. I was hot and slowed down. Suspicious of this familiar yet foreign feeling, I took a second look at my beer and noticed that this can was green instead of blue, like the first one I had. And there, in small print on the back of the can, was '5% alcohol'. My first thought was 'oh, shit' and my second was 'I could keep drinking these and pretend I didn't notice'. I could feel my brain tricking itself immediately - if I had already had a few sips, what was the rest of the can? What was one more? What was one night, or until the pack was empty? I knew if I didn't fess up I was going to go down a bad path, so I told my husband right away.

Turns out that 18-pack of beer was actually 15 cans of regular beer with 3 free NA beers. At a quick glance you wouldn't think twice, as the NA beer advertising was much more prominent. Not to mention the fact that IT WAS IN THE NON-ALCOHOLIC SECTION OF THE STORE. When my husband went back to pick up a different brand he told the owner, who just shrugged. It wasn't a huge deal for me, but what if someone else had made the same mistake? What if a pregnant woman had purchased it? Maybe Heineken was being thoughtful by including NAs for the sober folks at a party, but I can't help feeling it's an irresponsible marketing ploy. I can't be the only one who's done it - needless to say I'm going to be much more vigilant about anything claiming to be 'non-alcholic'. I'm still outraged about the whole thing and slightly peeved that my 'virgin' sobriety was compromised. Anyway, I'm choosing not to reset my counter because it was an honest mistake, and I'm proud of myself for making the right decision.

When I started this journey, I was trying to write down every day how my life was changing.  But lockdown has really affected me, so I haven’t had much energy to write and I’ve lost of lot of my enthusiasm in general.

I'm a professional in my mid 30s with a job I love that (before lockdown) required regular travel.  My home life is problematic, so travel, drinking, and work were all integrated together into my ""escape"" from reality. Now that I'm sober, and work doesn't provide the same distraction, I'm working through the real problems.

One thing is for sure, if I was drinking everything would be worse. Here's a few thoughts on the journey thus far.

&#x200B;

1. A few days before I chose sobriety, I had an anxiety attack while at a work function.  After spending much of the night hiding in the bathroom to cry and generally freak out, I decided to just go back to my room.  A well meaning colleague convinced me to stay, but of course I drank too much, embarrassed myself, and like so many nights before it wondered if it was time to stop. **You don't need to hit rock bottom to get sober, the accumulation of many bad experiences can be enough to give you the push you need.**
2. On day one, I went by myself to see New York City Ballet. I honestly wept with joy at the beauty of the experience being sober, people must've thought I was nuts... I’ve always used outings as an excuse to “celebrate” and drink, even when I’m out alone.  I was worried I wouldn’t enjoy the show, that it wouldn’t feel special.  It was a powerful lesson, and **proving to myself how much better familiar experiences are sober has been key to recovery.**
3. In the beginning, I was amazed at how different I looked, less haggard and more happy.  Waking up sober meant I was able to take care of myself and that I wanted to.  I often put on makeup to look less hungover, and now I look bright and healthy enough that I go without.  I've needed reminding of this lately, and **being able to take care of yourself and feel good in your skin is a gift of sobriety.**
4. After a couple of weeks, I had genuine excitement for activities and plans.  One morning, I sprang up out of bed and exclaimed without thinking ""I'm so excited for my dance class tonight!""  **I can make plans and stick to them, I can be consistent and present.**

At about this point, lockdown began.  It's been 8 weeks, and it looks like at least the same again before we're allowed to out of the house for non-essential activities.   I have struggled with lockdown, and while I know things could be worse, that doesn't cancel out these bad experiences. 

I've had a few days that were hard to stay sober, but deep down I knew drinking wouldn't make me feel better. I suppose I feel like I'm not able to experience so many of the wonderful things sobriety is giving me while locked down, while stuck in an unhappy situation, while I've lost access to many of the activities that give me meaning.

Looking back through the first few weeks, I'm reminded of the joy I had at experiencing life sober and I know that life will come back eventually.  Sorry for this long rant, and that my experience of sobriety ins't all cupcakes and rainbows.

I used to think people with such big numbers were wizards, now I’m here. It’ll be 2 years in August. 

I’ve had more cravings lately. Fewer outlets and being stuck inside has made it more difficult to deal with people around me drinking. I’ve also been thinking about whether I could start drinking again. Has it been long enough? Could I drink normally now? But I don’t think it’s worth it. Because my sobriety has given me more gifts than I can recognise, and it’s so much easier now than the beginning. But...I still can’t help thinking about it. Seeing people pour and enjoy a glass of wine makes me angry and jealous. I guess deep down I’m still pissed at myself for having a problem in the first place. That’s how I know my journey isn’t over. The demon doesn’t die, it just goes to sleep.

Last week I decided to break this habit as I was starting to feel increasingly miserable due to the consumption of these substances. So the last time I've been drinking/smoking was 9 days ago - which is HUGE for me. Like, I literally can't remember the last time I did this. 

But the downside is. I feel like I am losing my mind. I am irritated all the time. I can't handle emotions anymore. I don't know what to feel.

I am seeing a therapist already (started two weeks ago) but I don't know what to do as of now. So many thoughts, so many fucking emotions. Everything seems so overwhelming.

However, last night for some bizarre reason I couldn’t even explain, I bought some white claws? Had 4-5. Couldn’t even tell you why I wanted to drink or why I felt like I needed to keep drinking. Idk whats wrong with me.

For me my alcohol addiction was the facade for something much more sinister in my life . I like to call them the swamp . My emotional swamp and my relationship swamp and I was damn well stuck in them for the long haul.  You can’t build a good foundation in a swamp or live happily there either .  For me stopping drinking was the first step in me actually understanding I was in a swamp in the first place because I had no idea.  It takes the blinders off and forces you to feel all these uncomfortable emotions and feelings and it’s up to you to figure out how to deal with these feelings and knowing most alcoholics are the same we turn to drinking .  

I guess what I’m trying to say is that quitting the drink is only the first part . We still need to learn how to deal with all the shitty things that are most definitely going to happen to us and not turn to drink.  I thank you all so much for your courage and hope I see here daily but I think once and a while between the day 1s and the 5 year folks we gotta acknowledge that most of us need some therapy and reading and podcasts and support groups are sometimes not enough .  I’ve been seeing a Counsellor for a few months now over zoom and it’s made a world of a difference for me.  

I still get down , I still crave my old life from time to time and I definitely don’t know what to do with my emotions all the time but I’m learning how to regulate that stuff and things are absolutely better without alcohol in my life but it takes times.  I don’t think I will dismantle 16 years of abuse in 5 months .

Recently I was reflecting back on all of my attempts to get sober. I have tried several times, with stretches of sobriety ranging from 1 day to 2 years. 

People always say, “you still have that sober time! You didn’t lose it!” And that just always felt wrong to me. It reminded me of being stuck on an island, and all my attempts to get sober are represented as a ship I built to try and leave the island, but ultimately wrecked and wasn’t successful. 

Here’s the art: https://imgur.com/a/C0CCC51

Here’s what I wrote:


*This is my island. It’s not a great place. I’ve been here as long as I can remember. I can’t eat the food here, because it’s poisonous to me. My shelter isn’t great. I’ve explored all parts of this land, and there is no safe place on it. For so long I have tried to get off this island, but the sea around me is rough. I have tried and failed many times. 

I see others who live happy lives here, and I just don’t understand. They never seem to notice that the plants are poison. The soil is barren. Why are they so different from me?

My ships have all wrecked. Some were really great. And I got pretty far out to sea. But then I wrecked, and for a long time I tried again. But each time I wrecked I knew that my next journey would have to be made with far less resources. My ships became less strong over the years, until one day I stopped making them. 

I look out and see my wrecks. Sometimes I wonder if I should just try and eat the plants here, and force my body to adapt. Even though I know it never would. 

Will I ever leave this place? I will think about that another day. *

Creating this picture made me realize so many things
-that the island will always look fine from afar. One day I’ll be at sea and things will be rough. And I will be wondering if I could just turn back. But it’s all a deception. 
- no one on the island will get off it alive. 
-I don’t have a lot of resources left to build another ship. But I can still try. And that others who have left the island can show me how they did it.

**tl;dr**

Got started today on Naltrexone, already taking Gabapentin. Excited for the sober future. Immediately started feeling sick. Finally forced myself to eat some food and vomited more violently than I ever have in my life. I will contact my doctor tomorrow, but is this what I should continue to expect from Naltrexone?

**The rest of the post**

I was going to make a long post about my history with alcohol and how I got to where I am today and then I realized it doesn't matter how I got here! It wouldn't even be an interesting story, and even if it was, you guys have heard it all before! Let's get to it.

In the past I have had periods (months) where I drink far too much on a daily basis. As soon as I realize I'm in one of those periods I back off and get back to a ""tolerable"" level, which for me is 1-2 bottles of wine per night. I don't day drink, and I really, honestly, never do. I don't think that makes it better though because it just means I'm drinking way faster at night.

I have pretty much completely cut off liquor of any kind. It's just not worth the after effects and the shame. I bought a nice bottle of Japanese whiskey about six weeks ago and just finished it off on Thursday night. I absolutely love beer but I've gone from 10-12 per night down to about one a week. That brings us to wine. I like wine because it's easy and I don't get as much of a buzz off of it for some reason. Also, when people see me drinking wine they automatically assume I couldn't possibly be an alcoholic! Who drinks that much wine?!

I tell my doctor I drink a few times a week (I work four days per week) and I typically have 2-3 glasses of wine. I know she doesn't believe me, especially when my resting pulse is 115 and I'm shaking. Anyway, she asked if I was drinking more since the whole quarantine lockdown. I told her I definitely was drinking more than normal, but it wasn't a problem. Truth is I haven't been to work in seven weeks and I've been drinking 3-4 bottles of wine every night since. The last night I didn't have alcohol was 26 October 19. I know the exact date because that night I was in a horrible car accident and was hospitalized. Don't worry, I was sober and it wasn't my fault at all. I absolutely never drive while intoxicated. Well, after one drink I will, but never after two.

ANYWAY, she knows I drink more than I tell her, so she suggested I take Naltrexone, you know, just to make sure it doesn't become a problem. Got it, doc. You see me. I had to wait a few days for the prescription to be filled for some reason, but I picked it up yesterday and was super excited to take it this ""morning.""

Withing 45 min of taking the pill I started feeling sick. The feeling got worse as the day went one. I had a few dry heaves but recovered from them. At that point I assumed I should have taken it with food so, even though I REALLY didn't want to eat, I went to the fridge and had a big glass of V8 juice and a few tortilla chips. That seemed to work for the next few hours. Eventually I started feeling sick again so I decided I should just make some dinner. The more I ate the worse I felt. I ate about half of what I would normally and had a beer in case it was just withdrawals. I cleaned up my stuff and ate some tums. Immediately I felt like I was going to throw up. What followed was easily the most violent vomit session of my life. By the end of it I had sweat dripping into the toilet.

I cleaned everything up and, feeling much better, decided to have a couple of glasses of wine to calm down. Obviously the only reasonable solution /s. After finishing my second glass I had a headache and my joints were aching. Turning my head made my neck feel like it needed to be greased up or something.

So here we are. I'm going to contact my doctor tomorrow, because this obviously isn't normal. The reason I'm posting is that I've done a TON of Googling and searching on Reddit and haven't found anyone else complaining of this type of reaction to Naltrexone. It looks like it's supposed to be a really damn safe medication. Again, I will be contacting my doctor tomorrow, but is this a normal reaction? Should I take it again when I wake up? Do I just need to take it with food?

Last thing, even though this was way longer than I anticipated, it would have been even longer if I had done the whole history. Regardless, I was prescribed Gabapentin about 10 months ago and have been taking it every day. Just wanted to add that in here in case it's relevant.",4,"{'quarantine': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4644397}"

Once it hits 5 o'clock I would start drinking heavily almost every night until I pass out. Oddly enough, when out with friends I would drink more conservatively. But alone I would go overboard. I would drink alone and play videogames. At first it was fun, but quickly turned into a sad existence. 

However, I had 1 Rule: No Drunk Driving.

Due to COVID19, I haven't been able to see my friends and family on a regular basis. It has increased my Anxiety, Depression, and Alcohol intake (which I've basically been using as self-medication for my mental struggles.)

 Lately I've started to drive drunk to get food because I've become a cynical, selfish asshole. Every morning after, I feel terrible and swear I'd never do it again but of course once I'd drink, my stupid drunk brain would take over and do it again...

A couple days ago I bought a bottle of vodka and finished it last night. I didn't have an exorbitant amount but I was definitely drunk. My drunk mind said ""Hey you should get McDonald's and throw this bottle away!"". I live right across the street from a park and decided I'd throw away the bottle of vodka and then go grab some food. I parked my car at the park and was about to get out when a cop car came up right behind me.

My heart sunk and realized how much of a complete piece of shit I had been. I was so far gone that I began to break the one rule I had. The cop was probably there just cause the park was closed but I knew if I got out of my car and talked to them I would get a DUI...

I calmly backed up and started to exit the park with my heart pounding in my chest. The cop didn't move, probably just wanting me to leave the park. I went immediately home and thought about how much I have been throwing my life away.

Fuck this shit... I've been wasting so much money, time and energy into being a complete disaster. I can't stand how I've been treating my body and my life. I'm tired of waking up hungover, I'm tired of having no goals in life, I'm tired of being a disappointment...

I've tried to stop drinking before and made some progress but once the pandemic happened I slipped up again. This was it. This was the moment I've really realized I genuinely need to stop. I've become a danger to myself and others. I can't just let this happen and move on with it like it was nothing. I'm lucky I didn't get arrested, I'm lucky I haven't had any accidents or injuries. This is it. I can continue my life without any major consequences. I just need to do one thing...

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Is it a song, a phrase, a chant, a joke, a dance, an activity, a location?

My ability to remember I have a pot of beans going is not one of them. 

After the smoke cleared, I sucked it up. Instead of my grandma's scratch pinto bean recipe - heaven on earth, by the way - (ok you beat it out of me: a big dollop of bacon grease, bag of dry pinto beans, water, and black pepper. Usually the bacon grease adds enough salt, but salt em up if you prefer) I used canned. I can only imagine what she would think of that. Made some corn bread too. 

Now I grew up on Gram's buttermilk cornbread. Flour & corn meal (just eyeball it, she would say), a little baking soda and baking powder, salt, and buttermilk. Of course you don't sugar it! Who in the hell sweetens their corn bread? She grew up in Webster Springs, West Virginia, and she knew better. 

I don't make her corn bread. I will miss her too much; one day I will but right now it's too soon. So I make [this recipe ](https://www.thekitchn.com/cornbread-22943699) Yes it's sweet but LORD is it good. I never considered how good brown sugar and buttermilk together could be! Such a rich, wonderful delight.

 Once I got that in the oven I made greens. I do em up the same way she did more or less, but I like to add  cayenne pepper in with the onions. Gives em a little kick. Now the fried potatoes, I will add an onion when I'm feeling fancy. Today I felt fancy. The burnt ones on the bottom are the best, and I use a cast iron skillet so they slide right out.

You can eat a ton of this for dinner and you will still have a lot left over for a few days. Saves on cooking fuel. My Gram was a Great Depression baby, and lost her mom at 3. She and her brother were raised by their Gramma. Depression era West Virginia really hadn't changed much since the Civil War; Appalachia is kind of on its own time line, for better or for worse. She ended up raising my sister and me since my mom has addiction and mental illness. I hid the drinking from my Gram but I'm pretty sure she knew. Those mountain women don't miss much.

I never got to tell her I got sober, and I wasn't sober enough when she was alive to tell her how much I loved her. My sister and I have always been greatful; she didn't have to raise us, but she did. My little brother and sister weren't as lucky and they have been hard, messy, and addicted. I'm hoping that she knew. She saved us as kids, and she never gave up on me. And damn could she cook.

We lost her April 26, 2017. Her husband, my grandfather, is 93 and still lives at home. They were childhood sweethearts. 

It rained today. Rain is a good day for a meal like this. In the summer you might add some sliced tomatoes and cucumbers from the garden with a little salt and pepper. With some whole green onions on the side. I've never met another culture that eats green onions like a raw carrot, but my grandparents did at every meal. Makes me appreciate them even more.

I turned 50 this year. I probably have more years behind me than I do in front of me, and the clarity I found with sobriety has no problem pointing this out as often as it can. It is a gentle uneasiness. It makes being alive a special thing. 

No grandkids yet so I got a dog to spoil instead. A little 9 week old pug. She is the light of my life. We named her Tater Tot.

So I'll make a deal with you: work on staying sober with me, because we all can use a hand, and I'll get a timer for my beans. Be well everyone. Thanks for listening.

I think generally we need to think about deemphasizing the role of alcohol in society. The industry spends billions and billions of dollars annually to get into our heads that drinking is the way that we escape our problems. Meanwhile any healthcare worker can tell you that alcohol is what sends people to the emergency room.

Prohibition doesn't work, but banning ads from the industry--especially the creepy targeted ads--would go a long way to helping everyone drink more healthily.

Thanks for the constant support I get just looking at this subreddit. For those who feel like they can't do it, really struggling, etc., I have some concise things that helped me/pointers below. I was a consistent half a handle a night drinker prior to this.

-As stupid as this sounds, you really, really need to want to quit to make it past a few days. Generally I've been fine, and getting past social temptations has been my biggest issue so far. And I say that coming from a place where previously, I definitely didn't want to quit deep down.
-You need an outlet in real life. My girlfriend has been fucking awesome when it comes to this.
-The withdrawal symptoms obviously vary depending on how hard and long you drank for, but for me a headache and crazy dreams still happen in a diminishing amount.
-Kava has helped with my insomnia and spats of temptation/anxiety.

In general, any time I feel like ""fuck it, why not have a beer"", I need to remind myself that I'm an alcoholic and that a short two weeks ago I felt like shit constantly and that alcohol was the source of all of my problems. If it's not acceptable for a heroin addict to score a bag after x amount of time and after going through withdrawals, then it's not acceptable for me to have a drink.

I drank unhealthily for since my very early teens.. it occurred to me I had I had a problem but that didn’t stop me. I medicated myself for years and all throughout college. Alcohol turned me into someone I hated. It always brought out so much repressed anger and sadness. It got really bad as I was drinking a lot more often since working from home. 

19 days ago I finally hit a wall where I had to change. I blacked out and did crazy stuff I literally had zero recollection of. It was a painful time and I couldn’t live with myself knowing it turned me into a monster. I am happier not drinking but still have strong urges to drink here and there. With the quarantine and social distancing I feel so bored. I feel like drinking is my crutch and my entertainment. I feel like it’s my default. It’s the one thing I know and the one thing that feels familiar even if it’s bad.

Does it get easier? These 19 days have felt longer then ever. It was ok in the beginning but as more time passes my urge to drink gets stronger. Is this normal? I’ve started biking, exercising at home and trying to keep busy starting up new hobbies. The weekends I still feel like something is missing. I hope this passes soon.

I come from a fine family. They did tell me I couldn’t be home/around my younger brother as long as I was under any influence. I get it. Now that I’m getting clean and sober they are letting me come home.

My younger brother (12 now) is starting to ask questions about why I wasn’t around so much these past few years (I’m 23 and haven’t been home for a holiday in at least a year). My family did a pretty good job of keeping the truth from him while maintaining a positive image of me (school, with my girlfriend at the time, travel issues). I would still FaceTime occasionally. I don’t agree with the lies, but I respect it. 

Now that I’m getting my act together, I want to tell him the truth. My family does not support this decision and I have no experience to look at. I obviously don’t want to tell him all of the details but he’s a smart kid. He knows something is up. 

I’d like to tell him that I was really sad and instead of asking for help I used drugs and alcohol to try and feel better but they actually made things worse. I’m still sad but I’m getting help from professionals and support from friends and don’t want to drink or use anymore. I love him and if he ever feels sad that I will be here for him. Mental illness is no stranger to our gene pool. As you can maybe tell, openness about them is.

When he’s on the green putting for par, he isn’t thinking of winning the tournament, he’s thinking of getting the ball into the cup. If  he’s thinking ahead to winning the tournament, he’s not focusing on what he’s doing and might miss . When an NFL quarterback takes the snap and drops back to pass, he’s not thinking about winning the super bowl or even the game, he’s focusing on getting the  ball to the receiver. That’s how I think of not drinking a day at a time . I don’t think ahead a week, month or year . I just focus on what I’m doing today. This doesn’t mean that you ignore the future; it means you focus on where you are and what you’re doing  today. If I’m going to a wedding reception , I plan on how to stay safe so that when I’m there I’ll just follow my plan. If I’m planning a vacation I put money aside a bit at a time. If you just say that you’re never goin to drink again but you don’t pay attention  to what you’re doing right now, you’re setting yourself up for possible failure.

At the same time, I believe that truly, really, honestly accepting that I can't drink moderately is going to be the key that unlocks the door to staying sober. Along with accepting the rest of my reality. Which is not a bad thing. I have a good life, a supportive partner who I love, good relationships with my family, a steady job that pays well, a wonderful dog, fulfilling hobbies. At the same time, I've missed out on so much and have stolen so much time from myself by drinking, being a hungover slug, you know the drill.

2020-05-16 18:40:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gl3xlf/why_i_comment_instead_of_posting/,Why I comment instead of posting,"Hi everyone!

I got a couple of responses to a comment I wrote yesterday saying that I should write it up as post. I'm not going to, but I do think it's worth posting about why I prefer to comment rather than post these days.

I've written several hundred posts here on SD over the years. I think that posting is great. I think that people should err on the side of posting if they have anything that they want to talk about, get off their chest, or get feedback on. I still post when I have things going on with my own sobriety that I want to talk about. Posting is good. When in doubt, post more, not less.

I tend to talk things out with people who I know in real life these days, rather than post about it. I'm in AA, I have a sponsor, I go to meetings, and I have sober friends. I still highly value the SD community and being active here has been an important part of my recovery, but it's not the only way that I get support and feedback these days. You can never have too much support in your sobriety, and I still value being able to come here and post about what's going on with me and my sobriety, but it's not my immediate go-to anymore when I'm having a hard time with something or I just need to talk.

When I comment, I'm responding to what other people are saying and sharing my own experience with similar situations and what I've learned in my recovery journey. I am not an expert on any of this, believe me. Whatever pearls of wisdom I have to share come from things that I've heard other people say. None of my ideas are new, and none of them are my own. I didn't figure any of this out for myself. I still have my struggles, and I have made and continue to make plenty of mistakes.

But I'm staying sober. And part of how I stay sober is by talking to other people who are dealing with the same sorts of things that I have dealt with. Talking at SD about what I know doesn't keep me sober, that's actually the sort of stuff that leads to getting drunk. Talking with people about my own experience, what I've learned from it, and what has worked for me, in order to be of service to them, is what keeps me sober. 

Things that I say in response to one particular post probably *could* apply to a lot of people's situations. One thing that I've learned in recovery is that, while my problems may be unique among the general population, I'm not unique among other people who have a problem with alcohol. How I think, the struggles and problems I have in my life, the way I feel inside - none of it is unique. I identify with a wide variety of sober people, many of whom look very different on the outside and who come from very different backgrounds. 

If anything I say on here is helpful to anyone who happens to read it, I'm extremely glad about that. But it's always worth it for me to comment here because it *always* helps at least one alcoholic stay sober. It helps me. If it's beneficial for anyone else, that's great, but it always has a benefit for me. 

Being active in my sobriety and offering support to others strengthens my sobriety and moves me a little further away from taking another drink. I've learned that I'm either moving away from my last drink or moving towards my next one. There's no resting in place in recovery. Sobriety can be lost as well as gained. So I stay active in doing things that keep me sober. If I'm not working on my recovery it's slipping away from me, and I might not find out until I'm justifying that next drink. Relapses don't happen overnight, they're sometimes years in the making.

So, I comment because speaking with other people who have a drinking problem helps me stay sober, and pontificating into the void does not. When I post these days I'm mostly just posting about where I'm at, which also helps me stay sober. I don't find any real benefit in just generally posting about what I've learned.

The other main reason why I prefer to comment rather than post is that I didn't get sober through reading and thinking, I got sober through taking action. There were years when I wasn't taking action, and I knew that I had a problem with alcohol, but I just was where I was. I didn't take action, and so I didn't get sober.

People who are posting are taking action. People who are writing about their own experiences in comments are taking action. Anything that involves communicating with another sober person is taking action. Reading is research. Research is not action.

It took me years to get to the point of being ready to talk about what was actually going on with my drinking. I didn't want to talk to anyone. I didn't want anyone to know, I wanted to read a book and be done. I started reading memoirs written by people about their own experiences with drinking and getting sober. 

One of the books I read was *Dry* by Augusten Burroughs. I reread it after getting sober again this time around, and I was struck by how much of his story resonated with me now. I had similar experiences with getting sober. I had similar experiences with relapse. That all happened *after* I read the book the first time. Reading about it didn't save me from anything.

I just moved, and while I was packing up I was struck by the various books I have on drinking problems and recovery which did not get me sober or keep me sober. They're not bad books, don't get me wrong, I'm sure that it was helpful to read them in its own way, but my experience has been that I needed to actually talk to other people and connect before I could get sober. Reading books didn't change things for me. Actively talking to other people in recovery changed everything.

Sobriety didn't come out of a book for me. Sobriety came through taking action that connects me with other people who know how to get and stay sober. The connection is more important than the knowledge. I can't outthink my drinking problem. I couldn't think my way out of this. I couldn't reason it out by myself. 

I had to start talking with people who understood because they'd been there. I had to start putting myself out there. I had to be uncomfortable. I had to be exposed. I had to physically do things like posting on here and going to meetings and texting other sober people. Sobriety didn't come for me as a result of reading things and thinking about it, it came as a result of connecting with other sober people and talking and taking action. I don't post in general terms about what has helped me to get and stay sober because my own experience has been that reading stuff like that doesn't actually help. What helps is taking action that leads to connection.

(Steps down from soapbox. Notices that no one was actually listening.) Anyway, that's where I am on that. My posts are even *longer* than my comments, if you can believe that. I hope that you all are well.

I woke up this morning shaking. I couldn't hold the cup of coffee to my lips. I went in the bath. I tried to pray to something (but I just don't believe in God). I swore I wouldn't drink. I read more of the Naked Mind. I wrote in my diary again, I would quit. 

And here I am, day 1 again, just wrestling with this awful demon in my head. Its like a black shadow that just doesn't go away. 

I want to tell you all if you first are arriving at this sub - and especially if you are in your early twenties. Please believe that this is a disease. Please believe this gets worse. Please believe that this thing will get you. I first posted here many years ago. I've tried every scheme. Every deal with god. Bought notebooks. Journaled. Tried AA, I don't believe in god so I just can't give myself to a higher power. Tried telling my friends. I totally get the logic of the naked mind: its watertight. But I still don't know if I am going to take any notice of it. Nothing works for me. Just nothing. I don't really know what to do now. I can feel myself deteriorating. 

I used to be a good looking man, about 6'3, 170lbs. I could run, lifted weights. Since the virus started and i've been working from home more. The demon has dragged me further and quicker. Sometimes I used to be able to control my drinking, now I count it a good day if its only 12 beers. Thats how dark its god. I can inhale so much of this poison now, I can feel it affecting my motor functions, I feel my eyesight getting worse. I'm 198lbs now of pure jelly. Partly because the gym is closed. Partly because I cant do 5k & 10ks at weekends. Partly because during COVID I came to the end a long painful breakup that has lasted months (you know the kind guys, breaking up can be a long drawn out affair and it fucking sucks) with my ex-girlfriend, who I loved but cheated on me. I cheated on her too. The chains that kept me grounded have melted away, or perhaps the chains that kept that demon alcohol to an extent away, have broken. 

I haven't got to rock bottom yet, but I can see it. I'll be sliding off the side soon, I know it. Unless by some miracle things change, but i've tried everything. The worst thing is I could just happily accept my fate but I know its going to end with my death, my going crazy.

First, let me just say this community is awesome and full of wonderful people. You guys have made me feel so much less alone through the past few years. I'll be trying to make the plunge at the beginning of this next week to try to better my life...but I had some questions before I take that plunge.

I've done some reading about anxiety and drinking, and just to give a little background, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and also depression when I was 16 years old, and I'll be 32 next month, so it's been a long road. I tried medication (Lexapro/Vistaril) when I was in my teenage years, but eventually had to drop it.

Unfortunately for the past 15 years I've always self medicated in some way with alcohol and weed. I had to stop smoking because of my anxiety and I turned to alcohol in my early 20's. It's been a struggle on and off but for the past 7 years alcohol has completely taken over my life. 

Up until recently I've only been a night drinker...I've switched from vodka, to wine, to beer back and forth through the years but for now I'm strictly on beer. 

I drink about 8-10 12oz 8% beers a day. The problem is during quarantine, and being laid off of work, I've been drinking earlier and earlier. Most days I start at around 9:30 am, because my anxiety is starting to cripple me and it's the only way I can get it to stop. It's a vicious cycle... drinking totally stops my anxiety but also causes it. I get really afraid because I start getting a little shaky but I'm not sure if it's withdrawals, or anxiety or both, so I have to shut it down before it gets out of control. 

That's when I open my first beer of the day. I'm not even sure how things got this way. It happens so fast. I never thought I would be a day drinker. You think it won't or can't happen to you, but it can.

I've read some of your posts on and off through the years, and I decided to make the call and get some help next week. I can't afford rehab, but I am speaking to a mental health professional that can prescribe me medication, I'm terrified but I can't keep living this way. I'm too scared to eat, sleep, I can't drive. It's absolutely ruining everything.

So I guess I'm turning to you guys for help. What were your experiences with booze and anxiety? Any medications that worked wonders for your anxiety while quitting drinking? I'm not here for medical advice, I just want to know what worked for you! That also includes workouts, favorite hobbies... anything that helped you get through that rough time.

I look forward to reading your comments/experiences, thanks in advance for sharing them, and I hopefully will not drink with you all next week after my appointment!

I’ll try and give a brief background here. 38M, married with two great young kids (5 and 7). Amazing wife and incredible career. Definitely a functioning alcoholic. 

4-6 beers most nights per week. We don’t keep liquor in the house, because my wife and I would both gulp it. 

I’ve had my rough times with drinking for the last ten years. I’ve been honest with my doc, and other than high blood pressure, I have a clean bill of health. 

I am currently 25 days sober. Feeling good and blood pressure readings are excellent. 

I’ve attended AA meetings in the past, but really never took it seriously. I’ve been months without drinking In the past. But stress and anxiety seems to be my trigger. 

My job has been under incredible stress during covid. I now remotely manage a team of 15 professionals, and I’ve been clocking 50-60 hrs a week. 

About one month ago, the stress boiled over. I went on a three day bender. My team at work could tell I wasn’t myself, my wife was fed up, and my oldest kid was asking why dad isn’t feeling well. 

My wife is for voting for in patient rehab. I want to try therapy for my stress and anxiety before taking that step. I’m not a doctor, but I feel like i have to address the underlying issues first. 

Anyone been in this boat before? I would love some thoughts or insights.

I wasn't even drunk! As my pregnant wife drove us home I was actually feeling quietly proud of my ""successful moderation"".

But was it worth it? Let's check. 

Those three drinks led to a truly abysmal sleep, waking up at 3am snoring loudly and gasping for air. Suddenly wide awake. Without alcohol I never snore, and I always sleep through the night. 

A total of 4hrs of poor quality sleep. Which will mean an upcoming day of feeling sluggish and short tempered. Which will lead inevitably to ramped up anxiety over the next 48hrs, leaking through to Monday. 

What a shitty deal. Yeah granted I'm not ""classically hungover"" like I used to get. There's no thumping head or dramatic race to get to the bathroom before being sick. It's not that overt. 

Sunday isn't a write-off, but it's definitely going to be nowhere near as great as it could be. That Sunday got sabotaged. 

Is all the downside worth the barely noticeable upside coming from three drinks on a night of 'successful moderation'? Absolutely not. No way. Shitty deal.

Drink it, eat a snack, and by the time my boyfriend comes over I will have a fun buzz and he’ll never know I drank.”

Let’s be real. I would buy two mini boxes of wine, one to drink and the other to hide. Just knowing I have more in the house feels good to me. 
I would absolutely chug that wine. Drink 1/2 of it and stash the rest under the sink in my bathroom. Then I can go in from time to time and take a chug, flush the toilet, and I won’t look suspicious. 
He might say something like “you’re acting different” to which I will reply “I just got a burst of energy!” 
I’ll sweat, I’ll become paranoid. I won’t like that feeling of guilt so I will open the other box of wine to drown out the feelings.
Uh oh, now I’m drunk. I just drank 4 glasses of wine in an hour. I’ll suggest a movie and then tell boyfriend I am suddenly tired. “Take a nap with me!”
We get in bed and I immediately fall asleep. No cuddles for the boyfriend. I sleep hard and he wakes up before me and watches tv until I wake and come downstairs.
“Wow, I was tired!” I have a mid day mini hangover. A headache. I’m disgusted with myself. I’m so worried  he noticed.

A typical Tuesday, I drove out to make my rounds to the two stores I frequented to split up my purchase of assorted beverages for the night (so as to avoid buying all in one place and looking like I had a problem)
Usually I would crack open one of the tall boy mikes hard lemonades to down on the way home as a little kickstart. I was getting closer to home and realized I hadn’t started drinking yet so I whipped out the tall boy with less than a half mile to go and drank it behind the wheel as fast as I could... must have had it down in 3 seconds flat. 
Almost immediately the pain in my chest was overbearing. Shit, this is it. A heart attack.
I barely made it to the driveway without having to pullover and scrambled directly to my room where I was almost positive my life was coming to an end. Here I am... 39yo. This is how I go... I curled up in my bed begging for the pain to stop. My two kids on the couch watching cartoons in the living room. My wife had gone for a walk with the dog. My final thoughts were of what a loser I’d become and what an embarrassment I was getting ready to put my family through. The rest of my beer stash still sit in the car; one can open and empty; me on the bed headed for death’s door. Well, :30 went by and the pain slowly started drifting away. What an idiot... this is when I realized I must have swallowed an ungodly amount of air when I chugged the tall boy behind the wheel that resulted in the worst of gas pain. False alarm. No heart attack. My wife and kids will not have to find me dead today. The night went on like it usually goes except this night my wife went to bed a little earlier than normal leaving me all alone on the couch to battle my own demons and drown my thoughts with the remainder of my stash, well because you know, even a near death scare isn’t enough to make me waste a good beer. All I could think about is the mess my life has become. Going on 25 yrs of drinking ungodly amounts nightly, searching for something but never finding anything besides the bottom of another stash and awaking in an endless cycle of depression. That night ended with tears rolling down my face. I believe I had old YouTube videos of John Prine playing in the background while I discovered this subreddit group online. My final act before going to bed was signing up and the next morning I joined the DCI. It’s been 32 days. A drop in the bucket but so far so good. Who knows what tomorrow brings. All I know is that if I choose to drink today then tomorrow will surely fall short of what my family deserves. I am truly thankful for this group.

I've gone from a person who mourned the loss of alcohol, like losing a life long friend to someone who no longer misses alcohol. Only a few months ago, alcohol was creeping into my mind still , but over the last few months, the desire to drink has really gone away.

I began drinking in college and drank more in my 30s than in my 20s and I was drinking more in my 40s than I was in my 30s. Work, kids and the demands of a serious adult life need daily release, right? My weekend habit grew to a weekday routine, slowly increasing over time, year after year. A little bit more. A little bit more. A little bit more. Until one day I was looking in the mirror, not liking who I was seeing. I saw a man who was always worried, who didn't sleep well, who was impatient and irritable. I saw a bloated face, red eyes and a general lack of wellness. Was this who I once dreamed of being? No.

I went to my favorite place in the world on vacation with my family last July. It's a mid-sized lake in central NH. I had grown up going to my grandparents cottage on this lake and I was getting to share this special place with my family, passing along the tradition. The weather was beautiful. The sunsets perfect. We were tan. The kids were jumping off the dock and catching fish. We were eating lobster and on the surface it all looked so wonderful. But I was miserable. Absolutely miserable. At my favorite place on earth with my favorite people on earth.

My wife asked me on an afternoon walk what was wrong because I don't have much of a poker face and I finally admitted to her, ""I want to stop drinking."" I had never said those words out loud, though I had thought them hundreds of times. Her reply, ""Oh, well I'd quit with you if that would help."" We went home two nights later, I bought a Heady Topper, Sip of Sunshine, a Lush (all Double IPAs) and one other light beer. Drank them up and said goodbye to drinking that night.

The last 300 days have been up and down, but more up than down. I had to learn how to live without alcohol and that took a lot of time. I've found the fellowship of AA and this sub to be helpful. I've embraced the growing non alcoholic craft beer movement. Some would call that cheating, I call it living. I've improved my happiness. I'm more patient. I'm a better boss, a better employee and my relationship with my wife is way better. I'm doing it. And I'm just much better off.

I feel really hurt by that and said some hurtful things back in a pretty shitty defensive way, that I never let the lights go out or fail to put food on the table. I've decided to drop the smoke to save the peace, the difference between it and alcohol is that it IS pretty effortless for me to stop anytime, like for a job ect. I don't know if it's important that she know how MUCH control I have now in a comparative way. She gives me all the support that seems appropriate and I feel like it is genuine sentiment. Sometimes I feel like she really just wants whatever is keeping me sober to continue to run quietly in the background, and any blips on her radar and I'm going to be jacking cars for the local MC again before you know it. I also could be being a big whiny alcoholic in recovery who doesn't feel like his wife is giving him enough praise (for simply living the way normal people do, not blacked out on a park bench.)

(I’m going to try to post a pic in the comments of my view this morning, I’m on mobile so couldn’t post with the title). I have loved horses since a was a kid but have never had an opportunity to hang around them much. I am quickly reminded, though, that you can’t bullshit a horse — they see through pretension and into your intention in a heartbeat. They recognize fear before you do. As I get to love up on them, I have to enter into their vibe with really clear energy or it’s not safe. I have to trust, but know my way out if their energy turns. I have to be aware of their environment as well as my own and know what might spook them. 

What would happen if we treated each other like horses? What if we were so straight up with one another and we led with love? What if we always knew what we needed to do to keep ourselves safe but were also on the lookout for what made others feel unsafe and worked to mitigate that? What if we stopped trying to bullshit others (and ourselves), especially about our intentions? And what, most of all, would happen if we led with the clearest, cleanest energy of love with all we meet?

**For your Weekend Writing consideration:** How would your life be different if the above were true?

In regards to the current pandemic, I'm fortunate not to be still binge drinking or drinking at all. Not only does alcohol weaken the immune system and damage vital organs, but the need to buy alcohol would have meant more trips to the shop at a time when going outside should be kept to a minimum.

One of my brothers, who would regularly drink 2-4 drinks most nights has now gone several days without alcohol and is actively losing weight. My sister had a fall recently when she was drunk and is likely going to stop drinking - her and her husband have been drinking heavily during the lockdown - or at least cut down a lot.

My question is; how do you cope with the guilt of things you've done while you were a drunken lunatic??

I've hooked up with guys with girlfriends when I've been blacked out, plus multiple other horrible sexual situations.  I've put myself in some insane situations and there are blackouts where I still don't know what I said or did, and I don't think I want to. Years ago I was so, so horrid to my mother. 

As of now I am crippled by feelings of guilt, for things I did up to five years ago and all the way up to two months ago. Usually when this happens I drink about it until I forget, or do some other horrible thing to occupy my mind. I just want to go back and change everything.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning wonderful sober family!

Well, it's the end of my week as host and I just want you all to know how much I have enjoyed it.  It's been a real privelege to kind of get to know more of you and watch your numbers grow.  As I mentioned yesterday, there's no meetings where I am, and if there were they wouldn't be in English, so when I was looking to get sober, and I read time after time that you need support and community to do it, I felt defeated before I even started.  I'm a million miles away from friends and family, and even if I wasn't, loving and supportive as my family is in their way, they wouldn't get it.  Don't get me wrong, they knew I had a problem, and they are glad I've stopped drinking, but I'm pretty sure they think I just woke up one day and got my act together, and praise the Lord we don't have to worry about that anymore!  My sister and my son are the only ones who know that I spend time with an online community and I've only told them recently.  So when I found r/stopdrinking it truly was a godsend.  I lurked for about a year before I finally committed to a badge, which I did have to reset once, but so it goes - I'm in good company in that.  Once I got the badge I started checking in daily and got to ""know"" some people whose real names I don't know, and whose faces I've never seen, but who I think about every single day and genuinely love.  The love and support and encouragement that a person can find here is so beautiful and amazing to the point of being overwhelming.

I’ve been so hungry lately, no matter how much I eat I always want more. It’s disgusting and making me fat. I want another cigarette five minutes after putting one out. Nothing can fucking satisfy me and it’s creating this dull rage. This awful abiding resentment. People and their small talk are so annoying to me. I don’t wanna be this guy. I feel so fucking out of control, isnt that what getting sober was supposed to prevent??? It’s been like three days of constantly either feeling like I want to cry or resisting the urge to punch the fuck out of something. It’s been almost four weeks! Why am I feeling this NOW?

The fucked up part is I’m acutely aware that alcohol will not satisfy me. Just like the eating and smoking, it just begets more craving, more need. The enjoyment is so short lived. I just so badly want to feel good just for a second. That’s the only real temptation. That and the constant fear that all the work I put in is for nothing, and I will never again know true pleasure. Im so afraid that I will never feel calm and satisfied, and truly enjoy myself without alcohol. Fuck.

2020-05-15 18:29:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gkizvb/how_i_did_it/,How I did it,"I was thinking my marriage was over but neither of us filed, my wife said she was fed up and would just leave and I could have custody (probably not true looking back). I coasted a week as a functional alcoholic. The next weekend, I went out thinking I had the world under control and woke up at the request of a police officer to find myself laying halfway on the sidewalk, halfway in the gutter/street of a residential area a mile or 2 from my home. No repercussions, he drove me home and even brought my phone to me a few hours later when someone found it.

My family saw me sleep the day away on the couch. Then never spoke of it. I thought I would have trouble winning custody with this and any new episodes, so I made up my mind to stop. But only until I won custody. I made it about 30 days on my own, then visited some nearby AA meetings. My wife was bar tending most nights, the irony that she got that job a week after I quit is amazing. I was able to go to as many meetings as I wanted to, the kids didn't give a crap about me for a while and were old enough to be left alone. I was working toward my secret goal of winning custody of a family who didn't want me around. LOL.

I heard so many people talking about how I couldn't change anyone else, only myself.  I figured, when the marriage was over, I would hope to leave everyone better off than we were at that moment.  Be a good father, a decent person to co-parent with, a better person than I had been. Eventually, I stopped thinking about divorce and custody and started thinking about how much trouble I had caused everyone.  So I asked someone to help me work the steps. I don't think I was convinced I was stopping forever at this time.

I learned a lot about myself, and I started to learn a lot about my family members because I learned how to listen and I was good at it when sober. The steps took me from Dec2018 to about May2019.  When August arrived, I went to my first funeral sober, a good friend who took care of his disabled wife and always had a great outlook. He did her makeup for work holiday parties. My wife is a cosmetologist in addition to bar tending. I thought, ""that is the kind of husband I want to be."" I cried. I stopped wanting a divorce and knew I wanted to fix things.

I almost had my wife agreeing to couples therapy (probably not true looking back). Then, about 2 weeks before my 1st full year of sobriety, she suffered a mild stroke. And I was able to be the rock that everyone needed. She can't tend bar and cannot work at a salon right now, but she can basically take care of herself and manages to take care of all of us to an extent. I imagine how poorly I would have handled this past year if I had NOT quit drinking. What would my relationship with my kids be? Who would be there for her?

I would very much credit my interest in getting sober and my more recent successes in staying sober at least in part to this sub-reddit. Reading the posts of others - understanding that I wasn't alone, that others had been where I was or worse, and most importantly that I was only fooling MYSELF. I was only hurting myself. I also purchased several of the popular quit drinking audio-books mentioned here quite regularly. I listened to them over and over and over again. I watched my best friend quit drinking close to 2 years ago. Drinking was what we did. We met at a bar. He worked at bars. We hung out at bars. We spent a great deal of time drunk in various bars. And one day he just stopped. And I thought it was a phase, or that he was overreacting, or having a mental break down or similar. And he just kept showing up at our dates, ordering tea while I guardedly sipped my IPAs. And he never judged me or told me what I was doing was wrong - but he did talk about how much better he felt, physically and mentally now that he had quit drinking. He looked better, seemed calmer, was more able to handle stress. He just WAS sober. 

So, I slowly started incorporating sober days after I would estimate 5-8 years of pretty near daily drinking. And the more times I woke up sober and well rested, and the more times I noticed how much better I felt, and how much better I did at work, and how many less fights I had with my husband, and how much better I looked - well, drinking was starting to look less and less like something that was fun and beneficial. 

You don't need to hit rock bottom to quit drinking. You don't need to let yourself get worse. You don't need to worry that your drinking isn't ""that bad"" because you haven't suffered particular consequences.  I have never gotten so much as a speeding ticket. I have been heavily promoted. I got married, bought a house and life very comfortably, all while drinking. But just because I didn't plow through a family with my SUV while drunk or lose my job for being too hung over doesn't mean that my drinking wasn't a problem. I think back on all the days I wasted hung over and angry. All the mental time and energy I wasted hiding and explaining and rationalizing my drinking to myself and others.  I remember the poor choices I made that caused fights between my wonderful husband and myself. I remember agonizing over and planning my next drinks - when, where, how much, how often? I guiltily remember being at family gatherings itching for an excuse to introduce drinking. Talking others into drinking with me, even when they didn't want to. And on, and on.

The real truth that I came to realize - through this subreddit and those books and watching my friend and from genuinely reflecting on my experiences with alcohol  - is an incredibly simple one: **I have NEVER woken up in the morning and wished that I had drank the day before. I never regretted NOT drinking, but I frequently regretted drinking.** Whenever I get the urge to drink now, I think about how I would feel the next day. Waking up at 245am with a parched throat and a full bladder. Groggy and over-caffeinated to try and combat the hang over. Slightly nauseous but craving greasy foods.  And that low grade anxiety that is alcohol withdrawal. That craving. That nagging feel that creeps on gradually during the course of the day - have a drink, just one to relax, it's been such a stressful day. Meanwhile your day is only so shitty because of the drinks you had yesterday that caused this hangover and withdrawal in the first place!

The key is to put the work and effort into truly changing the way you view alcohol. As long as you view it as something that you're MISSING OUT ON as opposed to something that is ACTIVELY HARMING YOU, you will always resent not drinking and will struggle to maintain sobriety. 

Sobriety is simple, but it isn't easy. It is, however, the most worthwhile thing I have ever done for myself. I have accomplished so much in these last 6 months and I have risen to so many challenges that I never would have thought myself capable of.  I knew years and years ago when I started lurking here that I had a problem, but it took me a long time and a lot of reading to see enough of myself to admit it. Sobriety has changed every aspect of my life for the better. It's positive effects could not be overstated. This time last year I definitely would have been 3 or 4 beers in wondering how many more I could sneak in before my husband got home, today I'm going to be able to enjoy the evening sober.

We would have deep conversations, while I was buzzed (I tend to get into deep thinking and I have pretty good ideas when I drink unfortunately). Still I kept it moderate and i knew when to stop. 

Until I didnt. This quarantine has had me drinking 5 to 7 days a week. From Noon until Dinner (After dinner id try to sober up to avoid hangovers)... Still, i never craved it, so i said ""I MUST BE IMMUNE TO ADDICTION!"" 

Well y'all here i am. This week i consciously tried to quit and i couldn't... I craved it.. i actually craved alcohol, i had huge urges to drink and i would succumb to them. Today for lunch, I craved again a drink and I did but as i drank, i felt disgusted. I am bloated, my skin is weird, my memory is shit, my anxiety is through the roof, I cant sleep well, I cant be proud of the man in front of the mirror and the weight ive gained is making me very self conscious and sick. Although my wife wont admit it... because shes a damn sweetheart a blessing... it does, deep inside, my wife is bothered by it. Because I am unproductive, I am just a bag of meat on the sofa, smiling, laughing, talking...

A year and a half ago, I REALLY fucked up. I quit cold-turkey. My kind and beautiful partner quit with me. About a month later, I lost my job. I stayed sober. I found a new job about a month later. It was kind of a joke—answering phones in a mostly empty office with Judge Judy or whatever on TV. I had always wanted to be a lawyer, but I was so burnt out after college that I took some time off to decide, which was when my drinking got out of control. Late in the testing/application game, I decided to give it a go. I studied the whole time I was at “work” for the next month, took the LSAT, applied, and was accepted to law school. I got a new job that is very close to home—and is much more demanding. I’ve been going to law school at night and working full-time during the day.

The creek I drive over on my way home was flooded.  It's normally  just a little stream about a yard at it's widest but it was about 20 feet across and raging.

Still on Lockdown.  Going on two months.  I'm not really sure what the plan is, but last I heard it was until May 30th.  

I haven't been keeping up with it.  I've been trying to learn about what I can do to keep myself and those I come into contact with safe.  Unfortunately, I have to break the 6ft social distancing rule for my jobby job.  

I've decided to keep my daughter at her Mom's because I don't want to spread the virus to her.  The latest research I've come across shows that it can be dangerous for the kiddo.  I think it's best for her and best for me because I don't have to worry about being responsible for possibly infecting her.  And she took her dog too, so that's good. 

Keeping myself and others is something I do have (some) control over.   When or if the Lockdown ends, I have no control over.   By focusing on the tangibles, I can create a sort of dam, to prevent the flooding for today.  Today is enough.  It's all we have, and it's all we'll ever have.

But last week was my first “taste” of temptation to break and have a drink. Triggered by easy reasons and excuses why “just having one drink” would be easier than actually dealing with the events currently going on in my life. Things just now ended in my drawn out/shitty relationship. One of my good friends is struggling with chronic depression and suicide. My unemployment/income in general may become compromised due to covid. Just heavy things. 

And out of no where while I was with some friends the other night, I heard *it*. The voice of temptation. It said “maybe one glass of red wine would be fine”. Boom. I caught it as soon as it came through. As if it was a suggestive thought or encouraging idea from someone other than my self. Like it wasn’t my own idea. A strange sensation. Probably the first time it’s happened since the beginning of this journey for me though- for which I am extremely grateful. But as soon as I thought it, I caught it and decided against it. 

I had almost come to believe that since Ive been doing this and practicing this for over a year now that I may have passed through that part already. But after getting back on this sub and reading some of the other stories and perspectives posted, I see that time isn’t something that may ever help that voice go away. It comes down to strength, discipline, and determination to help fight against the voice. And of course it doesn’t hurt to have an awesome community of people who are here to help, listen, and support one another. 

Long story short: fuck you temptation. Sobriety feels too good to give up. And to all my lovely people, friends, strangers, drinkers, sober Sally’s, somewhere in betweens on this sub and in this community:

Longtime reader of the sub, as I've been thinking about quitting for ages. Yesterday was my first day without a drink in probably 20 years. For the last 7-8 years, I was drinking 10-15 beers a day. 

For the last 2 or so months, I've had a lot of pain around the right side of my ribcage. I assumed I had pulled a muscle coughing, but after reading here and other places, I realize it may be liver damage as it's not going away. That scares the shit out of me and I plan on getting that checked out when I can get a doctor's appt. In the meantime, I had cut down to 6-8 a day. (Didn't want to cold-turkey down from 15.)

Wednesday night I started getting really sick (flu-like symptoms). I felt slightly better yesterday, so I tried to have a beer, but I couldn't even choke down a sip. Dumped the whole thing out and I went totally sober. Didn't crave a drink AT ALL. I slept like a baby, and holy shit, it feels amazing to wake up refreshed and not hungover! As I've been thinking about quitting anyway, these seems like the time to just do it. First day down! 

Here's the problem... feeling quite a bit better today and now my stupid brain is on overdrive with cravings and intrusive thoughts. ""See, you can do it if you have to! A drink or two today is fine, just don't go back to 6-8! You could just be a social drinker and not a raging alcoholic!"" ...all of which I KNOW is bullshit. Especially if I do, in fact, have liver damage.

I'm trying to drink a ton of water and I'm going to find something sweet to snack on since some of it is probably the sugar cravings, but how did you beat these thoughts back? I've seen a lot of people post here about falling off the wagon even months or years later with these same kind of justifications. 

I don't know what my long term holds, but I do know I need to see a doctor (top priority), and even if that goes well, I want to hit at least that 2 week ""brain reset"" mark so I have some clarity of thought and time to reflect.

Honestly, it's so fucking worth it. I've had bad days in sobriety, but nothing like the bad days (or weeks or months) when I was drinking. I don't want to die all the time anymore. For the first time in ages I actually appreciate life enough to be *scared* of dying. That is wild.

I'm constantly growing and I can see my progress in every part of my life. I basically stopped developing as a person in a lot of areas when I started drinking, because drinking (and drugs later on) quickly became a short cut to attaining the personality (social skills and not having anxiety about talking to people and so on) I've always wanted, but now I'm slowly learning to be that person without ruining my life while doing it.

Started therapy in early April, and honestly I think it's made a huge difference to my sobriety journey. I'd never made it past 30 days before, and this time around I'm feeling much stronger and more secure. 

Anyway, my therapist and I got on the topic of perfectionism a few weeks back. She noticed that I hold myself to a very high standard and I'm quite hard on myself if I don't achieve everything I mean to. She asked me to consider why I still strive for perfection even when I know it's unattainable (because, of course, perfection doesn't exist). 

Long story short, social media & diet culture plays a huge role in my perfectionism (shocker!), and I found that **the only way to silence my inner critic was to drown her out with booze.** My therapist hadn't even prompted me to connect the dots between my perfectionism and my drinking, it just happened organically while I was journalling. I was floored. I realized that I had associated drinking with relaxation, and so became increasingly dependent on it the more perfectionistic I became. Of course, this just created a terrible cycle of drink, feel guilty, tell myself I'm a piece of shit, and repeat. 

I feel like I've finally found the catalyst in this vicious cycle, and I can now work on being kinder and more understanding with myself, so that I don't feel compelled to drink. 

Any tips you have on being kind to yourself, or reducing your tendencies to perfectionism, would be much appreciated.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning all you wonderful sober superheroes!!

(This is a bit late because I had some technical difficulties and lost what I had written, and so I had to start over, and it took a different turn the second time around...)

When I was still drinking and starting to seriously try to figure out how to quit, I did a lot of reading, seaarching online, listening to podcasts, watching videos, etc in my quest to find a solution.  And a couple terms I came across were ""white knuckling"" and ""dry drunk"".  While I kind of understood the concept, I didn't really get it at all.  I thought, sober is sober right?  If you quit drinking, you quit drinking.  If someone stops drinknig, what does it matter if they work on the reasons they drank or not?  That's just some AA dogma (100% no disrespect to AA, I would actually love to try it out, but it's not available here, and because of that I absolutely HAD to believe there was another way and find it).  Wouldn't a person's life be improved either way?  And besides, I knew full well that I drank because of pain and trauma, so what reasons were there for me to figure out??  And this whole concept sort of stuck in my craw, and I turned it over in my mind many times and often wished I could discuss it with someone.  Now that I've logged some sober time myself, after many, many failed attempts, I believe I get it now.  The irony is that even when I didn't understand what it meant to be a ""dry drunk"" (which by the way, I would never presume to call someone because we're all on our own paths, and it seems rather dismissive of whatever that person might going through in their effort to be sober), I was actively seeking answers because simply quitting was impossible.  ""White knuckling"" never worked for more than a week or so.  I wanted it to be easy.  I wanted to just snap my fingers and not have a drinking problem anymore.  I wanted it to be as simple as putting down the bottle.  I didn't want it to be hard and I didn't want to work at it.  And so to find an easy answer I read, and searched, and tried and failed, and read more, and learned more, and tried again, listened to more podcasts, watched more youtube videos, read endless posts here (my absolute favorite resource!) and on and on, until finally I got some time, and it felt so good, and then I relapsed, but I learned from that too, and I got back up, and I kept reading, and coming here, and learning and *working damn hard* at figuring out why I drank and finding solutions for it.  I was doing the hard work and changing my thinking around drinking (which, by the way, eventually brings you to start reexamining your thinking about pretty much everything), and coming to better understand the reasons why I drank, all while trying to just find the easy way out.  And the work continues, and will continue, and I'm very thankful for it because it is making me a more whole and content person with so much more compassion and gratitude and depth.  I honestly believe that having to face down addiction is an incredible blessing, and even though some days I want to launch sobriety, with all it's work and self-examination, and evreything that comes with it into the ocean and just be ""normal"", I wouldn't trade it for anything.  It's about so much more than simply not drinking.

So on that note, I salute each and every one of you and whatever work you are doing, whatever efforts you are putting in, whereever you are on the journey.  You showed up here today, and that is awesome and I love you so much for it!!  Have a great Friday folks!  I will not drink with you today!

P.S. Another reminder to anyone with 30 days or more who would like to host the DCI, please let u/SaintHomer know.  I highly recommend it, it's a great experience, and you don't have to be some kind of sober guru or expert like me ;-)  But seriously, it's really great, and I've loved it and learned a lot doing it.

These include some people who were really horrible to me based off of my background and I saw a situation where they were acting totally different, based off of someone else's background, totally giving them the red color treatment while they were abusive to me. It reminded me again how bad they made me feel.

As I reflect back, losing sleep on this, my thought is we often drink to cover pain and that pain is often from banging our head again and again. But maybe the reason we're banging our head is we set the bar too low.

Maybe the reason people are always being shitty to you isn't that you're shitty but that they're shitty people and you haven't opened yourself up enough to the possibility there's other places you can go where people will be better. Or that that job that hurts you is only a temporary holding zone and you could break out to something better. Or that this time right now, that feels boring and lonely, could be push-up time or reading time or something that let's you power up time.

So I drank to make that feeling go away, then felt miserable in the morning and craved more alcohol, keep doing that for a few days and become a shaking mess. Absolute misery. Rinse and repeat for 5 or 10 years.

There was also some self-deception about it - ""oh I need to clean my living room, I'll just have some drinks so I can have fun while I clean up! Then it won't be boring!"" Clean for five minutes and then crash out watching YouTube for 3 hours while getting smashed. Pathetic.

One thing that helped me was a post I read here that was really great - and I wish I could find it - basically saying ""it's okay to be bored.""

It's okay, in fact entirely normal, to occasionally feel bored, or anxious, or nervous. Those are inevitable human emotions. They don't have to be drowned out, in fact if I was willing to wait an hour and just endure through it those feelings almost always went away. Some tasks are just boring but you do them anyway and it's not that big of a deal. (Revelatory, right?)

The really interesting thing that prompted me to make this post is that the blank, empty, bored feeling that used to spur me to drink - I don't get it anymore. Turns out that was just an artifact from the drinking brain! Alcohol was in fact creating the problem, then presenting itself as the solution.

I had a lot of false starts - making it 3, 5, 14 days, reset my badge a bunch of times - and I think I learned from those too. But now that I'm over 5 months since last drinking, it does feel like my brain has largely repaired itself. And after the many miserable days associated with drinking, I really really don't want to go back to square one and start again. 

Anyway, I'm at the longest I've ever been without alcohol since I started drinking when I was 14 years old. Life just feels a lot better now. Just wanted to share with people who may be in the same spot I was for a long time, and say it really does get easier after quitting for awhile - cravings do subside, life does measurably improve.

2 weeks later later I'm a little buzzed and bubbly while talking with her on the phone, and she gets suspicious. She probes me for a while to ask if I'm drunk and I fess up. She's upset, she hangs up and I don't hear from her until about 6 hours ago where she says she can't be with me anymore.  


I'm devastated. I talk to her again this morning and it all comes spilling out, she thinks I'm a liar, that I'm lazy. That I'm not the person she fell in love with.

I felt death eagerly waiting for me to continue to do what I was doing to my body. I drank a lot before but the quarantine and self isolation kicked it up another notch. I acknowledged I had a problem for a long time but never sought help or confidence in admitting I had a problem to my loved ones. That day I mustered up a message to my family telling them I was gonna quit and needed help, and how much it hurts to tell them that I was in a dark place.

My family didnt know how to handle me and at first I thought my hallucinations were a reality so I was disregarding my families efforts to keep me from the world. I managed to escape one day and ended up getting myself arrested(my mind was in another world) the first few days in jail I thought I had control but the people spoke with begged to differ. After being thrown into an isolated cell in the dark, I dealt with a lot of demons( use this word to your beliefs) and I felt pain and fear. The next morning after being in jail for 3 days and finally sleeping a full nights rest, I woke up not trembling, not hearing things, and only seeing what was real. My family left me in there longer, I guess so I didnt have any access to alcohol. During these moments of clarity and enforced isolation I had to spend 23 hours a day in a cell, gave me a lot of time to rest and even more time to evaluate myself and what I want in life and who I want to be in life. I had in life. I eventually got out and have been sober since, and the clarity is beautiful. My bank account is healthy and I am healthy.

2020-05-14 20:01:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gjybei/i_need_help/,I need help.,"Hello good citizens of this sub.

I need help.

In late 2016 my drinking started to cause me problems - depression, anxiety, inability to care about anything. My marriage was falling apart, which didn't help (and of course the drinking didn't help the situation). I read ""This Naked Mind"" at that time, and it switched a flip in my brain. I quit drinking immediately, no problem, and immediately became happier and healthier. We decided to get a divorce, which was the right decision (the drinking wasn't the cause of our issues, it just didn't help anything). 

I was feeling *good*. I started going on dates. I told people up-front that I wasn't a drinker, so they'd know what they were getting into. Then, I went on a date with N. She was...smoking. I was astonished that someone that attractive would even go on a date with me, but lo and behold we started spending lots of time together and got physical pretty quickly. However, she was a big drinker (""I'm a functioning alcoholic"" she said at one point) so I started drinking with her. I started drinking for a woman, when I was perfectly happy myself to not drink. Stupid decision.

A few months later, and it's clear that she's not serious (""I don't really like to get to know people"", she said). That's not enough for me. She breaks it off. I'm sad, and alone, but also feel optimistic about the future: I know my marriage was a mistake, and now I have time and space to build something for myself. I'm not spiraling or anything, but I drink on the weekends. 

One weekend, I pull out of a bar at 2am. I'll spare you the details. They're very mundane and frustrating. DUI, lawyers who were more opportunistic than looking out for me, etc, etc. I have to go through a program and be sober.

It's great! Really loved the program and my counselor. Had to go to some AA meetings and FUCKING LOVED them (Infinite Jest is one of my favorite books, so I was kind of primed to enjoy AA). I remember thinking, ""I'm not an alcoholic, but I wish I could be so I could come to these meetings all the time."" I graduate from the program, my counselor tells me I don't really have an issue, just don't drive next time you go out for dinner and beers with your girlfriend - by this time I had been on Tinder and going on dates with lots of people. One stuck, hard.

I hadn't drank in about 7 months, and was now free to do so. I did. I got a beer and a tequila at a local Mexican place, and I honestly just remember how terrible they tasted - they didn't give me any pleasure at all. But the bottle, as it goes, was uncorked. This was February 2018 and I drank until sometime in the summer, when I think I quit for two months or so, really feeling like I was done, I knew I needed drinking out of my life, and I was happy to quit. I picked it up again in early fall when my girlfriend and I were meeting some of her friends I didn't know (and wanted to impress; they're super into nice wine), and we floated down a river and drank all day. Drinking became regular again.

We got married, bought a house, had our first kid. I was unemployed for 4 months and drank a ton, staying up super late (this is my preference: don't start until 11 or 12 and drink until the morning).

It's been progressing for a while, and WFH quarantine has let the beast a little looser than it has been. I've been unhappy with my drinking and I know I want to live an alcohol-free life. In February I had a streak of 16 days. Late April until last Sunday I had another streak of 16 days.

My problem is not that I'm unhappy not drinking or constantly craving it. When I go a week without drinking I feel incredible. But then stress starts to creep in; I don't know how to truly relax without drinking. I have hobbies: I read and write fiction (I'm very serious about my writing - I write every day (except when the drinking gets bad, naturally) and it gives me a lot of life. However, while it gives me peace, it's work, and it's not stress-relieving). I like to play online card games sometimes. These are fun, and engage my brain, but are not stress-relieving. The more I get into them the more I feel I have to optimize and learn and then it becomes like another job. I love to read and this is highly enjoyable but I am also constantly analyzing everything I read, underlining, thinking about metaphors and turns of phrases and how a character gets implanted in the reader's mind and how it can all hinge on the perfect turn of phrase - you know, because I'm trying to write well.

And then I have a baby, too. the cliches are true, of course: so much work, but so worth it, blah blah blah.

What I'm getting at is that I don't seem to know how to relax, and when the pressure of my life builds to a breaking point (which based on experience seems to be roughly around the 16-day mark), I cave and drink and feel amazing for one night, and wake up feeling emotionally drained in an almost cathartic way. But I can't stop; I then have to drink the next night.

I exercise: Run twice a week and lift weights 5x/ week. These are good and make my body feel good but they do not seem to really relieve me of stress. Since I have to fit them in with my other goals (writing every day, reading enough), often I feel stressed about the time they are taking. Anything I start to enjoy I have to analyze and optimize and try to become the best at. I can't just ""waste time"" (I have so little of it! Death comes for us all!). I don't watch TV or Netflix. My wife and I watched a movie over the course of a week a little bit ago and it was the first movie we'd watched in probably 6 months.

I don't think stress is necessarily the MAIN issue, but it seems to be the issue that stops me from breaking through to more dry time.

Also, I'm lonely as fuck, but I'm a man in his thirties in the U.S., so that goes without saying. I am very in touch with the emotional fact that I am craving close friends, of which I have none. I don't even have casual friends, really (I'm an introvert, but not shy, but also seem to have difficulty maintaining connections with people). I have very close friends from college that know me well, but we all live in different cities and we don't talk a lot.

I need help. How do I relax? How do I stop falling back on this crutch that sidelines my goals and makes me a worse father and husband and employee and writer?",3,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3659997}"

In 2016 my husband and I were scheduled to move to New Mexico for the military, he got a DUI, and promptly got released from duty. 

WE HAD NO PLANS OR JOBS OR A CLUE

It was absolutely terrifying. And our savings dwindled every month too. I took a job that made gosh.... 5-10% of our needed monthly income doing work I HATED. Husband took a job working in a toxic, trucker parking lot in the hot Florida summer sun all day making also.. 5-10% of our expenses. 

Every day we said to each other “thank you for working for our family” as we went to do the only thing we could making not nearly enough. 

Eventually I got a job appropriate for me, making not quite half our needed income. My husband did the same. We cut our expenses and.. it’s 2020 and we are still ok. 

That was the scariest experience of my (our) life. Maybe in light of things we could share some “there was no light at the end of the tunnel” stories that ended up ok.

I am a huge dog lover and my ex will not allow me to see my dog.
I am so lost without him, I used to go on hikes for hours every day to give me peace and now it's gone.

I don't want to take doctors meds as I honestly think there BS and its a placebo type scenario, and I think they can do more harm than good.

I've been hitting the booze a lot lately, got my car rear ended by some utter cu#t at a traffic light, so now I have no car. And then I lost my job to top it all off.

We been fighting it undiagnosed for 2 months and thankfully her last 2 days alive were spent at home surrounded by her husband and two sons. She lost her ability to speak or move a while before she came home, but I’m sure she knew what was happening. She fought hard to get to
Mother’s Day then let go and slowly passed away. I’m beyond gutted and for the most part still in shock/numb. I was always worried about how I’d respond to tragedy and that I’d use it as an instant excuse to start up the party again.

1-my mom liked that I stopped drinking. I wanna keep making her proud.  
2- as weird as it sounds... I’m only gonna experience this once and I want to experience all the pain, sadness, and happiness from this process I can. I’m never gonna lose another mother, I shouldn’t numb myself from the process.  
3-I already feel shitty enough from all the comfort eating I’m doing I DO NOT need a hangover on top of that.  
4-now more so than ever the absolute futility of drinking is on full display. It’s not gonna make my sadness go away, it’s not gonna being her back, it’s not gonna make anything easier. There’s just no point for it.

I love going to new and writing a line or two hoping that my experience can benefit another redditor struggling like I was just a couple of months ago. 

Here are some pro's and con's of my 3 months of sobriety:

Pro: So much money saved, cards paid off. Started 3D printing, doing more photography, learning new software. Became extremely productive at work, even though working remote. My sleep is 140% better, my shits are like perfect submarines. I am less agitated. I can focus and remember things better. I can read better in front of people and have less anxiety speaking in front of a large crowd. My apartment is much cleaner and now there is sunlight. My nose is not scabby or bleeding from prolonged cocaine use. I have quit smoking cigarettes, but still vape nasty Juul but eventually will quit because it tastes like ashtray water. I have become more open with my friends and my mother. I am now panning ahead, thinking of buying a house. I am no longer blaming this expensive city for being broke all the time.

Cons: I gained some weight because I've been eating a lot of ice cream and pastries. A reward for not drinking, but stupid nevertheless. Not vomiting also means I'm keeping the food that I ate in my stomach. 

And that's about it for cons. I don't miss sitting alone at bars wondering why no one would talk to me. I don't miss hangovers. I don't miss anxiety from checking my bank account. I don't miss making grand ambitious plans to only forget them the next day. I don't miss interacting with drunks who boast about themselves only to forget your name.

2020-05-14 13:41:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gjr3a1/15_days_hard_part_starting/,15 days. Hard part starting.,"Hi all,

I'm 38 yo trans man, 2 kids, separated from partner for the last month, and 15 days of no booze (which is the longest I've gone in 12 years).

I started drinking regularly/heavily 12 years ago when I was in engineering graduate school and working full time. I'd work all day, come home and write my thesis until 11pm. Someone gave me a bottle of scotch, and I started using it to find relief.

It's amazing I didn't start before that. I went to college in central texas in the late 90s, and came out as a dyke. My friends, my church, and my family outright rejected me. At the time, the Young Conservatives of Texas liked to drive around in the backs of pickup trucks shouting GAYS GO TO HELL, and ADAM AND EVEN NOT ADAM AND STEVE. And normal college kids wore shirts and had bumper stickers that said ""steers and queers go to austin"". And even the local mall sold shirts that said ""Queerios: feeding austin since 1970"". Everyone was happy to give you their opinion that you were being led by the devil parading as an angel of light, and that maybe you were even possessed. Sadly I believed them. I even dreamed of being crucified, and dreamed of being possessed like in the exorcist.

I tried to escape College Station, but couldn't. I developed severe anxiety and depression. Became ex-gay. Thought I should kill myself instead of ""offend god"". Managed to make it through to graduation with the help of an older atheist dyke, but did not make it out unscathed. I left for Seattle in 2003 with $1200 and a trunk of trash. I ate from the garbage and got rejected from every job for months until I finally found one, and financially I've been ok since then. It was a brush with near homelessness but thankfully that did not happen to me. Just complete abandonment. To this day I don't have proper memories (do you know what I mean?) until after I had been in Seattle for about a year and recovered from all the trauma.

I feel stupid typing all this out, but I need to. Obviously you won't read it if it's boring.

Prior to my traumatic experience of age 19, I lived with an abusive mother and a weak father. She routinely told us kids we'd die alone, become drug addicts, were losers, were mean, were stupid, bitches, etc. She choked me up against cabinets in the house. She ""pretended"" to abandon me in public to teach me a lesson. And of course she spanked us in cruel and unusual ritualistic ways (but I'd take that any day over the words). My brother was caught self-injuring by cutting big gashes across his chest with a sword. When they were taking him to the doctor, my mother was berating him telling him he would die alone and was a loser. My dad was there, and didn't stop her. When I wore a button down shirt instead of a ""blouse"" to a local small town wedding at age 21, my mother lost her mind so badly that she careened across the room trying to kick me and scratch my face. It's the only time my father intervened, and to this days she uses it against him as ""the time he was not on her side.""

Anyway it wasn't until I was 33 that I fully kicked them out of my life with the help of a wonderful therapist. And this was after my mother had hit me again, as a full grown adult. I made huge changes in myself then, and for the first time did not wrestle with suicidal tendencies, wondering each year if I would make it to the next. I am so grateful to say now that I haven't felt suicidal in over 6 years. I also feel like I see color now, and have access to so much more depth.

To move quickly forward in the abridged version, I've been with my partner for 12 years, in various states of unhappiness, and recently have realized I've been utterly miserable for the last 2 years. 1 month ago I moved into an RV in the backyard. 2 weeks ago I stopped drinking.

I have experienced more peace in the last 2 weeks than I have in 2 years. I drank to survive. I did not drink to avoid stage fright, or deal with a ""hard job"". I drank because I couldn't see going on living without some relief, sometimes. And, after a brief flirtation with opiates, understood alcohol to be my best option (and that I should never, ever touch opiates again).

6 years ago I made a huge leap with therapy, and now I feel it's time to consider another transformation. I'm being pulled to remove alcohol from the equation. Largely because I've started having alcohol related heart palpitations and have to take beta blockers for it. Also because I've lived with this internal fight over alcohol for so long: I -know- I shouldn't get drunk every night, but I must or else there is no peace at all for me. If I have no access to peace at all, how can I go on living?

I'm at a place where I'm willing to consider that I do actually have access to peace outside of alcohol now.

The first 2 weeks were easy, but I find my cravings coming on hard now. I am observing what makes me want to drink - hard conversations, stressful work meetings, and even good news (I want to amplify the dopamine). There are so many triggers.

I've ready 2/3 of This Naked Mind, and so far all it's doing is making me want to drink very badly, because her science is so ridiculously misrepresented. And she's soapboxing about how alcohol is just strictly awful. If it was only awful, how did it help me live all these years? Anyway. That book is not for me.

I am 4 chapters into Recovery by Russell Brand and I have found it to resonate very deeply. I don't drink to impress my colleagues, I drink at home with my children to make it through the (seemingly) unbearable evenings; to handle my life; to find a modicum of peace.

Anyway, if you've made it this far, thank you. I'm hoping I'll find similar stories and inspiration here i this community. As mentioned, the last two weeks have shown me more peace than I've felt in years and that's promising. I notice that the drink is beginning to tempt me again though, so I'm reaching out to a community to learn more.

I try to give up alcohol over and over again but I can't watch or do anything without the theme or a glorification of alcohol and what it portrays gets me. It really sucks cause I quit for 2 months.

For me, it was my realization that my arrogance was taking everything from me. It took my career. It took my best friends. It took my health. My certainty that I was right and everyone is wrong led me to feel so alone. 

I drank and got high because I constantly felt alone. I drank and got high to feel alive and happy when every day I was beating myself up with shame.

I couldn’t stop obsessing about drinking. If I took a night off I’d be patting myself on the back to the liquor store only to binge for like 10 days..rinse repeat.

Then it slowly crept to once every week with the occasional night here or there. Feeling pretty accomplished, I have lost 23 lbs. well last weekend was a big wake up call. I had been drinking 2x a week but still feeling in control until Sunday. On Friday night I was with my ex and got blackout on Friday. Came to on sat am at 7 and immediately took a shot of tequila. Followed by the rest of the bottle. I literally have flashes of Saturday. I then woke up Sunday and felt like a bus had hit me. I did have 4 drinks Sunday just because..just fucking because. When I left his place on Monday morning I felt like my old self and really shitty. I haven’t had a drink since and I’ve finally started to get a mental handle on my triggers. Yes of course having a drink Sounds amazing. I would love to have a drink RIGHT NOW. But what I don’t want is the hangover, the questioning my actions, the anxiety, the guilt, the bloating, the mental fog, the shit that comes after drinking. And the cons outweigh the pros big time.

Here’s some background: we’ve been drinking buddies in the bar world for a couple decades. I’ve been waning myself off for years and have drank maybe 2-4 times this month. He’s been drinking every day for a couple months and somehow I reached out to him when he was about to really lose his mind so he asked me to take him. 

Observations: it was a really nice place, the people seemed so nice. It was clean and didn’t feel like a jail or anything. He almost chickened out and this was the second day we had tried to do this. There was a middle aged family guy who’s wife had brought him in and he was obviously drunk but was rambling on in a funny way making jokes and apologizing. It was hilarious and kind of cute. Anyway, while they were talking to my friend I heard all the stuff they did to take this guy in like (I think) search his bag, take his phone, ask his clothing side (I’m guessing to give him clothes?)

So I’m wondering a ton of stuff. Do they really take all your stuff and then can you not leave? Is it enforced that you are stuck there? How do they do that, can they restrain you? It didn’t seem like that kind of place at all. Maybe it seemed more like they verbally convinced people. Ok and then, do you get your own room?  How long are you in there? Do they call someone to come get you after? I hope he gave them my number. I’m worried he gave them this person who is a huge drinker because he has a crush on them and knows they ply him with booze. Can I call them and what info will they even give me?

He’s on Medicaid so I was really shocked at how civilized this place was. Maybe it’s just a detox place. I’ve visited another friend in rehab and it was nightmarish and creepy.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49071842}"

No booze!)","Tl;dr: Thank you to everyone in r/stopdrinking. If it weren't for this community I could have never found the clarity and motivation I needed to stay sober. 

The #1 thing that helped keep me from drinking was coming here, reading posts, and leaving comments. Sharing in everyone's ups and downs helped me stay focused. Sometimes talking about alcohol on here was too much and I had to take a break, but I always came back. You are all wonderful!

\---------------------------------------

Here's my long-winded story:

One year ago I woke up hungover, feeling terrible, and finally admitted ""I can't keep doing this."" I'd been drinking around 300ml of whiskey every night, waking up feeling awful, stumbling through my days, and then drinking again in the evenings to ""feel better."" The smell of alcohol made me feel ill, but I drank though it, and after a glass it didn't bother me anymore.

Even then, knowing I had to make a change, I couldn't commit to stopping ""forever."" I initially committed to 30 days sober as a ""reset."" I'd done 30 days before (...years before), so I thought it would be tough, but doable. What I didn't realize was that I was a lot younger the last time I'd gone 30 days, and had been drinking a lot less at the time. This time I had insomnia and mood swings for about 10 days before I could finally sleep again. Realizing this was withdrawal helped me recognize that I truly did had a problem (which should have been obvious, but we are great at fooling ourselves, aren't we?) After those 10 days, though, I slept great.

Early in those 30 days I found this group. When I first learned what ""IWNDWYT"" stands for, I cried. It's such a simple, beautiful statement of solidarity. It took me a while to work up the courage to make an account and post, but becoming active here is probably the #1 thing that has kept me sober. 

For those who like lists, here are some other things that helped :

* This community (I'm repeating this for the people who skipped the text). Reading posts, leaving comments, doing the daily check-in. Upvoting other people who are going through the same thing I am.
* Keeping my hands busy. In the first days I bought a kit of embroidery thread and made friendship bracelets for my friends and family. Weird? Yes. But I had to keep my brain engaged and my hands busy without overwhelming myself, and friendship bracelets were the right combination of engaging without requiring too much brain power. Now I can do more complicated hobbies, but in the beginning I had to start simple.
* Recognizing that this was something I had to do on my own. Don't get me wrong, my husband has been supportive -- he has kept drinking, but he has never pressured me to drink. But he didn't want to join me in being sober, so I had to decide to do it on my own. I couldn't wait for someone else to come along and help me
* Treating willpower like a finite resource. Figuring out the things that triggered my ""drinking reflex"" and doing what I could to avoid them. If I couldn't avoid them, I gave myself permission to let some things slip (do that work tomorrow, leave the dishes in the sink, let the laundry sit for another day) as long as I stayed sober.
* Not thinking about ""forever"" or ""the rest of my life"". I am sober today, which is the only day I can be sober for. But the sober days do start to pile up, which is nice.
* These books and videos (I hope this doesn't count as promotion? They are all linked in the list of resources as well):
   * ""This Naked Mind"" by Annie Grace ([book](https://www.amazon.com/This-Naked-Mind-Discover-Happiness/dp/0996715002) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4KpBxerD_BIksjUfUT4hVw/videos) channel) -- helped me change my thinking about alcohol from ""a treat I deserve"" to ""a thing I deserve to be free of""
   * ""[Alcohol Explained](https://www.amazon.com/Alcohol-Explained-William-Porter-ebook/dp/B00W4D1YW4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=alcohol+explained&qid=1589463521&s=books&sr=1-1)"" -- understanding how alcohol affects the brain helped me understand why I can't moderate, and why going back to drinking will only end up with me in the same position I was before
   * The TEDx talks ""[Making sober less shameful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKfuGMzmfTs)"" by Clare Pooley and ""[Grey Area Drinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvCMZBA7RiA)"" by Jolene Park and  -- changing my perspective on alcohol, how ingrained it is in society, how it affected me, and how I felt about it
* Ice cream. At first I was worried about the calories, but then I did the math and realized I was incapable of eating as many calories of ice cream as I'd been drinking every evening. I lost some weight. I'm working on cutting back now

I need to vent, but I'm also feeling depressed which makes talking about this even harder. I also don't want to be a burden, yet again, I don't have where else to go.

Tomorrow, I'll be 50 days sober and while I feel somewhat proud of this achievement, I am not happy, although I haven't been sober for this long in so many years (I can't even remember) and the last time I managed to stay clean for about 40 days was [almost three years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6jlzpq/a_retrospective_of_my_first_sober_month_in_years/).

Long story short, I was diagnosed with GERD and I am still struggling to fight off unpleasant symptoms. In a way, it was bound to happen, as I was reckless with my health and well-being and it was time to pay for my mistakes as I'm fairly convinced that alcohol and poor diet lead me to this.

I wish I would have stopped before. It breaks my heart whenever I am thinking about how this could have been avoided. Perhaps someone who is reading this and struggling to stay sober can learn from my own misery. Perhaps someone who has been sober longer and struggled with this disease can shed some light and tell me that things will eventually get better as time goes by. Maybe it's too early in the process and healing will take a lot of time.

I don't know, I feel confused, overwhelmed and downcast. Ironically, I am not even thinking of drinking. It is fairly easy to stay sober since I am not feeling good. I am just hoping that sobriety will pay off eventually in terms of improvement for my symptoms.

On a brighter side, I lost some weight (although I kept the waist belly which I still need to lose), I kept my job in this even more crazy world we're living in, I can actually save money now that I am not drinking.

I hope everyone who's struggling gets to see some light at the end of the tunnel. I sincerely hope we'll all recover someday. Thanks for reading and sorry for the wall of text.

We have become good friends with our neighbour to the East over the last year. They are lovely people and have two great kids that we are quite fond of. A few months ago I went out on a limb and asked S (the guy) if he would be open to teaching me how to ride. Like really ride, not sit on the back of a horse that knows what to do and where to go. He said yes and told me to text him when I had time. Well, I was drinking back then and whenever I had free time I was tipsy or drunk. I never got around to texting him. 

Fast forward to yesterday and out of the blue, he texts me saying he was going for a ride and would I like to learn. I have been sober for about 40 days now and I felt like I was finally ready to get in the saddle. It was the most amazing experience I have had in a long, long time. I have never felt that level of connection with an animal. Once we were done he invited me to come over and ride anytime I wanted (he said it is good for the horses to get ridden by other people and gives him a chance to exercise them more). 

The thing is, I could have done this a little tipsy, but it would have been stupid and unsafe. Plus I don't think I would have felt it as much as I did yesterday. It was a completely different level of experience and I am so grateful my mind was clear for it.

The main thing holding me back has been fear of missing out when I'm in a house with daily drinkers clicking glasses in the garden, which is even harder in lockdown. I've also been trying to get used to the idea of a new identity when I've been a life and soul of the party type for the last 20 years. I come from a family of heavy drinkers and alcoholics who've normalised it so it's a pretty radical thing to do. 

But it's not fun anymore and I think I've crossed a line that means I'm playing Russian roulette every time I pick up a drink. It could be ok but there's a good chance it will end badly, so the bad now outweighs the good. It does nothing for my mental health either, so I've got to sacrifice the BBQs and celebrations and beer gardens that won't be the same, to make my life better overall.

I’m about a week in. 7 days!! I wouldn’t call myself a “typical” alcoholic, but since  I quit drinking it becomes clearer and clearer how deep in I was in reality. 

I’m really struggling with finding social activities to do that don’t involve alcohol. I like hanging with my friends and they fully respect my choice to not drink, but I somehow still feel like missing out. I feel like this “should” be my wild years before I settle down into a stable life. 

Deep down I disagree with this mindset and I’m comfortable reading a book and staying in on Saturday night. However, this makes me feel like I’ll lose my friends since every activity sort of includes (a little) alcohol. This small amount of alcohol makes me unable to stop drinking for the night and makes me wake up regretful and ashamed.

Are there any fellow students in here that feel the same? Is there anyone with some tips maybe or is willing to share their own experience? I figure we’re all in this together somehow and it would feel good to hear from you.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I think that most of us have heard or experienced the fact that alcohol increases anxiety.  A lot of us have used alcohol to treat our anxiety, only to learn either from a book, another person, or our personal experience that alcohol actually causes and/or increases our anxiety.  I've heard the comparison that drinking for anxiety is like putting out a fire with gasoline.

A couple of days ago the subject of boredom came up in a lot of your comments here in the DCI, and in interacting and talking with you all, I came to see an aspect of my sobriety that I hadn't fully appreciated yet.  I used to drink for boredom A LOT.  The last several years I have had the winter months off, and I've lived in a wonderful, beautiful dream of a place that has horribly cold, dark winters (Swiss Alps).  Think short days with precious little direct sunlight, long nights and nowhere to go.  Unless you ski or snowboard (I do neither) there is absolutely nothing to do where I live in winter.  I took to drinking to kill the time, and to relieve my boredom.  When I quit drinking, and quarantine hit, I was absolutely terrified about how I would handle the boredom.  Well, what I realized the other day was that I'm not bored anymore.  I have loads of time to kill, but I'm not bored.  I no longer feel the need to escape the free time.  When I was drinking, even when I wasn't drunk, I didn't enjoy the simple things that I could do to pass the time such as reading or arts and crafts.  Now I'm doing a cross-stitch, which is arguably rather ""boring"" but I love it.  I've started baking for fun again, and I can read for hours, which I could not do when I was drinking.  So what I see now, that I couldn't see then, was that alcohol was *causing* my boredom, not fixing it.  It was robbing me of the energy to enjoy the things I could have been doing with my time, and deceiving me into believing that it was the solution to that lack of enjoyment.  Drinking for boredom was like putting out a fire with gasoline.

Have you found anything that you drank for that drinking was actually causing or making worse?  What fires were you trying to put out with gasoline?

I love you all!  Special shout out to all of you on day one, be kind to yourselves!  Let's have a great day, and I will not drink with you today!!

My problem is this: I like to drink, and when I drink, I have a hard time stopping. I don’t have to drink everyday. However, when I do drink, especially when I go out at the weekend with friends, that's when there's some problems.

Sometimes I go out for the night knowing I'll get drunk. Once I start drinking, I just lose control and can't stop. I like to keep drinking and drinking and get more drunk till I get wasted and lose all control.

One time I've gone out for a few drinks and blacked out, basically sleeping on the bar table all alone and the bar was about to close around 5 am, the waiter saw my phone ringing on the table and answered, talked to my mom (after hundreds of missed calls she was worried to death), told her which place I was at, so my family came and picked me up. I dont remember any of it. Another time I blacked out, woke up next day at home and saw that I have bruises on my face and scratches all over my neck and have no idea what happened.

This is obviously a problem. It is causing problems in the family, my mother is worried sick every weekend when I go out because after some drinks I lose control and I dont answer my phone, she stays awake waiting for me at home shaking till 4-5 am sometimes. She is really on the verge of losing her mind worrying something will happen to me.

I want to stop this but I really can not control myself once I start drinking. I was wondering if psychotherapy would help? I also looked up the medication called Naltrexone, which some folks use in conjunction with the 'Sinclair Method'... it blocks the excessive dopamine response from drinking, and makes overconsumption psychologically much less appealing..

2020-05-13 21:37:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gjcol5/rip_dad/,RIP dad,"Four years ago yesterday my father died of complications from alcoholism. He was a kind, thoughtful, unusual man. 
   He was absent during my upbringing, and his most enduring presence in my life was his absence. I had attachment issues, and I sought attention from men. When I was a preteen and into adulthood, I managed to put myself in countless dangerous situations. Ultimately, I am ok, but I endured a lot unnecessarily.  
   In adulthood, we reconnected, and we tried to make a relationship that was special, but for me, it was always strained. He lived far across the country, and lived in poverty. I wasn’t financially endowed myself, and we were both alcoholics so saving money was rare, and travel was rarer still. We had phone calls occasionally, and over twenty years, we visited a handful of times. 
    When he died, I traveled to his adopted city to clean his home, order his cremation and gather his remains, turn off utilities, and say goodbye. At his home I discovered forty years worth of daily journals. I shipped them (320lbs) to my city, and for the next year or so I read them. During this time, I was drinking a ton, though I’m not sure it was any more than I had been before his death. I would read these journals, and pour drink after drink, crying and laughing and reading and crying until my husband had been asleep for hours in our bed. 
    He was a thoughtful, kind, and injured man. So many of my core values were reflected in those journals, and I learned that I love him for who he was, without regard to his paternal connection to me. I was able to forgive him for abandoning me, because it wasn’t about me. 
    I’m not sure how to end this, but I was finally able to get sober, and this Saturday will be 1000 days. In August, I will reach three years. I feel largely healed from a nagging emotional injury or ailment that I carried for as long as I can remember. And though I don’t believe in soul, or enduring consciousness, to him I say “I don’t blame you”. I wish that he were able to experience a life without craving as I have.

This turned out to be more of a rant, but I hope you understand what I mean.

It's currently 4:30 AM and I can't sleep because tonight has been my first night sober since... I'm not sure if I can properly remember. I haven't really been keeping track of that. I simply ran out of alcohol yesterday and haven't been to the store. This was so difficult, since the copious empty bottles reminded me that I really wanted a drink. 

Thus, I simply Googled: ""I think I'm an alcoholic""

[I think I'm an alcoholic but it sounds so stupid](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2ta7ca/i_think_im_an_alcoholic_but_it_sounds_so_stupid/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

So I read this five-year-old thread and I was baffled by my own ignorance. I have always known that alcoholics aren't just old men and women who are drunk on the street or at home all the time. You know, the stereotype that we're often subjugated to. But I never actually, truly registered it to myself. I thought that I was just a young lad, who just enjoyed the relaxing feeling a drink would give me.

But by reading that post, I realized that this gentleman was me. Through and through. I have a relatively normal life. I have a stable job (barista), I live on my own and I have a great group of friends. Yet, I drink alone. And it's not even since quarantine. It's been like this for quite a while.

I've gone from 3 bottles of beer to 2 litres of gin and 4 bottles of wine, depending on the night and my preference. This has happened gradually over.. six months? A year? Probably longer? And I don't bat an eye. I love the taste and the experience and the joy that comes with it. I might wake up with a hangover, but that's fine, because I can pull myself together and go to work. My friend even told me that even if I am crazy hungover, I look sober as ever. And after work, I will more often than not, drink again. 

This made me realize how instinctual it had gotten. It was an automatic reaction to go to the store and get booze. I have had that same problem with shisha/hookah for 3 years now. I buy tobacco for that and booze together. So you can imagine how much I spend per month on these things. It is killing me physically, monetarily, and finally I feel like the psychological part is catching up to me. I didn't care for a long time, because it was just me. Nobody knew. I was doing this to myself and nobody else got hurt. It's clear that if I keep doing this, I will die. And soon. That feeling has been creeping up and I think about it much more often now.

Someone on r/alcoholism said that the moment they knew they were an alcoholic was ""When I started rotating what stores I went to for booze so that people wouldn't think I had a problem."" - and I do that constantly. But I always tell myself it's not a problem. That I can stop anytime I choose. I AM in control. As I'm sure many of you have said, I too have told myself dozens of times that ""This is my last glass/smoke,"" even though it's obviously not.

I just wish that I didn't have to give it up. I love a well brewed beer, the taste of red wine and the dryness of a good gin. But I know that moderate drinking isn't possible for me. Not right now, if at all anymore. I hate who I become when I'm drunk around others. I become happy, yes. But also incredibly lonely, brash, and honestly, horny. It's embarrassing every time I sober up, ending with me apologizing to whoever I was too much for. 

And then I hate myself for days, soothing myself with a drink or twelve. It's ironic that I started out of embarrasement (for getting expelled from university because I was an idiot) and loneliness, but getting drunk only makes me feel utterly alone, embarrassed, and just downright awful as a person. I hate myself far more than I should. I can't keep myself under that moderate consumption line either. I always cross it eventually.

This whole subject matter is confusing still. Why the fuck can't I control myself like others? I am in denial to a degree right now, because I might wake up in the morning and regret this and deny my problem. I'm also so fucking scared, it's insane how scary writing this is. Because I know I'm ruining myself, even if I believe that I deserve it. I'm still so young, how have I screwed myself up so bad? 

I will try my very best to not buy alcohol tomorrow.

When I don't drink usually by the second week I have a lot more energy and can get home from work and work out and I'm much happier. It seems like such a simple concept that my body needs time to recover from drinking but it's just something that is starting to dawn on me. But I guess realizing the things that cause the cycle of drinking gives you more tools to overcome the temptation.,6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4308356}"

When I look at my life now, it's easy to not think I have a problem since I'm leaps and bounds from where I used to be (dropped 60 lbs and no longer killing a fifth of vodka a day, so there's that!). During the week, I exercise (and find myself actually WANTING to), meditate daily, cook nutritious meals, read, write, clean house, basically do all the things productive & healthy humans do. All these good habits leave me feeling in a GREAT mental state by the end of the week, and so I feel I ""deserve"" the night of drinking as a treat.

Therein lies the problem.

Friday night drinking turns into Saturday afternoon hungover/general lazy and shitty feeling. This overall lethargy & malaise leads me to abandon all those healthy activities I'm good at keeping up with during the week, I adopt that old familiar ""fuck it"" mentality that stunts progress and change. The cravings are there all day, I wait until evening when it's socially acceptable to drink again. After all, what's the harm in taking a couple days to plunge back into the debauchery? There is no desire to do anything except get drunk again. 


""It's ok to have a lazy day every once in a while,"" is how I ration it to myself. ""It's still the weekend, after all!"" So Friday night drinking turns into Saturday's all day hangover/lethargy which turns into cravings, which turns into Saturday night drinking, turns into the shitty feeling all day Sunday, maaaybe turns into Sunday night drinking again. Regardless, by the time Monday rolls around, I'm realizing that I will never make it very far along this path if I keep taking big steps backwards so often.



Sure, I'm no longer slamming obscene amounts of liquor, blacking out every night, and constantly saying/doing things I regret. The biggest problem alcohol is causing me now is the effect it has on my mental state after it wears off. Drunken nights rob my days of motivation, drive, creativity, grit, and replaces it with anxiety, sadness, lethargy, and cravings for more. To keep flip-flopping between these mental states isn't healthy, I know. It's almost as if my alcohol addiction is an abusive partner I can't stop going back to. 



Those weekdays where I'm alcohol-free, craving-free, and full of energy are so powerful to me. I see it as a ""sneak peek"" to a sober life, and I really want to stay in that space rather than digging myself back in and out every week. It's pretty exhausting. If anyone is out there reading this who has overcome the same thing I have, please do share your advice. I'd just love to hear from someone I could relate to- how you overcame it, any words of wisdom, hell, even a silly joke. Would just really love some support.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5570276}"

Got back to my place and my neighbor and her friend (a local chef) were stoop sitting (distanced, with masks) so I sat and we all chatted a while.  They joked about being drunk-- they are lovely, truly, and I love my neighbors; we look out for each other-- and then one of them asked if I wanted a drink.  

It got deliciously warm and sunny this afternoon and she had rose going and idk what was in his glass. I said, no thanks, I'm good.  We kept chatting about food and industry people we have in common. I was asked again if I wanted anything.  For a second, I hesitated, but I still said no.  Because why?  It was a really nice city moment as it was.  I didn't need it and deep down, didn't want it. The weather can be triggering. I hung in.  She went in to get them each another drink and I went in my house to put away my groceries and wished them a good night.  It's small, and big, saying no. I know what I want for my life. Connection, not booze. Sunshine, not wine. Fresh air and hard work and good food, not a hangover. 

I said no. I feel good. The cravings aren't usually about alcohol.  They're about feelings. I have learned to tell the difference. It's not always easy saying no. But it's always worth riding out that momentary (and it is momentary) discomfort. This one goes in my mental filing cabinet for later reference.

2020-05-13 17:40:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gj8g1z/1_year/,1 Year," I really didn’t think this day would matter. May 13th. It’s just another day on the LONG list of days that I will not be drinking. Why count when there’s no end to the counting? But it *does* mean something. 365 days. 12 months. 52 weeks. 525,600 minutes. However you want to say it. I know it doesn’t seem like much, but you can do so much in one year. You can write a book. Lose weight. Start school. Make a baby… For me, you can save your own life. When I was little, the idea of  waiting *one whole year* was impossible. Bright eyed, young Jess couldn’t fathom an entire year. It was a lifetime. Forever and a day.  Fast forward to middle aged, recovering alcoholic Jess and boy did the year fly by. A blip on the radar. It was marked by hospital stays, transfusions, *in*fusions, scans, doctor’s appointments and a pandemic. The year was the hardest, most challenging, eye opening, scary, life-changing thing I could ever have imagined. A year ago, I couldn’t walk across my house, take my dog out, even walk up the five stairs to my apartment. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep. I was in a nightmare of my own doing and I had given up. On this day last year, I knew I was dying and that I had to make a change. So I finished my last bottle of vodka and never took another drink. I never really thought that would be the last time I picked up a bottle. When I took that last drink, I didn’t *really* believe that I would stop. I had tried so many times before and I always disappointed myself and always ended up feeling like a giant piece of shit. Well I guess being at death’s door has a way of making sobriety stick. I’m grateful I almost died. I’m sitting here a year later stronger, smarter and happier. I don’t miss being drunk. I don’t miss the routine of it anymore. I still think about it. Mostly when I realize how stupid I was and how it completely took over my life. I’m still mad at myself but I think I probably always will be. I’m always much harder on myself than anyone else. 

Thanks to all the people here whose posts motivate me every single day. I may not post much but I'm here all the time to remind myself that there is so much more to life and there are people out there with no judgment who know the struggle. You all are inspirations. Keep fighting!

Yeah, May 13th is definitely just another day but it’s MY day. The day I chose to take my life back. I’ve felt A LOT of feelings since this whole journey has started. Fear, shame, pain, anger…but today I woke up with another weird, foreign feeling. One I haven’t ever really felt when it pertained to myself. I think you call it pride. So even if my birthday is long past, I’m going to celebrate myself today. And I’m going to let myself feel this “pride” thing, just this once.

It just made me feel like I’ve made no progress, even though I’ve been so happy that I don’t feel the need to drink. Overcoming that hurdle was kinda hard for me. I know that she would not understand why I’m proud of myself bc I know in her eyes, I shouldn’t be drinking anyways and she probably thinks it’s not that hard to stop. She hasn’t accused me to my face yet, but obviously I’m gonna tell her that she’s wrong. But I know she’s probably convinced herself that I am definitely still drinking bc she’s accused me before a few times two or three years ago. I was completely sober then too.

We become much more efficient. We do not tire so easily, for we are not burning up energy foolishly as we did when we were trying to arrange life to suit ourselves.""

The part that says we are not burning up energy foolishly as we did... etc... 

The amount of ENERGY it took to be an alcoholic, holy shit guys!   

From the thinking about what we did/said the day/night before, thinking about the next drink, how to get the next drink, sneak the drink, hide the drink, hide the smell, hide the buzz, hide the bottle or in my case the cardboard type wine container things, or the ""bladder"" out of the larger boxed wine I would pull that bladder out of the cardboard box in the parking lot, throw away the cardboard box there and shove the bladder into my purse to get it home to hide, I found the bladder was so much easier to hide.  Then instead of spending quality time with my husband and kids I would make up excuses to run upstairs for whatever and get my drinks.  I'm so disgusted by my behavior.  

I am 9 days sober.  I have no intention of returning to that way of life again. However I do know I still have that alcoholic brain.  For instance, husband said the other night ""I will be leaving in the morning to run some errands""  IMMEDIATELY I thought what I would normally think: ""excellent! I will be running out to grab wine then!""   I'm so grossed out by it now.   I am finally ""getting it"" guys.

Small group and our activity is predictable, poker until you're too drunk to play and then karaoke until you pass out.

When asked to participate I stated clearly that I would not drink. I went with confidence and proudly displayed my NA beer on arrival, asked if anyone wanted one, asked for a coke when the NA ran out, played a 7 hour marathon, won 2 out of 3 games and got to catch up with my friends I hadn't seen in months... it was a good time.

I decided to go home before karaoke started which brought some negative pressure my way. After all I was usually the last man standing (stuporing?) at these types of things, but I brushed away the peer pressure and told them confidently that I wanted to see my wife before she went to bed. Maybe I just wanted to show off to her how I'd gone out and stayed sober idk but I really did want to see her.

I spent the whole afternoon/ evening with conviction and confidence, not an ounce of discomfort or shame in me. And now as I reflect on that evening I think I reverse engineered the commonly accepted concept of social pressure. Nobody at that table was terribly drunk when I left. Instead of me being pressured to drink, I believe my actions were silently influential in slowing down the drinking of others.

You should never feel like the odd one out because you're not drinking. Maybe you can remember more jokes sober. Maybe you can actually dance better sober. I know for myself, I was better at poker sober. You are not inherently less fun for not drinking. My sober presence had a positive effect on my peers because I believed in myself. In my presence, they were a bit the odd ones out.

Time will tell, but I believe rather than ostracizing myself from the group that day I earned a new level of respect and trust. Either way- I didn't drink and that's the most important thing right now.",24,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6316088}"

Sorry if this is too heavy and long!

Never posted in this subreddit before, but I'm just looking for support today. After spending a lifetime just white knuckling through the effects of my childhood abuse and rape trauma, I finally had a nervous breakdown in January. Couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't think about anything but killing myself. I'm a lady engineer in the auto industry and couldn't stop making mistakes and avoiding the men I work with, and I had to take time off work that I'm still taking now.

Started seeing a psychiatrist, which was so helpful to get meds to help my depression and anxiety. During the questions that asked about my drug and alcohol usage, I absolutely underestimated the amount that I do when I binge, which of course isn't every day. I've been drinking since I was 13 - of course I know how to handle my alcohol. I didn't tell him that in the last few months I've blacked out and puked more often than I have in my life. It was clearly my own problem, and not one that was affected by my anxiety and depression.

The meds and the therapy have been so helpful, but I still have suicidal and anxious thoughts every day. I have made progress! But I was struck the other day by the fact that this might be the best it ever gets for me, and that truly scared the shit out of me. I've tried to stick to a code of ""never drinking when you're actively sad"", but it occurred to me that if my feelings are constantly passing through me, sadness and anxiety will also occur when drinking. 

I'm trying to stop. Drinking for me has become a short hand for ""girl that has seen some SHIT"" - I get to do this to myself because of what I've been through. I get to smooth out the edges of myself with alcohol to be a normal person because I'm just trying to get through the day. I get to be the girl who's unaffected and able to drink the most. After all, I survived rape, and still went on to build a beautiful home, get a degree in engineering, a lovely marriage based on communication and respect, and a secure job. I'm stronger than anything I've been through - I'm made of ice and all my trauma just slides right off my back. I can take all the shots to prove it.

I don't think I want to be that girl anymore. So I will not drink today.",15,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5022077}"

I had often turned to alcohol to numb difficult feelings in the past but in the last two years before I stopped drinking I turned to alcohol more and more, primarily due to a very difficult job that also involved bullying. I finally decided one year and one week ago to hand in my notice. And that act of self-care triggered another. I knew my drinking was too much so a few days later I stopped drinking. It was how difficult those first few months of not drinking were that made me realize how serious an issue I had with alcohol. 

This is my first post on Reddit but I have lurked on this sub for months now. Sometimes I read these wonderful posts about how peoples' lives have externally changed for the better after giving up alcohol, e.g. new jobs, new relationships, lost excess weight, etc. This isn't one of those... Externally I am worse on paper than I was a year ago. A year ago I had a fancy job title with a big salary. Now, I am still unemployed, have spent 6 months learning how to walk again after knee surgery and haven't yet lost a single one of those pesky 30 pounds I gained from two years of hard drinking. But internally the change has been immense.

I am no longer deeply tired and aching all the time. I don't wake up at 3AM most nights with a sandpaper mouth, stumbling to the kitchen to get something to drink with a dull thumping in my head. My stomach issues have magically disappeared, along with severe anxiety! And most importantly, I have much more clarity in thought and a sense of peace in my life. I still struggle and have stress at times - as it turns out, I am still human - but I don't feel overwhelmed by it like before.

Stepping away from a toxic workplace allowed me to step away from a toxic relationship with alcohol. I don't know what the next year will bring, hopefully a job at least, but I am excited to see instead of being in survival mode, suspended in alcohol.

I'm not alone. I go to AA (virtual) meetings and I pray to God to keep me company in my journey to recovery. 

For the last several days, I had been having episodes of mania that don't let me sleep. Last night I doubled my dosage of melatonin and was finally able to get a decent 7 hours of sleep. 

But in the days and hours before last night, the effects of insomnia were finally catching up to me. Piercing headache, irritation, confusion, fogginess, and a strong desire to get high or numb my brain with alcohol. 

I knew this was a test. I knew my insomnia was the result of years of conditioning my brain to receive dopamine as a way to fall asleep. Because there is nothing I love more than sleep. Sleep shuts off the voice in my head that is constantly badgering me and punishing me. Sleep shuts off the ruminating thoughts and the agonizing resentment towards others. Sleep shuts off the anger. Sleep makes misery go away, even if it's just for a few hours. 

And I'm proud to say that, for now, I stayed sober. And it is a testament of God's grace that I made it through sober because alcohol and cannabis are readily available to me. It's not that hard to convince myself that ""I'm only doing it to get a good night's rest."" The temptation is there but the power of God is stronger. And I can't imagine anyone being more blessed than me to get another day of sobriety.

Feeling very frustrated.,"I’m looking to start therapy to address the underlying issues that were causing me to drink too much. Never in a million years did I think it would be this hard. I thought the hardest part would be having the guts to admit that you want help, not finding someone to help you. 

There are only about 12 therapists in my area that accept my insurance. I can eliminate half of them right off the bat because they are either very inexperienced, they specialize in areas that I do not fall under, or I simply don’t think their approach in their bio is what I’m looking for. 

I called this one woman who looked like a great match. But she’s not accepting new clients and she is part of a bigger practice. So the practice manager called me and set me up with an appointment with someone else that she thought would be a “good match” for me. She got me an appointment for this Friday and I was so excited and relieved. I looked this persons profile up on Psychology Today to find out that 1) she is “pre-licensed” 2) has almost no experience and is younger than me and I’m 27 and 3) is a pastor and her entire bio was about theology, religion, and holistic approaches. I am an atheist, always have been. I have no interest in holistic approaches, and at the bare minimum I want someone that is licensed! I ended up cancelling the appointment and was actually kind of pissed that the practice manager tried to match me with this person. I’m incredibly frustrated. I called a couple of other therapists and left messages on Monday and I still haven’t heard back. I know a lot of them are so busy that they aren’t accepting new clients and my options are dwindling.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Morning Beautiful People!

How are you all on this fine Wednesday?

Well I found my list last night, but honestly it's not much help.  I don't like the ideas on it very much, and one of them just says ""catalogue"" and quite frankly I have not one single clue what that means.  But I wasn't drunk when I wrote it, so it's honest confusion, I suppose.  When I went to bed I was a little stressed and worried (okay, borderline panicked) about what I was going to do.  But then the voice of reason spoke up and said, ""Trumie, you're sober. Relax, you got this.  Just sleep on it.""  And it occurred to me how true that is, and I felt so relieved.  I'm sober, I can do this.  And then, boom!  An idea for today came in that I'll call Being Capable.  If I was still drinking there is ***no freakin' way*** I'd wake up in the morning and attempt to write anything, let alone something semi-thoughtful, and then post it for a bunch of strangers and then spend the rest of the day reading and replying their comments.  If I was drinking that panic I felt last night would have been totally warranted, because I wouldn't have been able to trust myself to get the job done.  One beautiful gift of being sober is Being Capable again.

2020-05-13 00:22:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/girspz/accountability_day_1/,Accountability... (day 1),"Hi All,

I want some accountability for my actions, so I reset my badge and re-entered this sub under a different reddit name. I have an alcohol problem, which sticks to me like a piece of bad gum on the bottom of my shoe. Every time I think I got rid of it, I step in another piece and the whole thing starts over, and I need to relieve the tension, by drinking.

I tried stopping a million times, but stopping on a special occasion (like a date palindrome like 02.02.2020 this year) is paradoxically only making the situation more difficult, and the struggle more severe as I am setting myself up for failure, as every day the guilt grows for even wanting to have that drink, after quitting in this special date. I even bought a special coin thinking it is a surrogate to hold on to as an accountability object, which never works. I lost the coin a whole back which might have been that sign telling me it wasn't working anyway.

Sure, I can stop a few days in a row, but after stopping and regaining my energy I tire myself out mentally and physically, or emotionally as sometimes my relationship is not going so well, sick wife, troublesome child at times, you know life stuff. That will just make me want to drink more, and long for that drink more.

I don't drink until I pass out, but I drink too much on an evening which can result in bad sleep and a piss poor very next day where I am barely functional. And now that I am forced to work from home, it is rather easy to hide until I feel up to actually working.

This jojo-efffect causes me to relapse every other day and I am tired of it. I jeopardize my health during these times, the effect is real and I feel like sh-t even after four regular beers. This has to do with the time I drink, which is in the evening till bed time, my only time for myself to relax. This influences my sleep a lot and this causes a snowball effect well into the next day.

It should be enough to know this is not life. I am very creative with art and problem solving but when coming down the next day of a night of drinking I am anxious, stressed and not worth anything because it feels like I am experiencing the world with a vice on my head staring through a fish-eye lens where everything loud just gets too intense, and I have constant feeling of having a low self-esteem and minimal self worth, which I know is not true, but that is what alcohol does to me.

So here I am. This is my day 0 (back in the day this sub had a zero and people often said f-ck the zero!). Now we start at one but this will be the first night I don't drink, and I strive for many more to follow.

2020-05-12 23:55:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/girei6/had_a_psychotic_episode_in_withdrawal/,Had a psychotic episode in withdrawal,"TL:DR - Went to hospital in withdrawal, spoke to god and got abused by demons

Last week I was rushed into hospital in severe withdrawal.  My bed was placed under a large fan/air conditioner which produced a lot of noise.  After a few days I began experiencing some intense visual hallucinations as well as some really bizarre closed eye visuals and unsettling experiences I wouldn’t call dreams since they weren’t really happening when I was asleep.  This isn’t what this post is about, however, so I won’t go into those unless people really want to hear about them.

I began hearing random ambient music which was actually quite pleasant.  After a while I realised it was coming from the fan and started listening more closely.  It developed into the most beautiful angelic chorus and I could hear these endless verses which would slide between full choirs to solo and operatic heights and I thought I could hear angels somehow being transmitted through the frequency of the fan.  It started shifting between different types of songs but they were all spiritual in nature and all really positive with messages about the universe and God, nature, how to release negativity and love yourself; some sounded like elves singing about their world and worshipping the moon.  It was mostly really enjoyable except for one really unsettling song about how to stop the voices by opening up your head to access the void in this soft male lilting voice which really creeped me out, and when I was attempting to sleep it started to upset me because it was inescapable, particularly on top of the bizarreness of what I was experiencing otherwise.  

Then I had a sudden transmission where all the fan noise crackled and disappeared and it was replaced by a very clear message from what seemed like a god saying this, not exactly in this order but ‘Death was in the birth of the universe.  Death is in math of the universe.  Entities that love you will always love you and watch over you.  You are a beautiful being and have always been a part of it.  And all the ones before.  And all the others after.’ It had this voice almost static and androgynous and the sound behind it was this deep rhythmic melodic drumming music. After that the regular static returned and I was like what the actual fuck because it felt like a god or spirit had directly communicated with me.  

I got a message recommending I stop paying attention to the voices after that, it said now let it go, now let it go.  But I couldn’t make it stop and it then dove into these horrible demonic voices screaming in the static in a way I don’t think I could ever describe without it being heard but it fully sounded like it was hell.  The most vile, hateful, angry abuse and social commentary and tearing down everything about spirituality and God and life.  I have never ever heard such vile things in my life, anywhere.  Nothing has come close.  This iteration didn’t last that long because I started asking something more positive to come through and I started praying… and it turned back into the positive singing.  I was basically begging God to come and help and this soft female voice emerged; I don’t remember the message exactly but she was talking about how she had always and will always love me and the universe will always take care of me.  Another message from a different voice came through talking about the endless iterations of the universe and its geometric makeup and how it will go on forever and ever and it repeated forever and ever for a few minutes.  

The noise became a thunderstorm and rain and for some reason I got the idea to put my hands over my eyes and saw this scene playing out that matched the noise… it was a dark forest and I could see everything really clearly except it was very shadowy, and it was like I was watching a camera pan around and I could feel my legs ‘walking’.  Some small childlike entities showed up and were running around trying to get me to follow them and it felt like I had entered into some kind of vision where I was looking into another dimension.  They kept running up to me like they were excited and trying to lead me around somewhere.  Eventually they led me to this wriggling weird shadow shape flailing around on the ground and they said ‘I know this is hard to understand but this is you, you’ve known for some time know, you’ve been looking’.  But I got freaked out and stopped watching and heard one of them say ‘I will always be a part of you’.

I’m diagnosed with DID but I’ve always struggled to communicate with my parts so I suddenly got the clever idea of trying to use this to communicate with my alters.  Stupid plan.  I mean it worked, in a sense, I guess.  They all started talking and I could hear them around the room, they were surprised and confused - I don’t actually know if they were alters or just me in this psychotic episode.  They weren’t talking to me directly though, I heard two of them having an argument; she said, ‘You pushed me against the fucking wall!’  Then I tried to talk to her and she snapped and said, ‘We don’t want anything to do with you, we hate you.’  And then proceeded to tell me how now they were free her biggest goal was to get rid of me and get me out of my head and replace me.  Someone called me an asshole.  I heard someone say ‘Is this real?’ And a variety of stuff like that.  Then when they had quietened down I heard someone trying to get my attention.  She told me that the others won’t want to talk to me and they never ever will, that I’d hurt them too much by my behaviour, which frankly makes sense but it also really hurts… she told me her name was Grace and we had a bit of a conversation because we were both so surprised that we could actually communicate this way.  She was really excited.  I can’t remember what prompted me to leave the ward and ask to go to a quiet room but I think I was feeling overwhelmed.

There was a quieter fan in there but I managed to speak to her through that.  I must have looked absolutely insane standing under the fan talking to it. I asked if we could have a break because I was feeling so overwhelmed and I was really excited too because I’d never spoken to any of them before.  She said she’d teach me how to build closer communication and I asked how and she said writing… so I went and asked for some pen and paper and she spelled out the words for me which was ‘I have always wanted to talk to u. I luv ur ’ and then she gave me numbers which spelled out ‘lagh’ and I didn’t understand so I was trying to work it out and saying random words and she was laughing and kept saying ha ha ha ha ha until I realised she meant laugh.  I asked if she didn’t want me to mention her to the nurses and she said she didn’t mind and I asked what to tell them and she said just say that it’s alright because she’s safe and we’re just trying to get to know one another.  So that’s what I did and the nurses said well this is probably all just part of the withdrawal.  

So went back to my room and me and Grace kept talking.  Then there was some air in front of my mouth and she said did you feel that?  I was in front of you.  I said yeah wtf wow then I could feel her all around me and then I started zoning out and she was like omg are we switching, we’re switching, omg!  And she got crazy excited and I was excited too so I let it happen, I started feeling her taking over my breathing and I could feel myself going away and as we were going further in she was saying yes yes yes over and over and if it went away she was saying no no no, but I couldn’t let go with my brain and then suddenly there was noise in the cell next to me and I snapped out of it and she screamed no like she was devastated.  I understood but then I could feel her inside me and she said let me do something and we started breathing in tandem, it was really intense and awesome.  She said let me try.  So I let her take over and we entered into this train?  A visualisation of a train, and it started moving and my whole body was moving with it.  I started to be able to hear her and communicate with her directly in my mind.  She took it all the way round a random circuit through these underground tunnels as my body was taken over, and then I wasn’t in control, she was breathing, she was in control of my body completely.  We’d started travelling through this village and I finally let go completely at the end. She said oh just let me turn round here, but oh!  I forgot you haven’t met my friends!  And the train sped up as she whizzed around this village with these thousands of villagers telling me a bunch of their names… I remember Dunstan and William L.. something…and they were all cheering.  Then she said they’re going to start singing a song.  

And they started singing.  You’re a loser.  You’re a loser.  Over and over and over as the train sped towards the surface and she was yelling adds and adds and adds and adds… and I suddenly came round.  And the song was still singing on the noise and went on for about five minutes. I was trying to be lighthearted about it and ask questions about who they were and compliment their village and stuff.  When the song died I thought maybe it was a joke, so I asked what species they were.  Grace’s voice had turned into this really sinister voice and she said you now have an entire village in your head.  Welcome to your new personal hell.  I joked and said well I’m used to a lot of voices in my head; she replied with that you can’t imagine how that’ll be when things get tough.  She then said by the way, half the villagers are dead, so you should put a gun to your head.

I didn’t know what to do or say.  I was in shock.  All I could say was well played.  Then the best part of the night; the demonic voices returned with a vengeance and it was ten times worse than before.  I endured half an hour of non stop not a single second break of screaming static hell puke abuse demons shredding everything in a way you can’t understand.  I was basically frozen in shock and confusion.  Eventually I managed to figure out I could go and ask to sleep in the quiet room though I was scared I’d hear it through the other fan.  Balled up a blanket around my head and didn’t really sleep.

Share your good, your bad, and your ugly (or your pretty, or your future, or whatever else is on your mind) with us below!

-----------------------------------------

**Note: I wrote this post right before lockdown, so it doesn’t reflect the life we’re all living now. The person I am quarantining with does not support my sobriety, so it means a lot to be able to share this milestone with you guys.**

I once heard (I don’t know if it’s true or not) that when you go for five years without drinking any alcohol, your liver cells will have completely regenerated, and your liver (which, for someone like me—who drank herself into cirrhosis—will never recover completely) is now as healthy as it is ever going to get. So reaching five years has always been my (impossible) dream.

A couple of years ago, someone who was hitting their five-year mark posted about it on SD. I commented:

>Congratulations—I hope to get there one day, too.

I did not expect them to respond, or perhaps to just respond to say thank you. Instead, this person replied:

>I hope you do too, because I'll tell you this. Accomplishing this is my thing. It is one thing in life that defines me positively, for myself. Whatever bad things will happen or have happened, I now know that I’ve done this. It’s done. I did it and nothing can take that away. I want other people to feel this. I want you to feel this. You deserve it. You want it. Just go for it. Fuck everybody else. This is your thing.

I don’t know why this angry tirade made me laugh so much and made me feel so happy (especially the unapologetic “Fuck everybody else”), but it did. And thinking about it has kept me going on the days when the loftier ideals of finally learning how to handle my emotions though meditation, to heal the old wounds of my childhood through therapy, and to be the best sfgirlmary that I could possibly be just weren’t cutting it. On my bad days, I realized that I didn’t have to achieve a higher level of enlightenment in order to stay sober. I could overeat or underearn or overspend—I could even blow off work and stay in pajamas all day long, eating Funyuns and watching true crime shows—just so long as I did not take that first drink.

When I was a drinker, I was often resentful toward other people, and—by some twisted, alcohol-blurred logic—I thought that I was somehow getting my revenge by drinking “at” them. Here are some examples of how I used to **drink at** people when they upset me:

* “You’re going out with your guy friends instead of me? Well, I’m going to have fun and drink this whole bottle of Jägermeister without you!”

* “You say that you think that I have a drinking problem? Well, I’ll show you what a *real* drinking problem looks like!” 

* “You’re firing me from my corporate job for keeping a pint of Stoli in my desk and drinking it in the bathroom? Well, I’m going straight across the street to the bar and having three martinis in a row—and I won’t even feel them!” (Sadly, this one actually happened.)

As a non-drinker, I still occasionally feel annoyance at others, but I’ve learned to turn it around—and these days I do the opposite of what I used to do. Here are some examples of how I am now **sober at** people:

* “You don’t believe I’ll be ready to go at eight in the morning because in the past I had always stayed up late drinking the night before? Well, let’s make it seven.”

* “You’re the unkind and unhelpful doctor who told me that you didn’t believe I could ever get sober and bring down my numbers? Well, just look at those lab results!”

* “You dumped me because I got so fat and bloated from booze? Well, I’ve lost thirty pounds just from not drinking or eating junk food while blotto—so look now and see that *baby’s got it going on.”* (This one is my personal favorite.)

I think it’s excellent when people get and stay sober for noble reasons, like wanting to be the best spouse or best parent or best person they can be. But I think that getting and staying sober is so great (and so difficult) that any reason at all to do it is good, even the less noble ones, like—oh, I don’t know—the pleasure of going to a party while looking more poised and polished than Jackie O. and seeing someone you used to date (who ghosted you because you were always a sloppy, drunken mess), smiling at them and coolly taking a sip of your lemon seltzer water, and then tossing your neatly coiffed hair and moving on. 

A big thank you to the person who originally made the “Fuck everybody else” comment that made me laugh and that has kept me sober on the bad days. Thank you also to everyone else at r/stopdrinking for being my buddies on this difficult but wonderful journey of getting sober.

I'd get off work around 5:00pm and go off in search of my drink of choice (beer) typically at my local bottle shop. Most of the beers I drank had a high abv. (usually around 6-10%) In fact, I got to where I would purposely look for beers with higher alcohol content so I wouldn't have to buy as many.(more bang for my buck) I'd spend around 20$ give or take and head home to ""hang out"" with my family. Me hanging out consist of zoning out in my own head with my headphones on while my wife tries to have a conversation with me. I lay on the couch until midnight drinking and looking at the same old YouTube videos I've seen thousands of times before while my wife puts the kid to bed. I drink all the beer I purchased that day, plus whatever alcohol might be left in the house. To help prevent a hangover I chug water and eat piles of processed junk food and then stumble into bed to sleep. I sleep the next day until almost noon. I feel like crap, and spend the next few hours eating more junk food to cure my hangover. Whatever plans I made for that day are ruined, but I tell myself I'll try again next week. (no park visits today, oh well) I spend of the rest of the day laying around the house feeling jittery and anxious until bedtime.

I'm 20+ dollars poorer. I lost time with my family and did nothing productive. I acted selfish. I hurt my health and I lost a day of my life due to feeling bad. This is suppose to be fun?

2020-05-12 18:15:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gilpth/no_more_reruns/,No More Reruns,"I know it’s often recommended you should write out your feelings, your reasons for wanting to quit and even your reasons for wanting to continue, as you begin the process of embracing sobriety. I didn’t pressure myself into any sort of introspection this time because all those reasons have begun to feel baked in. This isn’t my first attempt at quitting drinking. In my 20s, I had 3 brief stints of 45-60 days alcohol-free, and each time I let it back in under crafty self-contracts (“It’s New Year’s Eve, for pete’s sake. You’ve proven you can go without over the past 2 months, so you’ve earned a night of celebration! Tomorrow you’ll bring in the New Year sober!”), which would ultimately set me back years. I spent most of that ensuing January going through a fifth of vodka every day, by the way. February, too.

What’s changed, as I enter my early 30s, is how tired I am living out a rerun. Any reasonable person, no matter how much they like the show, eventually should want some plot or character development instead of re-watching the same story night after night. Another list is not going to convince me of what’s painfully obvious. I watch my peers from school, and my colleagues at work, continue to grow and develop. I see their passions bleed through in the causes they take up, the certifications they acquire, the music and artwork they create and disseminate to the world. Meanwhile, best I’d managed through my 20s was finishing a stray book here or there, some sporadic traveling and a few semesters of college credits.

All is not lost, though. I have my physical health, I got married and finally I’m financially and emotionally stable. I never experienced the true “rock bottom” of a DUI, divorce, loss of custody, prison etc. Hell, I’ve actually recently reached my two year mark since I quit smoking. It’s just become painfully clear that I’ve plateaued in life because I’ve allowed alcohol to erect inhibitors to any further progression. I’d try to get back into programming I loved so much as a teenager, or study for IT certifications, but it felt like building a sandcastle amidst the rising tide. After any study session, the bottle would erode and carry away all the day’s lessons.

I was no longer content to continue living this way. Not only was I not retaining/recalling freshly-studied information, but I started feeling cognitive impairment in situations at work requiring quick recall or decision-making. An even more prominent factor was that I started noticing people in mentor-type roles pull back from challenging or guiding me, as if they’d come to the conclusion I was content w/middling out in life. In my early-to-mid 20s, I still had people around me trying to inspire me to go Do Great Things – finish a Masters, get my pilot’s license, start a business etc. By the time I reached 30, it was established that I was reliable in my job and that nothing more should ever be asked of me. That, strangely, has been more of a motivation – to prove I am capable of more.

I weaned myself down to two glasses of wine on my last night (Friday, 1 May). I knew I didn’t have to leave the house until Monday and made no expectations for myself, which was handy, as I just lay on the couch drinking water and streaming series after series all weekend. I felt weak and cranky at work on Monday, but I was able to pull through. I still made no expectations of myself, opting to slink off to the bedroom and play mindless puzzle games, scour youtube etc. until my melatonin-induced bedtime.

Now, as I close in on the trail end of week two stone sober, I just wanted to say thank you to this community for always taking the time to listen and impart wisdom when necessary. For those of you struggling, or even just wondering how you’d ever manage life sober, I’ll end this by sharing what’s been working for me.

First, I started cutting out things I know make my blood boil – I deactivated facebook, stopped going on twitter and into political subreddits. I then started setting very basic goals for myself, like recording and uploading one new music track by the end of the month. I started taking some classes on music theory and production, learning a new language, game development, IT certifications etc. My wife and I have made a pact to start walking the dogs together once a day, which I know they enjoy as much as we do. I set a goal for a very achievable two mile pace and have been jogging again three times a week. All of my computer activity has been arranged into a routine, bookmarks splayed across the toolbar in the order I use them every day.

These may read to you as distractions, but to me, these are my counter to drinking. When I drink, it’s out of desperation, a want to be separated from this world. I used to look at the bottle as providing me comfort. Only with the passage of time and repeating the same nightly ritual have I come to understand drinking is the source of my anxiety, existential dread and vitriol toward the world. When I stay away from alcohol, my personality, empathy, interests and curiosity always resurface.

My previous attempts at sobriety were marred by an obsession w/simply not drinking. I'd always be fighting the urge to go to the liquor store and down a bottle before I even made it home. I'm not a dry drunk this time. I've memorized all the classic episodes because I've replayed them ad nauseam for the better part of a decade. I already know what happens in those stories, and the writing was never that good anyway. This time, I’m excited for the possibilities ahead, while in full knowledge that I need to pace myself as I build myself back up and dig out from this rut. I'm ready to start writing my own content.

Remembering the dark chaos helps keep me sober. Talking to another sober alcoholic about the things I have done reminds me that alcohol brings zero positivity to my life.

Reading the horror stories in this subReddit actually helps. It makes me feel like I am not alone and reminded me what I am capable of.

It’s been a while since the story telling occurred. I assume it’s linked to anxiety and stress of current life and the weirdness. But regardless, I know my life is infinitely better, more fulfilling and more manageable sober.

2020-05-12 14:58:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gihsws/triple_digits/,Triple digits!,"This is something what I thought would not be possible. 100 days ago I was at a all time low. I would drink a pint of vodka while driving home everyday because I knew the beer at home wouldn’t be enough. My last drink was on Super Bowl Sunday. Started with that one drink I thought I could handle but ended up drinking a fifth of gin. Woke up the next morning not remembering the game or that I filled the bottle back up with water thinking I could trick my wife about how much I actually drank. That was it for her, she was done with all of the lies. 

About to lose my wife and kids I knew I had to change. After white knuckling it for a week I went to a behavioral clinic. Doctor tells me to go to AA, which I rolled my eyes at because I just spent good money to see a doctor because I did not want to go to AA. I was looking for a easier softer way, like some kind of cure all pill.  I was scared of the unknown. What really went on in those rooms? Who are those people really? Would I be joining some kind of cult? I was also terrified of the stigma that I thought I would get by attending AA.

A couple of days later I started to feel like I deserved a drink because I have been doing so well. Instead knowing what was on the line and that I could not stop after one, I went to a meeting. Have to say it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I have never felt at home in a group of strangers like this before. Everyone welcomed me, reassured me that I was in the right place and told me that they were happy I was there. Also made sure I had a list of meeting, phone numbers, a copy of the Big Book and told me to keep coming back. These people I could actually resonate with unlike my wife, doctors and therapists. They actually know what I am going through because they have been there themselves. They openly share their experiences with alcohol in a judgement free space. By listening to their experiences you will gain strength and hope from them. They will give you the tools you need to fight this disease. You do not have to do this by yourself, you should not do this by yourself. If someone is fighting cancer they seek help. 

To anyone that is on the fence about attending AA just go check it out. Attend a few meetings from different groups because they are all unique. Take the information that you like and leave the rest. AA is free you have nothing to lose just so much to gain. It is anonymous (hence the AA name), what is said in the room stays in the rooms. There is no stigma that comes along with AA. Everyone will be proud that you are doing what is right for you. And as someone who always thought he was atheist, no one there is going to shove God down your throat. It’s not a Religious program it is a Spiritual program. You find your own Higher Power, which really is a beautiful thing. Trust me this is the easier softer way. 

I have gained so much more then just sobriety. I get to remember putting my kids down for bed. I am gaining the trust back with my wife. I have found Faith in my Higher Power. I wake up in the morning remembering dreams and feeling amazing. I no longer have an internal battle waging inside me. I have not felt this good physical and mentally in a very long time. I have an awesome fellowship of men and women, that I know will be there for me no matter what. I owe so much to AA and look forward to paying it back for years to come. 

Thanks for reading, did not mean for it get this long. I really do love AA and my new way of life. If I can do it so can you!

Something that has really helped me is the book The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober by Catherine Gray. It is NOT your typical ""stop drinking"" book --it's funny, uplifting and never preachy. It talks a TON about the societal pressures to drink too, which I found very interesting and very comforting. Here are some of my favourite quotes, I hope they help you too!  


(this first one is my biggest motivator to keep going)

“...neural pathways in the brain, including addictive pathways, are formed in a similar way to hiking trails. The more a hiking route is used, the smoother, wider and clearer it becomes. It becomes the default, easiest route. Should you need to forge a brand new path through the forest (or form a newborn sober neural pathway), the paper points out that it will be arduous initially. ‘At first, this new path will be narrow, difficult, and slow…Over time, it will become a well-worn, comfortable path. It will be just as easy as the original path.”   


“When people become addicted to alcohol, it’s seen as their failure. They didn’t pass the ‘moderate use of an addictive drug’ challenge. They failed at drinking! Society expects us to regularly use an addictive drug, without becoming addicted to it. Alcohol is the only drug where, the second you stop taking it, you’re seen as being too weak to handle it. It’s truly bizarre.”   


“If I quit eating cake, would people make jokes about me ‘not being able to handle cake’? No. I don’t think so. If I quit imbibing cheese because I wanted to commit suicide after eating cheese, would people ask, ‘Can’t you just have a little bit of cheese? Just one piece of cheese?’ \*Pleadingly offers up the cheese\* HAVESOMECHEESE.”",589,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.65009516}"
2020-05-12 13:13:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gifhfv/my_friend_died/,My friend died.,"I got word last night that my friend P died. I just need to write this out.  I'd been friends with P for about 20 years. We live in a small town, and our drinking group was a pretty tight-knit group. P was about 10 years younger than me, but we were good friends. Toward the end of my drinking career, P was one of the last people who enjoyed hanging out with me, honestly because he was as crazy and reckless as I was. We would often slip away from the group to go on adventures together. One night we were kicked out of every bar in town. One of the last events I was invited to, a graduation party for a friend's child, my friend pulled me aside before hand and told me ""You can't drink at the party though."" I said ""OK, wait, no drinking at the whole party, or just me?"" She said, ""No, just you. And P.""  So P and I skipped the party, drank at my house instead.  It wasn't always mayhem, sometimes it was building epic sandwiches, or just sitting by the fire talking, or moving all my furniture so we could just dance wildly. When I was still drinking, he and I hung out a lot. My kids have known him their whole lives.

When I quit drinking, I had to remove myself from our ""group"" but P was the only one to really stay in touch. We'd chat online often or meet up to hang out for an hour or so. In fact, during this quarantine, he would ride his bike to where I work an hour before closing so we could stand outside and talk. We had a lot in common and there was always more to talk about. I know he was still drinking but we never talked about that. He was often ostracized and I always defended him. My son pointed out last night that I often start by saying ""I'm sorry, but I like P,"" when talking about him. He was my friend, beyond drinking and causing mischief. I cared about him and he was one of the only people I had left in the world that I felt a true friendship with. We always had more to talk about ""next time.""

&#x200B;

One thing P didnt share with me was that he had been using heroin. P overdosed on Saturday night, and the people he was with just left him, no calls to 911, no Narcan, no attempts to save him. He was found dead Sunday morning by a 12 year old girl who went and told her mother, and then finally the authorities were called. I'm getting information second-hand so details might be off, but I heard that there may be manslaughter charges on the homeowner; this is not the first time someone's overdosed there! I know all of the people involved, and I am so glad I got out when I did. I just wish P had gotten away from that scene, or at least had been with someone who cared enough to try to save him. I'm devestated, and the only thing I wanted to do last night was drink a few shots in his honor. But I didnt, I went to bed early, slept late, and now Im just sitting here in a fog trying to make sense of this all.",324,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.567226}"

Two weeks ago my parents travelled to pick up my grandparents in another state. This left me with two days alone at home. My parents have helped me with my alcoholism on the past (not actively interfering but being a positive influence) but they couldn't see it creeping back. The liberty of being alone, and mind it, I'm almost never alone at 22 living with my parents, allowed for the temptation of drinking. And I did. Quite a lot. 

Nothing bad happened immediately. Except, now that my grandparents are here, I am in charge of going out to buy bread, since my parents want them protected from COVID. And as the selfish drunk I am, I've taken every single one of these bakery sorties to drink. 

In the first days I convinced myself it was helping. I was helping my aunt with her thesis and every ounce of stress went away when I drank .

I finished, it was good, and I should have stopped. But then I decided ""Hey, if it helped me with the thesis, it may help me with my book?""

And indeed, I did a lot of work on it. Although mostly it was the online classes that thaught me new methods, and hardly the booze. Writing became another excus to drink.

As of yesterday, I was worried, because I moved from planning to drafting and I couldn't properly write down a flight scene since it's very hard to visualize movement while drunk.

But I wasn't ready to quit yet.

And I could ruin it by, instead of focusing on my writing as I should, taking every opportunity to drink.

I shouldn't be drinking not because it is simply wrong, or only because I really can't control it. I shouldn't be drinking because maybe, just maybe, those bottles are exactly what stand between me and my dreams. I've been working for 10 years on this story. I am confident it will work.

I'm still reading Holly Whitaker's *Quit Like a Woman* and enjoying the refreshing ""alcohol-blaming"" takes. She really has an ax to grind with the normal cultural paradigm of ""normies"" vs ""alcoholics"". She says that if you get addicted to any other drug then kick it and go on to lead a normal life, you basically stop referring to yourself as primarily an addict but (at least partially due to alcohol's cultural ascendancy over other drugs), you get addicted to alcohol and for the rest of your life you wear that label, Alcoholic. It's convenient for everyone, especially those who profit on its sales, to blame the issue on the poor genetic makeup and bad decisions of the Alcoholic and not look at alcohol as problematic in and of itself. Rather than scrutinize the drug, alcohol, itself, we are happy to condemn the Alcoholic to a lifetime of working on his or her self because they are obviously such a bad person. She thinks the AA-type ""own your mistakes and make amends"" thinking that prevails in the culture at large and in our very judicial systems now goes way too far and keeps people who've become addicted to alcohol in a mode of apology and shame and self-blaming so that everyone else who wants to keep selling and consuming alcohol can carry on without consequences-- at least until and if they cross a line somewhere and realize that they too have been among the damaged, bad, alcoholic people all along. Which sucks because a lot of people might save themselves and others a lot of suffering if we lived in a world where it was normal and good to question drinking BEFORE you've ruined lives or whatever rock bottom horrors that will happen and suddenly reveal to you and your loved ones ""aha! here's the truth-- turns out I'm one of those bad and damaged 'alcoholics' and have been all along and must now dedicate my life to working never drinking again"". 

Holly's not alone in this new kind of thinking about alcohol and its problems these days-- there's a larger backlash and if you've been around this sub for a while you probably are pretty in the know about it. However most people acknowledge that AA and the self-help culture it has inspired has been enormously helpful to a lot of people. Dax Shephard often says that it is both his and Kristin Bell's philosophy that everyone ought to be in AA regardless of drinking history because of the wonders it works on your soul and I can see where that could be true. But I also wish that, as Holly Whitaker says, people were encouraged to look at their drinking more without the distorting lens of ""am I drinking like an alcoholic or like a normie"".

I have embraced the word ""alcoholic"" because it's turned out to be more convenient than trying to spell all this out to someone. I say I'm an alcoholic just as I say I'm an atheist. Both issues are way more complicated but the words provide convenient shorthand ways of quickly summing up an otherwise wide and complex swath of my character that for whatever reason, I don't care to delve into in a given moment.

I hope you are doing well ! I have a serious question. As some of the covid/corona measures are slowly  reducing, I get messages from friends/colleagues that we should have a drink to celebrate together. It will still take several weeks, maybe a few months before we can really have a drink together, but people are already motivating each other for gatherings.

I don't know how to protect myself. January and February were my first months of soberness, so my motivation was very high. Since March I'm quarantined so I don't meet drinking buddies, no more restaurants, basically I have it very easy.   
I think when restaurants reopen it will be easy to order soft drinks. But I might, I will, or maybe not, have a very hard time when meeting up with friends and they all order beer/wine/champagne to celebrate.  
The one protection I have is my car. I never drink when driving (never have, never will). My friends also don't care about what someone else drinks; so I don't have a reason to worry about drinking soft drinks. The biggest enemy is me, myself and I. I'm afraid of myself. I know I can do this, I have done it before and I love IceT. But still ....

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Morning all you wonderful people!

Yesterday I asked about sober sayings and cliches, and then I heard a new one on a podcast that I had never heard before.  ""I can drink two days a week... Yesterday, and tomorrow."" I liked it, it gave me a little chuckle.

Alright, so I gotta be honest with you guys.  I wrote down a few ideas I had for the DCI to ask you all, and as luck would have it, I can not find that piece of paper anywhere this morning!  And last night I woke up in the middle of the night with a great idea, but I can't find that this morning either.  So, looks like I'm just going to have to wing it.... (And now I'm staring at the screen waiting for inspiration...)

One unexpected thing I have come to love about being sober is making Honest Mistakes.  For example, a couple weeks ago I went hiking with a friend and after the hike, we got a coffee at the train station and got to talking.  I lost track of time and missed my train.  I had to call my son and tell him I'd be late, like I had many times when I was drinking, but this time I was sober.  It was an Honest Mistake, and it felt kinda good.  These days if I repeat myself, or lose something, or forget what happened in the last episode, or knock something over and spill it, or run late, or have to cancel plans, or trip on my own foot, or leave a red sock in a load of whites, those are all Honest Mistakes.  My mistakes are no longer loaded with the awful shame and embarrassment of  having been made while drinking, and I love it.  Even screwing up is better sober (which is awesome for me, because I'm a bit on the clumsy, scattered side even without drinking)!

What is something unexpected that you have come to appreciate about being sober?

I turned 28 earlier this year, went to rehab for 25 days and finished at the beginning of April, then moved into a sober living house in another state. I live here with 7 other guys, who are all going through their own issues as well. They are all good guys for the most part. Since being here, I have been in my own head much of the time and it shows. I used to never have problems being social and having fun with other dudes. Nowadays, I'm pretty self-conscious and find myself trying too hard (trying to be funny, obnoxious, etc.). I can tell these guys either think I'm weird or pity me. I try not to be a sad-sack with all of my emotions, but I've spent a lot of time in my room lately or end up talking about my feelings/troubles too much in front of them. I'm still looking for work out here which has me in shit mood, too. Lots of time spent in this house is beginning to wear on me, given the state of society right now. It's a mountainous state, so there are foothills I can walk around, and have, near the house but I don't want to get bored of it. It's hard being myself around new people because I want them to like me. I get down on myself to even do the simplest things like grocery shopping, calling family or my sponsor, organize my room, whatever. Could someone shed some light on how they've dealt with similar situations. Any therapeutic or mind-easing would be greatly appreciated. I need to try new things but am stuck in a rut.

Before my pregnancy, I didn’t have the courage to be “different” (or acknowledge we all had a problem). I still don’t have the ability to talk about my in-laws unhealthy drinking behaviors. Just yesterday my mother in-law had to comment in shock that one of her sons hadn’t had a drink when we all saw each other (socially distant) for my father-in-law’s birthday. She had to make a comment indicating it must be because he has gained weight in quarantine (soooo much eye rolling). He hasn’t, he is fit as a butch ass dog. 

How do you guys cope with these judgmental comments? It hurts when someone in your family has to tear you down in order to feel ok with their own behavior. It hurts to know that person gossips about and judges those she is supposed to cherish the most. 

This is just one example, there are so many more. One uncle doesn’t drink, but she has lots to say about all his flaws (smoking) anytime his not drinking is mentioned. 

I just feel so small. As anyone here successfully established boundaries around shame talk (or judgmental talk) with their families? 

I am happy with my choice not to drink! It would take way too long to list off all the ways my life is better, but for some reason I just can’t get comfortable with this gossipy woman telling people “I have a problem.” Am I struggling with denial? 

Do I have to tell everyone for the rest of my life, I have a problem? Is it inauthentic for me to want to focus only on the positives of not drinking when talking with people with whom I don’t feel safe being vulnerable?",6,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7819953}"

I was thinking to myself what would happen if I reached for the beer. What would happen if I poured the glass of wine while I was cooking. Well, I’d drink it extremely fast because that’s what I do now. You see, alcohol was my escape in the past. I’ve mentioned it before. Alcohol numbed stress. So I drank it fast. A bar was my 2 hours of freedom. So I drank as much as I could in that time (and never wanted to leave, but at least I was buzzed to face the stress). 

Never, ever before was alcohol like this to me. But, shit happened, and this happened, and it is what it is. Therefore, I cannot enjoy one beer slowly. No. I will slam it back and reach for more. 

At this time in my life, I just can’t start, because it’s a slippery slope. Tried to moderate. Not there yet. Don’t know if I ever will be. Right now, as of today, I’m not going to drink.

I am female and 26 years old and proper started drinking around age 20 when I started work in hospitality, i feel a lot of sadness towards this as i hated alcohol prior to and being drunk used to give me panic attacks. I then at 21 entered a relationship with an alcoholic where we were drinking 10 cans of stella every night minimum (seperately). I finally left him in march 2019 and while my intake reduced, daily drinking soon snook back in, I met someone new and although my drinking wasnt as bad, I did some pretty terrible things to this new guy who was only loving and caring.

18th of January came round and I woke up in an embarrassed hungover haze. I had embarrassed my boyfriend again. That morning I also had a tattoo and a Brazilian wax booked D: . That pain certainly gave me a lot of time to think about what I had done and reflect on the years wasted to alcohol

I decided enough was enough and i stuck to it, I set myself until June. The first two weeks were the hardest. My skin was crawling I was sweating, having nightmares, throwing up but I stuck with it - I promised myself I could have a drink in June. At this point I'm never going back.

The main things I've noticed so far are:

I struggled with spots at first, when was this glowing skin going to arrive?? Well finally 3 months in its happening, I am receiving a lot of positive comments about my skin.

Things can blind side you, I have no interest in shop alcohol anymore and can easily turn down drinks, however someone bought me a bottle of prosecco at work as a thank you gift and I felt back to square one!! Fortunately I summoned the strength to give it to my colleague. I was so proud of that.

Periods! I had so much trouble with my periods and the pain that came with them, would never have tied it to drinking! But here we are! The last two my PMS symptoms have reduced and they are pretty effortless.

Brain function, another gift from sobriety that I thought I was missing out on, but finally it has arrived! I am productive at work but can finally relax on an evening and weekend, I used to drink as an excuse to cope with a stressful day (funeral director) but now my mind just does it's own thing and relaxes.

I love cooking again and healthy food tastes great. I get excited about preparing nourishing meals.

I enjoy being clean and tidy again, I take pride in my appearance (no more dry lifeless hair and unironed clothes because I was too lazy to sort them out)

I dont nap as much! And when i sleep it feels productive.

The positives have really started coming in at about 3 months for me and I feel so proud for all the hard work I have put in to this and I feel now I am really started to reap the benefits. This may not be helpful for everyone but I found alcohol free beer helpful in that I realised half of the thing for me with beer was the initial smell and taste  after a long hard day. I now find that I dont need them as much anymore as I don't depend on it as much as I did before.

Thank you so much for the support I have recieved from this sub, I know the next part of my new life will have it's own challenges however I am too excited to see the further benefits coming my way.

But there’s another level where you need to breakthrough a bit to really grow. Imagine a factory that is prone to accidents. Things are always going wrong, they’ve been sued many times, they’re paying out disability to many people.

Does “better is better?” work there?

I was thrown out of my house due to my drinking. My wife had all she could tolerate and then some. She kicked me out of the house for my drinking. A peach of a guy like me? How dare she!!!I finally got sober and moved back home. Gone a year. I landed a good job and started hitting meetings and was trying my best to be husband of the year. One Saturday I was up early. My wife came into the kitchen. I poured her a cup of coffee and brought it over to her. On my way I spilled about a half ounce of coffee out of the cup. She went up one side of my head and down the other and let me know what an idiot I was. I was ""whoa lady, easy, its only coffee."" Things calmed down after a while and we went on with the day.  2 weeks later, we were all getting ready for school, and work. My wife got up first, put the coffee on and woke me up. I went to the kitchen to get coffee and found it all over the floor. She forgot to put the pot in when she made it!!! 10 cups ran down my beige painted cabinets onto the floor!!! My wife came out and saw me mopping up the mess with some towels. She got this look of horror on her face and waited for the revenge attack to come. She must have flashed back 2 weeks earlier when I spilled a few drops. My reaction? I said ""Don't worry. I've almost got this cleaned up. Things happen. I've got some cabinet paint downstairs and I can knock the cabinets off in an hour. Go get dressed. I'll bring you in a cup in a minute.""  When she left for work I got the biggest kiss I had received in 25 years.
The point of the story is that relationships are tricky. She got mad at me not because I spilled coffee but because she was still full of pent up anger over my drinking. For my part, I decided that trying to improve my marriage was a tad more important than getting payback for her behavior toward me 2 weeks earlier.

Now fast forward to the present we have a two-year-old daughter,  I’m now 29 years old and I’ve been on and off the wagon for a while just starting back up after a relapse earlier this year. 

My problem is I can’t just have one  if I have one in my system my mentality is why drink to not get fucked up? So when I fall off I  go on one or two day bender‘s followed by a huge hangover, guilt and shame. 

I Recently jumped back on the wagon because I felt I needed to change not only for me but for my daughter because I want to be there for her I want to see her graduate I want to see her grow up !! But  more than anything I don’t want her to grow up having a “drunk dad”. 

I’m taking everything day by day one day at a time but it is becoming difficult or it is difficult at times because my wife drinks daily I tried explaining it to her that she’s been spending  a lot of money on alcohol just the other day we had a fight about that, and I told her that I haven’t touched any of the money ( some cash she had stashed ) and that she has been the one digging in there buying alcohol. 

I feel like every time I try to tell her to slow down and start she begins to attack me and tell me that I don’t know about her life and that not everybody had a perfect life growing up and that I don’t care about her. Then she leaves but usually comes back buzzed or drunk. 

I honestly don’t know what to tell her anymore or how I can help her because I do love her and I want her to not drink every day so she doesn’t destroy herself or what we’ve built,  but it seems I can’t get to her and 
I didn’t know where else to post this so I’m hoping any advice or any words will help us. That’s is IWNDWYT",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.57207596}"

Been lurking this sub for about a month now and I find it so encouraging! I’m about halfway through This Naked Mind after so many recommendations on this sub and it is truly eye-opening. 

I’ve been a week without and feeling really great about it and myself. I’m keeping it as a personal thing for me right now. I find this book incredibly interesting. I would not be considered by others in recent years as a “problem drinker”- (I’m realizing now that anyone without control, is a problem drinker). However I absolutely don’t have a healthy relationship with alcohol and I KNOW I didn’t many years ago. High school and college I had no control, but that’s what everyone is doing right? Life of the party? No. I got myself 2 DUIs and a lot of cringe looking back. (Bless my sweet parents). I stopped drinking several weeks before I found out I was pregnant with my second (amazing how our bodies know these things). After having my baby, I just didn’t go back to drinking for 6 months. Not for any particular reason other than I just didn’t feel like it, maybe “spontaneous sobriety”. I gradually started again, just some here or there with dinner. Leading to almost every night cooking, with dinner, and maybe one after. And so it goes-it was each night basically until I went to bed. Some days I wouldn’t drink at all. It did not appear to negatively affect my life at the time- I was still outgoing “super mom” getting all the things done. But it was hard to wake up in the morning, I didn’t feel good literally most of the time. And every once in awhile I would do or say something that might just seem a little odd to the person I talked or sent the message to, but I’d be cringing the next day and I’m sure after some time it’d get a lot worse. 

Anyway, I’m feeling this week the same benefits I did when I randomly stopped drinking before. I wake up so much easier, I’m energized, ready for the day, headache free, don’t have to worry about last night, and overall lighter and happier. I’m pretty much doing this to show myself I can because I find great pleasure in overcoming, whatever it may be. While I may not outwardly be a typical addict per say, there’s no control here. I have bipolar disorder, severe anxiety, and insomnia. All of which have their own propensity for addiction and lay the groundwork with a pretty little yellow brick road to it. This is SO much longer than I intended! I enjoy the stories and positivity of this sub. Most importantly, IWNDWYT.",5,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.53416485}"

I haven't told anyone why I quit drinking at work, they just know that I still go out to the bars and I just drink club soda. They get their cracks in and then the evening goes on.

Anyway, today was our first day back after 2 months of working from home. As we sat at lunch(6ft apart), everyone just joked and laughed about how much they drank over the break. How they got hammered and dont remember much. One guy was even joking that he was shaking today because this was the first day in 2 months he had lunch without a beer.

They then ask me if I stayed as dry and was lame over break. I told them I had a couple of beers the first week or so but then decided I would rather spend my time enjoying my family and being productive. I told them about all the house projects I got done, how I finished my MBA semester with straight As, and how I learned a song a week on guitar. They were impressed but also annoyed by me. They make fun of me for not drinking but always wonder how I get so much done. I also got a huge compliment about how much I've matured in the past 10 months.

I started my 20's drunk, and continued on that path throughout my twenties. It was fun for a while until it got really, really not fun, and after several failed attempts I committed to rehab and have been dry since October 2019.

Exactly one year ago today I ""celebrated"" 29 with a few mini shots in the morning just to be able to face the day and be in a decent mood with friends and family. This was not long after two hospitalizations for alcohol. And at the time I was actually proud I stopped at a few drinks -- I ignored the fact that I was a. sneaking, b. liquor, c. in the morning.

I'm not saying life is magically perfect today. I'm celebrating my birthday alone in quarantine. My depression and anxiety have been up and down with PAWS and I still have some pretty bad days. Many of my relationships have not fully healed, some barely have at all. Etc. But alcohol has gone from a must-have I obsessed over daily, even when I really didn't even want to drink, to something I think of in passing then push out of my head. Sobriety now feels like table stakes -- something I need to do to even be able to consider the hard work I want to do to become the man I'd like to be. I've done a ton of work to get and stay sober, and I still feel like I'm just beginning the journey.

Really hoping my 30's have good things in store for me. Spending the whole next decade sober would be a huge accomplishment!

I, however, understood immediately why he did it.  One of the comments on that video put it perfectly:

""I think it's a lot more simple than people make it out to be. He did it for the same reason millions of us do it temporarily with drugs or booze..sometimes the fake reality is much better than the real one.""

I was very glad that somebody else had made that same connection that I had.  I left a response on that comment that I thought you all would like to hear:

""I was just thinking about this.  I used to drink...a lot.  Like most people who drink a lot, I did it because I enjoyed the sensation it gave me, or at least I believed that I did.  I drank to relieve myself of the psychological burden that it is to be alive in an imperfect world.  I was told time and again that that wouldn't give me 'real' happiness, but I thought that that was foolish; life is all about our perceptions and sensations anyway, right?  All we have is what we see, hear, think, and feel, so the 'illusion' of happiness is the same as the real thing.

""Now that I've separated myself from that, I now realize why I did it.  I did it because I believed that it made me feel better, so I made it so.  Think about it; if you're in pain, and you take a pill that you believe will relieve your pain, you instantly feel a little better, right?  I would feel 'better' as soon as I took that first sip, even before the booze could start working.  That's how I know it was fake.

""Why would we evolve to enjoy poison, anyway?  That's what alcohol is to us, inarguably; it's poison.  Yes, I know that evolution isn't perfect, but even our current evolutionary 'imperfections' have an answer that lies in the past; we have an appendix because we used to need to eat raw meat, we have tail bones from when we used to have tails, etc.  However, there is absolutely no reason for us to evolve to enjoy the sensation of poison entering our body.

Today I've moved a bunch of mulch for my mom, who was super surprised I even responded to her, mowed my lawn, but a fridge (with the money I saved from not drinking it away), did ALL my work for the day (I'm working from home), cleaned my room along with making the bed, and cleaned out my car a bit. Gonna finish that after posting. And it's only 3pm. I feel like a super human that just can't stop going. 

And what's weird? I've sweated less with all that work than I used to laying in bed not only a week ago. And after all of it I still smell better lol. Albiet I smell like grass and stuff, but at least it's not BO and fart. 

I'm at a point where I feel happy. I feel free. There's no real pull, at least right now or the past two or three days, to drink at all. Maybe ive really internalized the problem and broken the cycle of it all, I don't know.

This is it. This is the reason why I had been drinking for so many god damn years. 

I’ve suffered from GAD since I was 5-6 years old. My dad is diagnosed with GAD, my sister is diagnosed with GAD, my aunt is diagnosed with GAD and Grandpa had it, but was never diagnosed (World War 2 vet, so he just chalked it up to nothing and if you said anything else, you were a idiot. I miss him..) 

I’ve always used things to distract myself from my anxiety, because it’s always just there.. like a dull throbbing pain. When I was a kid I remember going through periods of absolute heart ache because I felt so on edge and pent up and scared, for no reason. I’ve been on SSRI’s since my teens and I used games, music, books, religion, crafts, socializing, bodybuilding, music, school and finally alcohol to try to distract myself. I would learn one and then move onto the next. 

For the last 3-4 years I drank like a fish. Because all that alcohol caused me so much pain and problems, I finally could worry about something other than the dull throbbing pain of constant panic and anxiety. I mean, when life feels so shitty and numb, who has the time to worry about that throbbing dull pain way deep down? 

The funny thing is, because of the constant desire to distract myself I’ve learnt SO MUCH in my life. I’ve learned more instruments than fingers on my hand. I’ve learned so many cool philosophies and meditation techniques. I’ve learned how to woodwork, live DJ, create soundtracks, create and organize charity organizations, all before I let alcohol rob me of the ability / desire to do these things.. now I’m learning that doing these things is what makes me, me. I don’t need to be the drunk/numb/boring version of myself I hate. 

Now that I’m sober for the longest I’ve been in a few years, that dull anxiety is coming back. I find myself restless, I find myself shaking my legs, biting my lips.. itching to let out this frustration that I can’t really put my finger on. This time though, I’m not going to distract myself and run. I’m going to face it, because in a weird way.. I’ve missed it. Well, Maybe I don’t miss the anxiety, but I miss being able to actually feel it, and not just being constantly numb/drunk/in pain. 

I know I’m probably rambling, but I’m excited. I’m excited to look at this feeling and finally confront it. To be able to say I have enough insight in my life for the first time and that I’ve seen the other side, and I’d rather live and deal with these emotions, than hide and be numb from them.

In the grand scheme of things, I’ve only drank about 8 days in the past 365 days. Which I count as a win after drinking daily for 4 years.

I’m to the point where I don’t think about alcohol daily. When I think about drinking I no longer see myself as a flirty sexy rockstar but as some sort of miserable, sloppy, humiliating, annoying fiend.

This all being said, there will be moments when my fiancé is away and I’m sitting on the couch, minding my own business. When suddenly my brain goes “go and find alcohol and drink. Get off the couch. Get your wallet and ID. If you go now you can drink and have enough time to feel good and pretend to be sober when he gets back. You can hide the bottle. Get up. You got this, you can do this. Quick! Get up! get up! Do it now!! Now!!!”

And it’s like, come on!! Why can’t my brain do this for stuff like working out or being better at my job or doing chores? Can you imagine how good life would be if your brain pestered you for things that don’t wreck your life? We’d be unstoppable.

I haven’t found an effective way to shut my brain up when it does this. Mostly I just muscle through it. It’s so tiring that this 30 minute fiasco can fuck up my life after long period of sobriety.

I keep getting more and more responsibilities and my job keeps getting harder. I keep moving up and up. But I am still not satisfied.

I am constantly worried that I am not where I should be or that I am where I shouldn't be. I haven't grown enough. Where is the end and when will I get there? When will I finally be satisfied?

Celebrate each step and every small victory. Enjoy the moments when everything comes together and you think you have figured out all of life's secrets. Bring on the bad times. Face the challenges head on and embrace the painful truth that there is no final destination. The satisfaction has to come from now. If you are on day one, be satisfied that you have started the journey. If you just relapsed after a year, be satisfied that you have learned so many lessons and you have the tools to try again. Look ahead but don't bet your happiness on some arbitrary mark in the future.  Be content and be satisfied now. I am working on this. I am learning. And that is the beautiful thing about this long arduous journey. I keep learning and growing. Even if I can't always see it. Even if it is painful. And that is more than I can say when I was still drinking.

First of all this is gonna be a good news post. After a few years of slowly increasing booze usage, I've finally mustered the courage to contact my doctor about it and am now working on it. I did a full week of no drinking whatsoever, which went remarkably easy. No physical illnesses or something.  I had a few friends over for lunch and sitting in the sun at 1.5m distance. I bought some beer and a bottle of champagne. We finished it with the three of us over the course of the day.  I had 3 drinks in total and did not go to the store afterwards to get more.  Sadly, 3 days later I had a relapse where I drank a bottle of wine. Way less than I would normally drink but still.  But what I noticed is that the hangover was different. I felt so much more tired. Or to be more precise, I think I've had this feeling for years on end now and being a week sober and feeling like a normal human being again is a big contrast to how I was feeling then. Is that something you experience too?  Only a week of exercise, proper diet and good nights sleep and I felt like twice the person I was before.

Either way, I discussed the relapse with my doctor and am now working on another sober week again. I got help, stepped over my own shame and although it's gonna be a tough battle coming I somehow am more confident now than ever now that I have help.

Since I can remember I was the kind of guy who never had a feeling for, when to stop. So, social drinking in 90% of the cases ended blacked out. I did a lot of akward stuff on parties, lost my licence twice in my early 20´s.

Since 2017 I am drinking almost every day. There where some cuts but I believe I never canceled more then 3 weeks, before I came back to my usually drinking behaviour.

I also see that I am drinking more and more, so  in 2017 it was three 0,5l beers a day. Today I drink an 1l of white wine and 3 0,5l beer often and alone.

I quit on January 15th and just came back to drinking on 7th february and within no time I was back where I was when I was quiting.

I am feeling no withdraws, when I do not drink so I guess it is only a phsychological issue at the moment, but I see that I will kill myself by doing it like that the next 10 years.

We got very intoxicated and his mood flipped. He got very very violent with me. I was terrified. The next morning after waking up I told him it was over and I knew it was bad timing but this just could not happen again, we had to get away from each other. This is a four year relationship, we haven’t had sex in a year or so, so it’s not like it was great and I thought I was SO ready to be out. 
Here we are, living together and I’m dying. I feel like my heart is being ripped out of my chest and I’ve been drinking (not currently).

I don’t have withdrawals, just moodiness for a day or two, then I feel better.  Then I go back.  I feel I keep going back, cuz otherwise I feel like I’m missing out.

Alcohol

For so long you had the wool pulled over my eyes. I believed you made me more confident more outgoing and an all around fun person. You had me believe that you were to be used for celebrations recreation, for fun times as well as sad times. 
Now that i am on the other side of the fence I see you for what you really are. Your just ultra refined engine fuel, a poison dressed up in a pretty bottle that bit by bit sucks any kind of joy or contentment from my life. 
For 15 years I consumed you and though at times I reflected on the harm you caused me, I still managed to glaze over it and return to you on countless occasions. 
Under your influence I hurt myself and I hurt my husband I could have possibly hurt other people and maybe I did and didn’t realize it. I made bad decisions when I drank you and I ignored my responsibilities. I was unreliable, untruthful  and petty when you were in my system. 
It has almost been a month since I last consumed you and I really don’t miss you. I’ve gained so much in such a short time. For the last four years I’ve suffered from depression and perhaps at other times too during my 15 years of alcohol use. Now I feel as if a great weight has been released from me. I’m beginning to love myself and I don’t remember the last time I felt that way. My confidence has grown as well and my mind functions so much better! There’s now a balance and a light to my thoughts and feelings. 
I feel no regrets saying goodbye to you. You’ve only helped me to hold myself back all these years. I can’t wait to see what opportunities unfold as I leave you behind and enter this new chapter in my life.

It's not because I have butterfingers. It was because I was drunk. Cleaned it all up and refilled my wine glass. Never ate my remaining pasta because I know how drunk I can get on an empty stomach. That was my goal. I'm done. Hello again, day one.

For many of us, the people we love may come to mind. It’s for my husband, my toddler boys, my family. And that’s all very important. 

But it’s also for ME. I deserve health. I deserve to have a good life. This is the one life I get. And already my body’s been through a lot. It deserves to be thanked for all it’s been through. It deserves a rest and a break from harm. 

I have value. We all do.

Before I quit drinking I was a mess, I’d get way out of control on nights out with friends, usually putting myself in very dangerous situations, getting arrested etc. I quit drinking to save my relationship and save myself and It’s done me the world of good.

3 years ago my best friend of 8 years fell out with me after I let her down one time too many. I acted very inappropriately and damaged her relationship and her friendships at the time. She completely cut me off, telling me I would never change and she didn’t know who I was anymore. It hurt a lot because we were basically brother and sister for years, but it wasn’t until I got sober I realised the damage I’d done.

Since my sobriety I’ve tried to contact her a couple of times to make amends. We’ve had brief conversations where she’s been polite and asked how I’m doing etc and it’s been nice to catch up, but things aren’t the same and I can tell she would rather not be speaking to me, she’s just doing it out of politeness. It hurts me a lot to see her on social media, knowing how badly I fucked up and that I will never have a good friend like that again. I feel like I lost my closest friends due to my alcoholism and I lost my party friends due to sobriety - overall leaving me pretty much alone.

I'm not even sure if this is the right sub for this post, but it's always so supportive and maybe I can be a cautionary tale.

I've always been a fairly heavy drinker. Caused some troubles with college, which I never finished. That could be chalked up to a number of reasons. Got a dwi about a decade ago. 

Fast forward to my late 20s. I've been bartending about 9 years at this point. Fairly heavy drinker. I'd show up to work hung over sometimes, but everybody does in that industry. 

Depression drove me to run away from where I was living. That's about 3 years ago. I packed up and moved to a major city. Took me a couple months to find a job that fit, no big deal. It's a local company with a few locations. I worked my way up to a corporate trainer position, opening new stores and being a float. 6 months ago I started dating a really great girl. I'm making more money than in my entire life. 

Then COVID19 happened. I lost my job temporarily but got unemployment. The first few weeks were kind of fun other than a little lonely sometimes. Then the isolation and uncertainty started to really wear. Relationship is massively strained. I started to get pretty depressed. 

Now, over the last couple weeks I've been permanently fired due to my position being eliminated. I discovered that my unemployment is on hold since I got terminated. Also the girl and I parted ways today. Her choice, not mine. 

I worked really hard to get out of a very dark place. I feel like all the work I've done for 3 years is for absolutely nothing and I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. I cried.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning Sobernauts, and Happy Monday!

I read yesterday that some of you are returning to work today, and I want to wish those of you that are going back to work a really good day.  Stay safe and stay sober!  And we'll be right here if you need us!

In sober circles, books, blogs, podcasts, meetings, here on SD, you will hear many, many sayings and slogans over and over.  So many of them are the very definition of cliche.  One of the biggest and most oft repeated ones is, ""one day at a time."" It's why we're all here checking in.  But I'll be really honest with you, I didn't really, really get this until recently.  I mean, after all I want to quit for good, right?  That is the goal, is it not?  So I'd give lip service to one day at a time, while at the same time causing myself anxiety by thinking about ""never again"", which leads to internal conflict and debate, and attempts to negotiate and rationalize, etc.  It's only been in the past few weeks, and especially since I quit smoking, which has caused every kind of craving a person can have to rear their ugly heads and start shouting all at once that I have more fully grasped the power and importance of ""one day at a time"" and it has become my most powerful weapon.  ""Just get through today, and if you still want to, you can f\*\*k it all up tomorrow"" has been my mantra, and it quiets my addiction monsters.  And sometimes I'm even 100% set on buying whiskey and cigarettes tomorrow.  When I wake up the next day, I'm so happy that I didn't drink or smoke the day before that I want to go another day.  Now when I try to explain my newfound understanding of the amazing power of ""one day at a time"" I just hear myself repeating the same wisdom that I had heard a thousand other sober people say before me.

So what about you?  Is there a sober saying or cliche that you had heard 100 times and thought you understood, but then one day the meaning really hit like a revelation?  Or is there one that you especially like that has helped you along the way?

With the busy day wrapping up, I have some extra work to do before the new week starts. 

To wind down, I've decided to:

-Make some peach tea.
-Surround myself with cozy warm light and new plants.
-Pop a live feed on the tv of trains traveling through Norway (highly recommended). 
-Eat some cookie dough.
-Get COMFY.

Overall, It's now calm, pleasant, and relaxing.

Why is this post NSFW you ask? Because there is also vomit all over the house. 

You see, I am married to the best man in my world. The sweetest piece of pie you'd ever meet. And together, we are on a journey. 

Quarantine introduced a challenge for him and he decided to quit drinking for 30 days. When drinking he tends to indulge, as I did, until things get a bit... sloppy. After a busy weekend, he wanted to unwind. Now, I think many of us on this sub are familiar with the landslide effect of 'moderating'. After a LOT of tequila, PBR, and a little bit of cake, he decided to go to bed early. Suddenly he motioned he felt sick.   

He really tried his best, and I understand he is embarrassed. There is now vomit on our bed sheets, on our blankets, on our clothes, in the hall, on the bedroom floor, on our towels, and all over the bathroom. 

We couldn't find a bucket to catch the first spill, so we used a sweater and cradled the warm vomit into the tub. The next spill, he admirably held his vomit in his mouth as long as he could as I scrambled for something, anything, for him to throw up into. We found a box. The box had a leak. Again, warm vomit pooled into my hand and veined down my arm as I cupped the leaking box and hurried to slosh it into the tub. 

After a few more batches, he made his way to the bathroom, stabilized himself over the tub, and let everything out. Let's just say, I didn't know you could throw up that much. 

He's showered and in bed now, sweet and snoring soundly. 

But I know he's going to hurt tomorrow. He's going to be embarrassed. His eyes told me that as he threw up and his body heaved. He'll have a horrible headache and a fuzzy mouth. Work is going to be super fun. 

I feel for him. I love him so SO much. This thing that grips him, that grips all of us here in some capacity, is insidious. What began as a promised evening of relaxation has been cut short by the false promise of moderation. Him and I are in this together. I've been through a similar process ( actually today marks day 301 for me!). I can't do this for him but I can support him and be understanding. Tonight, I am so thankful for my sobriety.

Thoughts:

-I said I was gonna give up smoking cigarettes 3 weeks in. It was very cute and naive that I thought I would be safe without that crutch. Now I've got a quit date planned at 3 months!

-I can joke about it now. I use humor to cope a lot, but alcohol was such a visceral part of me until recently. 

-FOCUS ON THE WITHDRAW. I heard it was like feeling hungover for a week, but that didn't account for the cravings. It felt like I was starving. The only reason I didnt go back to daily drinking after a small relapse was because I remember how awful it was. 

-Also the cravings are so much further in between. I might go days without thinking about it. By days I mean like 2 or 3 but still. It used to be hourly on a good day.

-With the last one, the cravings feel less intense. It's more like missing an old flame you knew was bad for you. A ""remember the good times? I'll never text him again because I remember the awful, but sometimes I miss the nice parts"" instead of holding a boombox outside his window begging him to take you back.

It’s not impacted my work or home life. It’s not impacting my social life. But I know that to be the healthiest I can be (physically and mentally) I need to stop. Many, many times I’ve tried and said, “ok, I’m going to take a break for 30 days.” and I’ve always joked that those are the hardest 4 days ever. It bothers me that I don’t seem to be able to follow through with even a 30 day break. 

So I’m posting here, this time. I still want to set small goals, like 30 days. But I also understand the value of taking it one day at a time. My problem, though, is that by taking it one day at a time, I have no incentive not to just opt out at any point and still feel like I did some good...you know? Like, “Hey, I was only taking it one day at a time and I did it 5 days! Woohoo!” And then I’m right back to it.

On top of that, my parents both drink pretty heavily and I could already tell that my Dad was in weekend-hangover mode, drinking all day just to feel baseline and really grumpy. To cut a long story short, my sister did visit for about an hour but then left without saying goodbye to me or my mom, I came on my period and had the worst cramps, and just kind of felt underappreciated by everyone this weekend. It could have been so easy to just give in and pour a drink with my parents, there are liquor bottles in multiple rooms of this house and they have been drinking since 10am. I came close to entertaining the idea, but just kept distracting myself with work and movies and I finally made it.

I went to my folks house today to wish my mom a happy mother's day. My Dad was out in the garage rummaging through everything and had started throwing things away. He was in a sour mood. I went in and wished her a happy mother's day and gave her some potted flowers ( I don't like giving cut flowers, they don't live very long) and some candy. Then I went out to help my dad. His sour mood just drained me and on my way home I realized that when he's like that, it's a trigger for me to want to drink. I know this sounds horrible to read. It feels horrible to write. But, I might have to give him some space when he's in a sour mood. I'm not trying to risk my sobriety because he's in a funk. Don't get me wrong, I live my dad and when he's not being sour we get along great.

My policy was to drink only when i was out at a club or only on occasion such as every 2 months. I sometimes broke this personal curfew and drank more than i should, i however quickly got ontop of it and stopped. However over the past 2 months, i have told myself to drink only on the weekends, so i started doing this, this soon spiraled out of control and i am now drinking regardless of what day it is. My problem has just started, and i tend to now drink 2-3 times a week, so i still have solid control over it. 

I am however scared that this will soon become a full blown addiction, i am not addicted or have any ''urges'', i just use it as an escape from time and to feel some sense of high, but no urges yet. I understand admitting is the first step but i believe in scientific fact not cult like mentalities. Technically it is not yet an addiction per the DSM5, and i also feel this way personally, i am able to admit addiction but this is not addiction (yet), but it is leading to it

My dad is a chronic alcoholic who has BPD and dementia like symptoms from alcohol, he has no self awareness and is almost homeless. He is a domestic abuser who only knows how to use Alcohol as a solution to any pain, his BPD is destroying his life.

Why not make the most of that? 

This was before the first Shelter In Place order was even given; the first one came out of the CA Bay Area 3 days later on March 17. But I've been in this frame of mind ever since. One of the things I've learned in sobriety is that I really am a true introvert: I do my best thinking alone, I do well with a decent amount of meditation and reflection, and crowds exhaust me. So, during this time I've doubled-down on all of that: more reading, more meditation, more journaling. Still keeping up with people 1:1 the way I normally would, just differently. And I just finished my regular Sunday morning meeting on Zoom where all of my favorite people were. The most interesting thing is actually how little my life has changed. And somehow, mentally and emotionally, I'm not sure I've been in a better place in my almost 29 years sober. 

And for that I am deeply grateful. I absolutely understand how privileged I am and that this is not everyone's experience. I live alone, my income is secure, I don't have any mental health issues which are being exacerbated by all this, and I know many people who aren't not able to say those things. Where possible, I've reach out to those I can help to support where I can.

have a question for the community. i am approaching five months sobriety. this is sobriety from everything except caffeine and nicotine. i am an alcoholic to my core. i almost had to die to stop. but i also have had addictions to just about everything else i can think of. pain pills, benzos, coke, weed, adderal. this is my first time truly sober in about fifteen years. 
this should be a positive time right? i am working things out with my wife (we were on the road to divorce,) am in the same home as said wife and my two lovey daughters, and yet, i am experiencing mood swings like a mfer. i am tired constantly. i wake up sad and pissed off for no reason. i am unmotivated. i am still finding myself unable to be present in the way i should be able to in sobriety. it doesn’t help that AA meetings have all switched to online (i have not done this as i’m not sure it will be the same) and my therapists office has temporarily closed down, as well as my gym. i am definitely white knuckling this period of my sobriety. 
my question is, is this kind of thing common at this stage? i have been looking into PAWS and it accurately depicts a lot of the things i’m experiencing though i feel almost five months is stretching it. i have some memory problems. though that may have something to do with a fall down some stairs onto concrete/a severe concussion i took during my last bender in august before i first tried stopping drinking, as well as the brain damage i gave myself after years of heavy alcohol intake. 
this is miserable. that being said, it is still less miserable than being drunk 15 hours a day. i just don’t know how to cope.

Rarely visit here anymore, but during the first 6 months, this community was a much needed daily source of info and support. Thanks to everyone who keeps this thing called Stopdrinking running.

\*\*\*\* Background:

I was a typical life-time drinker. In my mid-late fifties now and started when I was 15. Came from a location in the country known for excessive alcohol consumption, and Dad was in the military, which also has a solid drinking reputation.

Tried to seriously reduce in the last few years but failed badly. In fact, after a few days of not drinking, I'd drink more the next weekend.

Anyway, in May of last year, I got a sharp chest pain while in a Grocery store. This led to a sudden feeling of exhaustion. I actually had to sit down. Never had this before and was out of town and thought it was a heart attack. Called an ambulance and was embarrassed because I was fine when they arrived. 

I got lucky. They immediately found my blood pressure was seriously elevated at 209. That's it. No heart attack. Clean blood tests and subsequent analysis. One hour after they gave me a pill it dropped back to 165.

This is the part wherein retrospect I could have chose differently and not be writing this today. With a simple daily pill, I could have kept my blood pressure controlled and kept drinking. But, I didn't. In fact, I was afraid. Not much seriously scares me, but this did. I had been walking around for who knows how long, as a perfect candidate for a stroke or heart attack. Mid 50's, overweight, heavy drinking, high blood pressure, bad diet.

The fear I mentioned was similar to being very angry at something or someone. It was all-consuming. Add in a few self-loathing and serious 'get you shit together' inner discussions I had with myself and I decided I'd not drink the first weekend following the incident. This led to two, then 3, and so on.

The first 4 weekends were brutal but I knew after the first month I had a chance of winning. I had never gone that long in my life since I was a teen and not drank.

\*\*\*\* Jump to now - one year later.

I'm lucky. No relapses. Great wife and external support system (thank you SD!). Alcohol is now simply something I don't drink. It's as simple as that. Not sure how to explain this better, but for me, I now classify alcohol as simply being something I have said no to. No big struggle, no drama, no debating, no anxiety. No different than stealing, or jumping out of a plane without a chute, or drinking bleach. Not necessarily because it's so unhealthy - like the other examples, but, more like just something that is a hard stop.

That's it for the alcohol info, but there's more. My previous diet and lifestyle was not exemplary. From May till September I lost 50lbs. This was mostly from not drinking, but also because the blood pressure pills were causing a zombie type effect that kept me exhausted and reduced my appetite. I started jogging in September (never ran before) and was up to 5K in Nov. I even ran a 10K at New Years (I wasn't ready but did it slowly). Then, in January, we took the plunge and are mostly vegetarian. More relaxed on weekends or when visiting others, but through the week, no meat, or dairy. We saw a couple of Netflix documentaries related to food that triggered this. 

\*\*\*\* Some tools info here: 

We bought a Withings wifi scale from Bestbuy ($90), and an OMRON bluetooth blood pressure device from Costco ($65). For the winter, we bought a Costco exercise bike for $90. I used the free C25K app/program on my phone to learn how to get off the couch and run. The Reddit C25K community deserves a shout-out: [https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/](https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/)

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\* Wrap up:

In November, I had 2 months of Blood pressure data, including the month before and after I started running. I reduced my medication to half, then finally stopped taking it. Regular weight/BP monitoring is very easy using the tools described above. It should be noted that none of this was done after consulting a Doctor \[usual disclaimers here\]. 

Stopping drinking is achievable. In my case, fear was the missing ingredient. In retrospect, all I did was say no to alcohol. I'm embarrassed and angry at myself that I didn't do this decades earlier because it was actually so easy. You won't know this for the first few weekends, but it's easy.

Looking forward to reading about other's journeys. If you had told me on May 9th last year that by May 10th of this year, I'd be Alcohol-free, running 3 times per week, and a (mostly) vegetarian, I'd have said you were crazy.",14,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5008848}"

From my friends, from my own biological functions, from my health and fitness, from my feelings, from nature, everything.

500 days ago at age 33 I had a realisation that if I carried on what I was doing I'd never have the kind of life that I wanted. My drinking and drug use had taken me to some very dark places in my 20's I came close to death more than a few times.

Today my life is better. It's not been easy getting here but it does get easier. A lot! I had a few failed attempts to get clean and sober, I made a deal with myself before my last relapse that if I relapsed again then I'd go to AA.

I went to AA. I haven't drank since, nor do I have any desire to. I am a free man today.

In recovery I have had my squint corrected, lost weight, excelled at my job, made amazing  new friends, am closer to my existing friends, been to live music and comedy, played live music, paying off debts, trying to make amends to the people I have hurt, ran 5k, do voulunteer work helping other people with alcohol problems, taken up new hobbies and revived some old ones.

I just want to say thank you. This community is a really special place and it's helped me a lot. I still check in here regularly and try and chip in where I feel I can be helpful.

The most important things for me in the early days. Was knowing I'm not alone in this and having hope. All the above started with that. Then once I did the AA program and built it into my life things just kept getting better and better and they show no signs of letting up, every day is a gift that I'm super grateful for.

I've also been seeing someone, who has been supportive of me before I got sober and has stayed supportive throughout my recovery.  We recently had sex the other night, which is the first time I've had sober sex in about 6 months, and despite the fact everything he was doing felt good, it was hard for me to connect and be fully present which didn't feel ... as good?  I still have an interest in porn, but otherwise my libido is really low, and I dont like it.  I used to looooove sex, and now, it's like a hobby that just isn't as fulfilling anymore.

I tend to black out. 
I tend to get belligerent, incoherent and aggressive. 

I remember waking up with my face stuck to the pillow with blood at just 17 (had a fake ID) after going on my first works Christmas party - I'd become aggressive with a co-worker and he'd shoved me away and I'd fallen over and grazed my face in the process.

I remember the sickening feeling of embarrassment and guilt sweeping over me as the story got pieced together for me by others who were there that night and feeling like I wanted the world to just swallow me up so I wouldn't have to face the facts.


Fast forward 14 years and here I am at 31 with those same exact feelings sweeping over me again - I'd hate to try and put a number against how many times this has happened between now and then.


I haven't drunk continuously since now and then but every time I start drinking again it always ends like this. In the last 4 to 5 years I've been on an incredibly slippery slope - starting to drink daily and drinking more and more when I do - drink driving has become the norm, I've been abusive and dismissive to my partner when she has tried to confront me about my problems.

I know I haven't been the best parent I could be to my son because how could I possibly be when I've constantly been either under the influence or hungover for most of his life.

I know I'm at the point where if I don't change now I never will and while drunk me may choose the bottle over everything else, sober me knows that everything that matters most to me in life will slip away from me and it'll be nobodys fault except mine.

I've been sober since May 5th last year and stopped without AA or rehab, i had been drinking heavily for years and it was getting dangerously bad.

The withdrawls from my last episode scared me so bad that i stopped drinking for Six months, but like a lot of people no matter how bad it is, you think you will never forget how bad and scared you felt and will never go there again, but the longer time passes the more the memory of it fades until somehow you think it wasn't as bad as you remember or because it's been so long you now have it under control, like i did.

I had a weeks holiday from work last April and felt like it's been so long that i can have a drink and promised myself no matter how much i enjoyed it i would stop after one day but i just could not put the vodka down.

I drank around 5 litres of vodka over the next so many days at home and caught a glimpse of the bottles of piled in the corner and it only hit me then that i was even worse than before, i hadn't eaten in days as is always the case when i'm a mess like that (impossible by this stage) i hadn't realized just how much i had drank and stopped right there.

Then as the booze started wearing off i got the intense panic going from i will never drink again to just one more sip to ease the anxienty, i felt like i was going to have a panic attack, and my body felt like it wanted to fit, i felt like i had to keep moving around or my body would seize up, pacing around the house sweating, heart beating in my throat.

I lay in bed for days, sweating, intense never ending diarrhea, drinking lots of water, eating almost zero, my mouth and tongue was a mess because i had been drinking straight vodka like water, trying to sleep with sleeping tablets, they didn't work.

I had auditory and visual hallucinations, auditory was really bad and lasted a couple of days, i felt like i was going mad and this would be how i was for the rest of my days, feelings of total despair knowing i had nobody to blame but me.

I had taken a couple of extra sick days from work and went back feeling terrible, i have a physical job and had half the day done struggling badly, zero sleep or food for days and then my heart started to race and beat harder than i've ever felt and started to get involuntary movements, like i was going to have a fit (never had one before), i ended up having to call an ambulance at work and was in hospital for three days on valium and a drip having tests done.

Rather than be in hospital panicking about my situation and the state i was in i felt at peace, (valium may have helped) like this could be the thing that cements my resolve to stop drinking as i doubt i could survive much more of this, and it has been so far, just over one year sober.

Being in hospital and the the terrible state i was in along with my brother,  who also has a drinking problem (been to rehab and relapsed), recently having a fit and smashing his head open in front of his kids when detoxing is enough to push the thought of drinking from my mind, although i do still have the thoughts less and less as time passes, i know there is NO WAY i can ever go back to that.

Up until not too long ago i remember thinking to myself i will never ever stop drinking until i die because i loved it so much and it's what i do, now  it's been a year and i can't see a time i WILL be drinking in the future but i can't say for sure as tomorrow is another day.

I think hitting your lowest point is enough for some of us to stop when previously it seemed totally impossible, when you get in such an extreme situation that it can shock you into action and stick with you for a long time.

It was one of those times you swear, if i survive this i will stop 100% that i had said many times before but i couldn't have meant it more seriously this time and stuck to it.

Going from how terribly bad i felt back then to waking up feeling normal and being able to go to work and funtion and do things feels like such a reward and reminds me that i can't ever go back to drinking.

I still have by job, recently got into motorcycles, passed my test and bought a nice bike at the age of 42 so that's my thing now instead of drinking myself to oblivion.

I don't really mind quitting, but I have a question: my wife and I share common friends, who like to get together on a weekly basis and drink quite a bit.  In Mexican culture, drinking beer is very accepted, and something to celebrate, and do while you are making a ""carne asada"".

My fear, or my concern quite literally, is that people stop hanging out with us, socially, because ""oh don't drink around him, he has a problem"" so they just go elsewhere out of respect. This would really cause sadness with my wife, that her friends now avoid getting together with us, due to my 'issue'.

The thought of me sitting there, drinking a seltzer, while they are all hammered, really weirds me out.  I do not want to stop being friends with them, because really, why is it their problem that I am an alcoholic? I don't want them to have to choose between me and a beer, or make them feel uncomfortable. They are adults and can enjoy anything they please.

Each night listening to music, drinking and smoking cigarettes was my oasis. A bottle of wine a night then I’d kick myself for not buying more so I would buy cheaper magnums.

Fast forward. Last year I started dating a wonderful person who supports me and loves me like I have never felt before. I had slowed down on my habit of drinking every night but there were weekly or two-time weekly occasions I’d get drunk alone at his place. Tried to slow down more. That led to once a week binges where I would sometimes black out and emotionally act out (crying, negative thoughts, etc). Or be cooking full meals at 3am in the kitchen waking up to noodles on myself in bed (face palm).

December my bf confronted me about my drinking. I wasn’t ready to quit. But I knew (for years) that I had to stop. It’s been hard to finally quit. I had one last black out 55 nights ago. Since then I have had 3 occasions I’ve opened a beer, had a sip then poured it down the drain. But today officially it’s been 30 days since I have had a drink. I thought I loved wine so much so this is a big deal. 

I love having my mornings back. I love going to bed early. I love feeling like not every moment of my waking life revolves around drinking. I’m surprised that I don’t miss it. 

This sub has been my background support. Never thought I’d post but I appreciate reading everyone else’s posts so much that maybe this can help someone. If you’re thinking about quitting- trust me it’s worth doing. I feel like I am getting control of my life back. Days aren’t wasted in hangover abyss. If I can do it you can do it.

I love alcoholic drinks - trying new wines and beers while watching a movie or at a brewery is pretty fun and I love to drink socially with friends. It’s just that sometimes I lose control and take the drinking too far. Which leads to some really crap hangovers, some really stupid nights, and some guilt the next morning.

I was a binge drinker (feels good to say “was”). I thought I had it under control because I only drank at night and generally only drank when my daughter was at her Dad’s. I didn’t, and over a decade of bi-weekly blackouts left me depressed, anxious, unmotivated, sad, angry, at times suicidal, and unclear about who I was. 

I know that this is a marathon, but it feels damn good to be sober. I sleep better, I look better and incredibly, I feel better than I ever have in my adult life. I’m seeing a counselor twice a week. I also will say that if counseling wasn’t working I was prepared to enter treatment. I feel blessed that counseling is helping tremendously, and coupled with reading every book I can find (like TNK), I am starting to clearly understand why I drink and learning to cope in healthy ways. It feels like my soul has been muted by drinking, and seeking sobriety has liberated me.

Last, I wanted to share that 10 years ago, my Mom was in hospice for Breast Cancer, and on her last day one of the last things she expressed was how worried she was for me. She knew the dangers drinking posed and facing her own death, she was still worried about me. I felt shame for years that I let her down. I hope she knows how hard I’m working and hope she is proud of me. It’s fitting that this is Mother’s Day Weekend because I truly believe my sobriety would be the best gift to give my Mom.

It started when I was about 18/19. That’s when I started going to college parties every other weekend and basically getting alcohol poisoning every time because I was trying to get over this dumb guy. Then my mom was a bit of an enabler and let me drink some of her wine. (She’s a big wino and drinks every night too.) 
This started small but then I started having half a bottle every other night, then every night, and now I can easily drink a bottle of wine a night, if not more than that. 
After I turned 21 though, the way my body handled alcohol started to change. I was blacking out constantly, and having day-long debilitating hangovers. Right before I turned 22, I got into a terrible drunk driving car accident and totaled my car. 
I also have had some bad self harm incidents (I struggle with severe depression and anxiety—big part of why I drink) when I’m drunk, the most recent being almost 2 months ago. This usually happens when I drink hard liquor or when I’m blacked out, so since then I haven’t drank liquor and have been sticking to wine.
But wine in excess can be just as bad. When I’m really drunk it leads to really bad fights with my boyfriend. 

I was really drunk 2 days ago. As usual, it led to a fight. I wasn’t hungover the next morning, but since then I have had a really irritating pain in my side which I can only assume is my liver. I’ve had this pain before, but it usually goes away very fast. I don’t think I’ve ever had it last 2 days. I haven’t drank any alcohol since then, I’ve been trying to drink a bunch of water, and I’ve also been drinking detox tea. And now my stomach hurts too. 
Last night trying to sleep was a nightmare. I was so fucking anxious and genuinely thought I was having a heart attack. I’m definitely more anxious when I’m sober. I had to sleep in my mom’s bed lol. 

I don’t really know where I’m going with this post, but if any of you guys have dealt with any similar things, I could use some advice or even just a pat on the back. 
If anyone has advice about the liver pain, coping with anxiety, and tricks to staying strong and staying sober it would be greatly appreciated. I feel like dogshit today.

One of the most poignant things that I’ve read about it, is that it can signify that even though the physical addiction has dissipated, the mental addiction is still there, in that alcohol was my previous coping mechanism, and I’m not sure if I’ve managed to find my alternative yet.

So I’ll share some of what I have leaned and what I know now, that I didn’t know 9 months ago.

Moderation is absolutely not an option for me.  If I was going to be able to drink moderately I would have done that by now.  I wouldn’t have become an even heavier drinker as I progressed through middle age.

The cravings don’t go away but they do lessen and you develop ways of thinking to deal with them.  Even today, though, as I hit what is a significant milestone for me, the little voice in the back of my head tells me sweet little lies.  It suggests that I should celebrate this with a drink, especially since things have been kind of boring lately.  Play the tape forward.  I know how bad, how ashamed I would feel tomorrow so I will get through today without drinking.

I look better.  Especially around the eyes.  I was always dark around the eyes and I told myself that hey, no one probably notices.  I can see how my eyes looked in pictures going back some years.  Other people noticed, I guarantee!

My relationships are better.  Especially with my immediate family.  I would have been impossible to live with through covid if I was still needing to drink.  I’m sure I’d be divorced by now.

Tonight I won't be drinking. I'm always depressed these days. I have no energy, I never look forward to anything apart from having a beer.

I'm your typical problem/binge drinker. I tell myself that I'm not an alcoholic because I never consume alcohol before 6pm. So that makes it ok, right? I never get into trouble when I drink. I never stay out late at bars and wake up on a stranger's floor. I don't drink vodka from a brown paper bag in the park. So I'm normal, right? Surely? (< That is how my mind works. I always find Day 1 easy because I'm exhausted, but when it gets to around Day 3, or Friday night, that's how the mind chatter starts.)

How can I stay strong? I don’t want to tell him he can’t bring beer or drink. It’s my problem, not his.

Instead of freaking out and shutting down I took each day one at a time and after three days it turns out it’s just going to be a formality and everything is good to go.

Hey y’all not sure how long this will be and obligatory apologies for formatting while on mobile. 

I have a job that requires waivers if you’ve sought treatment for alcohol use, mental health issues, or physical conditions. I’ve been at this place waiting for my approval to come through when I found out my psychologist diagnosed me with a disorder that might end my career on Wednesday. Needless to say it was a huge shock and quite frightening with everything else going on. Background is that I stopped drinking in 2018 and sought help from said psychologist to help me work through any issues and he never told me he diagnosed me with a disorder just had the counseling sessions. Well fast forward to Wednesday and if felt like my world was crumbling down around me. But my doctor gave me a light and path forward and told me to fill out some forms to redo my physical with this information on their so it could be reconsidered. 

He wasn’t sure about the timeline and I felt a lot of despair about the delay. I went home and sat and looked at the forms not wanting to fill them out because I was afraid of the next step. But then I got the idea in my head to just keep calm fill out the forms make the phone calls to people and it will work out. Don’t hide or omit just tell the truth and admit your faults and weakness, present your plan for how you have bettered yourself some the objectives do subjective evidence that proves you’re not who you used to be because you have been doing the small changes one day at a time day after day since the last time you took a drink lo those many days ago. 

Fast forward to Friday and I get told I’ll be meeting with work doctors and counselors on Tuesday and based on everything they’ve seen in my files and a brief interview next week everything should work out and I’ll have no issues moving forward.

My message to the people who have one day or one million is to not worry about a week from now a month from now or a year from now but to find a good orderly direction and take the next right step in your process to not drink and still be productive.

I havent managed, but I did cut down significantly and was feeling pretty proud of myself. Ive habitually drank a six pack a night for the past 2-3 years. Sometimes that left me drunk, other times not, but I finally decided to call it quits. 

Well, I wasnt managing to not drink. But I was managing to say, stop for five days. Then drink for 2-3 but not end up drunk. Then stop for 3 days, then drink for 3, etc. And I was feeling a lot better since I was only drinking half the time I had been before. I had also switched to drinking that seltzer beer (like white claw). Hell, for a few nights I was just having one drink or maybe two, then stopping and drinking water instead. I was SO proud of myself. Like, wasnt that what I really wanted all along, to be able to just drink 'normally'? 

Except last night I went to go get some Truly (a seltzer beer) and I was going to just get a single one of those larger cans and call it a night and have it while gaming, and I saw one of my favorite IPAs at the store and thought, hmm, Im doing so well I bet I can just have one. And instead had all six. Stayed up till 4am, was between tipsy and drunk, slept horrible, and now woke up feeling horrible.

Before i quit drinking i was so sure I didn't want to have kids because my genetics weren't worth passing on.

I'm kind of worried once this is all over, I'm going to slip into old habits. I was wondering if anyone has advice as to what I should do. At times I think about my future and I think about how I could be sober forever and make this my life, but there are also times when part of me wants to go back not to drinking as much as before but a little occasionally. I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for uncertainty about alcohol but tbh I didn't know where to turn to and could really use some advice.

So it’s seems like an age away I was sat shaking and panicky on my sofa after coming off a three day bender. For me it wasn’t a case of reaching for the bottle every day as I was fairly good at keeping drinking at weekends. My issue lies within drinking Thursday Friday Saturday but also as a result taking lots of gear as well. My mental health was declining rapidly and I intended to stop doing gear but it’s seems after one pint that went out the f****ng window! 

So I decided to stop it at it’s source and stop drinking after I found this wonderful page. It’s strange how my friends and family have reacted and that it’s hit me how normalised drinking is and to not drink is seen as ‘strange’, oh well jokes on them I guess. 

The first 2 weeks have been bloody horrible with severe insomnia, restlessness anxiety and a big dose of depression - the wonderful combo. Mindset is key though and I haven’t even thought about giving in. Today I woke up at 7.30 on a Saturday morning (normally when I would be going to bed!) and sat in the garden. The sun is shining down on me and I can really appreciate it while I sit with my dog. I have just done a workout and about to walk the dog and I am looking forward to playing guitar later, a hobby I have picked up since being sober. I’m feeling lesser withdrawals now but still have a slightly shitty feeling.

To be quite honest I don’t really care though feeling shit is human and it’ll pass so no use paying it attention. What you resist persists!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\**

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\*

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\*

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn’t:\*\*

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I want to enjoy sitting by a lake and watch the sunset. I can do that if I don't drink during the day.

If I stay sober, I will achieve my long-term goals.

I don't want to fall back into the old ways. I want to keep moving forward.

What are you looking forward to? What's in your sober future?

The very first hard liquor I ever bought after turning 21 was a 750ml bottle of Sauza gold tequila (no account for taste, right?) because I had been curious about tequila for so long. I'd barely had any alcohol up to that point in my life, so I never got that experimental phase out of my system.

Little did I know that that purchase was the first in a long, long series of purchases that would happen very nearly every weekend from then until now at the newly-minted age of 30. 

Early last year is when I realized I might have a problem. After one too many hangovers, I decided to take a month off of drinking. Except when the next weekend rolled around I... had a craving. I couldn't shake the feeling something was *missing* and felt a nearly irresistible urge to get in the car and go to the store. Go I did, and battling that craving ""autopilot"" that seemed to just make the decision to drink *for* me has been the hallmark of my battle with the bottle since then.

Last night, I broke after a 6~ day stretch with no alcohol and the autopilot took over again. 750ml of Sauza gold tequila. The thing is, I don't even particularly *like* tequila. I just craved tequila in particular for days for no apparent reason.

Now almost 24 hours after I took the first shot - I drank the whole fucking bottle, by the way - I sit here feeling fuzzy, ""off"", vaguely sick to my stomach, cranky, irritable, and slightly jittery for the umpteenth time. My drinking since my last contract ended in December and the rise of coronavirus has grown significantly worse. There was a roughly two weekperiod where I was getting full-on drunk about every other night.

30's the age when shit like this really starts taking its toll and I told my fiancee on April 18, my birthday, that I want my 30s to be better than my 20s. This is one of the most important reasons why.

I know he's just excited and doesn't mean to do any of this on purpose, but I'm currently having a moment.

Thankfully I'm in the middle of baking some Mother's Day pies when he's telling me this, so my hands are busy (yes, I stopped to type this). I'm also sipping on some pomegranate juice and seltzer, so that gives me something dark to sip. 

Anyway, I'm just going to take a minute and play my tapes forward and remember that it's literal gasoline being shipped to my house. I just need to sit with this for a moment and it will pass.

I originally was planning to white knuckle my way through the recovery period , in talking to my doctors shrink , therapist , sponsor and a lot of time to think about it I don’t want to face the recovery with no pain relief. So I have discussed with my doctor taking a low dose pain med for a few days post surgery if needed, it sounds like it’s one of the most painful surgeries to recover from
 (-according to my doctor and a couple friends who have had the surgery) So I’ve talked it over with everyone and my fiancé will be controlling my medication dosage and timing, I’ll check in with my sponsor every tine I take a dose. Continue to do meetings and hopefully recover quickly and easily. The reality is I don’t want to cause myself unnecessary pain through something like this if this can help. I’m also concerned about taking ANY medication. I feel like I have a solid game plan but I’m just nervous. It’s something I’ve put off for about a year due to the recovery being kind of daunting. So I guess I’m checking in for accountability and advice, support or personal experiences regarding this. I’ve done a ton of dental work in the last couple years and done it with otc’s , this just feels a little different. Thanks in advance all. I hope you are well and sober this beautiful day.

&#x200B;

I will be turning 30 this year. For the last 6 or so years I've had bouts of sobriety followed by 3-4 days of drinking, getting it down to 1-2 for a while, and then watching it creep back up to 3-4 again. For a very small period (\~8 months) I even drank too much every day until it induced world-stopping panic attacks and after that I went mostly sober for the rest of the year...somehow I got dragged back in.

I never fit in any of standard stereotypes of a person who has a problem:

1. I have a good job
2. Drinking doesn't ruin my social life (I've even got ""why are you more friendly when you're drinking?"")
3. I've never blacked out
4. I've only drank enough to puke once or twice in my life
5. I've never lost a job, gotten a DUI, or been overly risky after drinking

Because of these things I never really had a ""come to jesus"" moment. Coming into my 30s I've started to become deeply concerned with my health. Checking my eyes (despite only drinking once that week), pushing on my stomach to check for pain, checking for excessive itching, etc. I've hit the hypochondriac phase. It's time to stop.

But do you know what made me realize I need to solve this the most?

This last bout I have changed my mindset. Instead of thinking ""i'll only drink out at the bar"" or ""i'll only drink twice a week"" I internalized the idea of ""isn't it nice to wake up sober and refreshed?""

That changed my entire perspective. Instead of biding my time during the week waiting for another day I can have a 6 pack I said ""no, I won't"". After listening to my friend who was drunk out of his mind try to have a conversation with sober me I almost had some pity for him. Was this how stupid I sounded? Likely.

Finally I hit my breaking point yesterday. I was playing some video games and decided to have a drink. I drank too much and woke up a little hungover. I was upset with myself. Why? 

It wasn't because I betrayed myself and my promise (it was my first day drinking since last week!) but in a moment of weakness I justified it. For no other reason than to do it. I didn't need it. I wasn't upset, angry, tired, or sad. The booze didn't enhance anything. I got a little more talkative but whatever. I realized that what booze is doing for me just an illusion. I didn't need those drinks, and yet I took them because my brain overrode logic and said ""yeah it sounds like a good time to do this"". I was compelled. Even though I am not physically dependent, thank God, I am clearly psychological dependent.

My perspective has entirely changed on booze. I really didn't start this heavy drinking until I was 24 and it's been a part of my life ever since. Until now I never thought anything about it. Recognizing this was the first, second, and third step to recovering from this. 

Thankfully my blood work last year was normal. As far as I can tell I don't have any signs of dangerous liver disease. I have certainly damaged my liver and my body with what I've done these last 6 years but I'm determined to stop it and do no more damage. 

I'm sure I'll stumble some more down the road. But my mindset has changed. I will not drink with you tonight. I can at least promise you I will make it through the weekend.

I would like to ask one thing from you people who've made it. My life is surrounded by alcohol. Even this weekend my friend wanted me to drink for his birthday and I told him I cant because I have a problem and I need to solve it. Understanding as he was - this is now my new problem. We are friends and have been since before we started drinking. He isn't a ""drinking friend"" I can just not associate with. Moreover I am in sales. Sales is full of alcohol - and this contributed to most of my binging from 24 to now. Top shelf alcohol was so available and so good tasting without mixes (the argument ""think how bad it tastes"" never worked for me) I just kept doing it. I also live in a house with room mates who drink (I own the house - I can't just leave). So the added complication of alcohol being available but not for me is something I will need to navigate on my own. 

I need help navigating this new life trying to avoid alcohol and enjoying sobriety. I really do enjoy being sober. I just want to make it permanent. I need some tips on how to say no - how to navigate these social situations (especially w.r.t. work where drinking with someone ""seals the deal"" in sales). I can't seek professional counseling through my insurance because having ""alcoholic"" on my records will torpedo me. I would however be open to anonymous counseling - if available.

Sorry if this is a rant. I've had a huge revelation in both my mental model of drinking and how it effects me. There's nothing left for me to do but take another step. I'm not scared of a world without alcohol - I'm scared of the monster dragging me back in.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46051785}"

It's a bit of a tear jerker, just as a warning.

**************************************
Hello Everyone,

It is with a heavy heart that I write to inform you that Adam passed away yesterday, following a long battle with cancer.

We received the sad news of his passing yesterday morning. 
 
For those of you that did not know him, Adam was a long-term veteran of the Team in the Americas, having joined our family in 1998.

Throughout his career at The Company, Adam established himself as an invaluable member of the team, through his technical expertise, eagerness to train new engineers, and his attention to detail – his core value was doing things THE RIGHT WAY (we often joked with him that he was a stickler with the paperwork).

Throughout his decades in the field, Adam embodied what it meant to be dedicated to The Company. He was a road warrior with a “go anywhere, do anything” attitude and a dynamic personality. During his career, he created a tremendous impact and lasting impression both with his fellow engineers and colleagues, but also with the thousands of customers from all corners of the United States, Canada, and Central and South Americas. His customers loved him and always ask about him.

Adam's passion truly was the work that he did at The Company.

We will always remember Adam's charisma, his positive and encouraging spirit, his good company and love of a good conversation, and commitment to dinner.  The man had a way with words that so often made us not just smile - but outright double over with laughter.  But we all saw the softer side of him as well – when he talked about his family: the love he had for them would fill the room.

Adam,

It was an honor to have had you in our lives. We are thankful for you always giving the best of you. We will dearly miss you in our travels, think of you during our adventures, miss your words of wisdom and tales of your family, and now that you are gone, there will always be an empty seat at our dinner table. We will miss you, dear friend.

*************************
May he Rest In Peace.


If you read between the lines, I suspect you will see what isn't written there, and why I am posting it to this thread.

I am torn up over this for many reasons, but mostly, because I wrote this eulogy - and passed it over for my higher ups to send out.
I loved the man, but it now feels like I somehow did him a disservice. 

When I asked the team on input of what to write, no one had anything to say except

...Adam loved to drink...
 
And so I wrote that awful sugar coated piece of garbage, to make other people feel better.
I don't feel better though. 

Adam was a severe alcoholic. The bottle killed him. But we don't put that in a eulogy, do we?

There wasn't anything anyone could do to stop it.
I don't know that anyone ever tried.
Drinking is encouraged at The Company. 

Just finished up attending my mandatory virtual happy hour, where they virtually toasted Adam, knowing full well what killed him, and I'm just disgusted with the World right now.

Mad that this poison takes good people.. 

Furious at myself and so so so sad.

Going into sobriety, I had an expectation that I would easily be able to rekindle passions and healthy habits, but it’s proving to be way harder. I feel like after years of abuse and treating others and myself horribly, I can’t quite get to where I want to be. After about a month and a half of being sober I started to feel more in control of who I wanted to become, but it didn’t last long. I feel that I’m falling back into my emotions and am playing pretend and fooling myself constantly, like I can’t see reality for what it is and almost in denial that I exist. I feel that I’m not allowing myself to go on the path to healing, and put small effort into it. my brain just does not shut off, prohibiting me from moving forward. Perhaps feelings of guilt and fear that my poor behaviors during drinking is indicative of my true character and deeply suppressed feelings. 

My emotions are often turned into looping thoughts and vice versa. I feel like I’ve damaged my ability to think, focus and have lack of empathy, often times thinking of myself, and it’s very difficult to get past the feeling that I’m merely existing with no real drive. It’s hard for me to learn something, trouble even making sense of what people are saying at times because my mind drifts or I become very aware that I’m trying to understand, that instead my mind kind of just blocks out whatever is being stated. It’s really infuriating and end up getting frustrated with myself that my mind is not grasping such simple concepts, little interest in what people are saying, always thinking of how I feel and what I think is right, and it’s starting to make me worry that perhaps there is a bigger underlying problem. I constantly look up mental health information, wondering if I just don’t have a well-functioning brain—suspecting that I have ADD, perhaps some form of disassociation, living in a reality where I feel so out of place. 

Before my drinking I was sharp, since I was a kid I’ve been in AP and honors classes, socialable, focused despite a horrible upbringing. I feel like alcohol may have just flipped a switch in me and I’m afraid that it’s going to be a struggle from here on out, always attempting to repair damage from such a toxic relationship with alcohol. 

I suppose I’m just unsure if this is a result from alcohol to an extent. Should I be patient with myself, thinking that this is normal to feel after drinking for so long, or seek other paths to understanding? 

I hear so many stories about people really turning their life around after drinking, but not so much of the people who still struggle this far into sobriety. Is this because social media encourages pride and boasting about oneself and the ones who aren’t succeeding fall into pity and don’t share?

I suppose I would just like to hear from those who have had a similar experience on the journey through sobriety and what kind of timeline to expect for all of these feelings of uncertainty, if you’ve had them during your early stages. I much rather believe that it’s just a part of the process.

I  go buy a mini bottle of ciroc and down it in less than an hour, a couple hours later I buy a bottle of tequila. End up drinking it all within a couple hours. I was amazed I didn’t die of alcohol poisoning. 

I wake up to find out that I’ve posted the dumbest shit on social media, I’ve yelled at my girlfriend, I texted my siblings they were terrible people and that I was the superior one. Just a whole ton of embarrassing stuff. So still feeling drunk out of my mind, I order a bottle of whisky on an app, end spending like $80 and not caring because I was still drunk. It gets delivered and I drink till I drop. 

On the fourth and final day, I wake up feeling like death. Like at this point I don’t know how my body can take any more alcohol without collapsing. But, instead of going to work, I buy a bottle of crown royale and drink it throughout the entire day, also bought a 12 pack of coors, didn’t finish it though. I fell asleep and in the morning I had no idea what I had done the night before I just hoped and prayed to god I didn’t do anything more embarrassing than I had already done. I didn’t, just passed out. 

Needless to say my girlfriend was so disappointed, I could hear the pain in her voice and all I could say was sorry. She’s a very selfless person and eventually calmed down and is trying to help me recover from this but I’m just so ashamed, I’m so regretful and I feel like those 2 months went to complete waste. My mind is in a fog, I’m shaking and my body feels like I’ve been hit by truck. I don’t know I feel like life is pointless, I don’t want to drink but that’s because I don’t want to do anything at all. I feel like I’m always going to have this issue.

I wish I had never took that first sip of alcohol, I just don’t think I have the strength to stop drinking, I want to and I’m definitely telling myself I’ll stop right now but what’s going to stop me? I have no idea where to go from here. Would really like to hear some words of encouragement. 

TLDR; went on a four day bender, feel totally ashamed and don’t know if I can ever stop drinking, need some advice or some words of encouragement. Feel like life is pointless right now.

Since then I  have just been on a downward spiral.  The last few months I have been drinking nearly every day. I keep going through these mental gymnastics where I want to stop but then I find my self drinking anyway. I've always thought that I had good self control but recently I feel like I have none. I know what I am doing is unhealthy and this is not the cycle that I want to keep supporting. 

Some more background knowledge. I had a 5.5 year relationship end last November as well. What was hard about the breakup is that it wasn't anyone's fault. She had developed severe bipolar and had went through a manic episode. Within 4 days she had quit her job (which she loved at one point), spent all here money, and broke up with me. I let here stay at our apartment after the breakup since I knew she had no money. However, I eventually had to call the police on her due to her becoming violent. That was my last face to face interaction. Since the breakup she's has basically shunned all of her family and friends and was staying at a shelter and at people's places that she had met on Instagram. She has done some pretty mean things the last 6 months. She tried telling her family and my family that I was beating her, that I owe her thousands, that I was verbally abusive, etc.  None of which was true. No one believed her as well. She even eventually went to the police and told them I was abusing her. I ended up being asked to go into the police station for questioning. Her family even came with me to the police to defend me. Its been a crazy ride these last 6 months.

I had my first drink with my best friend. It was a fun and casual experience and was unrelated (I thought) to the breakup. Since then I have definitely kept drinking to numb a lot of the pain that I've been having. Definitely not healthy. I never on a million year thought of myself becoming an addict. This is not the life I want. I want to get back to making healthy decisions. I don't want to keep binge drinking and wake up 2 in the morning not being able to fall back asleep on a work night. I don't want to feel like shit mentally and physically because of my decisions. Being quarantined for 5 weeks has made my decision making worse. I'm ready to change.

• I likely will not have a job for at LEAST a year due to the nature of my work. Spiral into imagining possible career changes, realizing I have no skills or connections outside of this area, nor do I want a change...

• I realized my recently-divorced-from-an-abusive-marriage mother is having a rough time on her own and is abusing benzos. She also wants me to do everything for her, and I'm having trouble setting boundaries without crushing guilt.

• I thought I'd have a future with a particular love interest post-quarantine, but I found out - on Instagram - that he's moving to another state to be with his ex. This is not the first time I've been in a situation like this, so it hurts even more. Spiraling thoughts into my dating patterns and my childhood....

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\**

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\*

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\*

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn’t:\*\*

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

""A sense of connection makes us stronger and more capable of living a life without alcohol"".

Social contact is important - especially during these times of lockdown and quarantine. Thankfully I have the daily routine of checking-in to the DCI and I can interact with others on their sober journey.

I've read many comments over the past week and I'd like to thank everyone that has posted a reply or given support to others. Knowing that we're not alone during these difficult times can be the difference between staying sober and reaching for the bottle.

If you'd like to help people stay sober, hosting the DCI is a great opportunity to give something back to the SD community. If you have thirty days or more of sobriety u/SaintHomer will help you become a DCI host.

Have a fantastic Friday!

I randomly found an empty bottle of whiskey I hid in my closet and then forgot about. So, I thought it might be a good exercise to write some thoughts down...

Thankfully I got distracted and the urge passed without too much trouble. Later, I indulged my sweet tooth. I've heard that sugar cravings are a major thing when quitting alcohol. That's definitely true for me. Tonight I ate an ice cream sandwich...and then like multiple handfuls of chocolate chips straight from the bag. Delicious. I was beginning to feel guilty and ashamed about that, when I remembered that I didn't drink. My stomach even hurts a little bit right now...just full from too much sweets. But this is so much better than giving into alcohol.

I have been trying to quit for well over a year. I have lost about 15 pounds in that time. I have been running (slowly) about 3+ miles, 2-3 times a week since the new year. I'm reading again - a hobby that got drowned by booze. I finished Jane Eyre and The Book Thief. Started Oliver Twist...

And yet, it's scary to think about how fragile all this progress is. I could have shattered it all tonight. I waiver between telling myself, ""Good job!"" and feeling discouraged that this is always going to be a struggle.

Social distancing/stay-at-home has made not drinking easier for me. I guess because it's more difficult to head to the store and harder to drink in secret as was my habit. It's also wearing me down, because I really need alone time to recharge. The other day I was grouchy, and my wife asked if I had been drinking. I told her no - which was the truth - but she was skeptical. Any time I have a hint of a bad mood, she suspects drinking. And she doesn't seem to believe me. She's perfectly justified - I have looked her in the eye and lied about drinking several time. I have done damage. Still sucks though - now that I have been doing a good job, I don't have any one in my life to say, ""Hey man, good job.""

I'm learning to say it to myself, though.. Similar to the way I've been learning to stop drinking (because *I* want to, because *I* deserve to be sober, and because there are things *I* want for *my* life) - I'm also learning to praise myself - tell myself Good Job - and actually believe that it's true. Doesn't come naturally. But I'm starting to value myself.

11 days sober, and I finally was able to see what it was like to truly enjoy myself without vodka to mask my lack of self confidence and irrational anxieties. 

For Christmas I got my husband a tattoo set up. We had discovered our son was going through some trauma with a family member, and my husband was drawing a lot to help his depression. I noticed how talented he was and surprised him with a tattoo set up to start apprenticing and trying his hand. Soon we had developed a tradition where every weekend he would practice on me, and soon we had my whole body planned out and were constantly drawing and coming up with concepts.

Life started to stress me between work (essential worker), kids, therapy for my son and my own depression. I started to drink before every “tattoo night” and soon would drink a whole handle by the time we were done (yes, I am completely aware of the risks/issues with drinking while getting a tattoo). The night is would usually end with me blacking out and or a fight. I would wake up the next day so hungover, I would be miserable. I would be lazy with my kids, irritable, and not wanting to do anything besides sleep. Repeat every weekend.

Now I never drank more than 1 night a week, but each time I would increase the amount and in return increase the drama and negative effects. Combine that with a deep familial history of alcoholism, and severe depression- you are looking at disease brewing.

I decided it was time to change. In addition to family therapy, my husband and I do therapy individually. I told them I wanted to know what it was like to enjoy myself without alcohol numbing my stresses, doubts, and complexities. It was then decided that the next step in helping myself is to go sober. We made a plan, I got a daily check in app, and here I am. 
11 days sober, just had a great tattoo session with my husband. We did a piece that I have been wanting for years, were done/sterilized, and cuddling the kids in bed by 10:30. Alarms are set to go bow fishing at 6am.... I feel amazing and so grateful to have discovered this ability.

I called my alcohol counselor before and he said kava is fine. When I got there it seemed like a little coffee shop and I was suggested the one with something called kratom.

My last drink was in the parking lot of the facility because I was terrified of going into withdrawal during the intake process. I was an around the clock drinker at the end, and I'd already had one documented withdrawal seizure trying to detox myself at home, and likely more that went undocumented. I'd always imagined my drinking career ending with a bang; some huge, blow out party where I'd get wasted and then decide ""Alright, I'm good now."" But instead it ended with my sleeping on my parents couch for three nights so they could monitor me around the clock as we waited for a bed to open up at the rehab. I was sipping cheap liquor mixed with ginger ale around the clock to keep from going into withdrawal again.

The irony wasn't, and still isn't, lost on me how I was ready to accept help and stop drinking--I actually *wanted* to quit drinking--but I *had to continue* drinking because of the dangers of withdrawal due to how much I drank. Those were the most emotionally and mentally miserable days and nights of my life, forcing myself to keep drinking to survive long enough to get help quitting. I was scared, and my family was terrified.

Alcoholism is a progressive disease. I'd heard that during my several stints in detox. I didn't understand what that meant back then, because as far as my distorted alcoholic thoughts were concerned everything had been great, was still great, and would always be great... as long as I had alcohol. I shrugged off losing my apartment as simply not being able to afford the newly raised rent, not because I was spending hundreds of dollars a month on vodka. I'd convinced myself that my boss didn't appreciate me and my abilities, so it was a good thing when I lost my job. I'll find something better. Something where I wouldn't have to keep explaining how I didn't smell like alcohol... it's just the aerosol smell from my body spray. My friends and family didn't understand how thoughtful and self-sacrificing I was being by avoiding and ignoring them. After all, I know I'm going to cancel on any plans we make at the last minute, so I'll just not commit to anything so I'm the hero who doesn't let them down. Slowly but surely, my alcoholism grew to a level I'd never imagined. That's what this progressive disease looked like for me. Little by little, it chipped away at my life until I had nothing: no home of my own, no job, no money, no friends, and family that I was pushing farther and farther away.

Seven year ago today I woke up sober, *actively* chose to remain sober, and went to bed sober, and I've done the same thing every day since. The first thing I learned in sobriety is that sober alcoholics do not drink under *any* circumstances. I learned that I don't have to constantly fight that mentally personified embodiment of alcohol every second of every day; I just need to avoid that first drink. That first drink is the one that leads to the second, the third, and the twelfth. I learned that when that nagging little voice in the back of my mind starts telling me I can have a drink--I *deserve* a drink--I can tell it to fuck off. It had never occurred to me that I could ignore those thoughts, or that I'm allowed to tell those thoughts to go shove it up their rears, but I can. I'm allowed to, and *you* are allowed to. Avoiding that first drink is the only thing I have to do today, and if I manage to accomplish that, I've had a successful day.

I'd like to share a few suggestions for anyone who's new here, or anyone who may just need to hear these things:

* You are welcome here, and you are loved here. The details of our stories may be different, but none of us came in here smelling like roses. We all had our Day 1, and we're happy to share what we've learned.
* This is a ""We"" journey. Regardless of what path you take or what program you choose to join or not join, *we* can get through today sober together. It may not seem like it now, but you can lean on us when you need to. I've had my share of bad days in recovery and, thanks to having this group as part of my recovery network, I haven't had to face a single one of them alone.
* Never belittle your sobriety. There is no such thing as *""Only""* X amount of time sober. Recovery can be challenging, and every day is an accomplishment to celebrate. Even, or especially, during difficult days.
* Reach out. We can't help if we don't know what's wrong.

It's those random binges, the thinking about drinking (caught myself doing it again when we went out for takeout - if these were different times I would be insisting we went somewhere with alcohol, I mean it's just a drink with dinner).

Relaxation -- I can give myself that by, you know, relaxing. I'm one of those people who feels like I'm being lazy if I'm not doing something productive at all times. It's definitely working against me right now.

A relief from tension -- followed by a dramatic worsening of it upon waking up hungover. Counterproductive.

Not having to think -- I have a very thinky job. All I do is think, make decisions, and advise other people on their decision-making all day. I love it, but it's exhausting, and all I want to do at the end of the day is not think anymore. Again ... I can achieve this perfectly well without alcohol by giving myself permission to just ... do something that doesn't require thinking.

Fun -- over the past few months, drinking has only been fun about 10% of the time. Shitty odds for such a high-calorie activity.

It's been roughly one month now of my 100% for-suresies-this-time-no-joke recovery, and to be perfectly blunt, my boyfriend of a little over a year and a half has been nothing but an absolute nightmare about it. I am an extremely emotional person and keep things to myself in the extreme, which is why I led myself to developing a problem with drinking to escape. Yes, I had this problem before I started dating my boyfriend. Yes, our relationship led me to continue using alcohol as an escape as opposed to getting sober.

With that being said, every single day he has told me just how horrible I was when I drank. Some days it's just the off-hand ""Oh but the last time I did this, you did Y because you were drunk!"" comment, and others, a good majority of others, it's hours-long conversations about how horrible I was, how mean I was, how I did X, Y, and Z, how I killed all his motivation, how I make him feel dead inside, etc. I understand I said and did things that were very hurtful to him. I understand that apart of getting sober is paying for all the wrongs you did while drunk.

What I want to know is... at what point is it enough punishment? It feels largely that now I am 100% sober, he is using this as an opportunity to make everything in the past that has happened my fault. He is currently going through a depression (which he does every... three months or so, and naturally, all of his depressions were caused by me), and so I understand and I think I have been very good at taking my punishment while remaining sober.

I understand I need to pay for what I did while I made the decision to drink, and I do not want it to come off as me trying to avoid taking responsibility and accountability. What I do know is that I need love and support right now, not punishment and recreating history to make me this horrible terrible monster who is to blame for literally everything in his life. Yes, I have told him this. He said he would be more supportive, and promptly went back to the digs and the monolithic rampages about my past behaviour. When I break down and cry and sob because I feel so guilty (which is as frequently as when he does this, so at least every other day at this point), he just tells me to stop crying. He says I am using tears as a way to avoid taking responsibility for what I've done, that I'm trying to manipulate him into no longer being upset so he would comfort me when really I should be comforting him, and I understand, but I also don't think I'm doing that. In all honesty, I think I am doing what I always do and putting others' needs above my own and internalizing my needs for support and loving care because I know I deserve the mistreatment all the while dealing with these things rather than turning to my past crutch, alcohol.

In fact, TL;DR: At what point does punishment become mistreatment? When should it end? What is a healthy amount of punishment for one's own behaviour? Does anyone else have a similar story?",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.605793}"

Promethazine is an anti-histamine. So my doc just basically prescribed me a stronger form of Benadryl for alcohol withdrawal management. I’m very confused about this and wondered if this is a common approach?",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5678669}"

Here's my story.,"I need your help and support. I binge drink to control unbearable anxiety, and for so many other reasons that I'll summarize here, including that it helps with creativity. It does so much for me. How can sobriety help me to function? How can it help with anxiety? Of all the drugs I've tried (prescription-only, aside from drinking), only alcohol takes the fear away and helps me feel normal and able to relax. I have severe post-traumatic stress disorder. I have virtually no support network. I can't afford therapy. Alcohol helps me to feel emotionally connected with people. I pay closer attention to what they say. I feel comfortable and socially connected. I'm a friendly drunk, and ambitious. I catch up on emails with friends. Writing becomes fluid, easy. I can imagine happier futures. My imagination goes into overdrive. I set new goals (even if they later prove to be wildly ambitious and unrealistic when I'm sober again). I don't even get hangovers. What's not to love about this drug?

I drank as a teenager, got blackout drunk once, and cut my hair short as a reminder that I wanted to stop drinking. I took up the habit again in my mid-twenties when I met a significant other who was an alcoholic. Now I'm spending hundreds of dollars a month on alcohol. I binge drink. I can drink a 12 pack of beer in a single evening. A bottle of wine and a half. Then I'll do it again the next day. Entire days, even a week, can go by without severe anxiety, which means no drinking and no cravings for alcohol. But when the anxiety is back, I drink, and when I'm drinking, all I can think about is drinking more tomorrow. I get really afraid at the idea of running out.

I've made horrible decisions under the influence, though. Messaging exes, almost hooking up for casual sex when I'd never do that while sober, ordering hundreds of dollars of stuff I don't need from Amazon, and needing extra time to catch up on university assignments because I've spent entire days drinking. I let people manipulate me into doing things I'd ordinarily never do. I send bizarre and entirely inappropriate messages and emails to people on social media. I write emails and essays that are only barely coherent. I've lost friendships. I've lost job offers when I left drunken voicemail messages. I've damaged my reputation beyond repair.

But the upsides always seem to cancel those out.

I need all the help and support I can get. I want to become sober, but with everything I've said, it looks impossibly intimidating. Can anyone relate to any of this? What are your thoughts?",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46020627}"

I think I've finally resigned to the fact that I can never drink again.  And I'm actually okay with that.

Looking back at my past attempts I think I knew I was going to drink again from day one.  I would take a break and then a few weeks or even a few months down the line I'd somehow convince myself that I'd be able to moderate.  But I never could, it would always escalate.

Life's been pretty good these past 100 days.  I'm finally running again, making art, getting certifications for my career, and playing guitar again.  I would hardly touch these activities while I was drinking.  It's amazing how much time I seem to have now. Admittedly it has not been all butterflies and rainbows. But that's life and it feels good to take on my problems head on rather than ignoring them and drinking to distract myself.  That was not a sustainable lifestyle.

I don't really have much to say, I mostly lurk here but wanted to make a post for my 100.  Even lurking has been pretty beneficial though.  It helps to know that I'm not alone on this journey.

I haven't had a day where I did not drink since January. I am an ""essential worker"" in construction, and I live alone. I often get my groceries while I am working when we are working on a grocery store, and at this time, I also make sure I have enough alcohol. 

 I typically drink:

On a weekday: 1-3 beers, or 1 beer and a few shots of hard liquor like vodka or tequila, or an entire bottle of wine. What is more common in the 1-3 beers or the beer and some shots.

On a weekend: an entire bottle of champagne and a beer or two in the evening, or 1-5 beers throughout the day, or a bottle of wine and a beer.

I used to drink until I got drunk, so I have ceased purchasing hard liquor. I have not been drunk for two weeks now, just buzzed or tipsy. 

However, I realize that this is still unhealthy, and it bothers me that I cannot resist the urge to drink. I cannot even go a single day without drinking. I think it has to do with a routine. I am so used to coming home after work and cracking open a beer and settling down to play video games or watch TV. Sometimes, I will even drink a beer instead of water while working out on my elliptical. 

How do I break this routine? It is difficult for me to go out and keep busy with the quarantine, so do you guys have any ideas for how I can motivate myself to redirect my desire to unwind with a beer/drink?

I also apologize if this post is not allowed and I was supposed to first reference a master list of introductory posts. I am just so desperate for help. I have no self control.

Edit: I want to add that I am definitely a functional alcoholic. I rarely get hung over or experience any side effects from my drinking other than just not sleeping well or weight gain. It has not interfered with work, family, friends, or caused me any legal issues yet.

I have a good job, my bills are paid and I own a house. (I’m 25, and I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished so far... mostly)

I’ve been drinking every weekend since I was 18/19. 
At one point I was drinking every night, for probably almost two years. 
I realized that was “wrong” and stopped that but still justified my binge drinking on the weekends. 
 
Of course over time my tolerance increased and the negative memories of drinking outweighed the positive. Blacking out, getting sick more than people realized, hiding how many drinks I actually had, making excuses when someone called me out for being “tipsy”... you name it. 

I no longer want to be that person. I don’t want booze to have that hold over me anymore. 
In the past I’ve tried to cut back or even switch to something not as strong to slow myself down but with no success. 

No one around me told me I had a problem because from the outside I seem put together but maybe just like to drink a little too much.

I’ve never voiced these things to anyone before...and maybe reddit isn’t the best place. Who knows. 

I’ve found the book The Naked Mind by Annie Grace and so far it’s speaking to me on so many levels. I know people have mixed feelings about this book and I’m just wondering if any of you have any opinions on it? 

Thanks for listening to me ramble. This is all new territory for me.

Over the past 3 years I have quit for short periods of time but also drank heavier when I was drinking. Lately I went way too heavy and was a mess. HAD to stop for good this time. 

Day one, wasn't too bad just very high anxiety and in the evening I got the shakes and sweat very heavy all night and did not sleep at all. Started to think I saw things and heard things. 

Day two, by far the worst for me. Sweat so bad all day, at times could not walk I was so shaky, was terrified and hearing things that were not there. I could not eat and could not sleep even for a minute during the day. Heart racing and anxiety really high. I'm only sharing to be of help to others because reading other experiences on here has been so helpful to me, I don't mean to scare anyone. The good part though I finally slept a little that night although woke with bad shakes occasionally

Day three, finally started to calm down. Dove into work (from home) and that helped me power through the anxiety and sweating. I really focused and did breathing exercises and finally ate a little. Then slept pretty good last night but did wake up to hearing things that were not there again. 

Day 4 - just started but I woke up with really red skin like I got sun burnt. It was mostly on my face. Red eyes too, and I think I look a little or a lot jaundice-y. Also upper right quarter where liver is located is definitely sore. 

Has anyone else had the red skin and eyes? Any advice to remedy this? Also any diet advice - my appetite is still zero.

We went traveling with our boyfriends last summer, and the four of us were a really great fit, so I mentioned we should all go again.

We started talking about destinations, and the Swiss Alps came up. I was really excited by that idea, especially all the beautiful hikes we could go on. But then my friend pointedly mentioned that she and her boyfriend would want to drink quite a bit. She didn't phrase it as a question, but I got the sense she was asking if I would be sober for this holiday. Not wanting to be a downer, I agreed that we'd definitely have to explore the pubs - I didn't say whether or not I'd be drinking, but I suppose I made it sound like I would. She seemed relieved by this, and we talked more about all the places we could go.

This conversation was very interesting to me. I get the sense that she would be very disappointed if we all went on holiday and I chose not to drink. She's been around me multiple times where I've gone out to the bar with big groups and not drank, but it still really bothers her. I don't *think* I'm a downer when I'm sober; I'm naturally quite bubbly and talkative with or without alcohol. I maybe just go home a bit earlier when sober. But I don't think she'd really want me on a holiday with her if I'm not boozing.

That's fine, of course. Everyone has their own preferences. It was just very enlightening for me. I am still 100% committed to my sobriety, and so excited to experience vacations without the added expense of alcohol and the associated hangovers. It's just clear that she and I will not be holidaying together, unless she accepts that I don't want to drink.

There are things we have to say goodbye to when we choose to live sober lives. Yes, I'm letting go of the idea of holidays with this friend. I'm saying goodbye to wild party nights, wine tastings, pub crawls. I'm also saying goodbye to hangovers, blackouts, hazy memories, regrets, hurting my loved ones, wasting my life on booze.

And in exchange for these goodbyes, I'm getting a fuller, richer life: one full of clear memories, genuine connection, real laughter, early mornings doing yoga and drinking coffee, more money, more time with those I love doing things that feed my soul.

I can't deny that I do lose out on some things with sobriety. But the benefits FAR outweigh the drawbacks, in my opinion.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\**

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\*

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\*

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn’t:\*\*

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

US—Night/Early Morning

Europe—Morning

""Positive affirmations release me from negativity, fear, worry and anxiety"".

I'm still discovering what causes my mind to think about alcohol. I have found that triggers are kept at bay with positive affirmations. If I think that I want to drink I stand and say out loud ""I will not drink with you today"". 

If I can look at myself in the mirror while I say it, my confidence soon returns and I know that I've got the strength and ability NOT to drink.

How do you deal with triggers?

* Weighing the likelihood of being too drunk to drive, and leaving my car behind because I am wrong again.
* Going grocery shopping with a buzz because I am scared of running out of alcohol.
* Losing hours to auto-pilot. Forgetting what I did, what I said, and when I went to bed. Risking life-threatening action because my brain is shut off.
* Wasting mornings, entire weekends, and sometimes workdays recovering from a night of drinking.
* Worrying I will still be drunk when I get to work or attend a morning event.
* Neglecting or ignoring my friends because I'm trying to get my next drink.
* Going to the bathroom and concession stand multiple times per quarter/period/inning when I'm attending a sporting event.

One of my ex's birthdays was a couple days ago, and I finally let her know the news. She was ecstatic.

I'm 32 days off the sauce. Glad I did it.  I've been lucky, so far, it hasn't been too difficult (especially compared to some of the stories I've seen. I never really hit ""rock bottom,"" but knew I needed to quit). I've had intermittent cravings which mercifully subsided without too much struggle. That's including the context of living in a situation with roommates who drink, and used to be my good drinking buddies.  While there, I managed to slip into new habits, and was still able to hang with them while they enjoyed the sauce. NDB. But I've recently made a transition (for work) to another place that I associate with drinking - and it's like I have to re-adjust all over again. 

The move was very stressful, and I've been under a lot of pressure with work, and isolated in a temporary quarantine.  I find myself thinking, ""Man, it'd be really nice to have a drink right now."" a lot more often then I had during the first few weeks of quitting. 

Luckily I don't have easy access to the drink for now. So that helps. I think I'll be able to get over it, but it still sucks. I'm committed this time. I am, however, having a lot of trouble finding alternative ways that effectively ""take the edge off"" of my stress levels. I meditate. I read more. I try to get work done. I hike. I see a therapist. I drink a lot of nice teas. But I still always feel like there is something missing - and that's really the most salient part. 

Anyone else notice a sort of craving reset with transitions into new situations, or new old situations? Thoughts about getting past the ""emptiness I used to fill with booze?""

The same year I met my (now ex) husband and we were together for 12 years. Now, at 34, I find I am extremely emotionally stunted. I am incredibly immature. They say you stop aging around the time you begin abusing alcohol (or something like that?) and I definitely believe that is the case for me. To add to the mental delay, my ex was my first ever partner, so exiting that relationship leaves me with no understanding of men and how to have adult encounters. I navigate dating as if I am still that 20 year old child. I am full of lust and excitement. I draw men in with impulsivity. I seek validation. I fawn over men like a young girl would. “Wow! He has hair on his chest! What a man!” This isn’t how a grown woman should act.
I am naturally a very emotional person. Not sensitive, per say, but very open and vulnerable. I am empathetic to a fault. Unable to manage my emotions and unable to manage my life I have used alcohol to keep myself from having to work through life.
Lately I have been beating myself up over being such “young” 34 year old. I have neglected to care for my body. I’m small and thin but I am not healthy. Bills, shopping, career, relationships, these important duties of life are very messy right now. I feel I am just now learning how to grow up and be on my own, and it can be very embarrassing.

I wish I could just be the occasional drinker - but I think that ship has sailed for me. Pretty much my health is demanding that I cut it out (high blood pressure), and my spouse has some pretty strong feelings about it too. I’ve been scared to just abruptly stop because of the jump in my blood pressure - and before the quarantine, (when I had a schedule and places to be that really made me happy) I was tapering pretty well - then boom. I read that a taper really needs to be 10-14 days.

But here’s the problem - I’m not tapering. I’m so sick of all of this crap - that the “escape” I get in the evening is something I definitely look forward to. But I get that this “escape” is really a lie - life is still here - exactly the same - and I’m damaging my body and relationships.

I got the info on tapering online on a medical website (very reputable one) - and the way I was doing it before the quarantine was each day buying the little bottles - reducing by one every three days. My spouse is not thrilled about the idea of my buying daily like that (people judging me? I’m not sure - I could just rotate stores). I was about three days from (I think) being able to safely stop, then BAM! I’m furloughed from the job that had been my dream for years.

So now I’m here - knowing that both my health, my relationships and the job that I will be able to go back too in a month or so could all be in jeopardy if I don’t stop. I don’t know how.

Add to that, I’m kind of angry that this is how it is. I totally get that I’m feeling sorry for myself - but I’m so lost right now.

I realised in the last couple days that I'm an alcoholic. I've been living at home with my parents during quarantine, and my drinking has started to pick up more since I was laid off from work. I had to quit smoking weed because after 8 years it reached the point where it does nothing but bring me terrible anxiety. Alcohol on the other hand has the same effect every time, which makes it easier to have on the same basis I used to smoke (not really an appropriate replacement). I have this thing where if I drink but don't get drunk, I just get depressed, which basically motivates me to always drink to get drunk. At first I really liked the way reduced my anxiety, and made me feel more socially comfortable, but that freeing feeling has turned into crutch.

My parents are casual drinkers, and they've been having the occasional drink more frequently since we're all living at home lately. They tend to offer me a drink when they're making theirs and that's given me an excuse to drink virtually every day. I realised in the last few days that I can't moderate my drinking and it has become one of the only things I look forward to each day.
I bought a bottle of Glenfiddich whiskey yesterday to replace the one I bought, to replace the one I finished off that my parents had in their cabinet. That sentence alone makes me wonder how I didn't see sooner, but I finished that new bottle in two nights after sharing less than a tenth of it with my parents (it was supposed to be for all of us).

I joked with my mom that day I was going to finish the whole bottle, which slightly worried her seeing as we've talked about my consumption before. I didn't realise how quickly I was drinking it until there was less than an inch left in the bottle which I proceeded to finish and hide. The weird thing is that even now knowing it's a problem I'm still worried I'll continue this routine, and will go so far as to seek out the means to keep it up even if that's not what I want. I'm trying to figure out what the next step is, seeing as we're currently in the midst of a pandemic and AA meetings of more than 10 (so I've heard) aren't an option right now.

I kept telling myself once I finally got out of my miserable job I would stop, once I moved in with my boyfriend and I wasn’t left to my own devises I would be forced to stop, once I had a steady 9-5 job and structure I would stop. But I didn’t. And one day I just decided enough is enough, this is going to ruin my life if I don’t stop now. 

I admitted it to my mom and to my boyfriend. To my surprise they have both been very supportive. I will admit my boyfriend is under the impression this has only been going on for 6 months or so and doesn’t seem to grasp the seriousness. He thinks if I take a break for a while I will reset myself and work on only drinking socially from there on out. As hopeful as that sounds, I fear that is unrealistic. I would love nothing more than to be like him and only drink when with friends. 

Luckily I am not having any physical withdrawals. Today I reached out to a therapist that specializes in depression and anxiety and I hope to book an appointment ASAP. 

Also, I moved to a different state to be with my boyfriend and all of my friends are friends he already had. And the only time we hang out is on the weekends to go to bars. I don’t know how I would even begin to navigate that. I don’t have any other friends and don’t know how to make them quite frankly. I’m very shy and my coworkers aren’t people I see as potential friends. 

I’m so scared. Scared I will lose my boyfriend. Scared I will be forced to move back to my home state and start my life all over again. Scared that I won’t be able to do this on my own and will have to go to rehab, exposing my dirty little secret to everyone. 

I’m absolutely terrified. And mad at myself. How could I let this happen? I have an amazing boyfriend, apartment, and job. And I see that all slipping away at any given moment. I don’t want to give up socially drinking. That scares me too. I am having an incredibly difficult time concentrating on work and have been thinking about how scared I am literally 24/7. I’m scared my work performance has gone down. I’m not sleeping at all. I have no appetite I’m so riddled with anxiety. I had my first ever panic attack yesterday when I started thinking about all of this. 

Most of all I am scared of losing my boyfriend. We’ve been together 5 years and he is way too good for me. He’s incredibly smart, charismatic, funny, and he’s my best friend.

I’ve done longer bouts in the past, but this time I am committing. I feel better when I’m sober and I regret that I didn’t stick with it sooner; my longest bout sober was my first one, in 2017, and it’s crazy to think I could have three years under my belt if I had chosen differently.

This is my plan to stay sober:

1. Be open with my family and friends. Shame thrives in secrecy, and shame leads me to drink.
2. Be active in the mornings. I lift weights and just started running. I have a bike that I used to ride every day and I miss it. I am so much better off mentally and emotionally when I do something active in the mornings. If I'm having an off day, a walk with the dog or a yoga video on YouTube are enough.
3. Keep seltzer in the house. I was feeling guilty about how much La Croix I was buying, but you know what, it's worth it to have something I can grab when I really want a cold drink. I keep a lot of herbal tea around, too. My favorite is Teecino.
4. Reread ""This Naked Mind"" or other books about the negative effects of alcohol during the holidays, when I have started drinking again in the past. Read this sub when I feel the desire creeping back in. Continue to keep a folder of quotes that resonate with me about sobriety/quitting. Follow sober people on IG and other social media.
5. Go to a Zoom SMART Recovery or AA meeting. I am super nervous about this but I hear it helps. So, I'll give it a try. Possibly Al-Anon too, my parents were alcoholics and it definitely impacted my life.
6. Pour out the booze. I used to be a mixologist and I have about a dozen fancy, expensive bottles of liquor in the house that I've been carting around for...at least six years, holy cow. Time for them to go.
7. Check in with my ""I Am Sober"" app every day. I have iOS and this app has been really great. You make a pledge in the morning with a reminder about why you're doing this, get a little motivational quote, and then you can review the day at the end of the day. I really like it.
8. Take it one day at a time. I'm not going to waste time thinking about ""Well what if I go back to France and I get to go to the Loire Valley"" like...I am in quarantine in the Midwest. If I magically find myself with a plane ticket to Paris I'll deal with it then. I was lucky enough to go there once before and I was really into the whole cafe gourmand thing, so, pretty sure I could find other things to enjoy.
9. Give myself permission to have a hard time. I definitely drank to deal with shit. I will strive to be kind to myself while I find new ways to deal with shit.
10. Post on here! Hi guys. I have been lurking for a very long time, but that's not enough anymore. I am going to hold myself accountable by posting on this sub. Thank you for being here.

Every day, most days until black out drunk.  I hit bottom about 3 months ago. My wife of 10 years decided she had enough.  We separated for about two of the months.  I still continued to drink the same way I always did.  I decided  12 days ago to look in the mirror   I was drunk of course.  I hated the man that I have become.  I decided that my mission in life will be become a good man. A man that will have a softer heart, a kinder side that people want around.

See when you are always drunk like my self you distance your self from everyone.  I believed that it would help me hide my addiction   But I didn't realize I wasn't the one choosing to distance my self  Everyone else was.   I found my self all alone at my lowest point in life.  It really resonates deep into your soul  when you think to your self if I died right now how long before any one even looks for me.

To the average person I am considered to be doing good   I was a high level functioning alcoholic  I choose 3 yrs ago to join the fire services  In one of the most dangerous cities in the country. Then I decided to move to a station with .5 miles of one of the most dangerous intersections in the country.  I loved the intense pace  I have put consequence to the side many times entering building on fire or entering well know gang houses for medical emergencies.  This was nothing new I always decided to put my life in danger when I decided that I was fine to drive "" no ones gonna tell me what I can and cant do.""  

Well last night we had one of the most horrific car wrecks I have ever seen   two out of the three people died.  But not before I talked to them,  I spoke to all of them and decided who needed the most immediate care.  The person we chose was highly intoxicated   she smelt of booze 20 feet away  she was in terrible shape.  As I talked to another patient she told me she was fine   she told me was so drunk she couldn't feel anything.  Good for her because shes the only one that lived   but she was also in very bad shape.

And really it shouldn't be, for me at least. I've got 530 days under my belt, but during quarantine I have wanted to drink SO BAD. My wife still drinks (in moderation), all my friends drink etc. All the people I know have really been letting loose during quarantine and drinking extra, sometimes I really just want to give in.

But it's not the alcohol specifically I want to give in to. I just want to let go of all the pressure I feel right now. You see, more than a year ago before the quarantine began, i quit my full time job to focus on contract work. Of course I couldn't have predicted the quarantine, and now I am looking for a full time job, and of course they are nowhere to be found. The few companies that are hiring are moving very slow, and have super stressful interview process (i work in tech.) All interviewing is remote right now too, which is super fucking hard.

And more than that, i just have this fucking cloud of dread over me all the fucking time. Like, things are just going horribly and everything sucks. I spent the better part of last year in therapy and worked on a lot of these things, including depression and anxiety. so I have some tools to fall back on.

HOWEVER THE THING that really fucking gets me is this... how god DAMNED lucky I am. So I am so worried about my contract work right? Well get this, my contract job is willing to give me MORE hours right now. So technically that's going fine. I just sold a property (my old house) and made a good amount of money. I have a ton of money in the bank. I have an INCREDIBLE family. I AM SOBER AND NOT DRINKING. I am in the best shape of my life. I have an incredible relationship with my partner. for all intents and purposes my life is so fucking great.

And yet I just can't shake this dread, like something horrible is just happening all the time. I. CANNOT. SHAKE. IT.

My main focus is to lose weight. I know how to do this, I’ve done it before. A huge part of any diet is to abstain from alcohol, which is kind of an added benefit for me because I’m a fucking alcoholic that really has a hard time coming to terms with my problem. 

So I didn’t exactly start with this plan on the very day the country (USA) shut down. I had to get a couple good weeks of glutenous behavior under my belt first. Day after day waking up feeling the same way I do right now. I’m writing this to give myself something to look back on the next time a ‘holiday’ or celebration  comes around to think long and hard before picking up that first drink.

After about a month of hardcore dieting and exercise, I’m just now starting to see some [tiny] positive results physically and going as long without a drink has worked wonders. My sleeping schedule has drastically improved, I think I’m generally in a better mood, I have more energy and actually excited to get some exercise. I guess yesterday was just a test.

Cinco de Mayo. On a fucking Tuesday. It only took one tiny little thought. I can take a day off from my diet. I can have a margarita or two. I’ll make them with fresh lime juice and won’t add any extra sugar so they won’t even be that bad for me. I *deserve* to enjoy myself after all of this hard work I’ve been doing. Poor me. I never get to have any fun anymore. I DEMAND these margaritas. It will be a nice little treat to let go of all my strict self imposed guidelines. I might even fuck around and eat some chips and guac too. 

And just like that it was settled. I drank last night. Like I usually do. I didn’t say always because like many of you I’m sure, I can and have had the ability to just have a drink or two and be sensible. But not last night. Last night I was kind of working against myself. It was my one day to cheat that meant I had to make it count! So I did. I drank until I couldn’t keep my eyes open. A proper fiesta. Olé.

Waking up this morning, even earlier than I usually do, I remember vividly why giving up drinking was the very best part of this diet program I started a month ago. This has turned into quite an essay and if you are reading it I hope you’re enjoying it. My head is still throbbing as I write, though it’s calmed down considerably since my moment of inspiration. I am tired, I want sloppy greasy FOOD, I don’t want to get out of bed for the rest of the day. One little thought led me here to the worst version of me that, very easily at any time, could once again become my normal. 

It’s easy right now to say this because I have a program in place to get back to and I have to work extra hard for the rest of the week to make up for last nights tomfoolery. It is important for me to acknowledge, however, that all it took was one little thought. I have these little thoughts all the time but this diet has been an easy way to overpower them lately. I am committed to sticking with this routine until I reach my goal weight. But how about after that? And before that, the next time a cause for celebration roles around? Mother’s Day? Labor Day? Fourth of July? My birthday? 

My birthday is in the middle of July and last year it was the catalyst of completely derailing a personal program nearly identical to the one I’m currently enlisted. Today is pretty similar to the day after my birthday last year. So I have more small thoughts and decisions ahead of me. I’m not worried. If you’ve gotten this far you can probably get the bigger picture: I’m confident in my self discipline ...for now.

I have written the 100 day sober posts, counted days, celebrated milestones and yet, I am back at the beginning. I am a 40 year old mother to three who has struggled for most of the last two decades with her relationship with alcohol. I have been hesitant to use the word alcoholic but I will say that my relationship with alcohol is toxic and if it were a person, it would no longer be in my life. Last year 2018-2019 I took the biggest break from alcohol for me personally (4 months from December - Easter). In 2019-2020, I took another break from December-March until a friend offered me a pandemic cocktail and since that day in March, I have justified how I can and should be able to have a cocktail (or three) like everybody else. Today, I need some new encouragement from this community to begin again after a fall. 

My relationship with alcohol looks like this: A few drinks in the evening with my husband, depending on the night can get to 2-3 because right or wrong, it slows us both down and we connect and I shed the stress of the day. These drinks are me making a deal with the devil - I know I will pay the price. Inevitably, I will wake up between 2-3am in a vicious SHAME spiral (I know all about why this happens and have read the Naked Mind, along with many quit lit books). I know better and I don't need to be convinced of all the reasons to quit or the science behind it, I know why. I find myself here, anyways, making the shame spirals worse. The next day, I feel depressed and low, disappointed with the broken promises to myself, knowing full well that it doesn't have to be this way. I think maybe I should search the internet again for another influencer, program, trick, tip, quit lit book, something to pull me out of this thing called relapse? But I know deep in my heart the answers aren't out there, they are in me.

For the last two years I have seen a therapist who has been a big help but also isn't specialized in addictions. She would try to get me to reframe my relationship with alcohol as ""taking breaks from it"" and then coming back. She saw me during my breaks when I was in a healthy mental space and during the times that I drank again and was in unhealthy shame spirals and sleep-deprived and anxious from my 3am wake ups. She has said she doesn't think I could ever become an alcoholic because of how bad it bothers me (whatever that means) - either way, what really matters is that my relationship with alcohol is incredibly unhealthy and it takes up more space in my life than I care to give and I can't afford to beat myself up over and over again (not now, not ever). 

Like many of you, I have questioned moderation and played around with it but failed. I still maintain that I would rather not drink than have just one. Having one is like putting wax paper under your butt and getting on a metal slide that dumps you out right here at the bottom. It might take days, weeks, months, but there will be a bottom. 

And, so here I am. According to Einstein, The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Last time around, counting sober days seemed suffocating to me, not liberating. Right now I need the encouragement to not let this define me. The hypocrisy and broken promises to myself are heavy and weigh me down immensely. It's hard not to look at others on their journeys and think that their path was linear. That's what is hard about so many of the quit lit books, it makes it seem like one day they decided to quit, so they did and then they wrote a book.

A little over a month ago I realized I was dependent on alcohol. The first time I noticed withdrawal - felt really confused n had really hazy thinking. I drank to stop the symptoms, then fell back into my heavy binge drinking. About 3 weeks ago, spending time with a friend, they said they didnt wanna drink that day. Next morning my body was incredibly sore, had a mild fever/disgusting night sweats and I started developing twitching/having body jerk movements. Honestly I thought I had tetanus (week prior I obtained a nasty abrasion in a old building drunk exploring with friends). I spoke to a physician over the phone n said it's most likely AWS and to come to the hospital to get some help, but I never went. 

I figured I could control everything with benzos. I also have had serious benzo issues, lol. The first week I didnt drink, but then I fell off the bandwagon. Mixing alcohol and benzos isnt going so well for me and I feel completely out on control. Yesterday I had ~1.5mg of Xanax in my system and was still shaking a couple hours after the dose, it subsided after a drink though... The one drink turned into idk how many n then I was sitting watching anime with double vision. 

At this point, I am at a loss on how to cope. I dont have health insurance. I'm depressed n distressed n alls I wanna do is drink n actually get high on the benzos. Not sure if it's worth it just to taper n hope for the best. At this point I'm worried I actually need a medical detox.

It's peace, it's well rested, it's teremity. Teremity is the perfect word to describe it. By context, it appears I'm using it wrong, by definition it's exactly what sobriety is.

I go to sleep on time. Lack of sleep will cause more damage to your body in a week than lack of food or water

I have a active routine. What is life without fire in your eye and passion in your heart?

Not distracted. Being black out drunk and waking up ten years later with nothing accomplished is no fun. Being sober and remembering what you went to the kitchen for is admirable.

I'm hydrated. My body is 80% water, drinking withers that away. 

I'm full of air. Ten second of conscious, mindful breathing will take away some of the anxious thoughts.

The burning desire, in the moment, to drink will go away, eventually. Did it go away yet? No. Wait ten minutes. Not yet? Wait another ten. Rinse and repeat.

I drink coffee. Have you noticed how awesome that stuff is and how it makes you feel? My god, that might be my next addiction (just kidding!)

I'm goal oriented. ""Without a destination in my GPS, somehow I always end up at a liquor store. Strange?""

I value those closest to me and don't crave others. My mom and wife were the ones who bailed me out of jail and got me some food, and my drinking buddies were magically too busy to help me move when I got kicked out of my apartment, because I couldn't afford a roof and a lawyer 🤷‍♂️
 
My people skills are a by product. I was too embarrassed to be around and talk to my family when I drank because they'd always smell it on me.

In order to have a good day I have to use my words.
whether it's talking to myself or others. Sobriety didn't fix my problems, but it gave me a clear mind to talk it out and face them 

Being mindful and present. Time is the most valuable commodity.

Complain if u must. Just know it doesn't provide a solution, but it's proof than your brain is looking for one.

SELF COMPASSION. The last thing a man needs is to be reminded of, is how weak willed or how stupid he is for failing, it'll only make the problem stronger. the world is going to judge you enough, they don't need your help, trust me here.

Me time is necessary. When you get some alone time, reflect and write all the wonderful things drinking did for you, and then write all the bad things sobriety did for you. Then throw away that blank sheet of paper.

Read quality books. It's easier to do when you don't have double vision.

I'm Not overwhelmed. Ok, you're stressed. Now what? Pick something. One thing. Fix it. You'd be surprised at the relief fixing one thing can bring. Planning and execution leads to fulfillment 

Im rich....ok not really. Drinking was stealing my money, health, confidence and courage. I never saw 5 figures in my savings account until I stopped drinking. Not bragging, but it's just a glimpse of all the money I used on booze

Lastly, Dedicate time to people who deserve it and who make you feel good. We, as drinkers, addicts, recoverers, or whatever you call yourself, are easily influenced by our surroundings. Change your surroundings, you change your habits.

Not a single drop. Im so bloody proud of myself, i really didnt think that just commiting to myself, and putting my mind to it would work. Well ill be fucking damned **it did!**

Yesterday i would have normally had a tripple vodka at lunch time, because ""you can have a drink at lunch and not feel bad about it"" and then at 5 when i finished work i would have cracked open my first pint cant of Kronenburg, followed by the other three cans. I wouldnt ever keep more than 4 cans in the house to not tempt myself to drink more than that. However then i would have a ""fun"" drink after the beers, maybe a tripple gin and lemonade or a tripple vodka and fizzy orange. I mean its not another beer so it doesnt matter right. 

Didnt do any of that, and im planning on doing the same thing all over again today. One thing i did find was i really was struggling at lunch, so i had a lemonade in a tall glass with loads of ice and sipped on that. Totally worked just having a cool glass to grab and sip out of passed the time. 

So if your reading this and today is your day number 1, and you totally dont think you can do it.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\*

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\*

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn’t:\*\*

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

""A day with ice-cream is better than a day with alcohol"".

I love ice-cream. It has been my go-to thing when I've been craving a drink. I swapped booze for an air-filled swirly blob of cream and sugar.

I know its not perfect, and I am aware of the problems from eating too much sugar.

Thankfully, the cravings are a lot fewer in number than they were a couple of months ago. I'm now weaning myself off the sugary creamy goo.

I believe that each step forwards will lead to better health, better wellbeing and a better mental state.

Understanding cravings and doing something to distract from them is really helping me stay sober.

What is your most effective way of dealing with the cravings?

I “quit” binging years ago and I met my wife after that darkest part of my life. We’ve been married for two incredible years now and I’m so in love with this woman and the life we’re building. 

Ive been handling my affair with alcohol so well that my wife doesn’t even know that I am an addict. I have been playing the casual drink game for years and I have gotten pretty good at it. I am able to go out with friends to have one or two drinks (which is so opposite of my habits— I usually can’t stop until I blackout) I actually convinced myself that I don’t have problem and that my issues were just an affect of a younger me.

I was wrong. Lately, I have been finding excuses to buy booze. Which for most, should be fine. My issue is, I cannot stop drinking once I’ve started. I used to be able to, but I’m losing control. I’m reverting back to my old self- the one who destroys everything. 

I’m getting really scared because I thought I had control but I’m really losing it. In the last week, I have done and said some incredible, terrible things to my wife and have done so many things that I severely regret. I’m destroying my relationship and I don’t know how to stop.

She still doesn’t know I have a problem- she’s attributing my terrible behavior to quarantine. But I know the truth. She bought me a six pack last time she went to the store and said “that should last a few weeks” I drank all six in 30 minutes and have been secretly replacing the beer all week (3 times) so she doesn’t realize. I also started covertly buying hard liquor again (I haven’t done that in 4 years) and am drinking it in secret. 

I am so ashamed. Today, she went to stay with her friend because of some nasty things I said to her. I know I’m fucking this relationship up and I know I’m killing myself. But what did I do the moment she walked out? I bought booze. And I drank all of it. And then I drunkenly stumbled back to the liquor store and bought more. This time, I also bought cigarettes (which I quit one year ago).

I know I’m ruining my life again. And I tried so so hard to make myself ‘normal’. My first binge in three years was a week ago and I haven’t been able to stop. I have caused so much damage in the last week that I don’t know if I can repair my former life. My wife will never be able to look at me the next ay she used to. I really fucked up. And yet, she’s gone and I’m still drinking.

Please someone give me hope or advice. My life has exploded in one weak week. I want to stop. I want to go back. I want anything except for my reality.

TLDR; I’m an addict who thought they had their vice under control. I got married to someone after my darkest moments and she doesn’t know my past or that I’m an addict. I’ve been ‘controlling’ it for years. But I started binging again recently and have effectively destroyed my relationship. I thought I was strong and in control. But that was just a lie I told myself.

I’m quitting with him as well for the first few months and eventually plan on having a drink with my girlfriends every now and then, but never in front of him for as long as it takes for him to feel more comfortable around it. If it takes 6 months or 6 years, it doesn’t matter. 

I want to talk to him about attending some AA meetings just to check it out, but he’s still recovering from the scare and I honestly don’t know how to bring it up since he has hope he’ll be able to drink again one day, but after talking to the doctor I know he 100% should not drink ever. Should I offer to go with him or is that a big no-no in AA? How do I handle this?

For me, it has always been binge drinking, or at least that is how it was at the beginning. Typical start, weekend drinking to excess and barely remembering the night.

Throughout university I was known for drinking, being a drunk when we were partying. What people didn't know is I was drinking by myself before we would even meet up, I couldn't feel confident without prepping myself this way.

After university, I suffered a traumatic death in the family. This actually stopped me from drinking for a while, not because it was related to alcohol, but because it crippled me with panic attacks and PTS so bad amazingly alcohol wasn't even a thought.

I moved out of the country and didn't drink very much for a good 7 months, the fear of the anxiety attacks I would have after drinking kept me sober.

However, I then moved to an entirely new country, I lived alone, I wasn't working and there was a bar on every street. I began drinking a lot, every other day, maybe 2 days in a row if I could. I'm a bar fly, I would drink at home but then I'd have to get out, once I had the buzz. I just wanted to sit in a bar and slam beers, alone was preferred, but if I was already drunk I was open to the random bar company and 'friend' making that happened from time to time.

I became pretty low but rallied myself, didn't drink and moved country again for a new job.

The new job kept me focused in the week so a became a Friday night binger again, regretting it every Saturday.

I'm now currently at a new job in a new country in East Asia. I've been here for about 3 years. I got drunk at every free opportunity. If I don't have to be in work early I would smash beers at home skip dinner then drag myself to work the next day. Weekends I would drink Friday and Saturday night, to get drunk, always.

I ended up moving into a new apartment with my girlfriend here, she knows I drink but no idea of the level. I'm, like many others, a master at hiding it. Friday evening I would say, ""oh I have this work thing."" Or, ""I have to go see some friends."". Then I would go to a bar and just drink as many beers as I could. Make my way home and crash, try and feel half normal in the mornings. If my girlfriend was busy and out of the apartment for an afternoon or evening, I would go get beers from a shop, drink as many as I could, then dispose of the evidence before she got back. If she twigged I was a bit drunk, I'd say, ""oh my friend came around we had a couple of beers, just relaxed.""

I knew I couldn't carry this on, there is only one way this is going. I remember a couple of weeks back, lockdown video chat with the family. Everyone was chatting lots of chaos, but I heard my sister say to her husband quietly, ""I think (my name) is drunk."" I didn't say anything, not even sure if anyone else heard, but I was angry she said it, angry for no real reason because she was right, I was drunk. I guess just angry at getting caught, because I always hide it, or hide how much I have drunk. That was a bit of an eye-opener for me.

Anyway, now my main concern, being 3 days sober is the irritability I'm getting, I never argue with my girlfriend really, probably because I was always hungover or feeling guilty, or going to say, ""Hey I'm going to be out late tonight, I have this work meal."" and feeling bad.

Now I feel easily irritated, I also quit smoking as I would basically binge those with beers and the two feel too closely connected.

I know this Friday I'm going to have a crazy rush after work to just go to a bar and get drunk and start the cycle over again. But I'm going to try like hell not to!!!!!!!!

I want to change but I'm worried about the negative impacts of the changing process. It's not going to stop me from making the change, and I know ideally I shouldn't hide my 'growth progress' as I hid my problems with alcohol, but I'm going to, I know that much. So advise on stress relief and relieving that Friday rushing; "" I just want to get really drunk one last time"" feeling would be great.

Anyway, God Bless your poor mind and eyes if you read all of this, Just needed to say it somewhere. Sorry for errors, I typed this in one long rant.

I'm about 10 months sober (with a one night blip in January) and finding myself ocassionally thinking ""wouldn't it just be kind of fun to get a little buzzed with my husband for a night?"" and justifying the thought with the fact that I've made it this far, not drinking isn't that hard for me, I can just hop back on the sobriety train lickety split. I know that in reality, allowing myself one night of drinks will open the floodgates and potentiate the old behaviors and cravings again, but I'm just wondering if anyone else here has struggled with this specific breed of deception. If so, how do you handle it? For the most part I associate alcohol with ""bad"" -- I know it's poison, I know it lies to us, I know it only robs us of our natural feel-good chemicals, etc -- but there's always that niggling thought that it does feel good temporarily and fuck it, sometimes I'd rather feel that ultra-good for a moment and sacrifice the future. 

Also, a little back story: I'm mostly a binge drinker prone to blackouts but also drank ""moderately"" for years before I quit for good. Within that ""moderation"" (i.e. not blacking out, lol an alcoholics version of moderation if I ever heard it) at times I was drinking 5-8 shots a day multiple days a week, and then might go months on end only drinking on weekends or having only 1-2 nightly. So I've gone through many waves of drinking patterns on and off throughout my life.

I'm looking for some guidance on my first ever post here. I've been on this subreddit for about a year now, and it has helped me with my recovery. However, I have been drinking the past few weekends. 

I was always a binge drinker, mainly on the weekends where I'd get a 24 pack of beer and a 750ml bottle of vodka, which would all be gone by Saturday night. I never really drank during the week much, and usually don't like to stop drinking after I've started. This has been going on for about 10 years now, ever since I started drinking when I turned 20 and was in college. 

I realized it was high time for me to quit last October, so I went on a 2 month sober period, then drank over the holidays, then had a 3 month period of sobriety. Now, I've drank the past four weekends, and I want to fully give it up. I know I want to fully quit, and start my sober life. 

My question and main dilemma is that I'm turning 30 this coming Tuesday. My original plan was to have a small get-together with some family and do a cookout with drinks. Given the current situation with the quarantine, I've already stocked up on booze - so it's just sitting here in my house. 

I'm not sure what to do. On one hand, I want to start my 30s clear sober, with about a week behind me (my last drink was 05/03/20 at this time); on the other hand I want to drink what I've purchased and have one last go into oblivion. 

I know which option I should probably choose, but I can't get it out of my head. 

I've had some pretty terrible withdraw symptoms this past weekend. I was on the couch basically from Saturday evening until Monday morning, writhing with anxiety and a pounding heart. I couldn't sleep and was sweating through my sheets. I've never been to the hospital for anything alcohol related, but my past few withdraws had me closing to dialing in, and luckily it didn't come to that. 

I'm aware of the kindling effect, and understand that I likely have started (or am in the midst within) this effect. My main reason for quitting is to become the healthiest version of myself and stop spending time recovering from a binge. 

I guess I'm just looking for a suggestion, but I probably already know what to do. I know it sounds dumb, but I wanted to type it out and see if anyone had a thought.",3,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.504783}"

Yesterday there was a post about transitioning from a DUI related court mandated sobriety to choosing sobriety. 

I am scared about what will happen when I don’t “have to” not drink. I chose to stop drinking for my 2020 New Years resolution, then got pregnant almost immediately. But because of how quickly the two happened, they are somewhat intertwined in my mind. 

I am scared of suddenly having two kids, under COVID life, and the biggest barrier to my drinking gone (pregnancy). 

I am scared, is anyone else scared of their future selves? Has anyone successfully transitioned from situationally “motivated” sobriety to choosing sobriety?

However, drinking was hogging all the bandwidth in my brain.

I stopped drinking January 1st of this year as part of a general “Year of Wellness.” I had taken a long look in the mirror and had many conversations with my therapist in the fall of 2019, and recognized that I couldn’t continue on in the way I was going. 

My family has serious alcoholism issues on both sides, yet I had disregarded my parents warnings while in college and drank pretty much non-stop, as a way to have fun, cope, distract myself, etc. My friends and I always joked that “we aren’t alcoholics because we’re in college!” I gained 60 pounds over the course of four years. 

Once I graduated, I moved across the country and started my adult life with a company. The first job I had was immensely boring and required very little brain power, so I was finding myself drinking at least 12 beers while alone each weeknight and more on the weekends. I was in a haze and didn’t recognize the slippery slope for what it was.

I then got promoted and moved again, and continued my habits in the new job, which was more stressful, so my consumption increased. Marijuana was legal in this state, so I was constantly both high and drunk for two years.

My father got horribly ill last year, and I was blessed to get a transfer home to be with him. He’s doing much better now, and for that I’m grateful. 

When I moved home, my habits revealed themselves to me more evidently. I was now 150 pounds heavier than I was in high school. I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror without being disgusted by what I saw. I was afraid to go to the doctor for fear of judgment, and was continuing to drink like a fish. 

Finally, I started going to therapy and was able to recognize who I had become. And I hated it. So, in December I decided to make a change.

I’m now 5 months sober. I’ve lost 25 pounds, have more energy than ever before, so I’ve been hiking again which is something I thoroughly missed. I’ve been picking up old hobbies like my guitar and writing and am so proud of the progress made in just 5 months.

I have plenty of days where I feel completely normal, but I also have plenty of days where I am depressed for no reason at all, today being one.  On days like this there is nothing in the world that can satisfy me and all I can think is ""I just need to get through today and tomorrow will be better"".  That is the only thing I can do to make it through the day without crying multiple times.

I have also found myself over using caffeine, perhaps even abusing it at times.  The caffeine picks me up and helps me get through the day.  I have also abused it to the point my heart was racing at 135bpm while I was laying in bed consciously breathing slow and it lingers to me being sad the next day likely due to hormonal imbalances caused by the access.

I'm thankful for that. It's been a breeze for a while.

That being said, my husband and I went on our first date 13 years ago today. We usually would celebrate anniversaries by dressing up super fancy, going out to eat at a high end place, having cocktails, grabbing a couple bottles of wine, and drinking until we go to sleep. Sometimes we go out of town and stay in a fancy B&B. We can't do any of those things this year. We're going to order carry out from a nice restaurant, but it's just not the same. I'm going to dress up for the first time in a long while, but it feels like a waste of effort. It's too windy and chilly to eat outside (a picnic was my original idea), so we'll be stuck in the house.

so it's been just over a month since i've drank and i want to say some stuff, and i don't really want to talk to my drinking friends and family about ""being sober"" or whatever. i got in a really-ugly-but-injury-free accident this year after a night of partying and then while i was feeling shitty about that i had a couple nights in quarantine where i fully realized the extent of my lack of control to moderate. i've recognized this for a a few years, that i have more difficulty ending a night, or day, of drinking than my peers, but the wreck really made me take stock of my habits and gave me motivation to change. i actually imagine it's easier for me to be sober since i'm quarantine. don't get me wrong i've been tempted to drink but i've held out. going back to work, who tf knows if/when that'll be, i think is going to be more difficult since i was the cook that was always at the bar after my shift to talk shit with the bartenders/servers/regulars but i feel like the longer this goes on the stronger my resolve will be if/when i do go back, the longer the streak the more pressure to not break it n'at. to be honest... i'm not sure what my goal with dropping drinking is but i know i needed to do it right now. 

so, my problems haven't all been resolved this last month... shit, things haven't even been all that great - sleep schedule has been out of wack, i'm still mainly playing video games all day, not working out enough, all sorts of stuff. but i haven't been up until 4 am finishing bottles of whiskey, drinking all the beer in the apartment, breaking glasses, or flipping my car over a guard rail. plus i'm looking a little thinner and i'm not spending \*nearly\* as much money as i would be if i were drinking all the beer i would be if i were letting myself drink at any point during this shit.

I'm 22 and have expressed this concern to friends before, and have always been told that I'm just a ""college drinker."" I started drinking at 19 (legal age here) and recognized my drinking as problematic, but it was the volume that troubled me, not the frequency. For some reason I decided this was fine. I could go months without touching alcohol, would regularly turn it down when offered, would DD for people, and so on. But if I started, I was incapable of having just one drink. I have never had a night where I had alcohol and consumed less than 7 drinks. But the infrequency of these events convinced me that I had it under control.

A year ago, I was diagnosed with a pretty horrible chronic illness that is thankfully 100% treatable, but is life-threatening when untreated. The treatment comes with an immense amount of red tape, and on several occasions, medical/bureaucratic negligence resulted in my treatment being withheld, causing several terrifying, acute experiences in which I wound up in the hospital. I believed my illness was eventually going to kill me and that nobody was going to help me get better.

Thankfully, that didn't happen, and I am no longer disabled and am physically well. The whole experience left me pretty messed up and extremely anxious about death, and I have a lot of anxiety that my medication might cease to work. After I started to get better, I went to another party and had a few drinks. It was like a switch had flipped in my brain - suddenly I was no longer just having fun, but I clearly remember thinking ""I don't ever have to feel miserable again."" After that, it was all downhill from there. I started drinking alone, usually at least four times a week, always heavily drinking with 94 proof or worse. I started day drinking just to ""take the edge off"" when I started feeling sad or anxious. I live with my parents, and they have absolutely no idea.

In quarantine, it's even harder. I can't speak to my therapist because he is unavailable online.

All day Sunday & most of Monday, I went between hating myself & finding comfort by obsessively searching SD and all of Reddit for ""drunk shame, day 1, drunk depression, yada yada"". I feel compassion for every post & although I feel too ashamed to comment, I upvote genuinely hoping someone who can help will see & help. 

Here is where I need to confess because I'm starting to see this is where I fuck up bad. After I start feeling a little better, I find myself instead of looking for similarities in the stories & comfort & having compassion, I start finding differences & get resentful. THEN I start getting irritated on behalf of others which has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with me & I know is completely ridiculous! I see posts, which I deem in my toxicity, that should be getting more attention than others & when they don't I convince myself to be resentful towards SD. Nevermind that anytime I've posted, I've gotten just the right amount of support and attention I need to a) feel supported and b) not be overwhelmed by too much attention. Nevermind that maybe the person who posted didn't want attention or got the help they needed. I've already convinced myself who should and shouldn't be getting attention. Shameful. 

I'm putting this out because I'm hoping by admitting it out loud I can begin the work to stop this toxic cycle. I know this behavior is wrong. This behavior extends beyond SD as well.

My mom fell this morning, as she was about to leave for work (nurse).  She’s 66, and overweight—any fall is bad, bad news.  She was screaming...”oh god, oh god, why me, oh lord, my ARM feels like it’s OUTSIDE MY BODY, not again, I can’t feel my arm, Michael, I can’t move my arm, OH MY GOD”, etc.  My girlfriend and I rushed to help as soon as we heard screams downstairs, and we couldn’t/did not want to attempt to move her.

It was just an accident.  She tripped over a box with some new orthopedic shoes in them, holding her lunch in one hand and her purse in the other.  Her screams of agony are embedded in my head and although it’s been 5 hours since, I’m still crying in waves.

I saw the box she tripped over, just a couple of days ago.  I briefly had thought to myself that it was in a bit of a weird spot...but I didn’t move it.  I didn’t think that this would ever happen.  I wish I did.

I’m trying so, so hard not to blame myself, Reddit.  Anyone could have moved the box, right?  But I wish I did, because then she’d be okay today.  I just thought it wouldn’t be an issue, she’d take the shoes out and toss the box out, no big deal.

But that didn’t happen, and she fell this morning.

It was seriously traumatizing to see her in such pain...again.  Those screams.  The 10-minute wait for an ambulance might have been the longest 10 minutes of my life.  She was in serious, crushing agony.

I could feel the massive anxiety of her realizing she will likely need surgery, lying there, helpless.  Waiting for the EMTs to pick her up and take her to the hospital...again.

She last fell in Dec 2018, when she severely fractured her left shoulder.  They tried to do a surgery to repair the fracture but her vitals bottomed out due to the anesthesia, and she almost died.  The surgeon and his team aborted the surgery, saved her life, and she healed naturally with months of physical therapy.

She fell that time, because I came home early from something, and she wanted to take me out to dinner.  She had even put the dinner she just cooked for herself in the fridge, so we could go out.  I told her no, eat your dinner, and we’ll go out another time...but she insisted.  

I started the car, and as she walked out, she slipped on an icy patch on the walkway by the front door and she fell.  And she screamed.  And she cried.  On the ground in the cold, wet, icy December...just because I came home early.

At that time and the months following, I helped her as much as I could...but hearing her sob every couple of days after physical therapy, and knowing she would never be able to lift her left arm above shoulder height again, had a huge effect on me.  I went to my room and cried and cried for her.  I tried not to blame myself, but I think internally, I still did, because I came home early that one night.

I think I buried my head in the sand by drinking.

But this fall seems worse.  This is different.  It’s a bad fracture pattern and she’s going to need surgery...tomorrow.  She might not be able to take the anesthesia again.  The doctors are trying to figure out all of the options as I write this, but they’re pretty confident it will heal poorly without surgery.

Nobody can even visit her in the ER because of COVID-19.

My anxiety today about her being able to get through this surgery is at a fever pitch.  I mean, it’s my mom, and she almost died in surgery last time.  But beyond that, the months of recovery and physical therapy ahead...again...it’s crashing down on me.  It’s deja vu and I feel like I’m drowning.  I should mention that this hospital system has over 500 active COVID-19 cases (probably 350+ at this specific hospital, the largest one in the area) and I feel like an absolute mess today trying to keep it all together.

I recently made a choice to stop drinking, based on a personal decision.  I had a hard time stopping once I’ve started.  I’m sure many of you can relate—I’ve read a lot of posts in this subreddit on my main account, and I was inspired by many of you to make a change.  

I’m currently on day 11, and it’s been an up and down challenge up to this point.  I’ve been so good, and I’ve resisted all temptation.

But the urge is so, so strong today, Reddit.  I am thiiiiiis close to giving in.  Please, keep me accountable.  Please.  I will not not drink with you today.  

I want to, so badly...but I will not drink with you today.  Please keep my mom in your hearts.",6,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.72638476}"

With working from home, reduced hours, and a lighter workload, I found myself drinking earlier and earlier in the day. Some days were better than others and I was able to control myself more, I even went some days without drinking. But the past week or so got pretty bad. 

Finally decided I couldn’t live like this. I don’t always get withdrawals but I drank heavily for so many days in a row that day one was rough. Worse than usual stomach issues, unable to stomach the idea of food other than goldfish crackers, bad anxiety, worse than usual depression, and the shakes. I had a hard time sleeping last night. 

But I woke up early for work this morning, made breakfast and tea, tidied up, and am now sitting at my desk actually working instead of on my bed “working.” My stomach is still iffy but I’m feeling worlds better. 

A lot of my triggers are anxiety and boredom, so I’ve made plans to combat those. Hell, a lot of the time I don’t even want to drink, it’s just my depression and anxiety basically saying “you gotta.” Of course alcohol makes them both worse so it’s a vicious cycle. 

I’ve done dry January, have had sober weeks, so I know I can do this. I’m working with a great therapist. We were going to start EMDR therapy right before the shut down happened, so unfortunately that has been put on hold but we’re still having phone sessions.

So she give me the info, great! And she's going to call me Friday, but it's just to check up on me to make sure I'm taking these steps, not an appointment.... Um, what?
 
Because my health insurance won't cover me seeing two types of therapists at the same time. OK, I kinda get that... except that if I pursue this professional help for alcohol abuse I can't continue the year of work and trust I've built with my LPC in regards to my mental health problems that are her specialty? 

Thats like saying you can't see a dermatologist to get a wart on your finger treated if you're already seeing a podiatrist to treat a plantar wart.

So yesterday I woke up (again) with the thought of “I need to quit this nonsense once and for all”.  I was shaking, dehydrated, headachy, foggy, and worst of all, guilty and feeling completely powerless.

So I came here (after knowing this sub has existed for years having mostly ignored it). I saw a post that recommended “This Naked Mind”. I’m about 1/2 through and I am experiencing a huge paradigm shift in my thinking about my daily escapades in poisoning myself.

I HATED being drunk when I first started drinking. My husband is 11 years older than me, and I just thought there was something wrong with me when I didn’t enjoy it at 22. Wine gave me headaches and made me stupid and emotional, vodka turned me into an angry person, schnapps dehydrated me and didn’t do a whole lot buzz-wise, etc. But about 2013 I discovered I had a taste for tequila. Part of the reason I loved tequila so much is it didn’t take a whole lot to get me to that buzzy happy point and maintain it. But as you all know, after a few years I started needing more. Yesterday I realized I had nearly downed a 750 mL bottle of Sauza in one night and I HATED myself for it. 

Alcohol and the ritual around it is so sneaky and awful and I have always blamed myself for not being able to control my “urges”. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself “You don’t HAVE to drink” so I didn’t start down this rabbit hole in the first place. What a relief and boon that would have been. 

But ... at the same time, it is today now. I am hopeful that I can control this and can see a light for the first time in a really long time.

I’m reaching that point where anxiety starts to resurface (after having initially decreased) and everything seems to have taken on a sort of manic tinge. I think the first little bit of abstinence was partially made “easier” because I was on a sort of high from quitting. However, that feeling of “look at me! I’m making changes and being a better/healthier person!” has since faded. What’s left is a growing anxiety, and I can tell my brain/body is craving dopamine release. I can handle most moments in a day (using mindfulness, mainly) knowing that over time things will continue to feel better and better, but it’s hard to see that now. I even feel a hint of depression coming back (which I consider to have defeated completely a while ago) and I’m just generally feeling anhedonic. The anhedonic part is honestly my biggest battle right now - my lack of desire and passion in general makes me kind of jealous whenever surrounded by enthusiastic, outgoing peers. Know what I mean? On the other hand, I think being impartial and sort-of anhedonic can be helpful in protecting yourself from hurt. The moment I get passionate about anything, I open myself up to disappointment/stress/sadness, etc. I’m struggling to find a balance there: I know I need to care more and get out in the world more (after the pandemic anyway) but I also know the moment I start wanting and caring more, the more I can get hurt. 

Does anyone have insight into this? I’ve had really high spirits up until recently. Lately I’ve been feeling anhedonic - like I’m a lame husband - guys in their late 20s should be super enthusiastic about things and life in general, right!? I feel like I should be obsessing over something or at least passionate about something. I try talking to people and “socializing” but I always end up hating it and it feels like people just want to get together and mostly talk about themselves. Am I broken because I have zero desire to talk to people? I know the answer is no, but still, it shouldn’t be so hard to be “normal” right? (I might also be on the spectrum, according to my wifey as well as my own understanding, so that affects this I’m sure)

I’m just wondering if you have any insight into the 6week (or so)mark.

**About me (the undesirable bits at least!)**

I grew up around alcohol.  Every member of the family and distant family, drinks.  I started drinking heavily at 16 and it's pretty much been consistent ever since.  I'm now 32.  That's half my life drunk.

Looking back at the past 16 years, I've always worked and **was** in a 9-year relationship up until 4 years ago, which broke down because of my alcohol addiction.  I've always convinced myself I am a functioning alcoholic, as I climbed the corporate ladder, far out-earning my peers.  I owned my own house before I was 27.  So what's the problem?

Well, after the break-up I spent 2/3 years in the same pub every day.  With my laptop, pretending to work etc, whilst drinking obviously.  And in the process picking up a colossal cocaine habit - which I managed to conquer last year.

Here I am today.  I'm lucky enough to be working from home during covid, but that's not good for my drinking habit.  I can some times limit my drinking to 4-pints of Stella a day, that's a very good day.   
Other days, I'll have 3 bottles of wine.  I'll drink until I fall asleep, wake up and finish the bottle, and repeat.  Those are my worst days.  Obviously that gets in the way of my work!

I need to do this for me.  In the immediate term to increase my motivation and thus keep my job, but longer term to improve my physical and mental health.  Last year I was diagnosed with severe depression and I'm currently on prescribed meds, but tapering off.  

I also smoke cannabis, but don't initially intend on cutting that out.  I may do so, depending on how I do with abstaining from alcohol.  It's reassuring having weed to fall back on, as pathetic as that sounds.

Along with the support of the community, I intend for this commitment and the sharing of it will help me conquer Day 1.",24,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5577213}"

I encouraged them to spend a week cutting back before going cold turkey but they want to just stop abruptly. I also tried to encouraged them to work their way up to a week sober, start with half a day, then one day, then two days, etc. I know from my own experience that setting a lofty goal and failing to meet it can send you spiraling further. 

I have never attempted to push them to stop or seek help, maybe that is shitty of me, but I could tell it’s not what they want to hear and we have not known each other long enough for me to force such a conversation. But I do jump on every opportunity to support them cutting back or quitting when it is brought up by them. So far I’ve just told them I support them stopping, I will not judge them if they choose to drink, and I will provide them with whatever kind of support they need. But, I don’t think they know what kind of support they’ll need so I’m trying to figure that out a little more on my end.

I do hope this post is finding you well on this spring Tuesday morning. 

Been a while since I’d picked up any quit-lit so I finally got around to starting Holly Whitakerr’s *Quit Like a Woman* last week. As poster for the Tuesday media discussion here, I feel duty-bound to read quit lit as part of my literary diet, but I’m pretty sure I’d do it anyway. I enjoy it. Hell, I read quite a bit of it when I was still drinking and had no plans to ever quit myself. I like to meet those kindred spirits who author these books. 

Holly Whitaker’s book is certainly (and not surprisingly for someone who follows her on Insta etc) the most political quit lit I’ve read to date. She doesn’t shy away from talking about things like Big Alcohol and the similarities its marketing and market growth strategies share with Big Tobacco. This may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but I am liking it. I need to stay mad at alcohol. Any time I’m feeling the least bit civil toward it, thoughts of giving the relationship another whirl start creeping in.

These lines from *Quit Like a Woman* had particular resonance with me: “That’s because we’re conditioned not to blame the precious alcohol, or to even worry about whether drinking it might be a bad idea, until we’re certifiable fuckups. What we are conditioned to believe is that there are two types of drinkers in this world, the normal ones who can tolerate alcohol, and the alcoholics who can’t”. I, for one, am happy now to put the blame squarely on the precious alcohol and it feels good to see that written out.

Happy hour is slipping earlier and earlier in the day. My clothes aren’t fitting the same and I’ve resorted to wearing sweats just to feel comfortable so now my self esteem is taking a hit.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\*

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn’t:\*\*

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Last Friday Night/Saturday Morning I was blacked out for like 14 hours and woke up at like 8 PM on Saturday night.

Major hangover when I woke up Saturday night and for literally 24 hours anything I ate, my body rejected it and I vomited it out, even threw up regular drinking water. I said to myself never again. I couldn't sleep without waking up ~20 minutes later, body jolted up. I just stayed up the entire night, morning and following day.

Around that same Sunday night l started felling better, headache is gone and I managed to eat bananas without puking it up and sipping slow on water. I was tired since I didn't get a good sleep for 24 hours...

Then the same shit happened again. I got like ~45 minutes of sleep this time until my body jolted up. This time my body was trembling shaking, drenched in sweat, rapid heart beat. 

I recognized it was Alcohol withdrawal. So I mixed a small drink and was able to sleep for somewhat 2 hours.

Not it's Monday. I decided to workout, drink a gallon of water and eat healthy.

As I'm typing this. It's Tuesday 1:09. About 24 hours from my last drink. I'm trying to sleep again and the hands shaking, legs jolts, heat flashes, anxiety, heart, palpitations, body jerks and insomnia are still fucking going on.

I'm losing my fucking mind right now. Is there a schedule or guide to taper off alcohol with alcohol to prevent withdrawals?

I swear if I make it out this. I'm throwing every single fucking bottle down the toilet.

I have, like many others here, been drinking since high school.  Back then, and still to this day, I will only drink on weekends - I definitely get triggered on Friday/Saturday nights, but weekdays I don’t think about alcohol at all.  I feel like I have conditioned my alcoholism into a pattern, i will get strong cravings fri/sat but if I wait until like 8pm the cravings are gone and drinking doesn’t feel worth it to me since I’ll be going to bed soon and I can’t drink enough to get drunk and enjoy it. 

I have wanted to stop drinking for years, I recognize it’s terrible for me and really just a time bomb for me to do something really stupid and ruin my life.  I know it doesn’t sound as bad as most of the people who struggle with this, it hasn’t really messed up my life or relationships in any way, which is why I didn’t like going to AA, I felt so dumb being there when everyone has had it so much worse than me with stories of their life just going down the shitter and I speak and I say nothing bad has happened to me, I don’t black out, and I just want to quit....  But I desperately want to quit and I can’t - which Is why I understand it is definitely alcoholism.

The feeling that I can’t control myself to simply not consume something kills me, it makes me feel powerless and weak, alcohol is truly a monster that has dug its claws into my brain. 

I have quit on my own before, first time I made it about 7 months and pretty much had it beat - but a girl I was dating really pressured me into having some beers with her and I did, it brought me right back into the pit of alcoholism.  I quit again for about 3 months not too long ago - but the cravings hit me like a wave one weekend I ended up back at square one.  The second time I quit, I would just smoke weed instead.  When I felt like I was craving booze I would just take one hit and all would be well.  But I don’t really want to just replace one drug with another...

My wife is supportive, but she doesn’t understand.  Like I said, I don’t black out or get crazy or mean so she doesn’t really get why it’s such a problem and why I am so hard on myself for wanting to stop.  She drinks as well, but very little and hardly ever gets drunk.

It seems so obvious yet it is so true. When I think of quitting or adding a habit, it seems so daunting. Bad habits don't feel like they have a long lasting bad impact. Good but painful changes feel like they aren't really helping. Our brain isn't that good at thinking about our lives, only how we spend our days.

I drink every day, so what? I can quit any time I want? I deserve a break after work. It's the only way I can relax... and before you know it, 5 years and countless terrible experiences later, here I still sit grasping a bottle. What am I missing?

Would you have spend all the free time you had away from work and responsibilities sitting in a drunken stupor that you won't even remember the next day? You arrive at the night of your life.

I'm a 35 year old female who has spent basically the last 15 years drinking pretty heavily. From the outside- my drinking never appeared to be out of control. I loved the craft beer scene and basically made drinking into a cool hobby. Fast forward to 2018 and my wife and I decided to start a family. We now have two children and 4 months ago I finally realized I had to quit for good. 

After experiencing the bliss of being without hangovers for 9 months and the birth of my daughter in 2018, I thought I finally had gained a hold on my drinking. I was wrong (surprise). After starting on a small dose of Zoloft last year (hoping a little help with depression would curb my desire for alcohol), my craving for alcohol started to get out of control. Months went by and my new normal became stopping at a store every evening after work and buying Truly or craft beer. I got to the point where I was literally opening drinks and drinking three in the 5 minute drive home. I would stash more in my purse and just throw them in the fridge before my spouse noticed. I would have at least 5-6 drinks a night, wake up feeling terrible, and do it all again the next evening.   I had always been an evening or social drinker, but I was graduating to a new level at this point. 
 
My wife had our second daughter a year and a half later and I still had not stopped my secret drinking. I was working, taking care of my kids, reading books, giving baths- ALL while intoxicated.

As of today I have almost 4 months sober. I can't say I felt anything monumental after that 90 day mark, but every day is easier.

I think we are all in the same boat here. 28/F/Can
I have been an alcoholic and heavy drinker for the better part of 4yrs. 
I dont want to put any blame on an ""excuse"" but I do come from a very unhappy childhood home with an alcoholic father and a very troublesome mother and an older sibling who is much older than I. My parents split when I was a year old. 

My father has always been my best friend, a 'daddy's girl's if you will. Despite his own issues, he always tried to make being a dad his priority when he had our weekend with us. However, my mother and I have never ever gotten along. We are made from totally different fabrics. Same as my mother, my sister is 8 yrs older than I so we have never had a life experience to share at the same time. I have nothing in common with either. This kindve family has lead me to unbelievable trust issues.  

In addition to this, I have always struggled with extreme anxiety and depression and I have never been able to form any kind of lasting or real deep relationship- friendship or otherwise (including other extended family). I have been on meds for years. I feel my family has not recognized this or given me the appropriate support. 

Recently I have been struggling with being isolated at home. I live alone and it's hard. No reliable family, and no friends. The major thing to understand is that when I say I have no friends, I literalllly have no friends. 

Recently I got into a bit of tiff with my mom and sister and have cut off communication to help with my mental health. The problem with this is, now I dont have anyone at all to talk to even once a week. 
Both of them are aware of my drinking problem but have never followed up or asked me how I'm doing with that, only criticized.

I've started to sink back into my own misery and building my existing walls higher and higher. I'm honestly just really lonely and.. sad. I'm not taking care of my self.. showering 1-2times a week, not washing my face, havent shaved my legs in weeks.. it's awful and so embarrassing.  But why bother when theres no where to go and nothing to do? Even for a super introvert, it's so challenging.

Some of you may remember me, I used to do the Sober Train posts each Friday...  I am sorry I got away from doing that, I always hoped that it helped someone out there get past that tough weekend here and there!  But new job, new responsibilities, etc. and life just gets in the way my friends...  My apologies!  


SO ANYHOW...  I promised I would keep this short and sweet, so here we go!  


If you are here today lurking, like I used to... wanting to commit, but fearing taking that first step, with all of its ramifications.  (IE. Who are you without alcohol, who will you hang out with \[because some/all of your friends drink...\], what will I do for fun, how will I relax, how can I sleep, etc.)  


Start NOW!!!  If you can't safely stop this instant, get a plan made and share it with loved ones.  Make yourself accountable to someone other than yourself, you can do all of that now.  If you can safely stop now, then STOP NOW.  


At two years of sobriety, my only regret is that I didn't stop sooner...  there's this whole other world out here my friends, and it is beautiful when you share it with the real you.  Sober you, with some time under your belt, with healthy coping mechanisms in your toolbox, you can kick some major ass my friend, I PROMISE!!!  


We are all one and the same, so I can't love myself without loving each and every one of you.  Love you all!  Come on, we can do this!

I disappointed her too many times during my addiction. I would swing between moods of being so family oriented and wanted to have great big family dinners to losing touch for months because I was deep into my alcoholism. Because I was the one waxing and waning, the burden of communication always fell to me. Also, because she has a husband and 4 kids and I am unmarried with 2 cats. It was like, because I had less to do, fewer people relying on me, that I was expected to keep up with her schedule and keep texts alive. She did know I was busy with alcohol, everyone knew. 

Eventually, she wanted off the rollercoaster because her kids were upset how I’d show up and be the best aunt and then disappear for months or years. Her mama bear trumped sticking around for a volatile sister. 

April 25, I passed 2 years of sobriety. I tried to reach out to my sisters twice along this journey (I have 2, the eldest and I have had periods of being contentious) but was met with a lot of anger and demands on my future behavior. The largest of which was that I was not to have contact with her children until she and I had restored a relationship. I felt restricted rather than supported in my sobriety and was worried if I moved forward trying to have a friendship that I would be under a microscope with people asking, “When?” As if screwing up again is inevitable. 

I’ve been through a lot in 2 years, a couple jobs, new career path, a paralegal degree and a fiancé. I feel very well and I’m active in my recovery. I stay close to people who remind me what I went through and understand the feelings of a fellow addict. I’m the outlier in my family, addiction was unheard of and certainly not discussed. My dad asked why I find it easier to talk to strangers, but strangers understand my cravings and depression and anxiety and instability I feel. If I reconcile with my sisters, I feel I would be met with some hurt feelings masked my ignorance around addiction. I felt I was too early in my sobriety to take on a relationship in which I would have to teach the other person about my condition at every step.

God, this post keeps getting longer! 

My nephew 15 followed me on Instagram. I don’t know what to do. I had set myself in a comfortable “One day I’ll address this” mood and that has been shattered. He reached his hand out. My account is open, I don’t need to allow his request. His account is restricted (glad to discover that) and I would have to request to follow. I’m terrified if I do, it will be overstepping my sisters decree that I not speak to her children without her. I love the idea of having a relationship with my nephew in which I can be a stable adult friend. I’m terrified I’ll disappoint him, thereby proving my sister right.

There have been so many excuses to drink over this time that would have been valid. Depression, sexual harrassment, work stress, relationship stress, death, and now being laid off work due to the pandemic. All reasons I could have drank and made the choice not to. I mean, I used to get trashed even when things were going great, I always had a reason and justification for why I deserved to numb it away. Good or bad.

Being off work would have been the perfect opportunity for me to drink every day. Old me would have done it. I probably would have gotten into other things too. Instead, I have been taking care of myself. I've been thinking of my future and I'm making plans and very hopeful. I just teared up writing the word hopeful and the emotion I feel from that word, cause I've had times where I really felt like I had nothing left to live for.

The next morning you are too busy trying to get comfortable in bed. Sweating, tossing and turning. Forcing yourself to vomit, then not being able to stop. Nothing satisfies you. Greasy food, sugar, carbs. Nothing. Of course you can’t work out. A little later on, muscle soreness throughout your whole body. And guess what. The problem is still there. 

Not only is the problem still there, the doom and gloom of it is amplified. Nothing feels good. Sleeping doesn’t feel good. Watching tv doesn’t feel good. Nothing. You can’t decide what to do. You remember times like this when you were happy and didn’t have the problem, and suddenly that makes you feel 100 times worse. You know that you are still suffering the effects of alcohol at this time, but nothing quenches the anxiety and pain.

I was at a house party and everyone is drinking and partying. The house is gigantic and even has a guest house specifically for the kegs. Inside true main house it seems tidy enough everyone is conversing and the TVs are all on playing music videos, cartoons, etc. This one particular man starts to speak loudly in the grand dining room and at the back of my mind it seems off but everything is in its place. I have to leave the gates of the property to pick something up and tell the gate keeper I’d be right back. I leave the property and come back in my dream was a walk around the block. 
The house is a completely destroyed and the man in the dining room ruined everything and killed himself. All the TVs are only playing static and everyone is just acting normal. I am in complete horror and ask my friend, “what happened?” They responded that everything is exactly the same as when I left. I said, “All the TVs are static, there’s a dead man in the dining room and the house is destroyed!” My friends look around and say they don’t know what I’m talking about.
I panic and find my friend to leave but the gatekeeper wouldn’t let us. I successfully climbed the gate and got out. 
It turns out the longer your in the house you just stop noticing the bad stuff because your partying and drunk. When you leave the house the illusion wears away and that’s why the gatekeeper didn’t want us to leave.
I woke up with a gasp of air! I thought holy shit that is a total metaphor for drinking. At least that’s how I saw it. The longer you stay away from booze you see the shit storm it brings and it hides and pretends there is no storm.

I was recommended this subreddit in another post I made and after reading some of your stories and progress in regards to sobriety.. I am excited to be here with you all and to share my journey with someone. 

I'm a sophomore in college whose 21st birthday is a few months away. I've been drinking since I was about 15-16. I come from parents who both have struggled with alcoholism and have been to treatment for it. That being said, I don't necessarily believe I have an addiction or anything, but I do see major issues in regards to my behavior when I drink.

I don't drink too often, definitely not as much as I used to. However, when I drink, it isn't like I can have one glass of wine and call it a day. I will drink until there is no alcohol left or until the sun is up. My behavior, when I drink, is what really made me consider sobriety. I become very depressed when I drink, often crying or thinking of harmful behavior. I say things to people I don't mean or I tell people too much. I wake up the next day so embarrassed and regretful. I just lay in bed, thinking about everything I did and said and feel so low. I have made so many poor decisions when under the influence and I have grown so tired of it. I want to stop. I need to stop. 

This weekend while 3 bottles of wine deep, I told my boyfriend some pretty personal things over text that I was not ready for him to know yet. While I know I can trust him, it just was not the time for him to know these personal things about me. Luckily, his behavior hasn't changed towards me or anything. I know he knows I was drunk, but I still feel so embarrassed that his opinion changed towards me. My boyfriend also has said he doesn't like who I am when I drink before, which I understand. I don't like me either when I drink.

I have not shared this with anyone yet that I am making this decision to go sober. I want to get more down the road before sharing it with anyone. Tomorrow I am supposed to go to the beach with my friend and I know she expects us to drink, but I am just going to drink plain soda. As I said, I'm not ready to share my choice with anyone yet.

Friday when I got paid I went and got a bottle of whiskey. a pint. I drank half and ate chinese take out while i watched tv.  Then the next day I finished it, i think. I can't remember. saturday evening i went and got another pint of whisky and drank almost the whole thing while ate take out and watched tv. sunday I went and bought a bottle of wine and a 2 tallboys.  Had the wine and 1 beer with dinner.  Had the other at 5 am, knowing it would make me feel like shit.  Has been years since I've done that.

a few weeks ago I felt dizzy. sitting in the chair looking at my phone. i went and bought a new blood pressure monitor.  Then saw my doctor again. He ordered blood tests that I haven't done.  Keep taking the blood pressure medicine.  Told myself I need to stop this, that it's going to kill me.  That I feel awful.

i've been drinking like this for the past couple of years.  grief over a close relation. death.  stress at work. moving. job instability at first. not having enough money. lots of stress at work from an alcoholic boss. i live alone.  I stopped working out. then i had an accident that kept me laid up in bed for a couple months.  I'd gained weight because of overeating and the alcohol, then being laid up.  this is causing other health issues: blood pressure, trouble sleeping, weight gain, absolutely no self confidence. i look hideous. I don't recognize myself.

i read about alcohol withdrawal and worried about it.  how they say it's dangerous to stop. i live alone and said okay but if I'm only drinking a bottle of wine a day in the evening with food it's not like I'm one of those people that wakes up and drinks.  rationalizing. Who drank a tallboy at 5 am today?

sometimes i dream of what i was able to do before. I used to jog and run.  i swam laps for years. i biked 5 miles a day at least. I weighed 165.  I ate less, and still drank a beer or two in the evening.  Even after drinking and overeating, for a couple years I still biked 40 miles one day two years ago. I've gone up by 75 lbs.

i can stop drinking. Back in 2016 i could go a week without drinking.  I'd get a bottle of wine on the weekend.  Then the next week wouldn't drink.  I stopped drinking and started watching what i was eating this fall. Then after a stressfull day at work came home ordered take out and drank wine and ate so much i puked.  I did that two or three times, at least. Christmas 2019 I went a week or so without drinking.  I went a few days recently after i went to the doctor.

All the time I told myself I was functioning, i was fine, i could manage. but i don't know if that's true anymore. it's catching up to me.

i estimated all the money i spent buying alcohol last month. i could have gotten myself something nice with that.  but i wanted to drink it as soon as possible and go to sleep.  that's the pattern. get food, get alcohol, watch some tv, drink while interspersing it with bites of food because i don't like the taste of alcohol. what i want is to sleep and forget.

It sucked.,"I got caught up – wave after wave of longing. Quarantine has been hard, but it’s not an excuse or really the reason I drank. This has been something that has been building since I quit. Likely before I quit, actually. 

There was a part of me that always wondered what it would be like to be able to have a few beers here and there. During my 15 year drinking career that was something that I was never able to do. It was always more than a few. And I really do like beer – the taste, the aesthetic, the whole thing. I wanted one. Or two. And I figured I should give it a shot or I would always wonder if I was missing out. So four days ago I had a few beers after nearly two years of sobriety. 

A pilsner and a nice IPA. Beautiful day out – hung out with my wife on the patio. My wife was happy to have me back. She did not quit drinking, and we haven’t spent as much time together over the last few years. I took my first sip and was shocked by the feel and taste of the alcohol. I’ve read This Naked Mind and it did its job deconstructing the allure of alcohol and exposing it for what it is – poison. I could taste it clearly. 

I kept at it. Finished the beer over an hour or so. Ended up feeling pretty lethargic. No euphoria, no buzz, nothing good. Just blah. Figured I would give the IPA a shot and so I did. It took me more than an hour to finish it. I had to force it down – it was making me sick. Heavy and bitter and astringent. And still some part of me wanted to drink all of it.  

Went inside afterwards to put the kids down. Started getting heartburn (hadn’t had it in forever). Got into my bed and tried to sleep but I felt gross and lethargic and my stomach was bothering me. Had a heart arrhythmia (minor) – also something I hadn’t experienced in many years. Couldn’t fall asleep until nearly 1a (I’m almost always out by 10p – easy to fall asleep and peaceful sleep all night long). 

I woke up at my normal time – 5a – and took my morning walk. It was a slog. I was still lethargic, couldn’t think very clearly. I was just off. That feeling lasted through the entire day until I ended up falling asleep watching a movie in the early evening. I was deeply exhausted and it was an exhaustion I recognized from my drinking days. All of this from 2 beers. 

The next day I woke up and still felt a bit off, but better. Did some cleaning, got out with the kids, and by the afternoon I was feeling good. I decided to have another few beers. Maybe it was the IPA that threw me off the other night. I had a few light beers – actually managed to catch a buzz somewhere between the end of the first and the beginning of the second. And I got triggered.

I was being very purposeful in how I was drinking. Slowly, responsibly – even drinking water in between the two beers I was allowing myself to have. At that moment I was ready to say fuck it. Drink how I used to drink. Instead, I finished the rest of my second beer, ate dinner, put the kids down, and went to bed to read. 

My evenings were something that I really valued in my sobriety. I loved getting into bed fresh with a clear head and reading for an hour or two before going to sleep. This wasn’t it – I was tired, full, my stomach was bothering me again, couldn’t think clearly. Felt disgusting. Had another arrhythmia. Got to sleep, woke up, and felt like shit for the entire next day. Had anxiety which I had not experienced in YEARS and was generally useless. Again - 2 beers. 

That was yesterday. Today I feel better. And my brain is searching the fridge thinking of the other beers I have left from the variety pack I bought. What an insidious fuck alcohol is. 

The good news – my sobriety has taken on new meaning for me. There were days when I didn’t feel particularly healthy, but those days were MILES from how I felt yesterday. The clarity of mind I had was pretty awesome. I was so much more present for my kids – for everyone, really. And I didn’t have the great internal battle: Should I drink? Or not? And if I do – how much? And on, and on, and on. My god is that conversation a time – and really – a life waster. 

There is a part of me that seriously mourns the fact that I will not be celebrating two years of sobriety in July. But I can’t dwell – dwelling would cause trouble (now it’s only been two days since I had my last drink, no reason not to today…). 

Interestingly, my neck has been bothering me the last few days. It’s been hard to keep my head up. Likely due to my current work from home situation (no more standing desk!), but it serves as a good analogy for how I feel.  

If anyone is having the kind of thoughts that lead me to this “experiment” (it wasn’t really an experiment – it was a poor decision) I would urge you to reconsider. I’ve done what I can to make my decision to drink as least harmful as possible for myself, but it still weighs heavily. My sobriety – and yours – is a blessing. Hold onto it.

I've fairly successfully kept everything hidden from my wife and family by some work of God, other than some weight gain and high blood pressure. 

A few factors have lead me to a point of significant reduction in my drinking. First being a wife and child to support, the recent pandemic, financial turmoil, and just tired of being tired.

The mornings where I wake up after little to no drinking have almost left me lost for words. I had gotten so use to feeling like a monster during the first portions of the day as a consequence of my addiction, always vowing to stop but never succeeding.

I’m reaching out to this community for some advice. 
I’ve been a lurker/occasional poster for a year now and I’ve done really well (64 day stretch) and managed to stay sober.
My S/O on the other hand... is struggling
I think he’s in denial.
He’s ok for the first couple of drinks and then a switch flips..
Rapid personality change.
Face changes. He goes from a happy fun person to angry, frowning person.
He laughs for no reason.
Mutters to himself.
I can’t reason with him. I’ve tried speaking softly to calm him down. I’ve tried reasoning with him. I’ve tried yelling back. It’s like there’s a wall. I can’t communicate with him at all. 
Yesterday he drank half a bottle of vodka and was doing weird things like putting our lettuce plants in front of the bathroom door (he said they needed to be watered).
He tried rearranging the patio furniture but it wasn’t making any sense and got mad when I tried to help. 
I was in the shower (after I put the lettuce back) and he got in with me all pissed off and I had to get out shortly after. He was being hostile. I explained he was being hostile and of course Im imagining it in my head and blowing it out of proportion.
I finally decided to leave for a couple hrs and take our dogs to the dog park. He was furious and said he just wanted me to be here with him. I said I am right here. He insisted that no, I’m not. I told him I felt like he was flooded emotionally and I was taking off for a couple hrs. He said he wouldn’t be here when I got back.
I came back. He was here and coming out of it. I can see him coming out of it. It’s so bizarre.
He claimed he wasn’t feeling well. Went to sleep at 530pm. 
This morning he’s acting like nothings wrong.
I’ve tried talking to him about it and he said I’m making it happen because I’ve decided that’s what’s going to happen. I told him because that’s what DOES happen. He hits a threshold and the switch flips. 
I don’t know how else to explain it to him.

Personally, I’m not doing so hot. For awhile I wasn’t really drinking. I had to go to work every morning so if I went hungover I knew I would dread it and it would be horrible. On Fridays I was too tired to drink. Don’t know exactly why but didn’t really use Saturday nights to drink either. I lost 20 lbs. I was exercising almost daily. I was eating healthier. I remember going to the doctor and answering questions on the depression and anxiety survey and thinking “damn, I’m actually doing really well.”

Then quarantine. I’m working from home and due to the nature of my job, my workload is much smaller. You know what that means? More boredom. More time for booze. No reason to wake up not hungover. Oh except that I gained the 20 lbs back. And I hate waking up and not remembering how the night before ended. Feeling like shit. Feeling like I’m lying to people about who they think I am. 

I love nights where I’m sober and watching a good movie. I love cuddling with my dogs on the couch. I love being able to feel “on” all the time. Yet alcohol still lures me away from those nights frequently. Not really sure how to sober up now. There’s so much time in my life and not much to do. But I want to be sober.

I would like to categorize myself as a ""binge drinker"" and not an ""alcoholic"", even though I know that's not true. I seem to be able to do incredible feats of mental gymnastics in order to rationalize this. What's the big difference anyway...

Background, I'm in my mid 30s and about 3 years into mostly cleaning living. One major multi month bender plus several intermittent slip-ups. Starting in my early 20s I started drinking a lot. Started with just a few drinks a day. By my mid 20s I was up to 6-8 beers a day. By my late 20s to 30 I was drinking a 30 pack every 2 days. 

I held the same job through this entire decade long period and was very successful. I never let drinking blur into my professional life, so I just laughed it off as being a functional alcoholic. I went literally YEARS without a day off from drinking. Although there was a 6 month period in there where I stopped randomly only to start right back up again. 

The part that has me messed up is the fact that miraculously I have never suffered any consequences from my drinking. I mean, for clarity I have plenty of crazy stories and it's caused plenty of friction in my romantic relationships (almost a divorce) but nothing like the stories I heard in AA. No lost jobs, no DUI's, no health issues, not even any withdrawals when I quit cold turkey. 

I realize that I am an alcoholic, but I still mess up. Nowhere near what it used to be, but still I tell myself ""hey, it's just a few beers while I grill"" or "" I'm really stressed"" or whatever I need to say. I did OK for the first month of quarantine, but a couple weeks ago slipped. Would drink 8 beers when the wife only thought I had 1 (gotta justify beer breath so I'd buy a tall boy that I'd let her see me drink while I grill. Then kept a 6 pack in the garage that I'd go through throughout the night) This lead to Franzia ""Crisp White"" box wine hidden in the garage that I'd chug by the Solo Cup full... bad stuff. 

Anyway, I'm back on day 4 of clean and sober. Glad to find this sub. Good luck all!!!",15,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43310273}"

My skin has decided that without alcohol it enjoys breaking out more. Not cool epidermis...

I started working out last week with some cardio, but really want to get back into our home gym with my husband.  But he has been Killin it lately and I know I can't keep up.  That used to be one of our things, lifting and HIIT training.  Might have to put my pride down and get back on the horse. 

I have been eating more after about day 5. But that is mostly to shut my alcohol cravings up.  I can get better at that.

I have been generally happier, but at moments I do miss the weight that alcohol lifts when you hit that sweet spot... But it isn't worth it...

Because I have found that I am actually funny and quick with a joke while sober!!

I am enjoying music and some little things you don't have time for when you are just worried about when you can drink next.

In years past, I've kept drinking under control (only drink on weekends, and in moderation), but over the years I've progressively gotten worse. 

I hate feeling like I am a slave to alcohol - needing a drink (and then another, and another) to relax. I can frequently drink without problems - and that has made it easy to make excuses and pretend I've got things under control. For example, I can go out with friends or have a beer or two at home and be ok - but much too frequently things go off the rails and I end up obnoxiously tipsy (if not outright drunk). And that turns me into a person that isn't that fun to be around.

Basically, if someone else is serving me I'll usually be ok - but if I start serving myself, things start to get messy.

Of course, the more I drink the more I want to. I've noticed it is keeping me from enjoying the ""real"" activities that actually make life fun - I tend to crave getting home and having a drink more than enjoying whatever else I happen to be out doing. Being at home with a drink feels like the only  way I can actually relax and let the stress of the day go. 

I have not been able to really admit this to myself - much less to my wife - which of course is driving her nuts. Having her police me doesn't work - someone else suggesting I've had enough to drink feels infuriating and infantilizing. 

I hope this isn't too incoherent. It is hard to write it out. 

I've gotten some of the recommended books and I'm going to start regularly visiting this forum. I don't know how to ""fix"" myself or my problem, but I guess this is a start.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week whichhave touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

I have two AoK this week to share. The first is all of the support that I receive from a post I made Wednesday night. I hit a wall, I was worn out and tired, and it reminded me of how I used to feel when I was drinking, which was an icky feeling. I posted about it, because I've learned in recovery that I need to share about things and get them out. Bottling things up doesn't work for me.

When I woke up and logged on the next morning I was really touched by all of the support that I had received. It helps me so much to know that I'm not alone, that other people experience these things, and that there's a way to get through them. On my own I got drunk, but together we stay sober. I need the support of my sobriety communities, and I'm grateful for all of the support and kindness that I receive here.

The second AoK also involved me asking for support. I'm terrible at asking for help, it's just not something that really occurs to me or that I'm comfortable doing. But I've got a sober friend who is going to be living with me as a roommate in my new house, and she volunteered to help me with the work that I'm doing before I move in. There's a lot of work, and I'm struggling, so I took her up on it. 

She came over yesterday and spent the day and it was a lot of fun. I've barely seen anyone the past couple of months, so it was a real treat to be able to hang out and talk all day. We got a lot done, too, and it was fun to feel like I was sharing the journey with her. It made me realize that I invite others into my life by asking for support. I'm allowing them to share the journey with me. It's been many years since I had a roommate, and I'm looking forward to it. It feels like a shared adventure.

34m, been a heavy drinker since I was 14. In 20 years the longest solid period I've been sober is 6 weeks. I always justify to myself I can control the amount and not go overboard. 

I like it. I like the taste, the feeling of numbness that helps drown out all the stress and depression I keep bottled up inside. I use it to cope with the fact my health has kept me out of work since December. To cope with the fact my wife doesn't love me because of my actions. To deal with the kids fighting and screaming.

I need to stop. I've probably already had my last chance. And if that's the case I will make my peace with that. But I'm so scared. The bad thoughts and depression will be there. 

I don't know if I'm strong enough to do this. But I have to. I need to get healthy. I need to get myself right so I don't scream at my kids anymore. I don't want to lose my family. I want them to love me and be proud of me. I want to see my kids grow up.

Harold Johnson is an indigenous crown prosecutor (something like a lawyer, from my understanding) who travels to various First Nations communities to represent people in court cases. The majority of cases have alcohol or drugs as a factor. Over and over again he hears the same story when dealing with cases involving violence: “s/he is a good person, when they aren’t drinking”. And yet under the influence, violence occurs significantly more often. 

Presently I happen to reading a book dealing with the history of murders in my area. There’s a chapter dedicated to murders that occurred while the accused was “under the influence” but as I’m reading the stories, the truth is that well over half of my town’s murders involved alcohol or hard drugs. Of course not every person who drinks becomes violent, but it’s significant that this most violent act involved drinking most of the time.

I (23F from Australia) have paid a deposit to train to be a ski instructor in November in Canada and then live and work on the slopes there for 6 months. 

Obviously I’ll have to see what unfolds with the current situation, however that aside I am thinking of pulling out because of my drinking. I am a binge drinker, it’s much worse when I’m in new environments with people I don’t know - particularly travelling - most of the time I black out and subsequently do stupid shit ie sleep with randos, wet the bed, run off etc etc.

I was really excited to have this break from my studies and live overseas, however talking to a friend who is in the ski world she said that it can be VERY drinking focussed. She went from being someone who had never had a drink in her life and was completely morally opposed to alcohol and in 1 year she had stomach ulcers and was shitting blood and had to stop drinking because she drank so much at the ski towns. She also said that drugs are very prevalent and there are a lot of drinking games.

I never drink alone - it’s only in social settings - but that’s what scares me because every night all the instructors go to the bar together and I’m just picturing myself getting so wasted and not being able to go to work the next day and putting myself in dangerous situations. People die at the snow every year from walking off while drunk (something I tend to do a lot - walk off or go with strangers).

Some of my friends think I should go but other close ones say don’t go, you won’t come back alive.

I can’t help but feel that I’m missing out - after all I can’t let not drinking control my life - however I’m only a couple of months since my last binge and I’m scared for what could happen if I go live in Canada.

Granted I had to blow into a straw twice a day for that period of time. I didn’t have to go to AA but I chose to. 

I got a great sponsor and I went to upwards of 40 meetings. Each time I went it was kinda therapy without the therapist I loved it. 

Won’t lie as you can see in my name I use cannabis. To an extent I am dependent on it but I don’t spend dumb amounts of money on it and I don’t center my life on it. 

Alcohol has only gotten me in trouble. I’ve never been in trouble with “drugs” and I’ve dabbled with a fair amount of them. It’s weird to phrase it like this but other drugs still keep me the same me. But when I use alcohol once I pass a threshold I almost always turn into a horrible person. 

Drinking with my current girlfriend went well, we never fought, I never got weird, I’d just get sad sometimes. 

She went back home for the summer and I’ve been drinking to cope and I sent her some BS message I didn’t mean and it turns out she’s taking a break talking to me for the weekend. 

It was a wake up call. I really love this woman so much and I’m so sorry I fucked with her head. My moms gonna help find me a therapist and I’m considering going back to meetings. I don’t necessarily need them to stay sober but I’d like to come in from time to time to check in. 

My dad is facing the possibility of life in prison for drunken misbehavior, I’ve gone to jail twice for drinking and one time was for a month (work release). I still have prospects for college, I can still turn myself around. 

I don’t know why but basically a month after being off court papers I picked it up again. It wasn’t anything serious but eventually I started getting shitfaced again. 

I haven’t fucked up hardcore in the sense that I have in the past. Waking up hungover in a drunk take with felonies. But I’m really questioning myself in why I picked it back up. I’ve told her about my past of course and she told me she never feels the need to drink, and she wouldn’t do it in front of me. We just had so much fun in the past.

For those of you reading this i will explain what i did so i am accountable for my actions. Having drank 1 and a half bottles of gin i decided to stay downstairs when my wife went to bed. While watching TV and continuing to drink i received a facebook message from a colleague at work who i had blocked weeks previously as she was messaging me frequently and i wanted it to stop. I do not remember anymore of this encounter and what of it i do know is from reading the messages after. I said some extremely rude and vile things for a married man which were against all commitments i made in my vows. I had then passed out on the sofa in which my wife came down and read all the messages on my phone. When questioning me i got extremely irate and aggressive with shouting and making threats. After hours of arguing i left the house and went and slept in a local park until later in the morning. On my return we argued again and i eventually went upstairs when the police arrived and questioned my wife on the events. My wife left the house for a while to get some space in which time i found a stanley knife (my wife hid all other knives) and carved lots of cuts into my arm 54 to be precise but that did not relieve my pain. I have battled my mental health for years after my farther died in my arms aged 15 and have attempted suicide on numberous occassions but this time was different it made me realise i did not want to die and this came to me with lots of blood everywhere. I have not had this thought in a moment of crisis ever and its the thought that has gave me hunger to change. Having backed off to give her space throughout the evening i decided i would sleep in our shed with a few blankets which was extremely cold and would have required a drink to sleep properly but i didnt (first positive step even without knowing).,10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8027172}"

But it wasn't a joke. I don't want either in my fridge. They are both bad, damaging habits. And while this is probably the hardest time to kick a habit, dammit I need to.

My backstory is that I never had what felt like a problem with alcohol, and especially not food. Despite working in cultures- music, treeplanting- that enabled and encouraged it, and missing a work day once every year or so, my relationship with it was a positive one, because I did it because I enjoyed it. It was fun.

I went back to school four years ago, in the hopes of injecting some stability into my life, some long-term security. It worked. I applied myself like a son-of-a-bitch, exceptionally disciplined, top marks, working the 14+ hr days without the constant break downs I saw happening with the other students. But there was a reason for it- I was walking and drinking. At 9pm most days, I would walk 45 minutes to the local brewpub, have a pint or two with the wonderful gregarious tender, buy a couple of growlers, and walk 45 minutes back home. Then I'd put another hour or two of work in while drinking one of the growlers.

At the end of the second year, I realized I was using the alcohol to cope with the extreme stress. I wasn't having anxious breakdowns because I was depressing my system with booze.

And I've come to realize that nothing has changed. This is my coping mechanism, and I need to find a different one. I've ordered a pair of running shoes. I hear running can help. Until I get them, I'm planning on taking long walks each morning, and maybe getting back into doing yoga at night. We'll see how it goes. All I know is I'm fed up with the routine, the habit.

When he drank he was funny out spoken entertaining and was emotional when he stopped for eight years he barley spoke was in a shell no friends no conversation just existed I remember deep down wishing he would drink so I could have our relationship back I felt guilty because I knew it was ruining his health.  My father died when I was 26 from failing down drunk and punctured his spleen he died on the operating table.  Today I struggle with quitting I did drink 5-6 times a week heavy I’m not down to 1-2 times a week medium to heavy I want to stop 100% I now feel like the empty shell until today I cried alone thoughts memories came to mind regrets etc.  I though about his me and my only child 24/daughter are not close don’t feel like she really try’s to see me or spend time with me as we did once before.  I NEVER though we wouldn’t be close always have been but not now lost my father to drinking my mom passed in my house lost her battle to emphasize I was there when she took her last breath.  I don’t talk to my half sister at all it got really bad when our mom died.  She is dependent on prescription drugs and has changed so much she tried hard to bring me down because me and mom were close and I was there for our mom she was not.  So long story short today I feel lonely and hurt I cried alone I feel like I have no family I didn’t numb it or forget about it I FELT it and for some strange reason I’m glad I did.  What I want to change is my relationship with my daughter but I’ve always been willing seems like she don’t care and I don’t know how to approach that.

I quit drinking mid February, at his ""urging"". It's morphed since then to be my choice and I'm doing it for me but it did start out because he was angry a lot about my drinking. 

It's been wonderful. My energy, vitality, happiness, joy...our marriage is stronger. We are both improving. 

He's diabetic. Taking meds but hadn't really been changing eating habits or exercising regularly. He has food/sugar junkie issues whether or not he acknowledges them is a different story. 

Well....when I quit drinking, eating better, sleeping better, more energy to cook healthy meals, energy to walk every day...

....his blood sugar has dropped significantly in the last few weeks. His moods are dramatically better, although he denies that. He used to get Hangry. He's losing some weight. Not snarfing chocolate every evening. Not eating anything fried. I make him huge plates of fresh veggies, which he loves, but just won't cut up for himself.

I'm sure it's for multiple reasons...my cooking healthy, increased energy to exercise together, he saw me quit drinking for our marriage and he's doing his part.

This is my first ever post on Reddit and definitely a first for admitting to anyone other than my parents or boyfriend that I am an alcoholic.

I’ve been drinking 4-6 days a week for about two years and during this pandemic it has become 7 days a week. I usually stick to beer and wine because if I buy a bottle of liquor I’ll just drink it all. I don’t drink to the point of blacking out but once I start it is extremely hard for me to stop, nearly impossible. When I go to the store to buy beer, I try to just buy a 6 pack (fully aware that that’s not going to be enough) because I know how inconvenient it will be for me to have to go back to the store when I run out. I think to myself “this will keep me from drinking too much”... ha never works I should know by now. I end up just getting pissed at myself later on for not getting more and I take my ass back to 7-11 annoyed and embarrassed. When I’m out drinking with my boyfriend or friends its embarrassing how much I need to drink and unless I go home and go to sleep, I’m not stopping. I can never just go out for a casual one or two drinks. Before I got laid off due to covid, I’d drink at work too (worked in a bar so it was very easy). Like I said, I’m 24 so everyone around me is always drinking and it just seems like the right thing to do at this point in my life (at least that’s what I tell myself to justify my drinking). But I know I’m not normal and that I’m a real alcoholic and if I don’t get this under control soon, it’s going to ruin my life. My dad is an alcoholic so it’s definitely in my genes to become one.

I was so glad to see my wife so excited yesterday. She offered to make me a spa bath, but I declined. She told me I am two different people when I drink. The funny guy or the mean drunk.

I am soo embarrassed. What have I done to my liver, will I ever be sober? Should I seek professional help? I have a great job with great medical insurance. 

Please help me get through this ordeal? Will I have a seizure? I take Lexapro and two high blood pressure medications and I am in relatively good shape. Big belly due to the wine I guess. I walk at least 10K steps a day and I am very active at work. I am also considered a worrywart.

I have tried AA once 5 years ago but it didn't stick. Oh, I also take buprenorphine strips because from 2010-2016 I took hydrocodone for a bad knee. I felt I was addicted and went to pain management dr who got me off those pesky pain killers. I still haven't been able to wean myself off of those though, although I wish I could.

I've been browsing this subreddit for a few weeks now and you all have helped me decide to tackle a problem I believe I have.

I'm only 24 years old and I am pretty sure I have a problem. My mom was/is an alcoholic and I'm terrified of becoming her. I'm not super sure where to start and I'm really sorry if this is a mess.

I started drinking when I was 17 or 18 and it really wasnt a problem at first. I was in university and of course everyone around me drank so it wasnt a huge deal. Fast forward to when I was 21 and I broke up with an abusive partner. I started to drink every single day because I never really could when I lived with him. I was in such a dark place and the alcohol provided a comfort while I was living alone in an apartment. I had a pretty severe anxiety/panic disorder and there was a point where I did not leave my place for 2 months straight and I dropped out of school.

My routine was basically wake up, clean a little, watch youtube and as soon as the clock hit 5 I would start drinking. I would end up falling asleep by 8pm and wake up at 3am. Sometimes having another in hopes I would fall back asleep. Rinse and repeat.

I was dating a little bit after a few months of my breakup and eventually I met my now fiance. I was still drinking most days but I wasn't drinking so much that I was constantly blacking out or passing out. I felt happier because I had my new boyfriend.

I think that's where the dependency started because I havent been able to not have a drink of anything for more than 3-4 days the hand full of times I decided to cut back. I don't usually have so much to where I'm belligerent, but if I do it's when I'm home alone. Before this week, I was drinking at least one drink every single day.

I'm so afraid to admit to my fiance that I believe I have a problem, even though I know he would just want to help me. Im sure he knows, he is too smart and too caring. I feel like if I tell him it sets it in stone and I really cant have another drink again and that thought scares me. I just want to be normal. I am so ashamed and I never wanted to be my mom, yet here I am. My dad divorced her after she started drinking again when he almost left her when my siblings and I were very young. I can't be that person. My dad is a very patient and loving man and he stuck it out for us when she was also toxic.

So here I am at 1 week without any alcohol. The majority of the week was pretty smooth sailing, but today I'm cracking. I'm typing this trying to convince myself not to walk across the street and grab a drink while my fiance is at work. I'm coming here to tell *someone* that I have a problem and I need help. Even telling strangers scares the hell out of me.

Feels great. I had a month before in November with the help of AA. However, alcohol still had a strong grasp on me. Shortly after that month I for some insane reason decided to drink. Didn't call anyone, just typical alcoholic impulsiveness/obsession.  Then the constant relapses came. Hangovers no longer existed just straight to withdrawals, which I cured with more drinking. 

My drinking was getting worse REAL QUICK. I never went on benders before. Now I was going on 3-5 day sprees. It was suggested I go to rehab by my temporary sponsor (I continued to go to meetings and was honest about my relapses). I had avoided going to rehab for a long time. It took another few weeks of sprees before I finally decided to just go. I surrendered.

I was fortunate enough to find a bed the day after a 5-day bender. It was a great experience. It kept me away from a drink but also gave me time to reflect on myself and to meet other addicts and to gain a new perspective on things.

I was diagnosed bipolar in February and since then, I've had to quit drinking. First, alcohol destabilizes my mood and second, it doesn't play well with my new medication. I thought I could get away with it. I tried having 2 very small glasses of red wine and ended up feeling quite drunk and was majorly depressed for two days afterwards. Now I'm swearing off of it.   


I was VERY sad at first. One of my most favourite things was to go to the local wine cellar and pick out something new to drink at home. I loved trying wines from different regions, years, etc. I loved going to wine tasting events. I think I mourned the taste and experience of wine much more than the feeling alcohol gives me. Non-alcoholic wines were disappointing beyond belief. None of the 6+ varieties I tried could even come close to mimicking the bold and full flavour of a good red. I was bummed.  


However, I discovered tea. I always thought tea was just Lipton tea bags or celestial seasonings. Kind of ""blah"". But, I learned that being a tea enthusiast can be a serious hobby. There are countless ways to brew it. You can get aged tea, reserve tea, barrel aged, etc. Reading about some of this definitely makes me feel that I can get that whole ""wine experience"" from tea. I ordered myself a nice loose leaf oolong, a white tea, and a green tea to start off with. I think this year, I'll ask my spouse for a tea gift basket for my birthday (tea cups, tea pet, etc)!

I have my own lovely place, in a lovely, different city, with my lovely stuff in it.

2 weeks ago, I was in that lovely place, and I was in a vicious spiral, on a wild bender - missing near 2 weeks of (remote) work, without even having the courtesy to phone in, radio silence to caring family and friends, lying in bed each day with a case of beer watching YouTube clips on my phone, not eating anything, really, but beer, and the odd pizza every few days when I worked up the energy to order one. A pretty typical spiral for me. I do this, crash-land, time passes, I do this again. Each time a little worse than the time before.

I, very, very grumpily, accepted the support of my family, and have been staying with them as I continue to (remotely) work from their place. I'm selfishly grouchy about it - on a conscious level, there's a big part of me that would rather be at my place, independent.

But you know what? I'm not drinking while I'm here, and who knows what direction I'd have gone if I didn't accept help. This little inconvenience is giving me time to get some good habits in place for a few weeks, to get my ducks in a row, and to build up the strength to take another stab at living by myself when it's time.

Let me jump straight to my main reason for reaching out: I am interested in the experiences and opinions of people here who have sought treatment for ADHD after getting sober. 

I am curious what led you to seek a diagnosis in the first place, and what that journey was like for you. Why did you suspect you might have ADD/ADHD symptoms, and specifically, how did you differentiate that from purely alcohol-informed patterns of living?

Further, what was is like finding the right kind of treatment and/or medication? What was is like adjusting to treatment? And how has life been for you since then?

I'm currently on a waiting list to be diagnosed via the Psychiatric Clinic at the University I attend. In the meantime, I'm trying to research a bit more beyond the books and online video stuff I've already come across and thought this subreddit would be a good place to come for info. Dr. Gabor Mate's ""In the Realm of the Hungry Ghost"" was what woke me up to thinking about ADHD in the first place a few months ago. Since then, I've found myself openly sobbing when reading or listening to even clinical descriptions of the hindrances that ADHD symptoms presents, and the ways that people have resolved those issues. I'd long thought that I was alone in this particular struggle, but am finding it alarmingly common, especially among addicts of any kind. 

One thing Dr. Mate brings up often is how commonly people who suffer from ADHD/ADD will self medicate due to the easy availability with alcohol. This was exactly my experience. I never really drank at parties because I felt poorly about myself, for example. I drank at parties because the atmosphere is generally loud, distracting, and hard to focus in. Alcohol was an effective medication, allowing me to ""magically"" be able to follow one person's voice out of many, to remember names and social connections, to more easily follow a story.

Similarly with school: I drank every night, not because I wanted blackout oblivion, but because my thoughts would slow down enough to follow through. A steady trickle of alcohol was incredibly effective in  beginning and finishing abstract academic goals that would otherwise seem completely out of reach. With a box of cheap wine, I could organize research papers and presentations easily and confidently. My instructors were pleased, if not impressed by the work I was accomplishing while drinking liters of wine!

Of course, the hangovers began to be nightmarish and the cycle of chemical dependant was way too high a price to pay. It felt like I was on death's door by the time I sobered up and reached out to a recovery community for help. I never want to go back to that way of living, but I do need to find ways of dealing with my particular neurological wiring. 

It's like I've been wandering in the mist for 37 years, my entire life, and just heard that someone has made an entire map of the territory that I've been stumbling through. I'd like very much to start looking at that map myself and learning from it. If any one here has experience with these matters, I'd be very grateful to hear about it. In all aspects of recovery, I have found that simply sharing our stories is one of the most potent healing factors out there, so I thank you for listening to mine so far, and thank you for sharing your own.

Both times I found that trying to drink and feel the effects I wanted was actual “work,” like it was hard trying to down a normal beer or a shot of whiskey. I used to drink more beer than water a year ago and now it’s a struggle even trying to drink a beer within an hour.

The effects didn’t seem so great either. I guess I felt drunk but it wasn’t that enjoyable nostalgic feeling. 

Woke up with heartburn, beer breath, slight liver pain, and a small hangover which reminded me of all those times I was deathly hungover where I’m pretty sure I was on the brink of alcohol poisoning but never went to the ER. Maybe it’s my liver enzymes and not being able to process alcohol anymore? 

In any case, this was an interesting experience finding out that my body can’t really stand alcohol anymore even if I try to force it to. It’s kind of a weird feeling... like I still miss that nostalgic drinking feeling but knowing that the effect isn’t the same for me makes me feel a little lost, like I was chasing a ghost for the past year for nothing.

When February rolled around I thought I was strong enough to moderate but we all know how that goes. I picked up essentially where I left off in December. March progressed pretty much the same.

I spent the first month out of the relationship doing more of the same - drinking myself into oblivion, doing drugs, hating myself, rinsing and repeating. When I saw her with another guy at a local bar I was thrown into a spiral and seriously contemplated suicide. 

Then the shelter in place started, and I found myself living on my own for the first time in my life, and really being single for the first time in my adult life. I called my health care provider and asked to start clinical therapy, something I’ve put off for the last three years. The clinician on the phone asked about my substance uses and abuses. Over the course of a one hour Q&A it became clear that I had a problem I was ignoring, and a vicious cycle of alcohol and drug abuse. 

She recommended I join their substance abuse program and get clean before I start therapy. She said her professional recommendation is that I maintain sobriety for at least 90 days before I begin therapy, so I break the cycle and minimize my chances of falling back on drugs and alcohol when I open all the wounds and start the hard work. I rejected the idea of joining their substance abuse program, and said I could maintain sobriety on my own for 90 days and that I am committed. She told me to call them back at 90 days. 

That was April 1st, and since then I’ve quit smoking, quit drinking, quit drugs, and have started a daily meditation practice accompanied by many books and podcasts on living an examined life through mindfulness. I’ve also reconnected with old friends and have been trying to live in radical honesty. One of my most immediate changes has been reconnecting with my sister in particular, who I used to be really close with but have neglected in the last 4-5 years. 

This morning I woke up at 5 and went on a sunrise run with her, and we just made breakfast in bed for our mom’s birthday. Mornings are my favorite time of day now.

A little voice tried to get me to drink last night, but I knew so well how much I loved sober mornings that I told it to shut the fuck up. Now, this morning I've been listening and jamming out to music while cleaning my apartment. A Saturday morning dance party! And I'm feeling great because I'm not drinking.

Staying locked up sucks; it sucked for me. Not many people can go back to work. But I hope everyone can find something to help them through each day, that you can have sober days where you feel good about not drinking. I've felt better today, after just one week, than I felt the past three months. 

Good luck all!

I've been very fortunate in that I haven't really had much in the way of cravings, except sugar cravings for the first 30.

Good - I've lost about 22lbs, I haven't lost my cell phone, keys, purse, I'm able to calmly remove dumbass people from my life without anxiety/depression blocking me.

&#x200B;

Bad - AA seemed like a good thing at first.  Maybe it's just that it's all online, now, but I am so over it.  I'm atheist.  The spirituality is annoying, and I feel like, while the steps in theory are fine, I just can't force my square self into their round hold.  My alternatives seem limited.  I've read about The Sinclair Method, but I have to drink, again, to get it to work.  I haven't had cravings, so....what if it doesn't work, and I've drank for no reason?  If that makes sense.  

&#x200B;

Ugly - My therapist has been in AA for over 30 years.  If I drop AA, he'll probably drop me.  I would have to find a new therapist.  Not all of my depression was alcohol-related.  My ex-roommate stole my anti-depressants, and while my emotions aren't extreme, I'm a little bit weepy.  I can get my replacements in about a week.    


Overall, I'm really glad I quit.  I feel like my life can only improve.  There are some hiccoughs right now, but I don't feel hopeless.

after years of ignoring my problem ive seen a lot of ppl around me get sober and i want to as well. ive had a drinking problem since the age of 16, it has affected my work, school, family, finances, spirituality, relationships, etc. im 22 now.

i tried to attend AA at 17 but  it was a Christian centric group and they really wanted me to say Jesus was god and stuff but im muslim. anyways substance abuse of all sorts is really prevalent in the lgbt community as well as impoverished communities and im both :/ im shopping around for helpful apps abt recovery if anyone has any suggestions, as i don't currently have a therapist. im trying to stay hopeful but i hope i will also be able to forgive myself if i make mistakes.

one thing that was alienating abt my AA experience was being a decade or more younger than everyone in the room. alcoholism is rampant in people in their 20s but no one is ready to address it. a man at the meeting said ""youre not even old enough to have an addiction!"" as a joke. 

i know i have hurt people emotionally with my drinking, and I have hurt myself both physically and emotionally from it. i am going to take a break from fasting and celebrate the month with alcohol abstinence instead and in time i hope to make amends to anyone ive affected. it is extremely difficult for me to talk about, write about, etc, bc i have so much shame surrounding alcohol. i know that it gets easier the more you talk about difficult things. my everyday depression has a lot to do with feeling like a disappointment to everyone. for years that shame kept me from even acknowledging my alcohol abuse bc i didnt want to be more of a disappointment. but when i see other people say that theyre working towards sobriety i never feel disappointed in them. i feel proud, inspired, and a little jealous!

i dont want bruises that i cant remember getting, i dont want headaches in the morning, i dont want an empty bank account, i dont want to sleep through meetings, i dont want to steal liquor, i dont want to speak without thinking, i want to get better!

many times i have tried to get sober silently without success so im trying to be more open about it. it will be difficult but i believe i need social support to make it work. inshAllah it will only get easier.",60,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.50370985}"

Originally (naively?), I had looked forward to celebrating myself on May 7th, 2020, which as other parents know, is a rare treat. I was going to take a spa day, do some shopping, and bask in the glow of my husband’s admiration (slight exaggeration there). Instead, Covid happened, and the economy happened, and my dad died unexpectedly and now the one-year anniversary of the much-improved sober me is going to look a lot different than I had planned. But sober I will stay, and May 7th will still be a triumph. Bad things don’t stop happening when you quit drinking, but I would argue that they are much easier to handle sober.

This is my first post here but I’ve been lurking for a long time on a different account. I need to take some steps to cut out my drinking, but there’s a huge barrier I can’t overcome. 

I’m in my mid-40’s and live in the uk. I’ve been drinking since my mid teens and have had long periods of relentless, night after night drinking over the years. The only time I managed to heavily reduce was about 10 years ago, after I got made redundant, and it was a massive change. I got into running, ran the London Marathon and generally got my shit together. Unfortunately, I also suffer from anxiety and depression, so as soon as my life changed (had 2 kids, 3 years apart), I started to slip back. 

Things stayed relatively stable until last year, when I was hit by a major triple whammy of my mum finding she had a brain tumour following a huge car crash (I’m an only child so a lot of responsibilities sat on my shoulders), starting a new job that was really stressful and being asked to be a best man for my close friend. After all this hit me within a 2 month period, I just started drinking every day. Wine is my drink of choice and I would go through around 2 bottles a day. 

I’ve hidden the scale of my drinking from my wife throughout, she and I have had major arguments about it for years. The biggest issue I have is that drinking is still the quickest way I have to feel... better? Happier? In control? 

But hiding it is something that I get lazy at, and for the 2nd time last night, after I promised to stop hiding my drinking a few weeks ago, my wife found another couple of soda bottles that I’d decanted wine into. Now we’re at a seriously perilous place. 

I feel absolutely awful for lying, and she’s right to feel betrayed yet again. I started seeing a rehab counsellor literally just before lockdown hit, and we were discussing options for treatment right up until she told me that they can’t currently meet with people. 

I want to stop but the awful feelings I get when I know I won’t drink tonight just tear me up. I’ve tried explaining the helplessness I feel to my wife but she’s a very different person to me and doesn’t see how this can control your motivations and willpower so totally. I’ve reached out to my counsellor to see if there’s anything that’s possible, but I don’t know what response I’ll get. Not knowing that there’s a solution available is just dragging me down into a pit. Hope someone can offer some advice.",4,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7555943}"
2020-05-02 06:43:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gc4fex/this_is_what_your_body_is_like_off_drugs_alcohol/,This is what your body is like off drugs (alcohol & others).,"Those silly commercials on TV were right. ""This is what your brain is like on drugs."" *Actor cracks egg and throws it into a frying pan.*

Off of drugs life is way better and this is coming from someone who tried nearly everything: weed, K2, pharms, alcohol, coke, meth, nicotine, shrooms, etc. I didn't do heroin or crack; those freaked me out and I didn't hang out with people who did it. Yet, of course, those two would have been easy to get. These days I do the occasional weed yet it is rare and was never a big habit for me.

I don't care who you are. We all look way more attractive sober. Better complexion, less bloat, better sleep (yes, that is still a struggle for many), and more all because alcohol is gone.

It is easier to deal with life's problems while sober.

It is easier to have good friendships and relationships while sober.

It is easier to have a strong mental state while sober.

Life without alcohol and other drugs is truly way better than with it. It's better to deal with life's problems directly.

I still dream of surpassing my only other attempt of 371 days, which is a big part of what prompted this post. I was thinking about my earlier posts during this sobriety attempt and it dawned on me yet again that something is definitely different this round. I'm still convinced I am off alcohol forever now. It's the only drug that got me hooked yet the desire & intent/plan to have it simply isn't there. Sure... fleeting thoughts to drink happen but nothing I cannot keep in check.

In the last 30 months I've only had roughly three weeks of heavy drinking which is crazy to me. I drank heavy since I was 17 (34 now) so I thought that was going to be me forever. Now I'm convinced it doesn't have to be. :)

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's not 100 days 'sober' as I've partaken in the occasional smoke, but it's 100 days since I've felt the kind of shame, embarrassment and financial burden that eventually became the only things I associated with drinking. Like most here my last day wasn't my 'rock bottom'-though it was pretty bad. And like most here again, this was not the first time I'd said 'I quit'.

But the thing that made it different this time was that I just felt 'done' in a way I never had before. With previous attempts, something had usually happened that made me feel I had to quit as a result. But in this case, it's just been utter repulsion at how long I'd let things slide, and my inability to get it under grips, that's made me feel like switch has flicked- I just don't see any appeal in being that way anymore (for me).

I have nothing against alcohol or those that drink it without issue, but for me I stopped getting anything good out of it whatsoever. And to make this time stick, I've kept on going out. I've still been getting in a 4am (well, pre-lockdown) but it's been sober and with nothing bad to report. I realised that if I was going to actively not-drink, I couldn't just avoid booze. That just reinforced the shame-spiral of 'I don't deserve anything'. And after the first couple of times it was okay! Watching other people make fools of themselves is far more entertaining than being the fool, and should you need to be present then you can be.

I finally started day treatment and learned about post acute withdrawal syndrome, or PAWS, and this knowledge has been an incredibly affective tool to maintain my sobriety. 

Basically, when you stop drinking the brain will begin to heal itself and rebuild neural networks. This can cause crazy emotions / reduce cognitive function to come out of nowhere and for no reason at all. While trying to go it alone I would hit one of these and just couldn’t handle it and squash it with a pint of whiskey. Now that I know it’s just the brain repairing itself and that it will inevitability cease I find it much easier to cope with. 

For anyone else new to sobriety or having a hard time staying sober here’s the video about PAWS my councilor shared with me that has been so incredibly helpful:

I'm really looking for a place I belong on Reddit. I look on this thread and it's so many success stories so I'm a little intimidated to post my questions / beginner story, but here I go:

&#x200B;

I don't drink that OFTEN anymore, but when I drink on the weekend it's still similar to how I drank in college. On Friday/Saturday night when I hit about 3 drinks I just get the feeling that I need to keep going and nothing in me wants to stop. I get a feeling in my stomach that I just want (need) another. Another drink will always get me where I need to be. If I'm with my friends/family, that drink will make me the most interesting guy in the room. If I'm at a bar it will make me the most charming guy there. It's literally a feeling in my stomach that I need another. It's so hard for me to ignore or dispute. If I put my head to it I can outwit it, but I need to be relatively sober for that to happen. I don't know, it's hard to explain my mental vs. physical feeling I have, so I'm really hoping somebody else is on the same page here and can offer me advice... 

&#x200B;

I want to know if this happens to other people. I've never heard anybody around me having the same issue so I feel so flawed.. It makes me feel so weak, but it's literally a physical feeling so I  find if very difficult to overcome.

&#x200B;

Not sure what to do, but if this is not the right place and you can point me in the right direction I will truly be grateful.

Yesterday was my 4 months sober. 4 months since the night I consider the darkest night of my life. It scares me still to think about it. I have deep cuts from that night that still looks pretty fresh and reminds me every day of the big fuck up. It also reminds me that I almost took my own life that night and the only thing that stopped me was thinking about how much I love my animals.

I'm struggling so much right now. I never wanted to quit drinking entirely, I just wanted to have a healthier relationship with alcohol like I used to in my early twenties, but what even is that? I'm scared of drinking, legitimately terrified. I'm scared to think of falling back into that dark place where I almost ended my own life because of my drinking.

I have started being part of a dnd group since I became sober. Most of the people in this group have never experienced me drunk and I'm glad that they haven't. Only one person has because we got way back (I think I've known him for over ten years) and last time I was drunk around him, my relationship with alcohol was decent and something I only did at parties.

Today was our dnd session day and it started terribly. I was woken up when our game master called me because I'd slept in. Nothing new really that I like to sleep and this whole lockdown deal isn't exactly helping my sleeping habits. After the session, the game master called me again to talk to me in private and ask me about being very quiet in our sessions. I explained to her that I'm really shy and that since this is the first time ever that I try dnd, it's still something I'm trying to get used to.

If I'd been drunk during the sessions, I wouldn't have been so quiet. I would have been able to do all the things that I'm too shy to do but think about during the sessions. I've really been contemplating getting just one beer or a glass of mead during our dnd sessions just to take the edge off, but I'm SO scared of drinking. The other people in the sessions talk about having a glass of something while we play, but I'm SO scared of even just one glass of anything containing alcohol.

I talked to another friend outside the dnd group about how I never wanted to stop drinking entirely but needed a break to get my shit together. We talked about maybe it's better to only drink socially and leave it at that, but what is social anymore? No events are happening because of the lockdown and even our dnd group had to move to discord chat because of it.

I've been thinking about asking some friends in my city for weed even though it's illegal in this country. It's not hard to get though, but last night I had a dream about getting busted for having weed on me and it scares me just as much as alcohol does. It's a hole I don't want to fall into. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Today I've really been thinking about saying fuck it to everything and just get a damned beer. I didn't, but logging off from today's dnd session and wanting to puke because I felt so depressed with myself that I couldn't be in my own body, really brought me close to going to the store down the corner for beer. I've been snuggled up in a blanket on my couch all evening and just wanted to cry and puke at the same time.

Back in the ""hey"" day of my drinking I used to be very proud that I drank almost every brand of beer there was on display. Of course if I went to a store that specialized in beer that wasn't always the case but at large chains it was rare that I saw a brand that I hadn't tried before. 

Today, when I walked through the checkout line and was browsing the beer selection there were so many new brands, so many beers I hadn't seen. Surprisingly, I didn't feel like I was missing out. I felt proud that it took 3 years for me to notice that the beer market has changed so much! I even mentioned this to my wife and she chuckled. 

I saw a post recently here that was (mildly) annoyed about how a lot of posts here are about how drastically and dramatically people's lives improve after they stop drinking. I must admit, while my ability to deal with what life throws at me has improved, my life itself hasn't changed all that much..

I constantly hear “you’re not an alcoholic, I’ve seen a “real” alcoholic”, which obviously doesn’t help with the recovery process when you’re hearing there’s nothing wrong with you when you actually know in your body and health there is. I consider myself high functioning as I still work everyday in a technical role however it has significantly impacted my ability to function at my best, normally off of around 4 hours sleep.

I feel like my doctor is just throwing pills at me. I don't even take aspirin more than maybe 2 times a year. So they started me out on librium for my first few days and that worked well, then wouldn't give me that again so they tried Trazodone which didn't do anything for me but possibly make it worse. Still had night sweats and rapid heart rate, no sleep almost 24hrs. Next day maybe 4 hrs sleep.

 Took those for 4 days, then they take me off that and give atarax and catapres together. Seems like my sleep didn't change I had shortness of breath out of nowhere and slept maybe 3-4 hours a night for about the last 4 days. Not so sure I should be on meds to lower my blood pressure I have a heart murmer as it is. I feel good during the day and the anxiety kicks my ass around happy hour to 4am. So as for the last 2 types of pills I got 30 days each. Less than a week in and I feel they are conflicting with each other and I'm not so sure on keeping on this regiment. 

I'm sorry to be confusing but anyone going to hard alcohol withdrawal seemingly shouldn't be bounced around from med to med, since i don't have a history of abusing pills. I don't know what works. 

I complained earlier and he gave me a script for lorazapam, said to stop the atarax and stay on the blood pressure meds with the lorazapam, again they seem like they shouldn't be mixed. Any guidance on people who have been kinda guessed with on meds, am I too confusing. I figured by the second week maybe I should just need help with the anxiety and insomnia.

I don't think they understand that part of my drinking is because I am not an easy going person and my laid back nature is only because I'm forcefully punching my personality down with alcohol.

In the beginning I thought I'd miss out on so much. In reality, I was missing out on life by living that way. I struggled for 25 years. I lost a wife. I lost a dream. I could have lost or taken a life.  My selfish habits were blocking me from my higher power and my fellow man. 

I made a decision.  We cannot heal that which we do not acknowledge.

At some point in the past year, I suddenly realized that a force greater than myself was doing for me what I could not do for myself. 

Today I'm experiencing a newfound hope and freedom that I never imagined possible.. and it's only been a year. For me, to be present and conscious is to live.

I drank occasionally but would mostly not drink. During the middle of our relationship, I caught her sneaking drinks in the bathroom. She cried and was panicking, telling me to not let her drink no matter what she told me. Fast forward, she started lying to me and drinking behind my back for maybe a month or a bit more. The stress from her job and our issues got to her. When it all came out, I told her I’d support her but that she needed to not lie to me and not sneak around, and she’d need to start going to meetings again and helping herself stay sober. She started withdrawing from benzos a couple days after this talk and said she needed to drink for a few days to stave off some of the withdrawal symptoms. I was scared. She looked in so much pain. I trusted her to know her body as she said she’s been through it before. So we both started drinking heavily for a week, until fights broke out between us and I couldn’t take the hurtful things she’d say to me while drinking or seeing her drunk on the floor because we had a fight. I started thinking I wasn’t good for her, and that our relationship was causing her to go down a dark path. I wish I would’ve supported her more by not enabling her, by telling her she didn’t need to drink that week or refill that Xanax 6-7 days after her last dose and a week of going through hell. I did tell her, but I didn’t want her to resent me either and I’m not a doctor, I lacked the energy, and therefore the clarity, love and care to really try to talk her out of it. I miss her like crazy, but I can’t see her or be friends. It hurts me too much. I do hope she’s doing well.

  The bender started off the same as the last two this month. I came up with the ultimate strategy to moderate my drinking - I'll only buy a 375ml bottle of vodka. That's it. When I'm out I'm out. Played some Halo and watched some TV. Bottles out. Time for bed.  
  
  Next day comes around. 2PM, my liquor store downstairs finally opens. Head in to grab my vodka ration. A bottle of white wine catches my eye. ""I'm having seafood for dinner, that'd be nice too."" Add that to my purchase. Drink the entire thing while I'm cooking and eating, then get into my vodka. Play Halo. Watch TV. Pass out.  
  
  Wake up. 2PM. Liquor store. Same thing as yesterday, but now I'm having steak for dinner. Vodka and Cabernet it is. Halo. TV. Pass out.  
  
  Wake up. 2PM. Liquor store. Not sure what I'm having for dinner. Guess I'll just get the vodka this time. Get home. Haven't eaten. Start drinking and playing Halo. No dinner plans. Run out of vodka and I'm hungry. ""They sell pretzels at the liquor store and it's only 6pm. I can grab those while I figure out dinner. It's too early to run out of booze, might as well grab another 375ml"". Eat half a bag of pretzels and do some work on the 2nd 375ml. Make a grilled cheese. Pass out.  
  
  Wake Up. 2PM. Head to the liquor store. Tired of running out of booze, I just buy a 5th. ""This is just so I can have a little more without having to make that extra trip"" later. Too hungover to go to the grocery store so still no food. Get home, eat some peanuts. Finish the bottle of the 375ml from the previous day. Start on my 5th. Eat some pretzels. Play Halo. Not even interested in Halo anymore but need to do something while I'm drinking. Pass out.  
  
  Wake up early for some reason. Don't feel bad, obviously drunk still but don't want to think that. Take a look at my 5th from the previous day. ""Nice, barely any damage done, just above half empty. Not bad"". Completely ignoring that I also drank the rest of that 375ml leftover from the previous day. Make a drink so I can go back to sleep. Pass out.  
  
  Wake up. Not feeling great. Stomach just feels weird. Eat some pretzels. Feeling better. Head to the couch and fire up the Xbox. Make a drink. Halo. Make a drink. Halo. Pretzels. Make a drink. Peanuts. Halo. Liquor Store. Make a drink. Halo. 11PM. ""Fuck I need to eat"". Find some soup in the pantry. Eat that. Pass out.  
  
  I woke up at 5am unable to fall back asleep. Weird - I went to bed pretty shitfaced the night before. I read on my phone for a few hours trying to get sleepy. It never came. By 9am I resorted to the magical solution - another drink. I made a couple weak ones and was able to sleep another couple hours. Wake up around 1pm. Not feeling great. Lay in bed for a while waiting for the hangover to pass. It's just getting worse. My stomach just feels weird- like I'm hungry in the most unsatisfying way. It's hunger but eating makes me sick. Eat some pretzels. Doesn't help. Drink some water. Doesn't help. Burp. Makes me gag. Start to retch. Cough. Retch. Oh shit. I'm gonna puke.  
  
  Run to the toilet. Everything comes out. I'm shaking, sweating, my eyes are bloodshot. Puking gives me barely any relief. Sit back in bed and try and eat some pretzels and drink some water. Try to sleep. Unsuccessfully.  
  
  9PM comes around. Still feel horrible. Stomach still feels exactly the same. Anxiety is cranking now. Know I need to try to eat. Get up and make a salad and some tea. Doesn't help. 10PM. I just want to sleep but know I wont be able to. Make a weak drink to try and help with that. 15 minutes go by. It's not sitting well. Wretch. Cough. Puke.  
  
  This puke was different though. First upheaval - there's my salad. What a waste. Second upheaval - There's my pretzels. I taste some peanuts too. Dammit. Third upheaval - Oh fuck. That's blood.  
  
  (*Sidenote: I did contemplate going to the ER and after speaking to friends, extensively searching google, and monitoring symptoms, I decided to hold off. I was not feeling dizzy, faint, or weak, my first two upheavals had zero red whatsoever. My feeling was that I was bleeding mildly in my esophagus from retching and violently puking, or that the redness was from chewable pink and purple alka-seltzers I had recently taken. If I puked up anything red again or began to feel lightheaded or anything I was going to call 911.*)  
  
  **This is where I realized shit needed to change.**  
  
  I get back into bed feeling better after puking. Eat a plain piece of bread and drink some water. lay down and *try* to sleep. By try I mean - I'd close my eyes and not be sleeping, but have the most rapid-fire off-the-wall nonsensical mini-dreams that just flowed from one to the other. I was awake but I wasn't, I was sleeping but I wasn't. It's a hard sensation to describe. I'm able to get this weird sleep-not-sleep for a couple hours until my stomach starts bothering me again. Lay in bed tossing and turning until 11am.  
  
  I spent the next couple days just trying to feel normal again. I had to start really slow eating, fighting to put down the smallest bit of oatmeal. Drink some tea, drink some water, take some vitamins. Fight off the nausea. Repeat this every few hours until night time.  
  
  Night sweats, insomnia, anxiety, depression, nausea, vomiting, a combination of constipation and diarrhea, disturbing dreams, these were just the physical symptoms I felt.  
  
  It's been 7 days since the night I got drunk and 6 days since I had my last bit of alcohol. I am feeling *so* much better. My gastritis is gone, my anxiety and depression have dissipated greatly. I am sleeping pretty well at night, just a little bit of night sweats. My shits are normal. I don't feel like I'm going to die. I feel like I want to be healthy.

Beltane is when we're halfway between the start of Summer and beginning of Spring.  Essentially a halfway point of Spring.  It really doesn't feel like it here, hopefully we won't get any more snow!  There's always hope.

It's typically celebrated with a bonfire and just letting loose and getting wild.  And lots of alcohol.  

We can still get wild without alcohol.  Drinking isn't rebellious.  It's not counter culture.  It's not authentic.

I'm going to go out on a limb and make the argument that alcohol isn't at all wild.  It's quite predictable, especially over an extended period of time.  A structured pattern of randomness emerges.  At first it's fun and wild and amazing, but that fades into something mundane at best.  

In reality my Friday nights would usually consist of me waiting for my daughter to go to bed, then drink, and forget what I watched on Netflix the night before.  That's not very wild.

In these days, one can achieve wildness by going less than seven feet from another human, BUT NOT LESS THAN SIX FEET, and of course with a face mask!  Anything closer than that is an act of pure rebellion!

Sitting on your couch drinking alcohol and watching Netflix, not wild.  

We need to try and have hope, we need to have clarity, we need to embrace life... tragedy and all.  Alcohol provides none of these potentials.

Unfortunately, no bonfire for me.  But I'm going to not do the dishes, eat some ice cream, drink some tea (maybe two cups?!), probably not though because moderation in all things, even excess...  Toss and turn for a few hours, then wake up around 8:00PM and off to work!!

A lot of what limited my drinking was 'doing other stuff', so I am sure I would have been drinking way, way too much. I am also very grateful that I had more than a year under my belt when this all started, as I am sure if would have been more difficult. 

Speaking of difficult, my best wishes for anyone embarking on the journey or who is very early in their sobriety. You picked a tough time but the rewards are there. I drank too much for close to 30 years - I turn 59 next month and am looking forward to an alcohol-free retirement!

Stay well, everyone.",19,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6770723}"

With my marriage. That failed in part because we are both alcoholics and I made tremendous mistakes in that relationship. I sat up sweating. Normally, I would look to my night stand for my bottle of vodka or whatever was left of wine and take some swigs to hopefully calm me down. But since I'm not doing that anymore, I only had my Perrier water. For a few minutes, I contemplated the time that it would take for a grocery store up the street to open up (7 am) and fantasized about going out for something. But I'm writing you instead.

In the car park I bump in to my parents buying beer because they had a bad day, water tank in their loft space is broken and their ceiling is ruined so they were buy alcohol to deal with it, and I still went home without alcohol.

I start making dinner and go to grab mayo bad realise we're out, my partner also wanted crisps so I popped back out. Bought 5 beers and two root beers whilst I was there, drank two bottles of beer before going back in to the house... No shame, sat down to start Control and shame washed over me... Was I about to deceive my partner again?!... Well yes, I already had... poured the other three away in the kitchen secretly and went back to sparkling water.

When will I finally gain the control I need. I feel the resolve building, especially by being bale to stop after starting but I'm still frustrated, would have been a week without the blips. Sod it, eyes forward.

Today I was ineligible to sell plasma because my heart rate was too high. I'm very certain that the reason my pulse and blood pressure are consistently elevated is because I'm hungover every day, so since my drinking problem has now cost me $200+ dollars in lost income I manned the fuck up and didn't buy a bottle of anything on the way home. Then my commitment wavered and I snuck a few shots from my parents' liquor cabinet. Then my self-control came back and now I'm sober again. And I fucking hate it. I'm just... mad. So mad that I can't sleep. I'm doing all the coping mechanisms but they don't *work*. Drinking works. I wouldn't be mad if I'd just gotten a bottle so I could drink as much as I want. I'd be drunkenly answering questions on /r/NoStupidQuestions before happily drifting off to a dreamless sleep. Sure, I'd feel tired and sluggish all day tomorrow until my body recovered just in time for me to start drinking again, which is what I'm hanging on to. But in some ways I'm happier that way. The world is so much simpler when you don't have the mental energy to focus on anything except what's in front of you.

Ive been lurking on these forms for a while. I want to stop drinking but im honestly afraid to. I love drinking. However I dont think it loves me, it seems to be ruining me.

&#x200B;

Tuesday night I thought to myself Im going to have a couple beers after work. Well instead that turned into me having 20. Calling my boss sounding like a drunken idiot saying im to sick to come into work. Ordering a ton of takeout food that i didnt need. (waste of money) Getting into fights over text. I feel so ashamed over it. When i woke up i felt so anxiety ridden (it was horrible, wanted to crawl in a whole and dye) and i layed in bed literally the whole day hungover, once again. I could keep going on with more stories but im sure you get the picture.  Ive never gone more then a couple nights of heaving drinking, and im fighting to stay sober tonight. Its so hard.

&#x200B;

I need to quit drinking to save my life. Im so tired of the hangovers(especially the intense anxiety), the way i act, the legal trouble, financial trouble, relationship trouble and yet I want to drink so bad. I hate it.
