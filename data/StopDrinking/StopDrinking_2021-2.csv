2021-02-27 23:33:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lu65nf/becoming_a_mother_during_a_pandemic/,Becoming a mother during a pandemic,"I’ve been in an unhealthy relationship with alcohol for a long time but its toxicity in my life became exponentially worse once I became a mother. I was 6 months pregnant when covid hit the country hard, and I never touched a drop during my pregnancy but it seemed like once I had my daughter, being a new parent, a newly stay at home parent, during a pandemic- was the perfect storm to send my alcoholism into a fucking whirlwind. 

I’ll admit I romanticized the idea of motherhood when I first discovered I was pregnant, which meant an incredibly emotional high for 9 months anticipating my life with a baby of my own, and staying home, taking a break from the full time work life which had been my reality for the entirety of my adult life after graduating high school. This was a dream come true as someone who always knew they’d someday become a mother although the timing of it happening wasn’t ideal. 

I don’t want to write a novel here but almost immediately after having my daughter the fantasy was crushed, ironically within minutes. She never latched which meant my beautiful,....  fantasy of motherhood, laying in silk sheets with large lactating breasts being sucked on by a tiny smooth helpless newborn were met by a screaming angry peeling alien who was only further pissed off when I tried to calm her crying with my poor oversupplying and desperate breasts. She rejected me immediately and I’ve never really come to terms with the fact that it wasn’t personal. I spent 6 months pumping my milk just to retain some semblance of control over the situation. deep down I just felt angry over the fact that other moms got to watch as their babies breastfed from their bodies directly while I had to try to find time during my busy day to allow this robotic machine to mechanically remove milk from my body so that I could force feed my daughter what I so desperately just wanted her to just take from me. 

My daughter is the biggest reason I’m sober, the most motivating factor I could ever ask for, and yet one of the largest sources of hurt because I allowed myself to have a teenage idea of what being a parent would be. This only increases my desire to escape. Instead of feeling exhilarated by motherhood and the freedom from a 9-5, I was stripped of what little structure I had without any of the freedom one would crave with all this newfound free time. 

I guess I’m just feeling incredibly lonely, it feels so niche to be a new parent during a pandemic... but I bet it isn’t all that uncommon. And I could really use some solidarity tonight.",9,"{'pandemic': 3, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64046806}"

The best thing about sobriety, though, is that I can handle the lows now. I don't have to drink about it, it doesn't last forever, and it's not as bad as it used to be.

I've just been having racing thoughts and crazy insecurity. I'm insecure about my intelligence, my ability to do things, my personality, my mind in general. I worked hard to lose weight and look good, but now I feel like I have nothing else to offer. I feel like I can't talk to people, don't know how to. I feel like I'm boring and have nothing to say or contribute.

I try to read and make art and find interests but all I really want to do is eat and watch TV.

Maybe I need to journal. Or see my therapist again. I just feel very trapped in my head. I need to call a sober person and talk to them about it (or my sponsor!!) but I just have no interest in talking to anyone right now...

I just feel like I'm not good enough right now I guess.

2021-02-27 22:24:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lu49k2/one_year_today/,One year today,"I had a sip of sake on New Years to be social with my in-laws, but it was from a glass the size of a sewing thumb guard. Last year, I made a point of not getting drunk, but not making alcohol an all-consuming demon. I just know that if I have a beer or glass of wine, I end up wanting to have six or more, and then even more for the next few days until my body revolts.  But a few sips in a social setting isn't going to start me down a slippery slope, and didn't. That'll be a once in a blue moon thing.

So I last got drunk on February 28, 2020.  I went through the pandemic and ups and downs of the year on my own terms. 

I think the timing of the pandemic helped. I didn't go to any social gatherings where people asked me to drink. Life was so upside down, I stopped watching TV (TV can be really boring when you're sober!), and started reading every day. I spent the money saved from not buying alcohol on books, and focused my free time on hobbies like reading, writing and drawing. I bought a PS4 and played 300 hours of games in a year. I restructured my home lifestyle. 

I wanted so much to just automatically lose weight, and I haven't lost a pound. I eat way more ice cream and potato chips than before. Despite this, the amount of fat on me is down slightly, my face slimmed down, and people have asked if I lost weight. But my weight on the scale hasn't changed. That's a goal for 2021.

Emotionally, I'm better. I have ups and downs, and they can be consuming and frustrating, but that's part of life.  I know I'm not special in that way. That's a feature of being a human.

I feel like I created a more stable base for myself. My personal problems haven't magically disappeared, but I'm facing them more than I'm glossing over them or wallowing in them, and I'm facing them hopefully with more compassion than I did in my past.",92,{'pandemic': 2},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4685839}"

I even went next door and bought myself a chocolate frozen yogurt because my sugar craving hit (lollll is been strong all week).

I admitted that drinking had been giving me anxiety and I was taking a break, and my friend offered to be someone I can reach out to if I ever want to have a sober hangout. I thought that was nice to hear.

I don’t know... I just wasn’t craving it today. I didn’t struggle that bad despite the circumstances I was in. I know it’s like hot and cold when I have cravings, but I’m thankful I wasn’t having a hard day or I’d have opted out on my friends for sure.

I’m also thankful my SO has been telling me how proud he is of me each day for not drinking. He’s been out of town and he knows I struggle with drinking alone. It kinda helped with my accountability. I wanted to be trustworthy and headstrong and continue to make him proud.

I’m not setting hard goals on us tho, because I don’t want to get myself overloaded and quit (I’m notorious for that). But considering it’s close to a month of being sober, and my cravings are subsiding more and more everyday, I can add a little more pressure than normal. 

All I did really today was garden (like usual) and I cooked. Tonight for dinner we ate salmon and shrimp cooked in creamy baked garlic and that feta tomato pasta that’s viral on tiktok- it’s really good but not as good as all the hype made me think it was. I added a few of my own ingredients to spice it up. 

I got a $50 gift card from my aunt for Amazon so instead of pawning it off for booze money I actually spent it.. I bought a knock of nutribullet and a cheese making kit! How cool is it going to be making my own cheese !

I was watching the movie Palm Springs on Hulu. Great movie, but pretty much every single scene (not exaggerating) involved alcohol consumption. Cravings kick in about 20 minutes in but I don't give in and kept watching until the end. 

Once it was done I took a walk outside to calm my cravings and thought about how it would have went if I decided to pick up some booze toward the beginning of the movie. I would have drank at least 5 or 6 drinks before the movie was over. Probably would have missed a lot of details in the movie and not enjoyed it as much. Once the movie was over I would feel the blood alcohol dropping, which is a terrible feeling. Best case scenario, by some miracle I may have decided to stick to not drink for the rest of the night and wait out the crappy feeling since it's either that or keep drinking to offset the terrible feeling of sobering up. The rest of my night would be shot because once my blood alcohol gets close to zero I still don't feel how I did before I started drinking. I still feel much worse and will probably have a terrible night of sleep to look forward to, and still wishing didn't well into the next day that I didn't drink. 

Here is the little extra part: I was able to put myself in that place pretty well, and actually started feeling kind of bummed as if I actually went through it. I then imagined being granted a second chance to go back and decide not to drink for the night. I snapped my fingers like a genie granting a wish and examined myself. I felt energetic and clear headed compared to how I just imagined myself feeling while going through the hypothetical scenario. I am now looking forward to eating some pizza, reading, a good nights sleep later, and doing stuff I enjoy that I don't enjoy nearly as much if I drank.",60,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45806614}"

System 1 thinks fast, automatically processing incoming information. System 2 is responsible for more complicated stuff like logic and long division. The author is careful to point out that there's aren't really separate systems but are used descriptively to help explain what happens, rather than to describe reality of neurons firing or not.

Anywayyyy... I've been enjoying thinking about turning off system 2 deliberately or just to go with the flow today, not to worry too much about what I'm doing or why, really just to live in the moment and let my automatic self do its thing and what do you know? My automatic self hasn't felt this free since you know when and started planning a trip to you know where. So I figured it was time to automatically come here and turn on system 2.

System 1, a lot of people call the lizard or monkey brain and blame it for relapses, but I'm seeing now, however automatically these words are flowing that system 2 is still needed when certain situations are recognized.

I’ve had a few anxiety attacks after sobering up, but they are different than the panic attacks. My first thought and instinct was: I need a drink. Needed to forget, to calm down, that was the only way I could control these attacks in the past. But I didn’t.

My panic attacks come from my fear of death, of the nothingness that follows after we die. What’s the point of living if it’s all going to end any way? But I’ve been treating it for years, and I know I want to live, specially now, that I’m fully sober and able to actually feel things around me. I can’t numb this anymore, but I’m doing everything I can to avoid it, so much that this is my first panic attack in more than a year! Even so, my first thought was to run from it, anyone that has had a panic attack can certainly say that’s not a pleasant thing, and if we can stop it we will try it. But today I didn’t have in, and I also don’t feel guilty for my feelings. Yes, if I got drunk it would certainly help me calm down and stop the panic attack, but a few minutes of peace (even though they may seem like hours) are not worth throwing away years of work on my self and almost 500 days sober.

I chose homemade beef and broccoli and it was so good! So good in fact I took pictures of it.

Why the fuck would Walmart in small-town Kentucky run out of oyster sauce? What the fuck are people putting it in? Friggin soup beans and cornbread? Fuckin ay, I digress.

I started drinking when I was 16 or 17. I'm 31 now. I was a dorky friendless kid who desperately sought acceptance, but couldn't seem to crack the social code in middle or high school. I graduated young, at 16, and saw an opportunity to reinvent myself in college - I could be whoever I wanted and was well versed in the qualities I'd idolized in my peers but didn't organically possess. I got an hourly job at a local Jamba Juice, tried to shed the \~15 pounds of baby fat I'd been carrying around most of my life, used the money I was making to purchase trendy clothing and makeup, and spent hours practicing the things I'd say to folks when I was finally invited to parties or on weekend trips. None of these things helped. I didn't feel different or more worthy or truly comfortable until the day some of my coworkers brought a bottle of Malibu to the store.

That shit changed everything.

Suddenly I'm hilarious, I'm effervescent, I can look people in the eye and talk about anything without a quiver in my chin or hands. I recalled pop culture facts that I hadn't even registered seeing or reading, I confidently made really salient points about big issues. I was fucking *smart*. For the first time EVER, I felt like I had a seat at the table. Alcohol was magical.

My new work buddies were fun and they thought I was fun too. I was intoxicated by having community - intoxicated, hah - and it wasn't long before I prioritized getting drunk at so-and-so's nightly house parties over coursework and midterms. I dropped out of college midway through my second semester after being placed on academic probation, and from there my life was never the same.

I don't remember much of my twenties. There were a few big milestones that are permanently seared into my consciousness - like the time I got arrested for throwing a rager at the townhouse my family had moved out of, but that my keys still unlocked; the time I got so drunk at a friend's frat that the paramedics were called because I'd stopped breathing; the time I was found unconscious on a dance floor, and when someone tried to move me I pissed my pants. I remember my DUI vividly, even though my BAC was so high I should have been dead. I remember every time an employer expressed concern after I'd taken it a little too far at the company holiday function. I remember (most of) the times I've been sexually assaulted. I will never forget my dad, broken, telling me it was killing him to see me killing myself. But as alcohol claims memories, it also helps bury regret - I'd cultivated the persona I'd always wanted and was everyone's favorite partier and was drowning in friendships. I was A Somebody and Having A Really Fucking Good Time. And up until this morning, I was prepared for this to continue to be my life.

I'm starting a new job on Monday after three weeks of funemployment. This is the longest vacation I've ever taken, and as alcoholics do, I saw cause for celebration. Without the structure of a schedule, I've spent the last 21 days fucked up after spending most of quarantine fucked up, and this morning I woke up convinced that I was dying. I'm no stranger to hangovers - there have been many Sundays spent shivering in an airport or an Uber as I make my way home after a serious bender - but today was different. My heart was beating at an irregular rate, I couldn't form a coherent thought, and when I stood to make a Bloody Mary to take the edge off, my legs gave out from under me and I collapsed. My partner was hungover as hell next to me and waved off my concerns as he fought to get more sleep (he drinks just as much as I do. Our relationship is built on a foundation of getting shitfaced together) so I did as one does when they're worried they're about to croak and asked Google.

One of the search results was a link to a thread here, in this subreddit, about the symptoms of withdrawal and how it really can be fatal. I read stories about recovery, stories about lost loved ones, stories about how, as it happens, no one's actually more hilarious or more effervescent or smarter when they're drunk. I saw myself in all of you, and after fifteen years, I think I'm ready to give sobriety a try. If I don't, I'm not sure I'll make it.

I have a very judgemental and narcissistic family and have broken away from them recently and have gone, and am going through a lot of pain and abuse as a result. So, through the process of standing up to them, I turned to two - three glasses of wine each night over only the worst three days to cope. 
The change was amazing. I was horrible. I was taking the stress out on others. I was being unreasonable and unfair and my reactions to things were so heightened. I shouted at my kids again, like when I was really drinking to cope and I wasn’t able to cope at all. With such a small amount of alcohol and yet it was so apparent. 
I get it. I can see the difference. 
At night I would love to have the relaxing enjoyment of a glass of wine but it’s not enjoyable really. It’s filled with guilt, anger and the effects hurt me and my family. 
I don’t know that I will never have another glass, or that I will stay completely away from wine forever. I’m not sure I’m there yet and I actually really like the taste. But it won’t be alone, in my house and it won’t be as a result of need to escape or as a coping mechanism. 
I won’t convince myself I will be ok and won’t feel guilty. 
One day very soon, I know that it will be a never again. 
For now I focus on waking up each morning feeling good, not feeling guilty and knowing that I can cope with anything thrown at me honestly and aware.

2021-02-27 17:27:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ltyw5z/the_fumble/,The Fumble,"I’ve been debating making this post for awhile now but I’m finally here so here we go. I’m an alcoholic with minor anxiety and depression, and I’ve been using alcohol since I was 19 years old. I’m turning 25 this year and becoming a father in July. I wanted to reach out to this subreddit because being sober has proved to be a challenge for me since 2016. It’s not that I can’t stop (I quit for 3 months last year) but it’s seems like once I slip up and relapse I struggle to get back on that wagon. It’s become such a big part of my life that I’m beginning to worry for my mental and physical health. The vicious cycle of alcohol abuse has taken a toll on my body and mind, I sense that with each hangover I can feel the torment I put myself through more and more with increasing episodes of anxiety and restlessness when detoxing. 

Last night I consumed quite a bit of alcohol and had to work this morning. I woke up with a headache and only five minutes to get ready, and all I could think about was how much I wanted to attempt easing the ugly feeling in my body with a beer I had leftover. Yet I’ve learned that method of coping only prolongs the duration of the hangover. In fact, I’ve used that same method on multiple occasions, which led me to then binge drink for days; running from the inevitable, and no longer drinking for enjoyment but out of fear of alcohol withdrawals. I’ve been to the ER a few times when withdrawing due to the overwhelming anxiety I experience when sobering up, on top of the shakes and excessive vomiting coupled with insomnia. This is a really big red flag for me, looking back at the start of my drinking habit and seeing such a dramatic change. I used to go to the river every week and be content with sharing a pack of beer with my buddies, maybe a few shots of vodka and then stop feeling satisfied. But I don’t get that same sense of fulfillment anymore. 

It’s become apparent to me that this means I should stop drinking all together, yet upon making that decision I find myself fumbling my sobriety over and over. It’s actually embarrassing but I feel the need to put this out there, to see if anyone else has shares the same patterns as me. I really want to be sober, and the more I try and fail, the more I see how much I really need the stability of sobriety in my life. So here I am, feeling vulnerable but happy to share my story of living with a drinking habit. It runs in both sides of my family so I’m sure I have some type of hereditary gene that makes me prone to alcoholism but I don’t see it as an excuse or anything. I just want to be better, but lately it seems like I’ve drifted so far away from that path I don’t know what to do anymore. If anyone has any ideas or guidance for me, I’d really appreciate it. I’ve talked to a lot of my friends about sobering up but can’t seem to take my own advice lol.

Thanks for taking the time to read this post. I know I’m not the only one, but it’s time for me to get real with myself and face this addiction head on. I have to be a strong father when my child comes, and to me, that means being sober with more healthy methods of coping with stress and anxiety. I hope you’re doing okay out there amongst all this craziness in the world. Hopefully everything will start looking better soon.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7609452}"

But I’m ready.,"I have been a lurker to this page for a while, and it has really helped me to stay sober for about a month or so. 34 days to be exact. I have been a heavy drinker since the age of 18 (I’m 24 now) and it has mostly been combined with heavy drug use. Although I am proud to say that I have not touched cocaine or amphetamine in over 10 months now, alcohol was something I’d never thought of being a problem until now. It lurks in the background. It creeps up on you. It’s there when you want it to be there. It exists in normal consumer society as if it is normal and harmless. I have tried to silence it’s seductive voice with cannabis use over the past few years, only to find myself drinking again instead of smoking because of the anxiety cannabis gives me. A couple of days ago I broke my sober streak... I moved places to live, and my GF decided she was ready to have a drink again (she had a problem with alcohol too but she quit a couple of months before I did) and I felt like I was finally able to enjoy alcohol too, since I had accomplished being 34 days sober. I was wrong. During my time sober I felt great. The first few days were hell, but I made it through and after that I had more energy, less brain fog and I felt like I could handle the stress of being an adult. Now, after 4 days of picking up my habit again I sleep longer and I wake up tired, my meds do not seem to work anymore (Vyvanse and lisdexamphetamine) and I feel worthless, anxious and straight up miserable. Moral of the story here is that I am not the person to enjoy one drink every now and then. I’m the kind of person that either has to drink until there is nothing more to drink, or the person that has to stay sober no matter what. I choose the latter. I have had enough. Sorry for the rant.

The main trigger today was that I phoned a very good friend and he told me he was going to be a father again, for the second time in a short time.
This is a topic that always makes me feel super melancholy because somehow it makes me feel my loneliness even more. Of course I was happy for him too, no question about it.
Unfortunately, my girlfriend is not much help, she already has an almost grown-up son from another man and does not want any more. I can't really talk to her about it either, because she then corrects me immediately and blocks me.
In addition, we have been having a lot of difficulties with our relationship lately anyway.

I just bombed a grad school test, it's my birthday and I have no plans with anyone because people canceled. I'm depressed, I live alone and I can't stop crying. I feel so demoralized and just want to shut my brain off and drink. I don't want to feel or be me. Please help.

Edit: wow! I am speechless at this support. Thank you! Who would have thought my biggest Reddit post would be me going completely unhinged? After sobbing for a few hours, it stopped raining outside so I was able to go over to a friend's house. We ordered way too much Ethiopian food and invited the neighbors over on the back patios. It was a good time and felt some degree of ""normal"" (we're still very shut down where I am). I emailed a tutor to work on the test and we'll try again. Today, my boyfriend is ordering me cupcakes from my favorite spot and he's coming down for two weeks starting next week (he's currently at school). I'm going to take an entire week off and just decompress--some of that time we will be in a cabin in the woods!. 

I think the scariest thing about yesterday is how quickly I can get unhinged and want to destroy my brain. All the yoga, therapy, exercise, healthy eating, ""self-care"" doesn't prevent me from getting to that out-of-control dark place. I have a therapy scheduled tomorrow and scheduled an appointment with my doctor to talk about readjusting my meds. I feel like to brain is broken, but I'm just going to try and keep fixing it. 

Thank you, everyone, for this outpouring of support. I am truly touched and inspired by this level of kindness from internet strangers.  I **did not drink** last night and am very proud of that. If there's one mark of improvement, it's my sobriety. (You are all right that if I were to drink I would feel *way* worse today and have another level of disappointment.)

I'm up at a reasonable enough hour drinking a cup of coffee. My cat is laying at my feet in my slippers (she likes the smell, it's weird) and I'm going to keep trying this ""forward progress"" until things get better.

You all are lovely rays of joy and happiness in an otherwise dark world. Remember your light and, as you've said to me, please be kind to yourself. You are wonderful people who have made my shitty day so much better.

If I go further than 5 drinks, suicidal thoughts are definitely going to happen.

I've never been addicted to alcohol, this being proven by the fact I can count on my fingers how many times I've got drunk. The effects I mentioned really worry me though.

I started drinking to cope with depression, but didn't start drinking heavily until last January when I lost my job.  School was online, I had no job, and all I could do was sit at the house depressed and get drunk.  I barely even remember last year I was so perpetually drunk.

But I got my job back last fall.  I was surrounded by great coworkers and had something to keep me occupied.  School was still bumpy with me because of the online courses.

Now I've had time to really get to know some of my coworkers.  They're great, and I really look forward to seeing them every time I go in.  School is going well too, I managed to snag some in-person classes; online didn't suit me - or perhaps I was just too drunk to really apply myself online.

Even so, I was still drinking.  But this past Thursday I got very drunk and like I've done two other times in the past I whipped out my phone and texted something really stupid to a co-worker.  It was nothing bad, just more embarrassing for me than anything.  Fortunately they're not upset and haven't blocked me or anything so that's all good.  I know I'll be pretty nervous the next time I see her, but I'll get past it.

Anyway, I woke up Friday morning and beat myself up over it.  I couldn't believe I sent that to her.  Facepalm all day.  And of all the stupid and dangerous things I've done, all the decisions I've made, this was the one that broke the camel's back for me.  We were getting along and working together really well - and I pull something like this.  I must seem so pathetic to her now.

But it's time to get it back together.  I reached out to the local AA group and at least have that resource  if I need it (they don't meet in person anymore due to COVID-19).

And I know it's going to be hard.  My depression is still there and it's going to be tough to deal with; and sober me with depression can be just as bad, if not worse, than alcoholic me.  But I just need to find the room to cope - keep looking forward, surround myself with good people, and stay busy.

It's time to drop the booze and go back to my plan: go to the gym, be a good worker, and get the education that I want.

Today marks my 1 Year Sober. Today is also a Full Moon - coincidence? I think not. 

Releasing what no longer serves me. 

After a night of drinking, I would wake up with terrible hangover anxiety. This anxiety for the next few days would spill over into feeling depressed. The following week after a night of drinking felt awful. When it got real bad, sometimes I would call into work “sick”, I would hide in my room for days, I would aggressively binge eat, I would close myself off socially to people, I would have suicidal thoughts etc. 
It. Got. Weird. 

The last year I’ve been doing some shadow work. What brought on that heavy drinking all through those years? Why would I get into a group of people; friends/family, strangers and just go balls to the wall? 

My big wake up call was realizing I’ve been living with high functioning anxiety. Getting into groups of people made me internally panic. 
I felt flooded by anxiety and would drink just to get through these interactions - any amount of shyness felt muted. 

The last year has been eye opening. The anxiety still exists. I still feel out of place. Some days socializing is a real pain in the ass, but guess what? I’m being patient with myself. I’m reminding myself a lot of other people feel these same things. Acceptance and authenticity has been helping through these times. As well, deciding to sit with the discomfort instead of numbing it has been my reminder. 

Since going sober, I’ve entered more conversations with depth. I’ve had moments with people that feel more human. People are starting to understand the real me. I’ve practiced setting boundaries. I’m in a relationship with someone who also doesn’t drink. I allow myself to feel my emotions, not try to run from them. Overall, it’s been a transformation that needed to happen. 

Another discovery I’ve learned about myself is that I really love to be alone. I’ve always felt drained after being around people. I’m an introvert at heart and that’s okay! Using alcohol to make me funnier, louder, and more lively is lame AF. I’m fucking great the way I am. I don’t have to shift myself to be more of what I feel the world wants of me.

Anywho. You guys, we can do this. Sober living makes life vibrant again. We are on this earth to live, to feel, to laugh, to cry & to mature through this human experience. Please don’t edit that out with alcohol.

Today I am 14 months sober. I’m proud... but it also means I have zero distractions or numbing from the emotions I feel now, in particular - pain. 
Getting sober meant finally sorting out my mental health, moving to a new city by the ocean, I cut all toxic ties, and I started therapy. I’m going the right things and I’ve come so far... but having to finally experience and truly feel pain, grief, hurt, fear and loss without numbing agents is the hardest thing in the world right now. 
I’m recovering from a lot of trauma as it is, and today I was rejected and dismissed by someone I once cared about, and the shock and confusion of that rejection, being asked to leave, being turned away (not for anything I did) sent me into a pit of despair, and I cried my heart out the whole 30 minute walk home. 

Whilst I was crying I kept thinking, how am I going to feel this pain and these emotions in sobriety without losing my mind? How do I deal with pain now? I can’t drink, I can’t self harm, I can’t cling to a relationship, I can’t use sex. I just... feel it. I’m just in agony. I’m recovering from over a decade of chronic trauma, I’m only a year into my healing journey and it’s the best thing I’ve done for myself yet the most agonising and most painful. I know healing takes time, I just want to get to the part where I’m fixed and I can enjoy my life and be happy. I’m only 25 years old, but sometimes I feel about 35 because I grew up too fast, and I’ve gotten sober at a time where all my peers are drinking all the time. If I’m going to live into my 80s, I’ve got another 50 years of all these emotions! It sounds so daunting and exhausting. 

What are the healthy ways that you’ve learned to manage pain and hurt in sobriety? How do you release it? Does pain go away or is it stuck there?

I could have fun with my friends without turning into a mean, sloppy drunk who breaks the rules (not in a good way). I could go for days without drinking. I would have a glass of wine at a classy bar and thought that chugging vodka from the handle was pathetic. I had more important things to do than drink - I had hobbies, a social calendar, ambitions.

But then I did a bunch of stuff that cannot be undone. I drank so much that I broke relationships, trust, laws, belongings. I drank so much that I became physically addicted. I drank so much that I crashed my car while holding a bottle of vodka.

That downward slide is inevitable, and in some cases, it gets steep real quick. Sometimes I think I'm lucky that it got so steep so quick. What if I just kept getting shittier and shittier for the rest of my life and never figured out what was making me so miserable?

These are things I think about when I entertain thoughts of a relapse. If I relapse, I wouldn't go back to having a glass of wine and giggling with my friends. I'd just go straight for the bottle of cheap vodka, crouching in a dark corner of my room, crying tears of despair.

I drank heavily throughout the rest of that month and the first week in February. I didn't drink 2/8 and then decided to call it quits on 2/10. I slipped up twice but, counting today, I have gone 17 days this month without a drink. It's been a while since I've accomplished something noteworthy like that.

I'm a 33F and my withdraws weren't terrible. The main thing that has been prevalent is anxiety. I was a moderate drinker up till about 2015/16 where it grew heavy. After covid, it's been a rollercoaster.I struggled with drinking and sobriety from June up until this month where it seems to actually be sticking with the exception of two slip-ups. March through May last year was a binge because of the anxiety and panic attacks I would have constantly due to covid and lockdown. I would throw up constantly because of the panic attack and try to quell it with alcohol... the same vicious cycle for about 3 months.

My anxiety is a constant. I would drink as a crutch to deal with my anxiety and I was already an anxious person for most of my life. I also got diagnosed with depression in 2014. I take meds for depression and anxiety but still. I know dealing with the withdraws, anxiety is typically heightened. But it has been so consuming lately. I have a doctor's appointment in April where I will have blood drawn and it is driving me crazy. I had blood drawn in June last year and my ALT/ATS (100s/200s) numbers were high and I've had prehypertension for at least 4 years due to stress and drinking. Also discovered I have a small umbilical hernia too that isn't an issue at the moment. That was the first time and it actually hit me in the face that it was really affecting my body.

I'm trying to take it day by day but often my anxiety is focused on the possibility of blood tests in April and what they reveal (it's worse, beyond repair, etc) and it's hard to focus and stay grounded in the present. I am so afraid of what will be found in April. I keep thinking about the worst-case scenarios and Google MD doesn't help much either. My therapist tells me to focus on what I can control, mindfulness, and I am trying to work mediation into my routine at the advice of this lovely group. I'm trying to take it one hour at a time (because that is the best I can do some days), but the anxiety can be so overwhelming sometimes.

I'm sorry but I've found this group really supportive. I am having another day where I need to get this off my chest.

Wife and I just moved to a new city and are living in a dinky AirBnB apartment while a real home becomes available for us on Monday. We have no friends out here yet, and we’re in a pandemic which makes finding them even more difficult. 

My wife and I tried to have a small date night last night on a whim of just going bowling, and given the restrictions it basically wasn’t doable. Waits were 2 hours or it was just bowling with your mask on no food or drinks, and we wanted a date night atmosphere. So we ended up turning around and just going home and watching Outlander on Netflix.

I was in a grumpy fucking mood. I felt bored, and even worse I felt like a  boring person.

But then I took a step back and realized that on any other weekend instead of just going home and being healthy, the wife and I would go to a brewery and drink craft beers. I would say I would only have one and then I’d have 3 and then I’d get groggy and then I’d sleep like shit and then I’d wake up today feeling exhausted. But I wouldn’t have been bored!

Is it not just as boring as watching Netflix with my wife totally sober? Isn’t watching Netflix with my wife sober way better than drinking and feeling like shit today?

So that is one thing I’m learning about my life in sobriety. I don’t know exactly what to do with myself now that going out and hurting myself isn’t my fall back option.

I’m still honestly at a loss of what to do, and think it will take some time to reprogram myself where instead of just doing nothing like I am now, I’m doing something that adds value to my life. But it was a realization that I’ve been doing nothing anyway, and in fact I’ve been doing less than nothing because I’ve been harming myself.

Now it’s time to transition to doing things that are positive. 

Anybody else feel/felt this way? Anybody else have stories of their journey through finding their own meaning instead of masking it with booze? Would love to hear your stories.",23,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.75061315}"

I’ve stayed strong, played the tape forward, attended three meetings, checked in here, remembered my “whys”, but it hasn’t been enough to stop the cravings. They subside for a minute and then come right back. I’m still standing sober, but it’s been hard and sometimes I’ve been so, so close to giving in to the fuck it’s.

This morning at breakfast my son might have unknowingly given me the best gift, triggered by a discussion about the empties in the garage and how they need to be cleaned up and taken back to the beer store.

“Remember that time you got drunk, mom? You couldn’t even stand up and then you threw up in the car!”

I remember, son. I remember the shame of realizing how much wine I had drunk and the sick realization that I will not be able to make the car ride home without having to stop to throw up multiple times. 

“It took us two hours to get home because dad had to keep pulling over so you could throw up! I had to ride the whole way home with a bucket on my head because it smelled so bad!” 

I remember, son.

“You couldn’t even walk in a straight line! You had to hold onto the trunk to stand up!”

Yes, son, I remember.

“Remember when we went to Shelley’s and Chris’s house and you got drunk and couldn’t walk down the driveway? Your eyes were half closed and you were talking all sloppy!”

Yes son, I remember. 

It hurts to hear those stories but I needed them to remind me that if I keep drinking, THAT is the mum by kids will remember. Not the mum that tells jokes or plays games or goes for hikes or goes skiing or works out or makes really good meals or makes popcorn and snacks for family movie nights.

They’ll remember drunk mum. 

I swore I wouldn’t be that mum. 

If I stay sober, I WON’T be that mum.

Cravings may come and they may be hard, but they won’t kill me. The shame of being the mum my son delighted in remembering this morning might, though.

He will start at 5 or 6 pm and not sleep until 6 or 7 at night the next day, always walking to the store when it opens at 8 am. Last week, he drank on a work night for me. (Were both full time students, due to pandemic he's just doing school, I do both full time)

Anyways, last week he drank on a work night, I missed a good 9-10 hours of his drunken behavior. I was not so lucky this week. Everything he took a shot he was trying to give them to me, his vodka breath when he tried to kiss me or talked at me made me gag, and every time I'd get up to leave (we live within 10 min of my parents, was just gonna go hang with them until he went to bed) he'd come at me about not being a good friend or girlfriend to him. Meanwhile he's trying to pour spirits down my throat?! 

I managed to say NO every time. I just kept explaining how much better mental health has been, I'm retaining info better in school, I went from 229# the last day I drank to 218 this morning! I find myself telling him that one day I might be able to have a beer out with friends, I realistically know this isn't true. My dad has been sober for almost 30 years now, after some shit deeper than mine, and he STILL will maybe only have 2 or 3 sips of a beer before stopping. 

Luckily for me, I never saw the worst of his drinking. Unfortunately he has seen the worst of mine. I'm almost 24 and feel like I wasted my teens and early 20s drunk. 

It doesn't help that people keep saying that this is the time in life to behave like that, like no. This is when you set up for the future. I spent my teens doing drugs and my 20s drunk. 

Rambling now I guess.. my Dad is the only one who seems to get what I mean when I say a switch flipped in my head, and the one I'm comfortable talking to irl, but I don't enjoy telling him about what an unsupportive butt my partner can be.

I always try to give credit to whoever gave it to me and add ""I don't think that I have ever came up with an original thought about recovery.""  Perhaps I can change that today.

When I started in AA I attended a lot of meetings  on steps 1,2,3. Week after week every Tuesday, and a gratitude meeting on Friday nite to get my weekend on safer footing. So every three weeks I read in Step Three the following passage;
 
""If I keep on turning my life and my will over to the care of Something or 
Somebody else, what will become of me? I’ll look like the hole 
in the doughnut.”

So, I know 7 days is not a lot. And I have gone longer without drinking. But this is the first time I feel like I don’t wanna go back. I don’t miss it. And sometimes the thought of it even makes me sick. I’ve been trying to kick off this 12 year old habit for a long time.

But it wasn’t until last week, when I got some lab results back, that I decided enough is enough. My AST is at 133 and my ALT IS AT 85. I don’t know if those numbers are super horrible, but that night I cried myself to sleep. The thought of liver damage, hepatitis, or cirrhosis, terrified me.

But it was more the shame of it. I keep my habit very secret, as I only drink at night. I do live with my parents, and while I know they’re not stupid and must suspect I drink more than I should, they are very much in denial and refuse to even see my problem. My mom, especially, will occasionally find an empty bottle of wine and won’t even question me. She’s always wanted to have the perfect daughter, after all. Surely her beautiful little princess can’t be an alcoholic. So I’ve been able to somehow keep it private.

I guess that’s easy when you live in a party island in the Caribbean where weekends start on a Wednesday and alcohol is as normal as drinking coffee. Just a recipe for disaster. But maybe someday I’ll tell the whole story.

So here I am. I don’t know if I will succeed this time. But I want to. I owe it to my body. I’ve put it through so much, and it’s always been there for me. So it’s time to give it some much needed love an affection.

As to how I feel: I have been absolutely blown away that I can fall asleep by myself every night. For years one of the excuses I used for drinking alcohol was that I couldn’t fall asleep without it. Here I am sleeping like a baby! I still feel the phantom hangover here and there, but it gets better every day.

The clarity that has come with all of these sober months has allowed me the time to reflect on all of the horrible mistakes I made, how I mistreated loved ones, how I was down a sloppy and deadly path, and how I was killing myself. 

The layers of denial that I built up because (almost) everyone around me was drinking as much as me if not more protected me from the word. ""So and so drinks more than me. I can stop."" And I said all the other lies we tell ourselves. Their greater alcohol consumption doesn't lessen the damage of mine just by comparison. I'm sure people were using me as a measuring stick! ""Foolishlyloaded drinks more than me and he's still balancing two jobs and a family! I'm certainly not an alcoholic!""

Fast forward 3 years and I am drinking every day still. It's killing my beautiful wife and my hiding it (or trying to) was killing our marriage. Not to mention my checking account.

So I went to the doctor and got Adabuse.

I am now 14 days sober and I feel... well I'm not sure what I feel. My wife is happy so I'm happy. The last two weeks are basically a blur in my memory. I have had fevers and sensitivity to both light and sound but my superiors at work haven't mentioned any slip ups.

I'm sure I am detoxing but my symptoms seem strange. I cannot get full no matter how much I eat, I can not seem to get hydrated, and this disorientation is annoying.

Boy, ain’t that the truth with me. 

I’ve made good progress in the areas of anger and sexual attraction, but fear still likes to rear its ugly head in various forms. 

I have been afraid of everyone and everything my entire life. I am now 36, 11 days sober (had 22 days, fell off for a few, and am now back), and on some days the “fear tsunami” comes roaring back to wash me out to sea. It’s primary goal? To get me to drink. 

My fear and anxiety can get so bad that my appetite disappears, and my mind flies off in a thousand directions. I’m OCD as all hell, so my own mind hits me with all of these “what if?” scenarios. 

Does it happen every single day?  Not exactly. Most of yesterday was a sunshine/rainbow/butterfly day, and it was just absolutely *marvelous*.  I can’t wait to consistently have more days like that!

Thankfully, I’ve found that small amounts of kratom have been able to help my anxiety, after medications worsened my condition (bad side effects, such as akathisia).  Without it, I’m pretty certain that sobriety would be impossible. 

I absolutely **refuse** to go back to drinking, as the bottle finally turned on me so badly that I fell into a deeply dangerous suicidal state after the last few times I touched it. I also firmly believe that God’s will is for me to be sober. 

So for those here who have made big strides in the area of fear post-sobriety, how did you do it?

My current strategy is prayer. Prayer that God will remove fear from my life, to the degree of His choosing, and that He will transform my mind.

But recently playing the tape forward has been really working in my favor. I know exactly how I feel when I drink, and exactly how I feel the day after.

While drinking I grow more and more tired to the point I end up having to sleep. Like, painfully tired. Fighting with myself to stay awake tired. And before falling asleep, I get buzzed enough to start calling and texting friends that I hardly see, making a complete ass of myself those few times I do talk to them. I think about the things or hobbies I want to do but have no energy or motivation to do them. Then I pass out. I wake up on the couch in the middle of the night and force myself up for water and probably to brush my teeth. Then I slump back into my actual bed.

The next morning I feel like shit; my mouth tastes awful, I wonder if I can get away with a cup of coffee or if it will just make my anxiety worse. Then there is the 24 hour brain fog that leaves me feeling like I’m only half-living the day or not even in my body. My gut or head usually hurt, and that causes my anxiety to creep in - another 24 hour side affect to drinking. I end up lying nauseous on the couch all day wishing the anxiety would go away, while cancelling plans and wallowing in self pity. I sit there wishing so badly it was night time so I can fall asleep and wake up to a day where I hadn’t drank the night before. There were too many mornings I was waking up wishing it was already nighttime so it could all be over.

It’s fucking awful. How unappealing compared to the days I’m waking up with clarity, confident that I can have my coffee, no anxiety, feeling good and well-rested, able to actually eat some real breakfast without having to force down a smoothie, while having all the energy to indulge in whatever hobbies I’d been meaning to get to. There’s also the plus or actually being able to work without hiding my anxiety from colleagues all day or actually enjoying my weekends. 

So for the most part, on this day 12, I’m thankful for playing the tape forward. I’m glad it’s finally working for me (it did take a while).

I don't have either one of my parents in my life. My mother is an alcoholic and let me and my sister go with an abusive father at the age of 5 and 6 yrs old. I graduated top of my class, with scholarships. The first year of college was completely paid for me. The second I graduated high school my father up and moved back to his home state, leaving me to fend for myself. Scholarships payed for classes but not room and board. 

I got a job and got my own place. Met a guy at my job and moved in with him. Dropped classes because I didn't have a car. Kept working fulltime with this guy who was giving me rides to work. 

Hurricane Harvey swooped in and destroyed my place and everything I own. Find out my guy was cheating on me with a girl from church. Ended up homeless. Started drinking alot, ended up jobless.

Here I am 4 years later with man who loves me, would do anything for me, but I still drink because I don't know how to be myself, how to love myself. How can he love me when I don't love myself? I want to stop. I want to be myself, but idk who that is anymore.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.694567}"

Largely not a big problem because I don’t see people ever (plague).  I have one friend who I spend time with and she’s a normal drinker.  I don’t think she’s been tipsy in over 4 years. 

However, I do have friends I would drink with. Like drinking buddies. But old friends non the less. Like nearly 30 years I’ve known them.  We grew up together and have had our rainbow of vices. 

Yesterday I had free time and was like I should visit so and so - but so and so seem like they are drunk every day.  And I honestly can’t tell if I am afraid I’d fall into drinking or if being around them will just make me super uncomfortable.  People used to do hardcore drugs around me and I’d leave.  I’d be like I gotta go now. Because I didn’t like the drugs and I didn’t like the way they made people act.  On a smaller level, I feel like my drunk friends are going to annoy the shit out of me.  I’m more concerned about just seeing them differently than me actually being tempted.  

I know I can’t avoid the unknown forever. Tomorrow I think I am having lunch or dinner with a friend who isn’t a huge drinker but their partner  is.  I already have no patience for the partners shenanigans as of late. That persons  drunken behavior partially inspired my sobriety.   I hope the partner has a hangover and can’t come for all these reasons. 

I think tomorrow may be a test of where I land on this socializing thing.  I am excited to go do something with someone  for about the first time in a year but oh so reserved about it.

On the brightside, the breakup is going very well. We both understand that this is what's best for both of us.

I  am really struggling. I am trying my hardest to keep myself going. And when the bad thoughts approach, I try to focus on my breathing and think about my future.

I found valuable information here so I felt I needed to share these results and their interpretation by my family doctor. (who has no idea about my alcohol dependency issues).

To add a context, I've been tapering off to maximum 1.5 L of light beers per day for 2-3 weeks, progressively less at the approach of the blood test.

By the way,  you probably noticed I decreased my consumption because I hoped to get better test results haha, so here's a fact from mister obvious: some of what happens in your blood is not something you can hope to change in a few days, for example red blood cells life span is around...120 days or 4 months. My doc told me it's no use to test again before at least 3 months. But hey, if you need an additional accountability reason to taper off or stop, go book a blood test, why not. 

I think this instant result/gratification need and habit is one of the components of my addictions. Like...I want things to happen NOW but that's not how biology works.

Anyway, here are the key points from my doc:

* **Uric acid**, slightly higher: doc said it could be related to red meat but when I mentioned I drink 'one or a few beers everyday', the doc took the hint and said there's a high probability that's the cause. Excess uric acid can cause gout by the way. I heard it's not something you ever wish to get.
* **Low MCV, MCH and Higher number of Red blood** **cells**: apparently normal due to my genetic condition (Thalassemia)
* **AST, ALT and GAMMA GT**: doc said normal values, nothing to worry about, just don't get addicted (laughs) and take days off between drinking sessions.

And here are the raw values:

**Uric acid**: 8.2 mg/dL (Ref. value: 3.4 to 7.0) - **HIGHER**

**SGOT or** **AST**: 20 u/L (Ref. value: < 40) **NORMAL**

**SGPT or ALT**: 11 u/L (Ref. value: < 41) **NORMAL**

**Y-GT or GAMMA GT**: 18 u/L (Ref. value: Avg 8 to 61) **NORMAL**

**MCV** (*mean* corpuscular volume): 65 fl (Ref. value: Avg 80 to 99) - **LOWER**

**MCH** (*mean* corpuscular hemoglobin): 21 fl (Ref. value: Avg 26 to 34) - **LOWER**

**Red blood cells** (ERYTHROCYTE): 6.68 10E6/mcl (Ref. value: Avg 3.94 to 5.99) - **HIGHER**

**Vitamin B12**: 626 ng/l (Ref. value: Avg 191 to 633) - **NORMAL (higher end)**

**Vitamin D**: 38 μg/l (Ref. value: 30 to 100) - **NORMAL (lower end)**

One thing my doc didn't mention but that I did find around in medical articles was the AST:ALT ratio, mine is 1.81, almost a 2:1 ratio. The normal range should be lower than 1. But I won't draw any conclusion to that as my AST, ALT, GAMMA GT values are normal.

Check this medical article, go to paragraph: Fatty liver and the AST:ALT RATIO

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609680/#:\~:text=A%20normal%20AST%3AALT%20ratio,and%20%3E2%20in%2070%25.&text=AST%3AALT%20scores%20%3E2%20are,more%20suggestive%20of%20NAFLD%2FNASH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609680/#:~:text=A%20normal%20AST%3AALT%20ratio,and%20%3E2%20in%2070%25.&text=AST%3AALT%20scores%20%3E2%20are,more%20suggestive%20of%20NAFLD%2FNASH).

Interesting parts:

A normal AST:ALT ratio should be <1. In patients with alcoholic liver disease, the AST:ALT ratio is >1 in 92% of patients, and >2 in 70%

Both AST and ALT enzymes require pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (**vitamin B6**) to function properly. Its absence in nutritionally-deficient heavy-drinkers has a much larger effect on the production of ALT than that of AST, causing the AST:ALT ratio to rise

\--

I am going to take a blood test again in 3 months, stay tuned.

PS: this is like a journal for me, I've been having issues with booze for at least 5 years that I know of. First it was light beers, then stronger ones, then wine, then liquor, a mix of everything. Tried to taper off here and there, never had more than a week sober for 5 years (terrible I know) but last year has been a bit different, I reduced the consumption dramatically, didn't miss a day of work like I did before. 

Also, my family doctor who's actually a relative has a big HINT now about my situation, I mean I had to repeat some words because my doc didn't get it the first time haha. Like...do you think you could do extra tests you know, to look for alcohol consumption related issues? yes that's right, FOR EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL DEPENDENCY RELATED ISSUES?

I had 3 beers, a biolyte, and evening Netflix with my partner. It’s hard to describe how I’ve evolved with my relationship to alcohol because I’ve done so many day 1s. Attempts to put together long stretches of sobriety have been successful at the 30 day range over and again. This was my second attempt at 90 days and I can honestly say life is better completely sober. I recognize that there is still a strong part of my brain that believes alcohol provides some benefit beyond a little bit of a happy warm feeling at the beginning. But...yesterday I bought into the big lie again that alcohol brings better Friday nights. It really didn’t. I mean it was a fine Friday night, but it wasn’t any better than most Friday nights and this one cost me over $20 for the beers and biolytes I bought for me and my partner. That’s money I could be spending on my retirement savings or kid’s college funds.

-I've told some close friends my decision. I got very kind feedback. Most of them even admitted to their own substance abuse downside, and voiced their desire to make drastic changes

-I spoke with an army buddy and very close friend. He hit rock bottom hard 4 years ago. He sobered up to save his marriage and life. He's didn't have a drink in 3.5 years. He shared a story of a night where his wife got obliterated and he caught her making out with a male friend who he greatly disliked. He freaked out, grabbed a beer, chugged half of it, stopped and then went outside to sit down. He confronted his wife in the morning, she claimed to have been blacked out and could only tell him ""she didn't know why she did it."" I have so much more respect for my friend now. I don't think I could have controlled myself in that situation.

-I ordered a book about alcoholism, and started listening to another one on audible.

-I went to play poker and made 500, and got to hang out with some friends. They were sobering up from going to the club and joked that I was too sober to play with them. This part hit me and I felt embarrassed. I didn't want to dump my baggage on them. One of them invited me out for Saturday night and that he would hit me up with plans later. He has no idea about my decision to stop drinking forever. I started wondering if I should go out and see how I react to others drinking, or tell him not to invite me if everyone else will be drinking.

-right now I'm sitting in the parking lot of my gym waiting for it to open. I should feel proud of myself for taking actionable steps to achieve my long term goals, but I just feel empty inside. Perhaps I'm tired or under the weather. Maybe the grief of a recent ending to a promising courtship is finally setting in.

I fully support lockdown, have been keeping to it religiously, and in NO way want to make this a discussion about that. What it means though is that we are not allowed to go 5 miles out of our council boundary.

What I miss deeply in my soul is going for big hikes with my husband. We normally go up to the Highlands a few times a month to go up the hills, and we've not been allowed to do that since summer really. It aches, it was our sanity, our joy, our play time. We are lucky enough to have the Pentland hills nearby and we are up them about once a week, but I miss the Highlands so very much.

Going into the comments though it is full of people that say they miss having a pint in a pub more and it just really made me so sad for the drinking culture in this country. I realise it's the social aspect of drinking together that people are missing, but for getting drunk in a pub being more important than freedom to travel out of the city boundaries... eep. Sometimes it's hard to not feel like getting wasted is a normal part of every day life here. It doesn't work for me anymore though. I miss the mountains and islands so bad, but for now the nearby beach and wee hills will do.

I’d had a thought that if it wasn’t for my wife and daughter that I’d probably kill myself. 

That also felt ridiculous. 

It felt indulgent. 

It felt selfish. 

I’d seen a field and woods whilst driving on a grey British motorway and had a vivid fantasy about just pulling over, walking into the distance, to the fields, to the woods. Back to nature. 

To do what? I’m not sure. I didn’t want to find out.

I am of the mind that when it comes to suicide, the pain simply transfers from those who are brave enough to take their own life to those who loved them. 

I use the term brave as I am too scared to do such a thing. 

At least I was back in October. 

I didn’t want to inflict that on my family and friends.

So I went to my local doctor and explained my state of mind.

I was prescribed antidepressants and referred to an NHS approved CBT course of therapy.

I had been drinking consistently since I was 17. I’m now 39. I drink to black out. I don’t drink to have fun. I drink to get drunk and when I’ve reached the required level of inebriation, something, deep inside me, clicks. 

But I wasn’t a hardcore drinker. 

A bottle or two of wine a night 6-7 nights a week, a few gin and tonics (liveners, as I called them) and single malts (nightcaps, 4 finger pours) on top. A sprinkling of a few beers too for good measure. 

I was pushing 90-100 units on a good week. 

I don’t have any trauma nor obvious demons to drink away. I’ve had a decent lower middle-class upbringing in the UK. I’m aware that I’m privileged compared to many others. 

I have decent enough job and a loving family. So none of it added up - at least in obvious terms to my uneducated mind why people feel like they do - why my chemistry was all fucked up and I felt anxious and the onset of what I imagined was depression.

I knew something had to change. 

I got home from the doctors and reflected on where I found myself and decided to try one last thing before the therapy and pills. 

I stopped drinking. Cold turkey. October 25 2020. 

I’d flirted with a sober life in the past. 2-3 months at a time. I knew I could do it. I knew I needed to do it. 

And so I did. And here I am.

125 days and counting. One day at a time.  

The feeling of pride, self-worth and general happiness is utterly priceless. 

It’s hard to put into words.

I feel like I’ve got a superpower. 

I feel like I can see clearly. 

It feels like a big, heavy, wet blanket has been lifted from my brain. I can breathe again. 

I can recognise my moods, I am more in tune with my body’s chemistry and my chattery little mind and can acknowledge why things feel like they do. 

I’m a better father, husband and friend. I’m creative and ambitious. Cliché alert: Anything feels possible. 

Most of all, I’m happy. I can’t remember saying that ever before. I’m easy on myself now, too.

What a drug not drinking is. 

Big respect and love to ALL of you in the SD community. 

It’s helped me get to where I am today. X

Although I’m in an infinitely better situation than I was 363 days ago I feel like there’s still so much work to do. I’d say the single best thing about being sober for me is genuinely being able to look into my own eyes in the mirror and see me. For years I could only ever pass a cursory glance at myself, usually to check the latest bump, cut, bruise on my face. Anyway I’m rambling now... just thought I’d say hi and thank everyone on this forum, reading that I aren’t the only one in this fight, has really helped me whenever that momentary flicker enters my head (pint?)",60,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49503425}"

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Saturday everyone!! We made it!

I’d like to leave you all with a little advice straight from ol’ Doodlebob’s book - screw what ANYONE ELSE thinks about you getting sober!!! 

I am leaving my full time job to pursue a different career path and I was painfully going back and forth on whether I should leave, and I realized the only reason I was so torn is because I was thinking about how my current job will feel. 

I realized if I was honest with myself, there was no part of me that genuinely wanted to stay; I was prioritizing others’ needs over my own. 

I had a similar struggle with alcohol - I was everyone’s little drinking buddy and I was concerned how people would react to me getting sober.

Please don’t ever think about anyone else’s opinion when it comes to getting sober, or making any other positive changes in life. It’s *your* life, and you need to do what’s best for you!

Best of luck to all you beautiful people, thank you guys so so much for all the participation and for the awards! I’m sorry I couldn’t respond to many of you folks, it’s been a crazy week! But I have thoroughly enjoyed hosting this check in, and if you are interested in hosting and have more than 30 days under your belt, send a message to either myself or u/sainthomer.

Please ask yourself something:

- Are you stoked about your sobriety and want the world to know?
- Are you a bit of a karma hog and want lots of upvotes?
- Do you think your journey in sobriety is interesting?
- Do you like getting lots of comments like ""thank you so much!"" and ""this is me!!!!!"" on your posts?
- Do you like feeling less alone?
- Do you like helping others feel less alone?
- Do you love /r/stopdrinking and want some way to give back?
- Do you think that there's a chance that maybe just one Sobernaut might get some benefit from hearing about your own experiences?

If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions (I answered yes to all of them, no shame), then do I have a deal for you!!!!

It's called the Saturday Share.  Each Saturday, we here at SD aim to feature a fellow Sobernaut's journey in sobriety, highlighting:

- Some background on their drinking
- What lead to them to get sober
- How their life has been in sobriety

For months I've been trying to find volunteers by surreptitiously reaching out to people.  Most humbly decline.  It's been challenging to keep Saturday Shares going.

But I _really_ like the idea of the Saturday Share.  I love reading about peoples' journeys in sobriety.  I can relate to what I read.  I am reminded of my own failures and victories.  I feel grateful that a fellow Sobernaut opened up and shared something so that I could feel less alone.  I get to better know a fellow Sobernaut.

I need volunteers.  I need people to step up and share their journeys with me and the rest of the community.  I've already [shared mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/htbb5u/saturday_share/).

Little did I know that a fellow coworker and friend was being demoted the same day. I happened to hear through the grapevine at work that she was being informed of the demotion just as I was moving to my new desk, which happened to be right next to hers. She did not take it well and cried for a while.

I'm aware that this isn't directly my fault, our positions aren't even in the same department of work, but it still felt incredibly awkward and I couldn't help but feel guilty. She mentioned how she was going to go home and drink to cope. I don't want to assume that everyone who drinks has a problem with alcohol like I do, however I definitely saw a reflection of my past self and it scared me. So much so that I spent a few moments staring down the liquor isle while at the grocery store after work. Before I took back control of my life, feeling guilty like this would have taken me directly to the liquor store for a bottle of bottom shelf vodka (basically nail-polish remover) and I'd finish the thing in one night.

I'm at home now, alcohol free, and enjoying a nice can of sparkling water. I still feel terrible for her, and I hope that she can cope with this shitty situation. But at the end of the day I'm realizing that punishing myself for a situation that I feel guilty about by drinking it away isn't going to help me, her, or anybody else.

Last December marked 2 years alcohol free for me and I've accomplished so much since then; returned to college with straight A's, new job, new promotion now, new home, and preparing for a wedding. Then days like today roll around and remind me how easy it would be to slip up once and throw it all away. One slip up and 2 years of hard work could be washed away. 

I hope everyone is doing well in their sober endeavors, I just wanted to share my experience today in the hopes that it can help other people who may be struggling. One day sober or two years, it makes no difference as long as you can make it from the moment you wake up, to the moment you fall asleep. It's too late to change yesterday and tomorrow can wait, all we can do is focus on today and make it though sober, clear minded, and better for it.

Rough week, but I’m rougher.

In order to change something, you have to accept it.  Sometimes you have to go on the journey yourself, as to just being told alcohol is bad, it must be lived.

I’ve wasted the last 5 years, worrying about what my life would have been had I never picked up alcohol.  Today, and Lord willing, the next 5 years, will be spent truly incorporating my learned lessons and living them.

I’m not sure how I’m going to put this in practice, but I intend to do so.  If successful, I’d have to consider my life better to have made it through, coming out the other side.  Then my life will have to have been considered better in spite of alcohol.

Tonight as usual, off to work.  Full moon, things tend to go sideways on these nights so I’m a bit unsettled already.  Whatever happens, I’ll face with fear or not, and make it out the other side.

Gone a few stretches of a few weeks without any alcohol, the longest was about six weeks this past fall. It never felt like too much of a problem, I mean I was still doing well at work and school and waking up early to workout and not being hungover... until I did start sleeping a little later, and started drinking much earlier on the weekends, and realized how much weight I’ve gained and money I’ve spent from the wine and late night food delivery, and constantly saying “I’ll stop on Monday.” Every time I go a few days without drinking I realize that maybe I don’t wake up with a bad hangover when I do drink but I certainly wake up feeling much better when I don’t. 

It’s more difficult because my husband and I fell into this habit together when we started dating, so now we’re trying to stop together as well, but it’s easy to fall back into old routines when the other person is too. Luckily I’ve started feeling like I’m on my own journey with it as I work with a coach on my relationship with food, so even when we stop together, I know I only go back to it for me, not because he’s drinking again too, and I know me being firm helps him stick with it too. Today is day 5 without alcohol and I feel great. Hubby almost stopped for a drink on his way home from an errand but the road was closed and he said it felt like a sign he should just come home instead. And I was proud when I realized that if he had stopped, he would have stopped at the liquor store on the way home after having one drink at the bar, and I would have turned down the offer for a bottle of wine, because I really want to sleep well tonight. Progress!

Didn’t mean for this to be a ramble, this is my first post, but I’ve been lurking for a couple weeks and reading a few posts throughout the day has made the nighttime cravings nonexistent.  I’m not ready to commit to forever AF but I’m fully committing to right now and I’m excited for what these next weeks, months, however long it is, will look like.

Everytime I go back to drinking, the bingeing is worse, the pain, detox and health issues get scaringly more severe. 6 days ago, everything hurt and I had the most frightening tremors.

The thing is, the longer I go without a drink, the more I think I can control my drinking, which of course is a lie.

So on day 6 (again) hoping to get some much required longevity.

My cousin (lives overseas) is also an alcoholic and went almost 3 years before his relapse. We had a really in depth conversation about it and he told me he couldn't really explain it, but felt on some level he could control it and released that was a lie also.

I read somewhere maybe here about a person had done 9 years and then had a relapse, but ultimately got sober again.

I think once you know you're an alcoholic, then you'll always be one, doesn't make us bad people and a relapse I don't think is a fail, maybe just another reaffirment that we're all broken, but some of us are more broken than others.

I don't know where to start. All I know is that no one in my life can offer guidance or understanding. Not even my husband who has been with me for 13 years and knows every dark, deep secret I have. He doesn't understand how outrageously concerning my intake has been because he has never been around heavy drinkers. I'm a nurse and extremely functional as an alcoholic. He assumes I wouldn't drink to the point of harming myself.

I had my 1000th break down knowing I have to go to rehab to stop.  My liver labs. The fact that Ive stopped my Multiple Sclerosis meds so that I dont exacerbate the liver damage with alcohol (what a shitty choice). I decided that I need to do a medical detox if I want to be safe. 3 bottles of wine on an night where I think Im doing great cutting down. I started drinking regularly 5 years ago after having a child I was completely unprepared for. He was such a difficult baby and his father was overseas for the first year. I don't know if I could have made it without wine. So. Much. Wine.  It got progressively worse until 2020 and it just went insane. 3 bottles a night. half a 1/5 of vodka on top of it to sleep. I started hiding alcohol. Alternating liquor stores.  just a shit show. But i was able to hold down my jobs, not drink before shifts. Had to quit a few times because I was afraid I would. But I always quit first. My profession is important to me.

Here is my issue. I have asked for help. I have broken myself down and sobbed and begged for help. I am going to go to rehab. But I have SO MUCH GUILT. Im not at rock bottom. I dont have debt. I've never been arrested or hospitalized due to my addiction. (All of this is because my husband is taking care of me, can take care of us financially. I have much guilt because I WOULD have been at rock bottom 5 years ago without him.)

Now I dread having to share in group (Ive been a nurse in a sober/detox facility and know the HEART BREAKING rock bottom stories...) because I will be a late 30's woman who is there to share stories about how bored she is, how much she hates herself as a mom, how she never came close to rock bottom but replaced it with self-hatred. But when it comes down to it... I'm a sheltered, person who is there to complain that my life is unsatisfying because i didnt take advantage of the insane privileged life I was afforded.

I know Im doing the right thing. I know i NEED to do this for myself and my son. But Im terrified to openly share without feeling like a fucking asshole. Because Im NOT at rock bottom and feel so much compassion for those who are. Im afraid I cant be open and address my issues for fear of hurting other peoples progress.

Im so terrified to hurt everyone else. Can anyone who has done inpatient rehab offer suggestions? Im so scared I'll withhold because I feel like Im in a much more fortunate circumstance through nothing I've done for myself.

Instead, I drove myself home, spoke to my roommates about what happened and made some comfort food and sat with them; joined in on a movie they were watching.

I woke up at 6am. On a Saturday morning. No hangover. No scrambling to try to figure out what happened the night before. No being worried about messaging anyone while I was a drunk idiot. I still felt like crap, but at least that wasn't compounded with the crap feeling of drinking.

I rolled out of bed and checked my phone and then it hit me: THAT was my 1st month sober.

It's that now that I've been sober for a bit (just 6 months, but it's in the rear view mirror) and with a pandemic winter, I am now bored as hell. I have been thinking now about how much time I've thrown away. Especially the past 5 years- just wasted, even though I've been drinking heavily for far longer than that. 

But I've been out f work for a while because I needed to get my shit together before even trying to go back, and I am so made at myself for just tossing the past 5 years into the trash. Now that I'm looking for a new job, it seems amplified for me- the amount of experience I've missed gaining, and having to answer questions about what the fuck I've been doing all this time. 

And now, unlike in the past, I won't just go drink another day away.

I’ve always been proud of being honest with myself and others. Maybe even brutally honest, and a bit of a cynic. 

But the more I struggle with staying sober, the more I’ve realized how much I’ve been lying to myself. With drinking it is always excuses of course (I’ll just have one, I don’t have a problem anyway...). So demoralizing. But while one part of my brain is making up excuses for drunken behavior, the other side is full of wildly exaggerated negative self talk. Beyond cynical, just pure lying self hatred. Nothing a drink can’t fix though. And around we go. 

But I lie to others too, or at least try to. While drinking I liked to think I had a great tolerance and no one could tell (turns out not altogether true ha). And the days off of work for “food poisoning” — who the hell did I think I was fooling? But even to people I know well and love, I’m putting on a front, spinning stories, trying to act in a way that I think the other person will like or admire. I’m a liar and a cheater. That’s about as hard to write as I’m an alcoholic. Feel like I’m coming out of a haze and I don’t even know who I am.

Anyway, why are we such liars?  My working theory is that alcohol itself is a way to lie to our brains (this party is fun, I’m not sad anymore, I like the taste of warm vodka in the morning, etc.). And you can’t lie to yourself chemically for years without it bleeding over into other parts of your life. Open to suggestions though!

I used to sleep terribly. Woke up every early morning without fail, whether I'd drank that night or not. Would get maybe 4-6 hours at absolute best. 

Two months not drinking, I'd still sleep awfully, so much so I thought it wasn't anything to do with the drink.....until month 3.

I sleep at least 7 hours a night at least 5 times a week now. Yes, sometimes I do still wake up early, but I'm usually able to get back off within 30 mins. Before I could forget it for 2-3 hours.

I used to have bags under my eyes. Not now. They went pretty quickly actually, even if I did sleep poorly.  And my skin is generally much younger looking.

I've been able to regulate my food intake, better food all round, and more often. I've lost several kilos as a result. And I wasn't a big fella, was still fit as when I drank, but I guess I've just ditched the additional fat. 

But the single most important factor, is that I've stopped being argumentative, and if I've had a bad, very frustrating day, I'm not put off by it. I don't get mad for no reason, and I don't get flustered nor impatient. I'm simply able to deal with whatever is thrown at me calmly, with patience and without any kind of 'woe is me' attitude. I just deal with it. And I often laugh at myself for remembering that this three months ago would have been the trigger needed to have the excuse!

I have posted similar stuff in the past, but writing is an important outlet for me. Sorry if I sound like a broken record, but I appreciate this community. I am also not deluding myself in any way. I know I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and won't be able to ever drink like a normal person. I haven't for 20+ years, so it won't magically start happening. All I can do, however, is fix the things that are leading me to drinking so that I won't want it in the first place! For years, I've been essentially a Friday night binger. It's also the only time I smoke cigarettes. I pick up a 12 pack of beer (I hate hard alcohol) and a pack of cigs and I am going to drink and smoke every last one. Because I am alone in an empty house. With no relationship to speak of. No longer have any hobbies or anything ""fun."" My few friends left are married and / or have kids. I've worked so hard this week. I need some way to blow off steam. But, what do I do in this void? It's all work, work, work and literally nothing ""fun"" to look forward to. Rarely any plans. I don't want to watch TV. Or stare at a monitor or cell phone. But, that's what I have to do. Add in some beers and it almost seems tolerable. Or even fun. 

Another aside. I've been blessed to work in an industry I love, something I am naturally talented at, and get paid very well. I always have ""loved"" my jobs and rarely dreaded going back to work. Hell, people would ask me how I could work so much and the answer finally came to me: Well, at work I am treated like a rock star! The degree of reverence for high achievers like myself was striking. I'm a somebody at work. When I leave my office or home office? Just another Joe. A nobody. I guess work has always been a sanctuary for me. The one place where I feel important. Wanted. Accepted. Recognized for being good. You see, as a kid I always felt like a follower. Join this activity or club because all my friends were in it. But, then I didn't feel like I fit in. The people I knew were always ahead of me, as they had done these things much longer. I needed their guidance because I was the n00b.  I was an outsider.  Then I found out I had a talent at something. People looked up to me, and this ""hobby"" ended up turning into my career. However, while I have generally LOVED all my jobs, I have found my current boss to be difficult to work for. It took away the one area of my life that was always going well. No matter what disaster I created in my personal life. No matter how bleak everything else seemed, I always had my career to lift me up.

Anyways, back to drinking. I stopped doing the things I loved (skiing, tennis, pool) outside of work. My hobbies became staring at a screen, even in my downtime. It's pretty much work and then nothingness. No idea how to pass the time. No idea how to meet ""the one."" I haven't made new friends in a while. A few of my best friends died tragically. People moved away. I find myself spending endless time alone. The drinking just helps the clock tick faster. It allows me to feel something. Anything. Fortunately, I have decided to address \*this.\* I have certainly known friday night or evenings were a problem for a long time. But, I never worked on actually filling the voice. It's too easy to drive 2 minutes and grab some beers. Oh, it's friday and I'm alone... again. And bored. No idea what to do with myself outside of the office. I can't remember the last time I genuinely had fun. My idea of happiness is the thrill from gambling, or making money on investments. It's the dopamine I'm seeking. And, the beer bottle is a cheap way to get that, too. I am hoping this time It will finally sink in. I need to address this void. To become genuinely happy. And then hopefully I can walk away from this destructive lifestyle. For good. And not look back. And to find peace and happiness inside. To be the child I once was.  Oh yeah, the kid I was before the abuse. That is when all started going sideways for me. I was very confused by what happened to me. Trusted Adults in your life aren't supposed to hurt you like this, right? How come this happened to me? I kept it locked deep inside. Didn't tell my parents. Haven't in 30 years. But, I also didn't heal either. And, it's affected me profoundly to this day. Lead me to a life of isolation. And some mental health and trust issues. Maybe this time I'll actually get to the root of stuff, and start to heal properly. And start to smile again. Then maybe I won't try to fix that which is broken with a beer bottle.

I am on Day 10, my longest stretch in years. The first few days were absolutely brutal--- pounding heart palpitations, anxieties I hadn't had or felt for years returning, pangs of craving for booze. I'm on Day 10 and beginning to feel clearer-- I've been out to the bar with friends a couple of times and really been proud of the way I was able to have a good time without drinking and barely desiring one.

With all that said, I've been dealing with extreme anxiety still, obsessive thoughts, an inability to quiet down my mind. I know that many of these anxieties are real, things that drinking was simply hiding. Still, it feels quite severe and a bit hard to deal with-- the obsessive and intrusive thoughts being the worst part. I'm curious if anyone has any experience with this and whether it gets better over time quitting booze? I am addressing my anxiety in other ways: exercise, meditation, therapy. I find myself scrambling for little errands to keep my mind busy and sharp. Anyone have any other useful tactics for getting/pushing through? A long process, I know but happy to be on Day 10 and reading this forum has helped me so, so much so thank you all.

This is the longest I’ve made it. 
I’ve pretended to be sober for almost a year now, but it’s only these 46 days that I can truly say I haven’t had any alcohol in my system.
I lied to everyone around me for so long, hurt people who loved me, lost jobs, lost a hell of a lot of money, lost my drivers license, spent nights in jail, totaled my car, broke & damaged so much property.... just so I could keep my buddies, Vodka & Tequila, within reach. I never felt like I *deserved* to be happy without a vice... without a crippling addiction to something. I punished myself in the same ways I rewarded myself with alcohol... for years. 
Today I read a note in my phone from 2013. That begged me to never drink again... it’s 2021. I knew so many years ago my relationship with alcohol was negative and to be avoided... but I never felt like I deserved this life... this happiness... that I have without it. 
I suffer from anxiety, depression, & borderline personality disorder. I drank to numb myself to my illnesses. It started off socially, because I never realized how socially anxious of a person I am... and instead of working it, I would slather my liver up in liquor instead... trying to make myself enjoy socializing with people who I didn’t even like.
I’ve accepted I have certain anxieties and mental health hurdles others do not... and because of that my relationship with alcohol is not going to be like everyone else. 
I used to hate that about myself. Another reason why I am different. Another reason I don’t fit in. But I can say now... I’m growing to accept the things that make me me... the good & the bad. 
Giving up my dependence on alcohol has given me the opportunity for self reliance. And from that reliance comes self love and self respect... that I lacked for all these years. 
I feel worthy for the first time... ever.

I go in a cycle where I stop for a month or two, then add back a drink or two a night, then it's 2 or 3, and eventually 4-5. I then gross myself out with being constantly hungover and stop again for a month or two and start the whole thing again. I think I would stop entirely if I were in a different relationship situation. My wife, whom I in no way blame for my decisions, is better at staying in the 1-2 drinks a night cadence but definitely every night like me. So there's always something in the house, whether it's a case from our wine club or new gin she wants to try or whatever. I have friends who have successfully quit drinking for good while their spouse still imbibes, but that's proving to be a hard bargain for me and I don't know what to do. Splitting up is not something I'm considering, just to be clear.

The nearing crisis I find myself in (or one of many, as I'm sure most of you are familiar with) is that I started a new job in January. A dream job. I am so lucky to have gotten this with so many applicants in this employer's market. And I earned it with a full career of experience and contacts to back me up. But it's the real deal, no half-assing anything, and definitely an expectation to be sharp starting at 7am. And here I am, slightly to moderately hungover every goddamn day and I know I can't keep this job if I don't get my shit together. But of course every day by 5:00 I'm like OK What Are We Opening Tonight?? And I justify every pour until bedtime, get shitty fitful sleep, and wake up thinking well here we go again.

None of this is original, I know. And it honestly might be easier or clearer if I had a more catastrophic rock bottom experience. I am on the slow but steady downward spiral and I'm sad and worried about it and could use some kind words and advice if this resonates with you.

Still a giant piss off because i should have been told this two months ago while I was on land getting debriefed, and not when I’m 200 miles offshore.

Over the course of the week I put off some current job duties to finish it up. I sent off the first half and was told it all looks good. Ok great, making progress. I finished the second half last night and sent it off. I’d say it took me 16-20 hours total this week to fix everything up.

An hour ago I get an email saying that while the numbers add up, I missed putting in the product forms. So what this means is that I will have to do the entire fucking reports all over again. I expect this will be a week long process that will not be possible to complete while I’m out here as I don’t have any of the forms from that last trip with me, because why the fuck would I?

So with this current trip I will also have to redo the numbers as well as it’s the Same god damn mistake I’ve made yet again. But this is what happens when you have one office looking at the paper portion of my reports and okaying it while another office three hours away looks at my excel files and says it’s ok, until they get the paper portion of it sent to them a month later only to say it’s all wrong.

This is also what fucking happens when they don’t train you with these specific types of trips. A week long course in how to properly input numbers would save the giant headache that I’m feeling right now, and not the 45 minute crash course that they gave me back in November.

I made it through a couple of hang out sessions with friends that had always involved booze. I made it through the super bowl. I made it through a dinner party where I craved the wine my wife and dinner guests were drinking. 

Toward the end, I started to slip. I thought how I missed the taste of red wine (and how horrible NA wine alternatives were). I thought how I enjoyed going to Napa with friends and doing the tastings. I thought about nights around the fire with friends and shared whiskey. And honestly, I read some of the posts and stories on here and though ""I'm not that bad. Maybe I'm being too hard on myself trying to quit entirely. Maybe I can just enjoy a glass or two of wine, or a single glass of whiskey, and that be it. I thought - well maybe these 30 days have been a good rest and I can re-approach alcohol with a different mindset. 

So last Friday, when my wife got home, I had a bottle of wine out and some bread and cheese. We sat and talked about our days at work. I didn't finish the bottle. I didn't switch to whiskey. But the wine also didn't taste as good as I had remembered. And then the next night, when I poured myself a whiskey when watching TV with my wife (who wasn't drinking), that didn't taste as good as I had remembered either. But I still poured another the next night. And then yesterday, with a frustrating day of work, poured a whiskey. Then another. Then another. Then I opened a bottle of wine and had half a glass of that too. I ate candy and a box of mac and cheese, despite promising myself I would eat healthier. 

So maybe alcohol doesn't control me to the extent it does others here. Maybe I don't finish a 24 pack in a weekend. But I obviously don't control alcohol either. And that's not okay.

\--

Kudos for taking the first step towards a much better life. I promise you it's worth it.

I know you're scared right now—your thoughts are erratic, you're ashamed of what you've become, you can't imagine going a day without a drink. It's true—you really embarrassed yourself and your family when you had that ""episode"". Turns out it was alcohol withdrawal...that's because your problem is a lot worse that you even know (or care to  admit) right now.

The high BP, the shakes, sweats...they will eventually go away. The first few days are going to be hard.  Hours, actually. But eventually those hours will turn into days...and then a week in you'll be sheepishly proud that you went a week without alcohol--a feat you can't  even recall doing in years.

In a year you will go weeks and even months without thinking about how long it's been since you've had a drink. You won't believe it. Others won't believe it, either!

Then with the passage of time, lots of reflection, lifestyle changes, and more time...you'll come to see that the alcohol you loved so much is the reason you were anxious all the time. It didn't fix your  anxiety, it exacerbated it.

When you get the urge to drink, ask yourself *why*. The answers to that question will tell you more about  yourself and what you're trying to avoid by drinking. Only then can  you really live your life rather than running from it.

Unfortunately I do have some hard news for you. This is going to be  the toughest year of your life. It will be extremely stressful. You'll see. So the bad news is that if you keep drinking at this rate, I can  promise you that you'll be dead.

But the good news is that you'll be able to handle the hardest year of your life thanks to the fact that alcohol isn't in the picture. That alone is enough of a reason to quit, but you don't see that today. All  you see is the mess that your life has become. Use that as your motivation for now.

After all the years of dragging myself through the shit I won’t let anyone put out my light. I have a friend who things haven’t been the same with since I quit drinking and honestly I don’t care about that either. Sometimes your social circle needs to change and there’s nothing wrong with that. I think being too close to a sober person can invoke feelings that people don’t like and instead of looking further into it and realizing “I feel insecure because I am addicted to alcohol and can’t even admit it let alone stop drinking it” They instead get irritated with your positivity and outlook because they just simply can’t match that energy. Ben Harper said something about sobriety I thought was interesting. He said that even if being sober gives you 5% more energy in life from not being hungover etc how much that 5% gives back to you is nuts. Personally I feel like I’d put that number closer to 20-25%.

I'm a 29/yo male from Texas. I worked my ass off my entire life to get my dream job as a programmer, and now Im allowing alcohol to undo all that work. It's not too late for me to get my shit together, but I needed to start last year. I've had a desire to quit drinking years before it became a crippling problem. Back then I noticed that the majority of my fuckups in life were alcohol related, and now those fuckups are happening regularly. I don't drink every day, or drink at home alone, but I understand that is where my life is headed eventually. I drink 3-4 times a week, and usually have 8 or more drinks. Sometimes I set a goal not to drink, and I succeed. But once I start, I can't stop, unless I remove myself from the situation. Even when I stop at one or two drinks, my night is tainted by constantly fighting my craving. I've gotten arrested for PI, risked lives by driving intoxicated, and hurt the feelings of so many people. I'm a completely different person when I'm sober, and I want to be that person all the time. I like that person. I want him to get his act together, get back in the gym, feel happy on a daily basis, become a rockstar at work, get married and so on. None of those things can happen if I don't get sober.

Im scared of getting sober too though. Many of my closest friends drink, and some of them drink more than I do. Im afraid I'll have to cut everyone out along with the alcohol. I lack the self control to be around alcohol and not partake. Even if I don't drink, the temptation just eats at me. How do I deal with this in the short and long term. If I stay sober long enough, will it become easier to be around alcohol? Anyways thanks for reading. I will not drink today.",22,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.55251217}"

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

******************************************************
Good morning everyone! 

I wanted to share a quote with you all that really resonated with me:

""To truly be happy, we have to prioritize acknowledging our present selves rather than our future selves."" Jordan Mendiola

This was in an article on Medium about why you shouldn’t rush your success. It was talking more about success in the workplace, but I thought it worked perfectly for the journey of sobriety. 

When I first started here, and sometimes even now, I looked at others on here with their crazy high badge numbers and I felt a twinge of jealousy that I wasn’t there yet and placed so much focus on who I would be when I “got there”. 

Now I’m learning to be grateful for how far I’ve come instead of wasting time imagining what it’ll be like to reach 1000 days. I’ll get there one day, but for today I acknowledge and appreciate who I am now, and furthermore, I’ve learned to fall in love with the process! Every day enriches my life with new lessons and new mindsets, and I wouldn’t want to rush a single second of that!

This is just what this quote means to me, but I would love to hear your thoughts on it!

Usually I would not deal with these thoughts and feelings properly and just drink, but since I'm currently not drinking, I've been forced to step back and really look at the situation, and I suddenly realized something amazing. 

I've listened to my internal monologue and things that I was telling myself, and then I thought: if a friend came to me and told me that they've had a shitty job interview, would I reply ""that's because you're a dumb bitch""? Would I ask why do they even think they deserve a better job? In fact, one of my friends did actually complain about her job search not going well about a week ago, and I, sure enough, didn't say or think any of those things. I encouraged her not to give up and to take care of herself.

And then it struck me: putting myself in my friends' shoes in a situation like this is exactly what's called self-compassion! Treating yourself like you would a dear friend - like someone you love. Someone you give benefit of a doubt; someone who can make mistakes or not always be ""on"" for whatever reason, and that's okay. You just tell them that this happens, they are still a great person, and you'll support them no matter what.

I read about self-compassion before, but I've never really truly understood what it is, and I know that alcohol was at fault - it had always felt like a simpler solution in the short run, so the primitive part of my brain told me to just take it. But taking care of myself instead already feels more rewarding (and I'm just at the beginning of my sober journey)!

This is a little bit of a rant, but I just feel like I need to get this out.

I don’t know quite how to express what I’m feeling.  I called my dad and step mother today just to chat. I haven’t talked to him in a couple weeks which is pretty normal for us.  I could tell that they were pretty drunk when they picked up the phone just from the way they were slurring their words.  It made me feel uncomfortable and sad to be talking with them when they were in that state.

We talked for a while but the whole conversation left a horrible taste in my mouth.  They asked me about my new job and let me say one or two things about it before my dad started saying a bunch of cynical stuff about how you just have to work for a paycheck, and training just exists to make the lawyers happy.  I’m really proud of myself for getting this new job and it makes me feel sad when he talks about it so negatively.  I just want him to be proud of me too...

My father has been trying to get an audiovisual system up and running at his church and today they finally got it working so he should have been happy, but instead he kept telling me that he woke up wanting to kill himself because the whole thing was so stressful.  I thought this was hyperbole at first but he repeated that he woke up wanting to kill himself like ten times. It was super upsetting for me to hear that whether it was a joke or not.  

This whole conversation left me feeling really sad and confused.  Sad for myself because I want approval from my father that I don’t totally feel like I’m getting.  Sad for my father because it seems like he is in a really dark place.  Worried for my father because of the things he said.  I feel helpless, inferior, and sad.

I will follow up with them and make sure that they are ok.  I hope that the next time I call we can have a more positive conversation.  I really love my dad and I really want him to be ok.

I managed 36 days. I was a social drinker who was bad at moderation and would often have way more than planned and then be faced with life destroying hangovers/shame which was affecting my physical and mental health. 

Things were going great. 36 days no alcohol, 24 days no caffeine, and finally hit a week no nicotine. I lost 4kg since start of year, have been eating healthy, going to the gym 4 days a week, being so active, sleeping better, way more calm and have my mental health a lot more in control. I also finally built up courage to install some dating apps after a couple months from my last break up and had a couple of dates lined up, one I was especially looking forward to. I was proud of myself. I started taking micro holidays from work, have a 4 day weekend starting today where I had all these fun activities planned and was going to de-stress and be kind to myself.

Yesterday I had a super stressful day and work, then I run from my house a bit frazzled, late to meet friends. I'm taking public transport trying to work out where I'm going. I get a phone call from a number I don't recognise, I think it's the optician and answer. Except it's not, it's my ex who I have not spoke to in many years. My longest relationship that I sometimes have regrets about, who decided to call out of the blue and then give me all these life updates about how they just had a baby and how great their life and career is going and ask some invasive questions to me (30, single, hate job that is nothing to be proud of etc.). It really threw me to get this phone call out of the blue and not easy to hear how great a significant ex is doing and they just had babies etc.

I arrive to my friends and am quite thrown from the stressful week and phone call and proceed to drink 3 beers (smaller 33cl ones not pints) and also do nicotine, so broke both streaks. Bars close early here so I proceed to invite everyone back to mine cause I want to keep going. It's early evening. I have another beer, buy more nicotine.

I had messaged my friend/roomate saying how I'm bringing a few friends back hope that's fine. He doesn't respond and then I tell him we are back here hope that's cool. And then I realise he's actually on a date and staying over at the girls so I'm like oh forgot you on a date so don't care nvm. He gets really offended and I think he's upset I brought people back, and we have this weird back and forth and I really don't understand why he is upset. He says I'm being disrespectful. I explain sorry didn't mean to be, I had a few beers and nicotine (he knows I quit) and also had this cray call from an ex and a bit of a personal crisis, so sorry if I wrote something he thought was insensitive. Instead of being my usual friend, asking me if I'm ok, he is still being like wtf why are you telling me this. It goes on similar strange back and forth, he is upset with me, I'm sharing about the mini crisis I had today with ex, work and breaking my sober streak by drinking and doing nicotine.

I go to show the messages to a mutual friend because I can't work out what I could have written to him go make him so upset. This is when I realise I have not been messaging my roommate, I have been messaging my upcoming date (first one set up after many months not being brave enough to date and and of the 3 dates I set up, the one with most potential). I try to explain but it's a really embarrassing exchange and a shit show. They never respond again. I feel intensely embarassed plus that opportunity is now ruined. I drink another beer with friends. I go to bed feeling ashamed and really upset for messing up the great work I had done with life in 36 days.

Now I'm wide awake at 6am and didn't sleep well, feel hungover (I can get terrible hangovers even from 5 small beers), feel ashamed, and like I ruined my fun weekend off. I get OCD stuff like intrusive thoughts and excessive rumination, so anything I do that is shameful gets blown out of proportion in my head and I can't stop thinking about it and feeling this wave of shame and badness wash over me each time, and I can keep ruminating on things for months. I have a separate date tonight and something on Sunday. I'm feel like I'm just going to give up and drink, I already ruined my work and dating is already hard sober and I'll spiral and be back where I was with my bad habits.

Sorry for the essay. Now I will lie in bed and feel paranoid someone I know irl will read this. Thanks if anyone has words of encouragement to stop my spiralling this weekend and making bad decisions. I realise this is all stupid and minor and most people post here have greater problems. My friends even think it's kind of funny.

TL/DR: had mini personal crisis brought on by work stress and phonecall from long lost ex. Drank beers until I was tipsy/merry drunk.

also with all this free time ive been getting into gardening, and its officially a breeze getting my little tomato/jalapeño/basil/tomatillos/lettuce/marijuana/ect sprouts now.

Not that anyone asked for gardening advice but I thought what the hell, a group full of sober people might actually care about my gardening tips lol

Her and her fiancé both got pretty drunk while I stayed sober.  I know being around people drinking can be a trigger for many, but watching them act sloppy and obnoxious hardened my resolve to remain sober.  There have been so many nights where I was just as bad as them, oblivious to how impaired I was.  Tonight I had a sad realization: going forward, I know I will probably spend less time with some of these friends as many of them are ""drinking buddies"" and every party often involves getting drunk.  Though many of them have reigned it in over the years, they still like to party.  While I love them all dearly, being the sober one amongst a group of drunks simply isn't all that fun and I have no desire to join them in getting hammered.  I don't want to ask them to stay sober in order to hang out, if they want to come to that on their own, I would embrace it, but I don't want to force my sobriety on others.  I ask them to do things that dont involve drinking like hiking, biking, fishing etc, but often they decline.  So as I continue on my path, I will probably spend more time alone and try to find some new friends, something that feels weird in my late 30s.  I'm a little sad about this, but I know that this is what needs to happen as I make a real effort to live a sober life.

See, I am also 75 days off nicotine and I used a medicine to stop smoking which worked pretty well. I figured science HAS to have improved.

Well it did, he started talking about naltrexone, it's 80% success rate at curing alcoholism, and the sinclair method. He was also adamant that I had to keep drinking at my current pace until I felt otherwise, which isn't much compared to when I was downing a bottle of vodka a day. So, I said sure, I'll ""feel otherwise"" when hell freezes over. My two tall boys that clock in at 5 drinks a night have been my rock for the past couple months.

I wound up reading the book, The Cure For Alcoholism, looking into the studies done on it, and feeling pretty good. I just needed to take the pill one hour before drinking, keep track of how much I drink, and try to be mindful when drinking. Not a bad compromise, 32 drinks the first week, 28 the second, and I'm on the first day of the third week now. Already nearing the 24 drinks a week max to be drinking healthily.

Tonight, I felt otherwise. I just feel, I don't know, indifferent to the idea of drinking. Like, yeah I wouldn't mind a beer right now, but I'm in no mood to go out and get one. I took a 2 hour bath, read a couple chapters of my book and now I'm winding down for bed with some tea.

Hope that over a few months, I will no longer be alcoholic, as long as I take one little pill an hour before drinking for the rest of my life.

Our neighbors recently moved, but left plenty of their belongings on the curb to be picked up. My boyfriend and I had the bright idea to go rummage through the pile and look for anything worth taking home at about 2 AM. As we quietly sort through everything, someone emerges from the house next door and starts talking to us.

Thinking that we're in trouble, we immediately put our hands up and apologize. The guy introduces himself, tells us to let him know if we find anything cool, then goes back inside. A few minutes pass and he comes down the steps to us, with a beverage in hand. It's only when he offers the can to me that I realize it's a beer- I immediately freeze up. *I'm only six weeks sober. I haven't been offered alcohol and had to say no yet. I don't want him to think I'm rude. Fuck fuck fuck*.

My boyfriend sees me struggling to get the words out and says, ""Actually, we're..."" The man cuts him off. ""Recovering alcoholics? Me too! I just keep stuff in the fridge for when guests come over. Have this instead."" In his other hand is a Cherry Pepsi, which he then tosses to me.

This stranger was aware that not everyone drinks and brought an alternative to alcohol. He had no reason to be friendly with us and chose to be anyway. He knew before my boyfriend finished his sentence that we were in recovery.

This interaction may not seem like much, but it gave me a renewed hope in my sobriety. I had this vision in my head that no one else understood and that my life would be a constant series of awkward no's and invalidating comments.

This past fall, one of my relatives died from alcohol poisoning. He had battled alcoholism for well over a decade, and it finally got the best of him. Despite knowing that, I started drinking more heavily than ever before. Then, in November, I lost my job due to a combination of alcohol and depression. Since I was home by myself all day, everyday, I passed the time by drinking. Eventually, a buddy got me a job working at his bar. I made it through one month of working there before I started drinking heavily on the job. Finally, one night I drank a fifth in about 3 hours and blacked out. I have no idea what happened, I just know I woke up with bruises all over and a gash on my nose. My roommate and girlfriend agreed to help me stop drinking, but I hadn't yet hit rock bottom, so I kept drinking. I was able to hide it from them for 2 weeks. Until last night.

My girlfriend and I had plans to hangout last night, but when she got here, I was so drunk I could no longer form words or coherent thoughts. As a result, she broke up with me. I am in love with her and was planning on spending the rest of my life with her. But alcohol has now taken that from me. 

In 4 months, my addiction to alcohol has taken the life of a family member, gotten me fired from not one but two jobs, and has destroyed my relationship with the woman I love. But this stops now. I'm done being controlled by alcohol. I'm done letting it ruin my life. I'm done letting it ruin my relationships. I'm done letting it destroy my body.

Day 2 came around. Felt OK, not great, just ok, a little sick feeling a tiny bit shaking, but otherwise holding down food, got some exercise. At a good dinner, relaxed and went to bed. Sleep still kind of sucked. I think I hit REM a few times (takes 90 mins).

Day 4 LETS DO ALL THE THINGS. LETS FIX IT \*ALL\* EVERYTHING ALLLLLLL THE THINGS!!!!!!

I cannot even handle how the hell I drank everyday. Leading up to this, I did start taking M-Th off from drinking  starting late Dec. I think that helped me lay down getting used to being sober, even if it was over a near 2 month period of being sober M-Th. 

The kindling effect is no joke - if you don't know what that is it's when you drink a long time, quit, get sick, get sober maybe for a while then go back to drinking, and quit again, and again. Don't think just because you got a year in of drinking, doesn't mean it won't hit you. It can! I'm finding people who are younger than me by 20 years are having this issue. Who knew? It's crazy.

Over time everytime you drink the window of withdrawal gets shorter. For me it got down to a mere 4-5 days of drinking when it was HELL to stop. You can do more research on it, but it's not a good thing to have and there is no known cure for it. 

Even though it's tempting to go back to this schedule of M-Th not drinking, I'm scared to even approach it and drink on a Fri/Sat/Sun.   I'm not going to. I am going for a 30 day quit, to see if I can put the next 30 days after that 30 together.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5441489}"

I made it 14 days without any ""alcohol"", but found that I started replacing it with cough syrup (which has alcohol in it....), weed, and sleeping pills.  Anything to alter myself.  I struggle with bipolar disorder and anxiety on top of everything.

After 14 days, I relapsed on Valentine's day and I'm worse off now than before.   I am once again hiding it, and I finished 12 shots of vodka on Tuesday night, woke up Wednesday still drunk, decided to drink another 1.5 bottles of wine in the morning and blacked out by noon, completely missing my therapy appointment, an important meeting for work and basically did absolutely no work (was ""working"" from home).   

I feel so depressed and hopeless.  I am ashamed and frankly scared.  I have lost any semblance of self-control, and I am so worried I will not be able to stop this and it will kill me.

I have a master's in a health-related field, a great job, and a wonderful partner.   Why am I doing this to myself??? I am very close to losing any shred of sanity I have left and everything good that I have in my life.

I'm a 30 M, grew up with parents who both abused alcohol to a large extent while I was growing up (teen years) but managed to keep the facade, so nobody suspected. I still have contact with them, and love them, even though I know they fucked me and my younger brother up psychologically.

I began experimenting with weed and psychedelics around my 20's, which I don't regret at all, but I developed a bad drinking habit in my mid-20's. My heavier drinking has been on and off ever since. I've worked in schools and kindergardens, and been on benefits for some periods (live in Scandinavia), and have recieved psychological help of varying effectiveness. I've also been on escitalopram (lexapro, cipralex) for some periods. I'm currently studying a bachelors degree into my 4th semester, and doing alright, started another round of escilopram some week ago because I guess I'm depressed and have anxiety. Hope to combat that. Keep making stupid choices, and I'm all aware.

The temptation to drink is strong. I often feel kind of shitty, and drinking some whiskey or rum takes the edge off, even though I know it's fucking stupid in the long run. I often figure I'll have a couple or five drinks at the max, and I almost always finish the 50cl bottle during an evening. I know it's stupid and I know it's counterproductive and I know it's continuing habituating a bad habit. That's the fucked up thing. I know all the cognitive facts and insights, and I would probably be great at guiding or coaching someone to break out of substance abuse, I just can't apply it to myself because of, I guess, low self esteem/worth, and I haven't hit a rocky enough bottom yet?

I've been lurking here for some time, and just wanted to post here now. Started a post loads of times, never clicked post.

I have heard nostalgia can result from the small victories feeling big when life is very hard. I've also heard that during times of crisis life is simpler because survival occupies all of your time so there is less to worry about.

For me the issues that need to be addressed are my long term dysfunctional relationship with my SO, a traumatic/abusive childhood, and my career which, I'm realizing, are all intertwined with my substance abuse. My dysfunctional upbringing taught me that my feelings and needs did not matter. As a child I coped in 2 ways: by turning into a people pleaser where it was my job to be the kid I thought my parents needed (of course that didn't work) and by learning to disconnect from myself and from that situation. I did this by obsessively reading books. Books created an escape into worlds where I did not exist and neither did my family troubles. 

Well flash forward a couple of decades. I haven't had a relationship with my parents since I left in my early 20s so I figured I had escaped them forever but lo and behold, it turns out my strategy to adulting is the same as when I was kid. Both in my personal relationship and my career, my needs have taken a backseat (I frankly don't really know what my needs are or how to verbalize them). As a result, my life the past decade has felt like I'm just going through the motions, not really living for myself, accepting subpar treatment from my SO and not really knowing how to progress in my career. How do I cope with that? By numbing myself from the situation with, you guessed it, booze.

This seems obvious now but it has only become apparent to me in the past few weeks as a result of not drinking. I guess the hard part now is how do I deal with those issues so that I don't feel the need to be numb all the time? Has anyone on here dealt with alcohol addiction and codependency? What helped you work through that? I've started looking for literature on codependency though its been a bit of a frustrating search because much of it is 12-step or faith based material.

Until I woke up Monday with my body feeling like it was under attack. I genuinely think my body was screaming at me to stop. Muscle spasms everywhere, my legs were cramped up bad, bloodshot eyes. Naturally I drank a beer to settle down thinking maybe I was having some withdrawals but it finally hit me. My body had had NOTHING but alcohol in it for days. It was screaming at me to stop and drink some water. My heart rate was through the roof.

I'm not even exaggerating when I say I was almost to the point of needing an IV. I contemplated the hospital all day and even called my doctor. As long as I could keep water down, just keep trying. It took me hours of sips of water and gatorade to calm my muscles down. The amount of water I actually had to consume was incredible. I'll be lucky if I come out the other side without kidney damage.

It was insane day but it will be the day that scared me straight. I don't EVER want to experience that again. I was so disgusted with myself for letting it get that far. I'd become so okay with putting my personal health and hygiene on the back burner. Jesus.

I officially started my get sober clock yesterday morning. My last drink was Monday morning. Monday night I laid there with the sweats but last night was a rough one. I've quit before and can only add last night to my scare because it's the worst I've ever experienced. Jerking myself awake, gasping for air. I went to bed with the lowest resting heart rate I've had in months from being properly hydrated but I'd wake up with the highest. I'm tired today but I'm sober. I still have insane diarrhea but it's not black from red wine. I have an appetite for once and I've lost my bloat because I'm finally eating. How did I ignore that I never had an appetite?

I'm being careful about my symptoms and am a little shaken up from nerves but thank GOD I don't have withdraw hands. It's been over 24 hours and my eyes haven't turned yellow, trust me I check every 6 minutes. I want to give myself a couple of weeks before getting a check up to asses the damage. I'd just like to go in confidently saying I'm sober.

I can't go through that again. It's not worth it. People WERE starting to notice my ""tipsy"" behavior and I can only think I was a day away from putting my liver over the edge. My face was always flushed, my emotions a wreck. The last time I ""took a break"" I noticed my anxiety was so much better but it was only a break. I cared more about drinking than I did a positive thing. Not this time. I can't live like that and I want to live. I'm ready to start the journey of repairing my body and mind.

I'm at least 20lbs overweight (5'9"" and 190lbs). I'm not sleeping well. I always wake up groggy even after 2-3 beers, and at least mildly hungover if I drink more than 6 beers.

Whenever I'm hungover I always think ""that's it - no more"". And then a day or two passes, I recover, forget, and start drinking again. This time I'm putting it down on the record - no more booze. 

I want to go back to the days when I hardly ever drank except for the occasional wedding or happy hour. I was happier, more energetic, and in better shape.  I hardly ever gave alcohol any thought. Since then it's slowly become a central part of my life, always planning when to stock up, driving around various liquor stores to buy exactly the beer I want, wasting money and time. I've grown to loathe this.

Before I got sober and learned how to get better, my days added up to depressing, self-defeating thinking. I stumbled through my day, chained to my past, not even being able to think about how to get better. That is how overwhelmed I was from my abuser's impact and that is why I drugged, drank, and over ate most of my life.

I inherited that self-destructive mindset from the three monsters who raised me. I also know them as my ""mother"" and two older ""sisters"". Outsiders did not know them as I did; I knew them as hypocritical monsters. They conned outsiders into thinking they were happy family members and I was the problem child. Unless, of course, outsiders knew the body language and tip-offs that would reveal our true identities. We lived a big fat distortion and putrid lies.

Now, after having devoted the time I needed to face and accept how cruelly they treated me, FREED ME FROM THEIR CLUTCHES, plus I can think clearly!

I never could before. I could not figure out how people arrived at their simple, logical decisions because I was still struggling with the questions.

I didn't understand how my brain worked and dealt with trauma, with assault. Assault so severe and damaging, I locked it away in amnesia. Almost the entire time I lived under mother’s roof was a COMPLETE BLANK. I am 63 years old and I cannot remember any Christmases. I have one flash of moving to a new home, but not moving out of old ones, and mother moved us every two years, mostly. I have images of two of my birthdays, and random days from different schools. I have occasional brief snapshots here and there of other occasions. But that is it; I locked away the rest in my head and it exhausts me. I know my exhaustion and chronic fatigue connect because when I process a big problem, my energy improves a bit. It is tiny, but it is there and I feel it. I know those will add up over time to enormous improvements for me, so I keep going.

While I know I may never retrieve every memory, I have the right to know what they did to me I cannot remember. What worries me is this: Our thoughts fuel our behavior. And our brains learn through repetition, whether it is accurate or not. Mother could not talk about anyone, family or friends, without ripping them to shreds with hateful, destructive criticism. That is what I heard from them: Dripping sarcasm, super glued with hypocritical hatred, simmering with rage.

So, what did I lock up in my brain, that one day will show up, triggered, echoing mother’s vile, sickening way of life?

Believe me, I work hard to resolve that because that is what my family cemented inside me. They taught me hatred. It worries me!

So, with that in mind, what I can do is accept the issues that nagged me my entire life and kept me awake at night. What kept me running, drinking, drugging, and overeating was the chant in my head from my monsters I could not get to stop: that I would never be lovable or good enough. They chanted I was a bother to everyone; I was beyond repair. I should never have been born. I could do nothing right.

Another crippling fear I had? What if they were right?

Those problems overwhelmed me, so I could not avoid them any longer. I had to face them. I knew I would relapse if I did not face them. Yet, I did not understand why I sabotaged myself consistently. I tried different things to help myself, but I always blew it. See? I could not think clearly. I could not put 2 and 2 together.

Discussing that with my therapist, she suggested hypnotherapy. I asked her a couple of questions and agreed to try it. On my next session, I brought a voice-activated recorder with me. We got to work on that iceberg of confusing pain. Those sessions got those buried, padlocked in place, cemented emotions moving and OUT of my system.

So, to keep that moving out of me, I listened to the sessions 2 or 3 times at home most days. I watched movies that made me cry. I would sit down at my computer and just type out what was in my thoughts. I didn’t stop to edit, I just typed.

Over time, I saw how much better I felt to get that toxic waste out of my head and in black and white in front of me where I could see it for what it was: LIES! DISTORTED. PUTRID.LIES!!!

What do you think? Is that something you think you could do or can you think of another way that would suit you? The events that hurt us will vary from person to person. But, the underlying emotions are the same: shame, humiliation, guilt, self-loathing, self-hatred, anger, rage, need to escape, not knowing how to problem solve or take care of ourselves…….. Those feelings are a huge part of who we are. They need validation their wounds are real, and when they get it, they will heal and quiet down. The best way to heal them is to face how the abuse hurt us. Then they will settle down.

Do you want to know what happened next after I did that for a while? I thought clearly and arrived at solutions ON.MY.OWN.!!!!!

Being able to do that makes me want to HUG MYSELF! I go through my day so much easier now; I don't have dark, depressing worries and thoughts pummeling me throughout my day. I think about what I am going to do and come up with simple productive steps and I get things done as best I can. I say ""as best I can"" because I am disabled and have a lot of chronic health issues. The worst for me now is my chronic fatigue.

Over the years, as I worked on my mental health issues to get better, my fatigue problems would improve a teeny bit every time; it was teeny, but I felt it. That encouraged me to keep going because I know those teeny steps add up to enormous improvements.

So, in closing, working on my emotional wounds has brought me the furthest. I am better than I was and I do everything I can to polish my writing because I am determined to find the way to earn my own living with my writing, and get off of welfare and out of poverty for good.",23,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64277107}"

My ex got in contact in Jan wishing me hapoy bday and that he missed me and we chatted here and there, then met up last week 2 days on the trot. No mention about money (I'll get to that in a bit). The first day he said he wanted to see what happens between us. The next day I stayed over (I know) after having quite a bit of wine. He said he wants us to get back together and said about how happy we were and we could get to that again. He said we should meet up as much as possible before I go to rehab. 

Anyway, I saw him yesterday and told him my check in date for rehab is now 9 days away and not a month ish like I thought. So we went for a walk round the path then he said I owed him £200. It was out of the blue. I asked what for and he said for ""drink"" etc. 

I'm pretty certain I paid him back everything I owed him. He had booked and paid for a holiday around the time I was applying for rehab. I then got confirmation I'd be able to go to rehab, so told him that I wouldn't be able to go on the holiday. Obviously the hol isn't going ahead now anyway, due to restrictions. At the time he wanted me to pay him half for the holiday but I said to take his mum or a friend. 

I just feel conflicted. There was no mention of me apparently owing him money until I said i was going away? I asked where his proof is I owe him and he said I said I'd pay him back at the time. I left abruptly and he sent me a message saying ""you've paid me money back before. Are you worried I'll leave you if you pay me back?"".

It was just such an endless, constant misery. This is a record of an average day of drinking for me, back when I was an addict.

I’m sharing it partly because it’s another record of my journey: I’ve written a bunch about where I am, but not where I came from. I’m also sharing it because it’s my first time confronting the reality of how much alcohol I actually Drank.

I have a chat with my therapist today, I’m going to tell her too. It’ll be my first time discussing with her as well, but you guys heard it first lol. 

***An average day***

530am: wake up. Never hung over, potentially still drunk. Think through anything horrible I might’ve done the previous day, if I lost anything, etc.

6-7am: cuddle with wife, shower, shave, brush teeth, etc. this is the only normal hour of my entire day, I try and appreciate it.

7am to 9am: morning work calls taken from dive bar, 4-5 drinks on an empty stomach 

9am: around 3-4 drinks at another bar - change of scenery, my favorite pub has opened! their food sucks so we always skip breakfast.

10am: brush teeth, floss, mouth wash for any in person meeting 

12pm: 3-5 drinks at lunch (2 with whoever I’m having lunch with, 2-3 afterwards to round it out)

2-4pm: if i have any in-person meeting, suffer through a few hours. If it’s a call, keep on drinking around 2-3 drinks. By this time I’m quite tipsy, haven’t eaten much and have had a ton to drink. So I take a little pause.

4-5pm: we just took a pause on drinking right? got to get back at it. Pre happy hour. all the rest of my meetings can be set at bars and restaurants, so this launches us into the night of drinking. Down maybe 2-3 drinks.

5-7pm: meetings over drinks. 2 drinks max, got to keep it classy.

7-9pm: dinner. I’m pretty much always paying, so I insist that we order lots of drinks. 2-4 drinks.

9-10pm: nightcap(s). 2-3 drinks.

That’s around 20-25 drinks per day. I’m not a big guy, I’m around 140lbs. That was so fucked up. I can never go back there again. I had never written this out, because it feels fucking so sick. I can’t believe this is how I lived.",70,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49058348}"

For whatever reason, this time around my cravings haven’t been debilitating. This is probably the easiest going it’s been since my many quits starting in August. I truly believe it’s because I’ve switched into the mindset of really wanting this for myself.

Future events use to daunt me. I couldn’t imagine - or it would make me so sad - to think how I couldn’t drink when snowboarding, or at a social gathering with family or friends, or at a restaurant, or on a trip. I could feel in my bones I hadn’t even fully convinced myself I wouldn’t drink at those.

So I began tackling each of those, one at a time. It started with a trip and I chose that I wouldn’t drink. I ended up having a really great time and I look back at it fondly whenever I relapse. I remember how good I felt to be sober and not drinking while on that trip.

Then I tackled a family event. I brought my own waters and kombuchas. Honestly, it felt like every other time I’d go home for something. Nothing changed except the fact I’d wake up feeling really good and not worried that I’d be getting “the looks” from my parents the next morning.

Then I went on a snowboarding trip that I told myself I wouldn’t drink on. I spent the day working on learning my new board and felt glad that I could drive home if I thought my SO was getting tired.

I think it took realizing that I could enjoy myself at each of these things, despite being stone cold sober. I don’t look forward at these looming events and trips with sadness anymore. I’m learning reframe my mindset when it comes to the fear of missing out. 

Anyway. Thanks to those choices I can sit here today and not feel so bummed anymore when looking ahead. But, for the most part, I’m focusing on the todays.

The fact that websites did not open and those blocks existing did remind me of the reasons they are there. So just ordered some soda (well, kvass) and cereal instead.

I am not even sure where all these cravings are coming from. Maybe just getting overworked and tired, and without anything major happening it's just smaller things building up.

Anyway last night I barely slept a wink, which is common for me after my first sober day. When I did start to fall into a dream my body began vibrating for what felt like 2 minutes. I tried to say my BF’s name but I couldn’t move or get any words out. Has anyone else experienced this after newly becoming sober? I was too scared to fall asleep because I was worried it might happen again. I only drank again for a week so I can’t imagine it would be withdrawal symptoms?  When I googled it, a couple threads for lucid dreaming and astral projection came up. Your body apparently starts vibrating when your consciousness is leaving your body and ready to explore your dream world. I’ve never practiced lucid dreaming so I don’t know if that’s what it was, I was just wondering if anyone else ever experienced it?

This happened at work, this Monday. I got back from winter vacation this Monday (I work at a school and we had all of last week off), walked into the office and there on my desk is a four pack of tall boys of possibly one of my favorite beers I used to drink. I saw RED. I was immediately angry, because how dare they put something like that on my desk, because pretty much 99% of the people I work closely with in my office all know I'm in recovery. At first, I thought it was a joke that might have gone too far. So I fired off a few texts to a couple of friends that worked in other buildings on campus, ripping into them a little, nothing too blood-thirsty though. I later found out, it was a total mistake, a forgivable one, which one of my friends corrected me and told me as I was ripping into everyone, which he shouldn't need to at all.

My thing is that, how am I to go around expecting everyone to walk on eggshells for me for the rest of my life, when it's really me who has to make a modification in my life, because let's be honest here, there's no fucking way I'm going through life with everyone that's going to be sensitive to all my triggers. It's something that I need to eventually deal with. 

Speaking for some of us that are alcoholics and in recovery, we know that we have the odds stacked against us. We live in a society that was grown on alcohol. I'm pretty sure each of our Fore Father's enjoyed a few whiskey shots before bedtime. The prime default for your average American, at least the country that I live in, is that you at least drink alcohol. Even if you drink once or twice a year, you still drink. That's beside the point as I drivel on here..... How do we (alcoholics) expect society to adhere to our lifestyle just because we have a sickness? The answer is we can't. We have to deal with this shit on a daily basis, and the normal shouldn't have tip-toe through the tulips for us on eggshells and apologize profusely if one of them steps on a crack and offends us. Doesn't work like that.

This whole thing came to fruition as I typed a really good friend of mind in rehab who's had it really hard. He's like a brother to me and I really want him to get better and be healthy and move on with his life. I guess this epiphany also came to light as I approach my one year mark. I've already had friends die from the sickness and countless more relapse and go back to the bottle.

I was in AA at the time and really struggled with letting go of drinking forever. I could never seem to commit to it when I looked out on all the living left to do, people to socialize with, and adventures to be had. Shortly after achieving day 110 (or something) I threw in the towel. To be fair, there were plenty of great times, but the impacts grew greater every decade and the good times grew fewer.

I spent far too much time alone in a bar hoping to recreate the good times. I assumed my brain power and education would carry my career into retirement. I imagined my drinking would somehow morph into a healthy habit conducive to raising a family. None of it happened. I'm now trying to figure out retirement, too burned out to keep learning more BS in a career based on BS. Trying to get back in shape which seems to be a game of whack-a-mole with injuries and ailments. I'm trying to become a good parent just as my kids are preparing to leave the house.

I wish I could say I felt great and it was all sunshine and rainbows, but it is remarkably unmoving. I still need to take action to build a life I want with what time I have left.

In college, I started smoking a lot of weed. I can remember those days easily. Early on, I remember that I would usually be feeling pretty good each day, content, clear-headed, social, confident. And then I would smoke some weed with my friends, and I remember a lot of times I would think ""I'm high as shit and I felt better before I got high. I've lost my confidence and social ability."" This is strange, because why would I get high if I didn't like how it made me feel? But I would continue to smoke more weed all throughout college and it really killed my social life. I only hung out with stoners. 

I've been thinking lately, why I have felt the need to drink myself into complete numbness for so long. And I wonder, is it possible that I actually don't like the feeling of being intoxicated and that I drink more and more to feel less and less of the intoxication?

Day 1 I was massively hungover. I had a busy day at work which I just about managed to get through even though I was not very productive due to the drinking from the day before. I then made dinner (nothing special) and watched tv with the family for an hour. Neither would have happened if I was drinking. Went to bed at 10 and up at 6. Only woke up once in the night and fell asleep again within a few minutes so sleep was ok.

Day 2 - yesterday I went for a walk in the morning and by the end of the day managed 7.5k steps. I managed 11 push ups over 3 sets which is actually a huge increase on my previous  1.5 push ups. I had to prep for an interview plus another busy day at work. I had three good meals but the tiredness was unbearable. My eyes were heavy and I just felt like falling asleep. Managed to get work done but the evening was just me lying down. Had no energy at all. I guess that’s what I get for drinking so much for all these years and being hungover everyday except yesterday I didn’t have the alcohol to fuel the hangover induced tiredness. But still it was a good day. I fell asleep at 9 last night and woke up today at 7. I woke up once in the night but fell asleep within a few minutes.

Today - I could make this day 3. I woke up feeling rough with a headache. But I had breakfast plus painkillers. Had a phone interview and it went really well. The role is very senior to what I do and I have been told by the recruiter I was picked as the left field candidate that they feel they can develop into the role whereas the other 3 are all experienced in that role. But after the interview I thought I will back out. I don’t think I want too much change at the moment as that may affect my attempt at sobriety.

I haven’t had any cravings so far and I am positive although very tired. Trying to get through as much work so I can manage to keep things ticking.

I know I shouldn’t look too far ahead but I am hoping to make today day 3, get through work today and tomorrow and then have a sober weekend where I can rest plus spend time with family and hopefully that will help a little with the fatigue going into next week.

I'm 26 and have been binge drinking 3/4 times a week for the last 10 years. It started with partying a lot in school, then getting myself into a career (entertainment) where alcohol before, after and during work is perfectly normal. Last year myself (and the rest of the industry) were put out of work and to put it lightly I... Spiralled. With it came the mood swings, benders and liver pangs.

Well I wanted to post here because as of today I've been sober for 34 days. The longest I've gone in 10 years. If I'm being honest at times it's absolutely sucked, but every day it's getting easier. Day by day I'm discovering the person I am without alcohol and slowly trying to fall back in love with myself.

The one thing I wanted to ask you guys is my country is reopening soon and I'm already being invited to parties, bars, festivals - and I'm dreading the thought of doing any of it sober. Anyone have any tips?

The second I feel up to drink again it's back in the pit I go. 

Worst part, I started lying to concerned friends family. ""yeah I'm doing a lot better these days.."" ""honestly I don't count the days but it's been a while since I drank, I know that.."" are my go to lies. I hate that I feel the need to lie to them, they only care. 

I'm better than I was, sure, but it just doesn't feel like it's enough or ever will be. Instead 30 drunk days a month, it's more like 15-20. But that's still super abnormal.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's officially 25 days, the withdrawls are all seemingly gone finally. I hit a very bad point, minor delirium set in, I was losing function of my legs and that lasted about 6 days, I was unable to stand and keep my balance in the shower, I needed a shower seat so I didn't fall over. I was having conversations in bed while fully awake with people that weren't there and it scared my wife a lot. I never, ever want to go through this again, and experiencing the quitting side of it I think has pushed me enough to stay dry long term. I don't even really crave drinking right now. 

With that said, I can't sleep. The insomnia is insane. Sometimes it will take me 3 to 5 hours to fall asleep an i'm up and wide awake by 8am, usually I wake up once during that time at least to use the restroom. I feel so physically drained constantly because I cannot get a good night sleep. I've tried melatonin, valerian, doxylamine succinate, diphenhydramine, kava, sleepy time tea, and CBD. Nothing helps me fall asleep, nothing helps keep me asleep, and i'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this, has some tips, or anything other than going to a doctor and getting a prescription for something that will knock me out.

My mother has been drinking since I was a child. She isn't drinking all the time, but when she does - she becomes erratic, violent, and doesn't seem to think clearly.

I am 28, I don't live with my mom and my step-dad anymore, and the last year or so I was certain things had calmed down over there. Yesterday, I received a phone call from my step-dad who said he wanted to let me know she's still drinking when she has time off work. When I was a child, it was like this vicious circle - she would drink, then scream and either hit me or throw things around the house, throwing a tantrum. Then she cried because she was sorry. This has been going on for years, except now I don't have to experience it in my own home. At some point she was using pills too, and once (that I know of) she tried to kill herself by going into the woods, trying to use a belt to hang herself. 

My step-dad said he can't handle being in a relationship with her if this continues, they have been together for almost 20 years and she's still drinking. He wanted help from me, so we can try to help her.

How do you help someone that doesn't want help? She already knows we hate that she drinks, because she's like a different person when she does. Any advice in this situation would be highly appreciated.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.82819283}"

So over two years ago I was in the depths of depression and drinking to blackout nearly every night. Did some awful embarrassing things, some I know about, but god knows what other terrible things I've done that I do not have a clue of.

Until today when one caught up with me.

So I have this friends who's been doing some jail time, who just got out, and texted me to see what I was up to, we chatted for a bit and then he mentions that he saw my -generic police documentary name- episode. I asked him what the fuck he was talking about, and then he goes on to explain... 

So in one of my blackouts I fell asleep on a beach, like on the shoreline. I only know as I woke up in my bed at a hostel I was living in soaking wet and covered In sand. No clue how I got home but I vaguely remembered talking to two men. I was hoping it was nothing too nefarious and went on with my drinking career. 


Ladies, gentlemen, and non binary pals, those two men were cops. With a camera crew. 

My friend, sitting in the common room of the jail he was in, sees me so drunk I couldn't speak, getting scooped off the shoreline by cops and brought home in the back of a car. And I couldn't remember. 

This happened two years ago so god knows how many times this episode has been replayed. I am mortified. I think my face was blurred but I have very distinctive hair so anyone who knows me will know of they see it. National fucking telly. 

I had a little panic and a cry but then I called my sponsor and she helped me see the funny side, kind of.

Better still, this is the most sobriety affirming thing to happen to me in a while, and I'm so glad I'm not that person any more.

If moderation posts aren’t allowed I’m sorry. I e been drinking heavily for about ten years, I’m 32 now. Over the past two years I’ve probably only taken 3 or 4 days off randomly. Three nights ago I got absolutely shit faced, the next day I couldn’t even go open up the shop I own. So I took the day off at home with my expecting wife and we found a Wii in the attic and hooked it up and played all night, even though I couldn’t really stand up for any of the games. Then the next day, feeling okay, I decided to have a few beers which of course turned into shots and I got a little drunk and felt like crap again yesterday and I was able to not go down the usual road of drinking again to make me feel better. Today I woke up feeling pretty good, I had two days sober in the same week for the first time since I was probably 28. But then tonight I decided to have some beers again because I felt good. I’m about 7 beers in, probably shouldn’t have that many but I plan on not drinking tomorrow again. I think if I start to moderate myself like this at least alternating days is better than having 8+ beers a day everyday and my goal is to continue to slow it down back to where I can control myself and only have a couple beers with friends once a week or so. Which is my main problem, I can’t just have a few, if I have one I have ten.

EDIT:
We had our baby two weeks ago, I had been doing pretty good on the drinking side of things and three days sober with my wife in the hospital actually felt good, even though we knew something wasn’t right. Our baby girl came out blue, they tried the whole rubbing the back and slapping the feet thing but nothing happened. The terrible first words out of my wife’s mouth she saw her baby for the first time were ‘Is she okay?’ 
The immediately took her to the NICU. Told us she was just a little shocked from the quick delivery. My wife was in labor for about 14 hours but when the real pushing started she got our girl out in 40 minutes, which apparently is very fast for a first time mother. After a day our girl was transferred downtown where they have more resources and after a week of testing we found out that has a very rare genetic disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Type 0. Type 0 is the most rare, and unfortunately fatal within months depending on decisions made by us. After speaking with doctors and ethics people we have decided it’s probably best not to try to get her home, it would invoke a tracheotomy and a g-tube for feeding and hospice or nurse living in our house for 24/7 care. And doing that would even only extend her life for about six months. So in a week or two, after we get some family in to see her and have a priest come in (we aren’t super religious but were raised catholic and believe it will bring some peace to our older family members) we are going to have to pull the plug on our month old daughter.  I’m not sure why I decided to edit this post, not much do with support for my drinking, because it’s only gotten worse since we left the hospital. Maybe I just needed a vent.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41830695}"

No, I like to take it slow, immersed in my surroundings. I am obsessed with walking, always have been. My infatuation is partly out of necessity. I have an aversion to cars because of a long string of bad luck when it comes to finding one that doesn’t end up having something wrong with it. And then you have to pay for insurance. No thanks. So I walk, everywhere. It’s the best way, I think, to explore new places and find those hidden gems that always seem deliberately located out of the way, as if they don’t want to be found. For me, walking is a kind of adventure where I never quite know what to expect. It’s a way of losing myself. But also a way of finding myself while alone with my thoughts.

And it’s always incredibly therapeutic, rejuvenating. I read somewhere recently that doctors are starting to more frequently prescribe walking as an alternative to or in tandem with pharmaceuticals to alleviate anxiety. Walking therapy, I think it’s called. And this makes sense to me because if there was one thing that I can point to that was absolutely crucial for staying sober it was walking. Initially it was a way to escape my urges. I literally walked away from drinking. I’d walk as far away as I could from civilization so as to make it impossible to buy that wine that I craved. And it wasn’t just the distance created between me and alcohol. It was the experience of nature, the sheer wonder of all the beautiful sights and sounds responsible for that surge of dopamine you suddenly feel overcome you, altering your perception and mood. I’m not going to say that I became Henry Thoreau or anything. But I learned to commune with nature more intently, to take as much in as I possibly could. I’m never more present, and never feel more alive, than when I’m trudging along through the great green yonder.

I never fully realized how grateful I am for walking until this winter. I had grown accustomed to strolling around a lovely lake next to a ridiculously large and open park where I take my new pup Pneuma. Our walking regimen included snaking through the rich variety of trees while feeling the warmth of the sun on our faces and a gentle breeze wash over us, sooth us, much like the tranquil sound of the lapping water folding in upon itself in the lake. I even took up birdwatching. Me, birding! Special binoculars and the whole bit. Who would of thought? I lost all of this when the bitter cold settled in. I kept walking for as long as I could, bundling up to enjoy the beauty of the wintery outdoors. But eventually I grew weary of the cold, unmotivated and lethargic. Sedentary. It was a dangerous period for me and my sobriety. The magnitude of my depression in this great winter of my discontent while deprived of my walks reveals just how vital it is to connect with nature, with what I have truly come to understand as the sublime.

I finally made my triumphant return to the great outdoors yesterday. Hearing the birds sing and watching my dog race after squirrels, I looked out and thought how grateful I am for this, for all of it. Walt Whitman was right when writing about the splendor of nature and all its unexpected gifts. “I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell.”",52,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45527336}"

I (25m) will be starting TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) treatment this coming week hoping to treat and (possibly) put my depression in full remission.

I've never considered myself an alcoholic, but realize I don't have healthy drinking habits. I'm a bartender so I'm around the stuff constantly and tend to drink after work most days. I'm worried that one day I'll cave and screw it all up by having one drink that so easily turns into ten for me.

And since I’m reaching double digits, I decided to do something for myself. I’m taking my cup back!

My cup: a shiny, pink, thick-glassed gauntlet that I got from a really gaudy hotel, has become one of my main drinking friends. Any time I popped some wine, that cup was ready to receive it. Beer? Sure, cup can take that. Some shitty market vodka? Cup can and cup will. 

But, after bad nights and awful mornings, I began to look at that cup with disdain and sadness.

But not today. 

Today I loaded that puppy to the brim with some sparkling French pink lemonade. Today, cup matched its drink. Today, cup looked good. 

And for some reason it feels incredibly redeeming to take my favorite cup back from alcohol. 

This is just the beginning, but cup and I are on our way to great (AF) things.

I've been so scared to try to stop because I don't want to never drink again, I just want to drink LESS. I'm buckling down. Let's do this thing. What are y'alls tips?","I try so hard not to drink too much. The idea that I might be an ""alcoholic"" is offensive to me. I have never once let alcohol get in the way of my responsibilities, to work or my family. I'm not violent, I'm not drinking to the point of puking, I just... have a few, almost every night. Because I feel like I need it to relax. My life is VERY stressful right now and I have no other stress relief. The past few months have been nonstop financial difficulties and it's really getting to me.

But I know this isn't healthy. I've been afraid to seek help because I'm afraid of judgment. I'm afraid of people saying I'm unhealthy or a bad wife or mother. I have a 7 month old daughter and she is my HIGHEST priority. She is happy and healthy and I feed and take care of her like any responsible parent.

But in the past couple weeks I feel like my drinking has escalated to an almost every night thing, I'm unable to have just one beer, it goes to 3 or 4 or 5 and I'm afraid to let this continue.

I signed up for a website called Cutback Coach and I'm excited about it because instead of forcing me to quit drinking entirely they seem like a nonjudgmental place to just reduce my drinking. I'm in the Army, my husband is a vet, alcohol (especially on weekends) is kind of a way of life. I'd love to just cut down to drinking once a week for fun, instead of every day for stress relief. I think alcohol has a place. But it should be occasional and fun, and not an addiction.

I'm struggling though. Once I start it's hard to stop. I keep thinking if there was something else I could drink that I felt like it had some effect on my mood, I'd do that instead. Or maybe some mental tricks to help stop once you've started? What works for y'all? What helps you determine that 1-2 beers is enough and makes you stop?

-Alcohol advertisements are EVERYWHERE!  my god the money they pump into triggering our addicts.  It is no wonder we are so conditioned to thinking it is normal and good.  It is even here on my Reddit “promoted” posts.  Here’s a tip!  I report them every time I see a beer or booze ad, as harmful and offensive to me.  Because you know what?  They fucking are.  And if you click through enough, you can block Corona, and Sam Adam’s and all the rest.  Fuck them.  I hope it sends a message.  I encourage you to do the same.

- I started working back nearly small home town.  There is a dive bar on the highway that advertises breakfast served at 6am, and that is about the time I drive past.  Cars, ALWAYS  parked outside.  It just makes me sad for people and so happy and proud I’ve made this change.  I was never a barfly, too expensive.  But what a horrible life to start your day that way.

- my wife is out of town this week.  Normally a prime chance to get tore up with no one around to see it.  Definitely felt that itch from the familiar behavior I’d fallen into before.  Instead, I just went to bed early and I’m having a wonderful week with a nice 8-ish hours to sleep every night.  

- last, a friend of mine, someone that was in the program for years and returned to drinking several years ago reached out and gave me a sort of atta boy for quitting.  I think he’s coming to the same conclusion for himself but is still gripped by it.  Trying to be moderate, but reading between the lines I think he may be having a tougher time at life because of his drinking/pot use.  I figure he’ll quit soon enough... as he’s starting a new diet and realizing his calorie intake is largely spiked due to drinks and late night food binges.  But he wanted to talk about the “existential” hump I was either coming to or near.  It’s funny but I just don’t think it will be the case for me.  I am not defined by drinking or not drinking.  A huge number of people literally don’t think about it at all and yet my very existence hinges on my drinking?  I was sort of amused.  I just refuse to give something so trivial that large of a place in my life.  I don’t drink alcohol.  If that’s how you define me, I feel bad for you, not for me.  I’m just me.  A better happier me, because I’ve stopped struggling to process poison everyday.

I vomited and passed out on the floor last night and been in bed all day suffering anxiety attacks over what damage I’ve done with my phone when drunk. My SO is also an alcoholic. We are unable to string even a few sober days together .

We live in the country where cheap alcohol is abundant , literally easier to get than water so it’s hard to get away from it . We have always been binge drinkers but every passing year it gets worse . 

I’m 40 and we have been together 10 years. I usually work away from home and abstain for months at a time without feeling any ill effects so I know I can do it . I can put it aside when I have other things to focus on , there’s no easy access to alcohol where I work which helps a lot . I really don’t think my wife can manage to quit  . One of her parents also died young from alcoholism . I’m sure we are going the same way.

We are in the middle of a renovation project that has collapsed due to covid , all the funding got pulled , we also got screwed over by builders for a lot of money and now basically living a nightmare in paradise .

I had to quit my job recently , my wives mother died while I was at work , then my wife was admitted to hospital , passing blood , stomach lining gone due to too much drinking and stress and we had nobody to help look after our 3yo , we are pretty isolated where we are. 

She was pretty bad for a while there , bottles hidden all over the house and drunk before 2pm every day. We are different types of drinkers she drinks every day at least 2 litres of wine and some spirits ( been much more since her mum died) and still manages to kind of function .

No matter how many promises we make we both always go back to it.

I know I need to get out of here to stop drinking but my wife refuses to move away . There’s a lot of time and money invested where we are . I don’t want to leave my kid either with just her mum but is 1 alcoholic parent better than 2. Or one sober parent better than none .

We keep trying to pick ourselves up and continue with the project here but the size of the task is huge. Tomorrow il get up and try to go again and promise again that if I can’t last a week without drinking I need to leave .

I can't celebrate. I can't even go out and buy myself a treat. Why? Because I was a sneaky drunk and everyone in my family and friends circle thought I quit nine months ago.  To tell them now would reveal my big lie.

Being a hidden alcoholic is so much work and so much stress.  I would go through anywhere between 2-4 litres of vodka a week.  It was usually after my wife had gone to bed, and it was always hidden. I'd have to catch up on sleep during the day because of poor quality and short bouts of night time sleep; hooray for work-from-home I guess.

About nine months ago, I promised my wife that I would stop the booze but I just couldn't do it. So I went into stealth mode. Every time I'd go to CVS for a prescription, I would also pick up another 750mL of vodka.  Whenever I had to duck into the supermarket, I'd pick up another one. Sometimes, I'd just ""go for a drive"" and go straight for the booze. Who the fuck thought that pharmacies selling vodka was a good idea anyway? There were so many opportunities, so many triggers that just meant it was just so easy to keep failing.

So a month ago, I just stopped. Ironically, it was less about needing to stop drinking, but more about the stress of drinking in secret.  Whenever I'd come back from the supermarket, I'd drop a bottle in the garage on my way into the house. Later that night, I'd go back and empty it (or most of it). I'd then have to hide the bottles, either in the garage or in my desk. That just led to so much stress. Every time she needed to get a screwdriver, I had to jump in there and ""help"" find it. I was really just making sure she wouldn't find my stash. If she needed a pen from my desk, I would physically jump in and guide her directly to the pen so she didn't have to go searching. There were so many close calls. She never found out. It got to the point that whenever I left the house without her, I was worried that my cover would be blown. Sometimes, I'd even invite her to CVS knowing that if she was there, I wouldn't buy more vodka. She'd almost always decline, so I'd almost always stock up again.

It got to the point that my whole life was revolving around the cycle of protecting not just the stock but the empties. I would religiously do the trash each week, making sure I was the only one accessing the trash cans.  Hiding five or six vodka bottles is hard, both in and out of the house. It's so much easier to hide plastic bottles than glass. I can't even believe I needed to know that.

So that gets me to today, one month in. I found ways to eliminate the triggers. If I need a prescription, I now get it posted for free, even though I only live two minutes away from CVS.  If I go to the supermarket, I take one of the kids because they can't keep a secret.  So you're the only people I can share this with. It's a small win, but for me it's a big one. I don't yet know if this is me forever, but for the last month, and at least for tonight, I won't drink with you.

But when I started working from home last year and became isolated, it all just came crashing down. I had a glass of wine on Saturday night and that just lead to me drinking for three days straight.

The girl training me caught it, and because I made a similar mistake the previous month from being drunk while working it’s finally coming to surface. She asked me to explain what I did and I couldn’t even remember, so I just broke down crying and said I’m really sorry and I’m having some family issues. 

I took the rest of the day off but the guilt and shame is unbearable. I just keep thinking “what have I done?” I’m trying to be self compassionate, but it’s hard because I keep making the same mistake. Everything is shut down and it’s hard to find treatment and make those in person connections.

Everyone says vigilance is key, and this week I learned why. This Naked Mind gave an analogy of alcoholism as a monster that's always just outside the door. All it takes is to open the door a crack and the monster comes back in with a vengeance. Last week I thought the monster might finally be gone after a year so I cracked the door to peek and... nope. still there...fml

I'm not even sure how it started.  My partner and I have 6 month old twin girls and life has been tough in general, exacerbated by covid. Bla bla bla... We also hosted my parents over Christmas so there was wine every night, my Dad likes a nightcap, everybody drinking except me. I was at the store buying wine and booze for everyone.

Somewhere hidden in the sleep deprivation, work frustration, exhaustion, family stress, etc the booze bug in my brain found a chink in the armor and weaseled itself back into my life. One day at the grocery store a bottle of vodka found its way into my cart. That wasn't the first time something like that had happened. I've  made it to the checkout counter with a single beer in the cart but ended up just giving it to the cashier and leaving without it. This time tho, the bottle made it from the cart to the cashier, from the cashier to the bag, and the bag ended up in the car. Once I got in the car I was hit with some serious anxiety about it so my brain started doing gymnastics to try and make what I had done ok. I told myself ""I'll just keep it in the garage for emergencies, I won't drink it all"", which doesn't even make sense. Here we go...

The first night I put a shot or 2 in my kombucha and got a nice buzz on. It felt good, I have to say I missed that feeling. It was like meeting an old friend after a looong time. Of course I had to sneak it (my partner told me she would leave me and take the girls if she caught me again), and that gave me a little rush as well. I used to skateboard & snowboard, we would goto concerts, sporting events, road trips, hikes, etc and the monotony of covid has been driving me crazy. Even sneaking that little bit of vodka gave me the rush I had been missing.

Didn't last long tho. After that first night, the bottle lasted 3 more days and when it ran out I bought 2 more. I also picked up a hard seltzer and drank it on the way home. I started stopping off at the liquor store on my way to run errands and pick up a single. The rush of sneaking the bottles in the house, quickly taking a pull while going to change out the laundry... this all felt strangely familiar...

Those next 2 bottles lasted 5 days. I was back to running out to the garage and taking pulls off the bottle and chasing them with kombucha that had vodka in it. People say that it takes awhile to build your tolerance back up. For me at least, that's bullshit. My tolerance at this point after about a week of drinking was almost right back where it was in my heyday. I was spiraling, but also starting to recognize what was happening.

It's amazing how fast it happens. I was meditating & exercising every morning, eating well, juggling child care, taking care of my partner, cleaning the house, a demanding startup job... even a little leisure time (VERY little) and doing just fine with everything. Once I started drinking again all that success disappeared within DAYS. Waking up late & foggy, skipping the exercise, going right for the coffee only to be forgetful at work, missing deadlines... With Homelife I was disconnected. My partner flat out told me one afternoon ""what's happening to you lately? You look like shit."" I did. I made some excuse about being tired and overwhelmed but obviously I knew what was happening.

One morning I had enough and went out to the garage and dumped what was left of the vodka. There were a few ""aftershocks"", where I bought a hard kombucha (I had rationalized that this was better than beer or straight booze) but I've since cut those out too. It took me \~24 hours to recover (when I first quit after being a heavy drinker for years, it took me a month) and my life almost instantly snapped back into place. Thankfully this time I was able to put a stop to it before it got completely out of control. My partner is already at wit's end.. our families are thousands of miles away and we've been taking care of infant twins during a pandemic... I think if I fell back into old habits she would have a nervous breakdown.

I'm quite down on myself for a couple reasons. Number 1, that I let this happen again. I am the sole provider for my family. I have my partner, our two infant daughters and a dog that all rely on me. It's so fucking selfish of me to do what I did... to get so close to the brink of disaster. I know the oven is hot, I don't need to touch it again to tell me that. I actually used a few posts I remember from this sub that helped me:

1. The addict brain is different than your brain... it doesn't give a fuck about you or anything you care about. It just wants to be fed.
2. Recovery is a journey and life is long.  Don't beat yourself up for falling off the wagon, it happens. Just make sure you get back on.

The second downer realization I had is my ultimate goal of getting back to a state where I can have a glass of wine at a restaurant with my partner and not have that spiral into a week-long binge might never be possible for me. I may have permanently damaged something in my brain that will prevent me from doing something I enjoy for the rest of my life.

Hopefully that is not the case, but if it is that's ok. Certainly after this little episode I've finally accepted this scenario as a real possibility. I still have hope because I've always achieved satisfaction in life by beating the odds, but in this case I just might not be able to.",24,"{'covid': 2, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48123127}"

I’ve been a pretty high functioning alcoholic for say the past 6/7 years or so. I just wanted to share my experience in case it might connect with someone like so many stories here have with me. 

I’ve tried cutting down and even quitting for the past 2 years and I feel like I had cut down from my peak a few years ago, but I would still hit weeks/ months where it was pretty heavy. Normally I would drink 200ml to 6-700 ml/day on occasion. I know that’s no where near some people’s levels but this isn’t exactly a competition that I want to win. Every couple of weeks I could string a day or 2 or 4 together and much more often as of late. 

Last week I received the kick in the ass that I needed. I had to have a health screening done for life insurance and due to my rabid avoidance of doctors, the results were a kick to my chest. I knew in the back of my mind that they wouldn’t be great, but seeing it on paper is a completely different realization. Luckily everything but my liver enzymes was perfect. The enzymes were 2-5x higher than they should have been for those of us who are lucky enough not to have a love of that comforting, warm, mind numbing, sauce that is liquor. 

I’m praying that the damage isn’t severe or permanent obviously, but I feel like it was a good thing for me to see. 

Now to the good stuff

Tonight/ tomorrow morning, depending on your perspective, at 2:15 AM, will complete my 7th day of sobriety. I’m so happy that I’ve made it this far. Although it’s not all rainbows and sunshine. I am having difficulties and believe it or not, it’s not really the urge to drink. I still have that about once or twice a day and it’s the strongest near the end of my workday. I’m still in that newly sober funk. I haven’t had many of those highs you tend to get after you quit drinking. I felt that a little bit this morning, but ’ve also had a migraine the past 2 days and I feel like that was more to do with the rapidly changing weather more so than anything else so that may have something to do with it. Oh and I’ve thought it was a great idea to stop eating/drinking sugar at the same time so I think that’s playing a lot into things as well. 

So since last weekend and continuing through today I’ve been chugging bottles of sparkling water, and where I would normally only have 1 cup of coffee a day I’m up to 3. I think I’m just chasing that high energy feeling. That’s ok. I rather be addicted to coffee for the time being than drinking alcohol. I’ve also been eating really clean where my snacks now consist of throwing a bag of steamable mixed veggies into the microwave and eating till I’m full. No fast food no crutches in my diet other than the caffeine. The plus side is that I’m down 6lbs so far! I know it’ll be slightly miserable for the next week or so due to the massive change in diet but I need it. I just want to suffer once and reap the benefits sooner. Would I recommend it? Maybe. It depends on who you are. It sucks right now but I was desperate to lose weight and never could because of the alcohol and sugar. I know the weight loss will slow but I’m pumped about that right now. 

I’m extremely bored even though I have a lot of hobbies I enjoy. It doesn’t help that we just were slammed with winter storms, the gym is closed due to a gas leak, and it’s winter right now. But I e noticed that I just acknowledge my cravings when I have them and give myself a pep talk to keep going. I’ve already put myself through the “torture” of eating clean and cutting all junk out of my diet, what’s a few weeks more? I’m hoping in a few months when I decide to schedule a physical, my numbers will be back to normal or at least close to normal. I’ve been irritable at times to those closest to me the past week but I felt that it is subsiding. 

Sorry for the rambling mess of this post. I just wanted to put my feelings and thoughts out there in case someone else needs to relate or needs to see that things do get better. It takes time but I feel better every day. Now will I quit forever? I don’t know and I’m not concerned with that at the moment. I just know for the next few weeks and hopefully months I won’t drink. I would love to be that person that can drink on holidays and vacations, but who knows if I can be. At this point I don’t want to test it.

I still drank but I didn’t drink as much as I usually would have. I drank 4 beers last night instead of around 10 shots of liquor that make me black out in no time. I was seriously looking for ANY reason to drink. Oh they ran out of my favorite water at Walmart—reason to drink. Oh they showed a depiction of someone drinking in the movies—reasons thag liquor isn’t that bad and it’s totally normal to drink. I’m not a real alcoholic because I haven’t lost anything to drinking. I deserve it. It’s the only way I can relax. I played the tape out in my head and was *fine* with being hungover today. I seriously thought about everything that could’ve gone wrong. I told myself I was in control of my emotions. 

What I didn’t realize when I was justifying my drinking is that I 100% lose control of who I am the second I start drinking. I didn’t even remotely think it was possible I’d call my ex and force him to come over and keep me company. I didn’t anticipate ordering pizza and eating a shit ton (because I told myself no when I was sober).

So I have a new tool for the next time I get that craving: remember I 100% lose control and will not have my shit together no matter how strongly I think I am.

So, my counter was at a month.. today is my 3rd ""day one"" since I stopped drinking. Yesterday after buying 2 shooters and a seltzer, i poured half of the can out and there's an uncracked shooter out in the trash. Couple days before that I also bought a half pint and, well let's just say yeah.. the counter had to be reset.

Compared to how much I was drinking (if it was any less than a 5th that was ""Taking it easy"", every single night. for years.) that's still tremendous....but, the problem is the week before Halloween was spent in the hospital where they put a new word into my vocabulary: Pancreatitis.

if it wasnt for the pancreas - that shits pretty much a death sentence even if i was doin everything right if it gets bad enough on its own - These bumps in the road wouldn't be much a big deal other than for pride....but, i can't stop letting fuckin addiction negotiate with me. Anything past 0 is not ok, i keep trying to weasel around that rule. 

Anyway, just wanted to give the ol' sorry i let you down to anyone that was rootin for me but, i aint out the game yet coach... i just gotta stop gettin flags thrown. Each time i've had to reset the counter (out of the last 4 months maybe a total of a week were ones that had alcohol in them, ive basically slipped twice) i drink less n less and realize i truly dont need it a lil more each time

But yeah.. somethin I wanted to say is - for those of us who have had to reset that counter ...isn't it kinda funny how its not the moments when shits rough like you'd think, but - its those moments where everything is goin good and your guard is down. Fuckin sniper.

Here’s what I’ve learned.,"Firstly everything that happens in life is not a tragedy that requires the bottle. I couldn’t face anything without alcohol for years. It was always a drink before this, a drink after that, a drink just because and a drink just in case. Since getting sober I have had covid hit. We both got sick almost lost my wife. My dad died of Lewy body dementia. Lost his mind. And I got a massive foot wound on my foot that went septic and almost lost it. Each of these things normally would have made me run for the bottle. Hell quarantining woulda just been drinking time all day everyday. 
What happened instead was that I wanted to be present with my feelings. I approached each problem with a clearer mindset and learned to take things one step at a time. Everything has found a way to work out. And when something arises. I don’t escape it I face it. 
Personal relationships and job status has all improved. I’m a successful geriatric therapist. Was just promoted to full time with benefits. First time with benefits in a job at 39. My wife and I are closer than ever. I told her last year that I had accepted that alcohol was going to kill me and that she needed to too and I hate myself for that. 
I’ve lost 72 lbs. I’m off antidepressants and BP meds. I was stage two hypertensive and now I’m normal. Mentally I’m much better. I’m bipolar and had two manic episodes this last year sober which I haven’t had since 19. Crazy stuff. Super productive super confident. Super motivated. Got outta control a little without alcohol to numb me. But it’s all good. My productive ass made 2800$ selling videos games over my last 22 day manic streak this month. 

All in all everything in every aspect has improved. There are no negatives. I still get compulsions to buy just one airplane bottle, but I don’t. Sometimes seeing someone take a shot fills me with want but also disgust.

he use to call me Minty Moo Mouse. I had forgotten that, because as he got drunker, he stopped saying the funny, smart witty things that made him him......

he was an alcoholic, of long standing, 750 mls of vodka a day.  He was bright yellow when he died.  He could not speak, he was just reduced to grunting, I don’t know why that was.

I do know he hid it well.  Until I came along, at the end, and he could no longer hide it.

he was an alcoholic, but he was a father of two, a younger brother, an ex husband of one, an ex boyfriend of many, a friend of long-standing to his childhood mates.

born in New Zealander, died in Australia, he lived a life few of us would dream of, he made an income that even fewer will experience.  He lived in South Africa, the Middle East and the Phillipines.  He partied hard and had some amazing adventures.

he was smart, a lovely singer, a poet, a writer, a rugby player......he could wax lyrical about movies, poetry, life.  He was funny, an amazing story teller, an entertainer.

he could also be mean, petty, cruel, selfish and ungrateful...he said some horrible things to those that were close to him.

despite a lifetime of work, he died nearly penniless....

He died in hospital, rattling breathing, unable to eat, drink, talk or walk.

I take solace that he knew he was loved by many.....but I take no solace in his death.

I went to meetings with him, picked him up of the floor, got him into hospitals and rehab, packed his hospital bags, cleaned up his home, looked after his cat, yelled, cajoled, cried and flirted with him until I got him to try a new rehab facility....all to no avail....he died drunk....after a months long binge....

I am writing this, as my tribute to a funny, good looking, soft , gentle, smart man...who got lost in alcohol.  

if you read this and you think for just one minute, that you don’t want this to be your end, that you don’t want a friend to write your obituary on a stop drinking page, now is the time to make the change.

I loved my friend Jeff...I know I did all I could to support him getting sober...but that could never happen, because in the end, his bravado, his glossing over his feelings, his pretence and story telling took precedence over him getting real, getting honest and showing up for himself.  He could never really accept, we are human, we are flawed, we make mistakes, life is dirty, unpleasant, we have emotions....and he was no different to the rest of us.

Jeff, I told your story, because I love you.....and because others deserve to know that you were wonderful and you died because alcohol is a dangerous drug....

- overly intense emotions/anger: while drinking

Certainly at least for today! I tried to drink it all away on Sunday night and couldn’t even get too far in that but enough to have a hellish hangover on Monday. I took care of myself and went for a walk and hydrated and got some sleep. Tuesday was the most productive and positive day I’ve had in a long while. It’s like I had a little spark back!

Unfortunately I monkey wrenched it and drank last night after some negative self talk and a big hit of past pain and loss. I went for the good old drown it out method when I was just about to call on some coping mechanisms. The easy and known “answer” of booze won out. 

Alcohol definitely numbs the fact that my life is somewhat of a mess. And it’s somewhat of a mess largely in part to, you guessed it, alcohol! But it also just lets me exist in this purgatory of nothing great so there’s very few let downs. When I get sober and motivated and looking down a new path, the minute there’s a small hurdle I just give up. Not my usual MO but it is what’s going on now. Which I then use as an excuse to drink because “nothing ever works” so why even try?

It’s all in my head. And I’m always in my head. 

I’m off to shower and work. My anxiety is eating at me but I’ve got a bunch of hydration on hand and food to take with me and I’m not in extremely hungover hell. Just not so great hell.

I abided by this idea when I felt powerless, thinking of the future times I'm not going to be able to drink. The social gatherings, dinners out, late night camp fires, all the times I think alcohol enhances those experiences makes my heart thrum with longing, like I lost an old friend. Then I adopted ""one day at a time"" and it made it easier to shift my thoughts into the now, where I am able to control my actions. This eased my discomfort. 

When I focus on something new I like to deep dive into the topic to maintain a level of passion for something. When it's discovering a new hobby or interest I'll reddit, find books, YouTube, compare tools and items, and the list goes on. Abstaining from drinking is no different for me. I've joined this beautiful community, discussed with friends and family my choices, and read. The books I read so far that really speak to me is Alcohol explained and alcohol explained 2. 

Which brings me to my point. In a later chapter of the second book he constructively criticizes the philosophy of one day at a time. He argues that, simply, you must make a choice, either to drink or not to. By abiding by one day at a time you give your addiction power over your entire life and you live in fear thinking if I can only control the now I will be ok. At first I felt kind of attacked, because I too used one day at a time to get me through some of my weaker moments. However, I contemplated this shift in belief and realized how it frees me from my addiction. I am not a drinker, I have no more interest in drinking. I made a conscious choice and shifting my identity sets me free. 

I realize I will still have moments when I reflect on the past and the times I had while drunk that were good, like fleeting memories of old friends and things that will exist no more, and I will miss some of these times. But when im anchored in the now, knowing I'm not a drinker, the future feels a lot brighter. The social gatherings, late night camp fires and dinners out will be much better when im able to be composed and enjoy these moments sober with loved ones.

Had a small revelation this morning as I was getting ready for work. Somehow I realized that every little thought I had was chased by a negative thought. Like ""do I have any meetings this morning, what should I wear?. Was followed with"" Nothing fits you, you look hideous and no one's going to listen to in the meeting. Constantly. It's like swimming with a stone strapped to your chest. STFU, alcohol. 

I'm also realizing that I was living life in a perpetual fog.

For many years my justification was, oh I don't drink that much. I only drink on the weekends. That's BS. Even when I wasn't putting alcohol in my body, it was still in my body and my brain preventing me from living.

The basic point is ""don't shut down the thinking mind by escaping into [insert whatever one uses to escape]."" I used booze to escape and put off life for decades. Now feels like a good time to evaluate my relationship with sobriety to ensure I don't fall in to the practice of using it as an escape.

It doesn't feel like I've ""made it"" or am over the hill or whatever, more like I've been celebrating sobriety and now the celebration is over. There's no need to force it by trying to keep the party going. Celebrations come to an end in a lot of life events -- marriage, graduation, getting a driver's license, a new job, etc. Even small celebrations occur when you finish mowing the lawn or a book or getting an awesome hair cut. The sobriety honeymoon feels like it's come to a close and that's ok.

2021-02-24 12:33:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lriesq/why_i_am_an_alcoholic/,Why i am an alcoholic,"Why I’m and alcoholic?
No, Its not about where or how I acquired the disease of alcoholism. that’s not important to me any more.
Why do I wear the label and why I’m glad I do?
I started AA and went to outpatient counselling and rehab before the word “trigger” came into use regarding this disease. And I ran across lots of people who had good and longlisting sobriety. Apparently they were giving us something that worked. 
With meetings, lectures, literature and videos they beat into our heads that we were alcoholic and that alcoholics cannot control their drinking.
My old twenty-two from my youth had a trigger, the handgun that my mechanic thinks he needs to carry around has a trigger. They are basically the same things. If somebody backs into his new car he may feel sad, cheated, victimized, angry or all of the above.
If somebody backs into my new car, I may feel sad, cheated, victimized, angry or all of the above and I want to drink. Same trigger, different results.
Why do I want to drink and he doesn’t? because I’m an alcoholic and that’s how alcoholics react. And if our alcoholism has been successfully treated, the next thought is “but drinking is a horrible idea, I start and can’t stop. My judgement goes to hell. And I’ve heard it from hundreds of other alcoholics, it’s the same with them.  That helps weed out the thoughts “But it was different, anybody would get drunk If they went through that. But it’s a holday, but it is Tuesday. But I just got a new tat.”
No, “Banged up car-angry” goes straight to the CPU in my brain which pulls in appropriate information from the hard drive in my brain “I am an alcoholic, my judgement is poor when I’m upset. It makes me want to drink and get rid of this horrible feeling about it. And also from hard drive of my successfully treated brain “I don’t have to drink. Drinking right now is a horrible idea. The feeling will go away soon if I don’t feed it and make it worse”
Do I need the knee jerk reaction time of a formula one driver to do this? Probably not but it sure is good to have.
Also stored in that treated brain is “Alcoholism is Absolute, Universal, and Eternal.”
So, I can forget about trying to slip around it, negotiate with it, or out wait it.
 
I’m not good with absolutes “but there must be a way around it? “but I’m special” “Anybody else would.”  If I have received adequate treatment for my alcoholism and accepted it, all those lies fall away.
And that, boys and girls is why I am an alcoholic. An alcoholic who has been successfully treated for his alcoholism. An alcoholic who doesn’t count time, just made time count.
Notes
Alcoholism doesn’t have to be treated at a treatment center (although it has been a good idea for many of us.

Mostly out, recently - except for two slips last October, I've been sober for almost two years, thanks to a pretty effective combination of psychiatric medications to treat my bipolar 2.  It made a big difference.

So, last week, I was iced in my house due to a freak winter storm in my state.  Lost water for a while, but never lost power.  We were lucky.  It was just the kids and I, as my husband was sleeping at work in between his shifts because of the snow.  And I... on those long, boring, lonely evenings, I did a complete inventory of the alcohol in the house.  And ultimately decided there wasn't enough.  A few beers and a small flask, both of which my husband would immediately notice missing.  So that was lucky, too.

Things are back to normal, but I still feel like I have a binge to get out of my system.  I want to get a bottle of cheap-ass nasty vodka, mix it with something less nasty, and make a night go by in a flash.  Like sleep, but better.

I'm low-key depressed, I think.  A lot of it is pandemic fatigue, aggravated by the winter.  Sleep is my best and only escape.  I go to bed as early as I can and generally stay there until the children are awake.  I home school them half the day and work half the day while they're playing.  The rest of the time, I watch too much TV and play too many games, doubling up on devices as much as possible to stay extra-distracted.  I exercise a reasonable amount, but I'm not accomplishing anything that's lasting or important.  Writing is my hobby, but I haven't had the attention span for it lately.

It's not like I'm in extreme distress or anything.  I'm just bored and tired of sleeping and that's why I want to drink.

I broke my leg four weeks ago and had to have surgery.  I’m still in a splint and crutches.  For various reasons, I’ve had to stay at my dad’s an hour away from home to recuperate. Can’t drive, can’t leave the house most of the time, and I went from seeing my bf and my dog most of the week to only once a week. They’re the emotional support I really need right now, so it’s been hard. I love my dad but he sucks at talking about anything feelings related. 

I’ve managed to keep my spirits up surprisingly well - but yesterday, for whatever reason, it all hit me. I’ve had to hit pause on my whole life and it’s wearing me down.  It was the one day I got to see my boyfriend and I was just a weepy mess for most of it. We went out to a local restaurant for dinner, and I confided in him that I really, really wanted a beer to take the edge off. I felt horrible because he’s been trying to quit too.

He pointed out that I was off the painkillers and I had been AF for two months, and that one beer wasn’t going to kill me. He said if I ordered one he still wouldn’t get one, so I wouldn’t be influencing him in any way.

So I ordered one - and lo and behold, I had forgotten my wallet at home, so I was denied. I took it as a sign.

Would one beer have ruined me? Probably not - at least not right away. But I’m glad I ended up not having one.  I thought about asking my bf to grab me some on the way home, but quickly realized that would be far worse than having one at the restaurant.  So I abstained. 

I dunno.  It’s so hard not to make excuses for myself.  I really felt like I was spiraling yesterday - my heart kept pounding hard for no discernible reason and I kept feeling like a panic attack was about to strike.  The only way I know how to kick that feeling is with a buzz. I don’t know how to get out of my own head and self-soothe in those moments. 

This isolation is getting to me. I hope I can bear weight on my leg soon. 😞

Then I have times when I am a nervous wreck, convinced I have sentenced myself to an imminent death. Doc says he thinks I will be fine—numbers generally look good—but I have abdominal aches and chest pains that come and go and have convinced myself I've destroyed my organs. It may be anxiety, it may be the body healing, it may be my worst case scenario. I do not have the courage to face a bad prognosis stoically if I get one.

2021-02-24 10:12:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lrf4hb/hardest_withdrawal_yet_i_am_an_alcoholic/,Hardest Withdrawal Yet - I am an Alcoholic.,"I need to get this off my chest. This isn't an easy admission for me.

I am an alcoholic. This is my story.

I've been drinking for 20 years. I'm in my early 40s' and have spent the last few years grappling with controlling this monster. I am married to a wonderful wife who I've kept in the dark about almost all of this and who has a problem even with the little amount of my drinking she's been exposed to.

I've been a functional drinker this whole time. I've never drank at work. I've never woken up and ""needed"" a drink. I have a good job, a good wife, some nice things and a stable life. Alcohol hasn't destroyed my life.... ""yet"".

Since 2015 or so, I've been fighting off withdrawal by having 4-6 IPA's every night. I'd wake up feeling horrible, go to work, start feeling anxious, nauseous and irritable as the day wore on until I got off work and went straight to the bar for a 24oz IPA that I'd chug down in 10 mins. Drive home and continue drinking until bedtime, usually.

My weight spiraled out of control (an extra 1200 calories a day in IPA's will do that...) and when I hit 260 and saw myself in a facebook video, I decided to drop weight by doing Keto in August of '19.

It meant that I couldn't have beer anymore, and to no one's surprise, cutting beer out of your life alone will drop you 30 lbs without even trying.  I lost a lot of weight and felt great about myself.

But I made a horrible mistake. I replaced IPA's with Vodka.

It was like shifting the addiction from low to high gear. I recognized the increase in cravings and withdrawal almost immediately, but was too stupid or whatever to do anything about it. Now I was drinking 3-4 generously poured mixed drinks every day instead of IPAs to keep the symptoms at bay. I quickly reached the point where these drinks had little effect on me other than to bring me back to ""normal"" and took the edge off the near constant jittery, anxious, agitation and pangs of intense nausea I felt.

Then the lockdowns and pandemic came. My work began rolling furloughs, and I lost my social outlet of my bands and musical groups that kept me busy. Aside from my wife, who I've kept in the dark about how much I've been drinking, there was nothing stopping me from spending 8-10 hours drinking and sitting in my home office / den playing video games.

I know exactly where the tipping point was. At the height of a dangerously warm summer and virus spread in my area,  I spent 3 consecutive weekends binge drinking over a 5th's worth of mixed drinks a night playing the game ""Hollow Knight"" that was strung together by 4-5 drinks daily during weekdays.

I was draining a Costco sized bottle of Kirkland Vodka in a week. I began sneaking cheap 5th's of rot gut vodka into the house to refill the bottle with so the wife wouldn't notice.

One day, I woke up and my mind and body felt ""different"".  I felt like I was dying. Sometimes it was like something was going to snap at any moment and my heart would stop. Other times my brain felt like it was telling my body that I couldn't breathe. Ironically though, I'd still force myself to go exercise or hike on the ""good"" days and was never abnormally out of breath or experienced heart problems.

Even with these demonstrably contrary physical abilities, the result was the same. Anxiety would begin to set in every day. I became consumed with it and the fear, panic attacks and restlessness spiked with moments of nausea so bad, it felt like my heart was skipping a beat. Muscle tension appeared. I'd be clenched so tight that my neck and shoulders would ache for days.

I began to spend entire days not doing anything productive because I was expending all my mental energy on controlling these feelings. Fatigue became a daily experience even when doing nothing. Every day became an exercise in masking the internal feelings from the external world. 

I began to taper off drinking, trying to restrain it. Mostly by limiting myself to 2-3 drinks a day. Finally, I had to begin accepting that I may have lost control when having those 2-3 drinks didn't take the edge off anymore, sometimes even making them worse.

3 weeks ago, the first debilitating level of panic and trembling happened on a Saturday. I hadn't been drinking all that much, just the usual amount. In fact, I'd only had 2 White Claws the night before. But regardless, I had to pretend that ""I hadn't slept good"" to explain to my wife why I needed to go lay down at 2 in the afternoon, just so I could go someplace dark and quiet to focus on my breathing and meditate.

Between then and now, I've started adding dry days in and it's seemed to help, also keeping my intake to just a couple White Claws. This last Saturday, I felt great. My mental attitude was as positive as it had been in what felt like months and my body felt vibrant and healthy.

But Sunday night, that voice showed up saying ""You've done good, you feel great! Let's have some vodka mixers just like old times again!""  I had 7 of them that night.

Monday wasn't ""too"" bad. I was functional. Went into the office, did my day with only a mild to moderate feelings of restlessness and anxiety with occasional short spikes of panic. I didn't drink anything on Monday except water.  Then Tuesday came...

I didn't start feeling bad until after lunch. It came on suddenly. A rush of panic and nausea that triggered the flight or fight response. Adrenaline fired through me and made everything worse. I got through the rest of the day and came home, making an excuse to the wife that I didn't want to go on our afternoon walk because of some heartburn and frustrating day at work.

I sat in my home office barely able to contain the raging panic, fear, anxiety, sense of impending doom and agitation inside. It was a moment to moment struggle. She asked me if I was hungry around dinner time, 2 hours has blinked by without me noticing them. I wasn't in the slightest, but said ""yes"" just to keep up appearances.

While she was cooking, it spiked so bad that I couldn't sit still. Just the smell of it was enough to make me feel sick. I had to get up and pace around. My stomach was in knots, my whole body began to alternate between trembling as if I was freezing cold, to clenching up. My mind was on fire, hazy and convinced it was the end of the world.

I didn't eat dinner. I snuck half of it into the trash and put the rest in the fridge. While doing the dishes and cleaning up, I could barely hold still. I felt feverish. I came into bed as soon as the kitchen was cleaned and lay next to her uncontrollably shivering for another hour before I began to relax. My wife asked if I was cold, of course I said ""yes"" and joked about just being chilly for some reason.

At this point it had been about 6 hours of intense anxiety, panic attacks and pulses of incredible nausea that takes my breath away. I was exhausted.

It's now Wednesday morning. I'm working from home and still have some tension and anxiety. I haven't had a spike yet, it might happen, it might not. My day might be wrecked again, it might not. I don't know, and that's half the fear I feel to begin with that feeds into this whole mess.

THIS is the withdrawal I've read about. THIS is what I've been afraid of happening... and I walked right into it willingly.  I won't drink today. Probably not tomorrow either. I hope.",28,"{'lockdown': 1, 'pandemic': 1, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5229319}"

Don’t want to feel? Drink! Alcohol became a necessary accomplice to any emotion I was feeling. In these months I’ve adopted self care and grace for myself. Eating healthier, exercise, starting to be mindful. I’m learning patience and acceptance. I’m becoming less self involved. I’m a stay at home mom to toddlers and I’m able to give them me instead of being lost in my addiction. I’ve isolated myself due to my drinking, Making relationships only with other drinkers. I am lucky to have an amazing husband that is also almost 6 months sober but I admit I still feel lonely. I look forward to making real relationships and connections in the future. My goal is to have more purpose that fulfills me. I love being a mom but need more. Drinking (numbing) still feels appealing to me but knowing all that it does it’s just not possible.

Hope you are all doing well.
I'm happy to be almost 40 again, in sober days as I'm way past 40 in year.
I was asked why I stopped drinking and my mouth spoke before my brain engaged oops. I said without thinking, why are you not stopping?

Then we had a bit of an awkward moment followed by a laugh. Then a conversation on both sides of the question.

Positively speaking I'm being very open about how drinking impacts my life and marriage. How I've changed in just 38 days and how my anxiety has reduced too. She commented on how all her activities in love it end with drinking and is hoping to reduce her intake.

Good on her and I hope she does but selfishly, I feel this journeybus personal and fir me. I need to do this and I need to be responsible for my success. When drinking I allowed others to enable me, not that that took much...but I was never able to say no as I didn't want to upset others with my refusal to stop or make the party stop and it's the same with sober me, I don't want to upset others and therefore need to do this myself. Thus is not to say I won't talk or share but ultimately, this is something I have to do for me.

Partying is where everyone just puts all the worries behind them and enjoy the night, no politics no nothing, just fun - I miss that.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

MIKEMIKEMIKEMIKEMIKE...! GUESS WHAT DAY IT IS?!?!?!

I was thinking a lot these past few months, and I had a wonderful epiphany. It seems contradictory, but becoming an alcoholic is the best thing to ever happen to me.

I’m so grateful that this happened because first of all, I would have continued to drink like a “normal person” and would just be living life in a slightly hazy state, instead of hi-def crystal clear picture like I do now. I’m 25 and I have the rest of my life ahead of me to enjoy booze free!

If you’re 55, think about the fact that you’re not figuring this out when you’re 75. If you’re 75, think about the fact that you’re not figuring it out when you’re dead. Not to be morbid, but it’s true!

Second of all, quitting drinking was a gateway to so many other improvements in my life - I quit cigarettes, started yoga and meditation again, and even quit bad sugar (bread, rice, pasta, sweets, etc.) I would have never in a million years thought I could do these things if I hadn’t quit drinking. 

And I would have never quit drinking if I didn’t have a problem. 

Today, my lovely friends, whether you’re years or hours into sobriety, I invite you to think about the amazing things you have experienced as a result of quitting or attempting to quit alcohol, and thank yourself for making the decisions you’ve made to end up in this sub.

I have a form of OCD that, in a nutshell, causes me to obsess over interactions with other people, especially if they’re negative. I lose sleep and energy over these negative interactions. My family knows about my diagnosis. 

SO 

I reach into our mini fridge to get a Topo Chico, my chosen beer substitute, and my dad reached for a Guinness and poured it for himself. He got this grin on his face and brought his beer mug close under my nose, saying “are you sure you don’t want some of my delicious Guinness?”  This was a disappointing attempt at humor from my father. I went back into the room and said “it’s funny, when you put that under my nose I didn’t even like the smell”, and he said he was just “testing my resolve”. I’m having a hard time moving past this, and I’ll admit, I got so angry about it that I wanted to drink. Does anyone have any advice? I don’t really want to talk to him about this, his actions in the past tell me that he would likely would just feel like I was attacking him by standing up for myself. (Another semi-frequent occurrence) I’m kind of hoping he will just realize I’m serious and stop. I think he may be projecting in some way, because he drinks almost every night. Thanks, IWNDT

I said no thanks as we continued talking about my trip to Europe, marriage and divorce, life, and death. She drank my glass than poured me another. And than drank it again. She was so tipsy that her glass ended up broken on the floor. Nearly broke the finished tequila bottle too when she put it back on the counter. Then I left after a 2 hour conversation, that was that. As I was getting ready to leave I realized the whole time I thought I had been drinking, when I hadn't, if that makes sense?.

I've been sober for 2.5+ years... Not a drop. Got very active in Refuge Recovery and facilitated tons of meetings. I went a couple times a week until shortly before the pandemic started and shut everything down. Got very involved in Buddhist meditation and was in a sangha. Did silent retreats, etc.

I've also never subscribed to the whole idea that someone could be sober for 8 years and still be an alcoholic. I believe that as much of a clunky word it is, if you're not drinking anything then you're not an alcoholic, nor is someone a drug addict if they've been sober for a considerable amount of time. The body and the mind aren't static. They can grow and reset and move on.

So that's my world view, no need to debate it. I respect people's opinion that they are forever an alcoholic or drug addict the same way I respect someone if they consider themselves to be a woman even if they were born a male. It really doesn't affect me.

I say all this because I've been having these thoughts that maybe I could have a glass of wine. Or maybe I could try a White Claw which only became popular after I quit drinking. I love soda water, I'd probably love a White Claw. 

And I know I'm not about to do that tomorrow or next week or even next month, but if I was perfectly honest with all of you it really doesn't sound like the worst idea, even though it should.

If meetings were open I'd probably show up to one. And it's likely that I would hear a share about someone who had a considerable amount of sobriety under their belt who had the same exact thoughts as me, and who drank a little bit, and then a little more, and then even more and then lost it all. It would probably be helpful.

So not to worry, I'm not about to crack open a bottle of wine, but that's where my head is at now. I honestly don't want to reset my counter because that first year was really fucking hard. But since then, it's been a lot of coasting and really just a very normal life without booze. Zero desire to get wasted, plenty of desire to be even MORE normal and enjoy a glass of whatever just like everyone else.

I'm sure all of this is just a fucking trap.

I fell down the steps and broke my kneecap in half. The first week I was off crutches went to a wedding got hammered slipped and fell on ice and broke it again. 

It hurts constantly and I used it as my excuse to drink my face off. I would say oh my knee causes me so much pain this helps. It constantly throbbed everything single day. So I would drink and keep ice on it on bad days. 

Fast forward. When I stopped drinking the pain was excruciating it hurt I was irritable it never went away. So I watched the resurrection of Jake the snake and got really into DDP yoga. It helped a bit with the pain but it was still there. 

I talked to my doctor and they said I just needed to walk and use it more. I refused to think that was the cause. Now that I’m not drinking any more I have extra money so I bought a pair of brooks running shoes and holy smokes. The difference is unreal the extra support instead of my converse or boots was amazing. 

I went from walking with a limp almost every day to being able to to run. Not just walk I can RUN! I ran 3 miles a day for a week and felt amazing. Then I got busy and it went the way side. I am 25 pounds over my recommended body weight I am going to start a new healthier lifestyle and cut out my snacking on candy and drinking soda. 

I am so thankful I am able to do this. I have almost 8 months down and figure I am in a good space now that I can start to change other things and not jeopardize my sobriety. 

I am so excited that I will be starting to do something I have always talked about but never acted on. I always would say “oh tomorrow after I am not hungover I’ll go.” It never happened. After I drop the kids off with my mother in law I am headed to the gym to start day one of my new diet and my new plan on exercise. I quit something my body had a physical dependency on however I know this is different. 

I know I can do it and I am hoping in 6 weeks I will have dropped the weight and be closer to my goal. I think this will be harder than quitting drinking because I am lazy and I have never been someone who is active. I am so determined to make this happen.

It stops now. It stops for her.","Hey. Long time lurker here. As many of us are and have been.

I have been a daily drinker since I met my now husband. Won't cast blame, naivete on my part I suppose. I drank occasionally (once or twice a week, and just wine). We met and he was the son of an alcoholic-all-day-every-day drinker. Now husband had a great job and worked rigorously and did well. But from day one, date one, needed to drink as soon as the evening began until it was time to sleep. I didn't understand but didn't balk, either. It felt nice and was cool, goofy, interesting, fun. I joined in. Tolerance grew to meet his. Routine fell into place.

Flash forward... EIGHT YEARS. 

I have wanted to do better, be better, stop. A few times. Its 100% my fault as I could very well have just put my foot down. It worked maybe a day or two when I tried. But he'd drink, buy my favorites, etc. I'd always drink, too. I frankly liked the numbness and lack of presence. I didn't protest when it came time that it was most important to do so. I'll spare you all the details. But, I've drank heavily:

Early years = 2-3 bottles of wine a night

Middle years = 5-6 sugary shots (30%) and 3-4 (6%) beers a night

A brief period (3-4 months) of just champagne or wine (1 bottle of 12% a night, my lightest times)

Latest few years = 5-6 harder shots (40-45%) per night with nearly a whole bottle of 12% champagne or 12% wine per night. 

Last 2 months = 8-10 harder shots, 1/2 bottle of champagne or wine, 1-2 beers.

Yeah... I know. 

I've had periods (many, numerous, more days than not) of just wanting to quit. I don't even want to drink, per se, I just do. My husband can be cruel and abusive (verbally, emotionally) when drinking, most nights are just spent with me feeling badly, alone, using it as a reason to keep on having more. A few months ago, my dog died. She was the best thing, the only good thing, in my whole life, for her entire 11 year existence, and my nearly 30. She was the love of my life. 

I'd been trying to taper before that night. I'd done decently well, only weekends for a few weeks, just some bubbly. Not even half a bottle per. But after that, all bets were off. I'd lost the only important thing to me. My husband lent no relief or care towards me. Knowing that she meant everything to me. I adopted her at 3 months old days before my 19th birthday. She saw me through leaving an abusive and destructive childhood home and father, through getting my first apartment, college, working myself to death, buying my first and only house. Everything. My husband only came into the picture a few years into my and my dog's endeavors to better. But he knew what she was to me. 

Anyway, I derailed after her death. After a traumatic evening and night that led to me coming home from the emergency vet (heart failure) without her, I really got more serious about drinking. Tequila all night, every night. Sometimes a shot for lunch, etc. It's been 67 days now since she died. Husband is still drunk and blissfully so as ever. I've just drank as much as I can and cried in the garage every night for every single day of that time. 

Today, I just feel. Done. I hate drinking. In a way I always have. It's just a quick change-of-mood that I've not accomplished on my own, that *always* makes me feel worse in the end. I'm over it. I've damaged myself I'm sure to some degree. My feet tingle at night. My hands tremble sometimes. My stomach hurts. I want to stop. I want to be done not feeling. Even when the feelings hurt. I want to show my husband this is no way to live. That we probably don't belong together, in all honesty. 

I want to do this for Tangerine. I want to do this for her. 

I love you, pretty girl. I miss you every moment. I'm sorry I lost you to the void. I'd trade anything to have you back home. As you. Not trapped in this box, or the bag full of ash inside of it. You saw me through and led me through the worst and best years of my life. And look what I have done with them. 

No more.

3,133 days after I started down this road. And 3,995 days since I first held you in my arms and booped the snoot that would carry me through the most important years of my life. I won't let you down. I won't let it be worth nothing.

Since then, I'm quitting out of fear. I don't ever want to give that personality the slightest chance to ever exist. I won't become him. I'm having nightmares of waking up next to empty bottles with no memory. Nightmares about seeing Facebook posts of myself getting drunk with friends and not knowing if it happened before or after I quit. The whole time I can feel him in the back of my head, waiting for me to find out I made a mistake so he can try to take me over again. The desire to drink feels so alien now. It's like an invasive thought. When I get angry and my first instinct is to imagine the feeling of liquor passing through my throat, I can't even embrace it like I used to. It feels like I'm being controlled by someone else. I thought it was torture back when I still wanted to drink, but that's nothing compared to what I've been fighting this time around.

Making the decision to quit drinking is an absolutely phenomenal thing to do. One of the best things any person can do for themselves in my opinion. 

However what I mean by that on its own isn't enough is the fact that most of us alcoholics don't simply drink because it's fun. Speaking for myself and assuming a vast majority come from the same place, we drink because of underlying mental health issues. 

For me it was depression and low self esteem. 

What I'm proposing is to stay sober (and just better your life in general) you need to fix the reason why you drank in the first place not just drinking itself. 

I still felt like shit after I quit in the past and I didn't understand. I quit drinking which I thought was causing all my problems yet after months I still felt empty and void of confidence which led me to start drinking again. This time around I had a plan though. I talked to a couple of Dr's and asked for real advice not just a medication. 

What I learned hit me like a brick because IT WAS OBVIOUS INFORMATION I ALREADY KNEW. Seriously it's so basic and simple (not saying easy to execute) but I feel like everyone knows how to properly take care of themselves we just get lazy and lost in our ways. 

Also I feel like a lot of people (my past self included) don't want to hear the actual solution. When asking for help or how to make it better we're looking for one tidbit of information that INSTANTLY solves the problem that we simply didn't know. The reality is though that there are no immediate solutions. There's no way to magically change yourself. Of course some drugs can alter your brain chemistry and fool you into believing you feel good but in reality isn't that just what you did with alcohol to begin with?

The information I learned from consulting different doctors on how to improve my mental health and quality of life goes like this: regular exercise, eating the correct amount of calories in healthy foods (lean meats, healthy carbs like oatmeal, brown rice, and nutrient dense vegetables), daily multivitamins, find and regularly practice a creative outlet such as drawing or playing an instrument, socialize, naturally elevate your dopamine levels in your brain (achieved by setting goals and accomplishing them), breathing techniques (yogas great for this and can be coupled with exercise), and naturally elevating your serotonin levels (achieved by sticking to a daily routine and rewarding yourself once a week for sticking to that routine). 

My daily routine goes as such: I wake up take my b energy multivitamins while I'm brewing coffee and making my breakfast. (Coffee also has some pretty nice benefits up to 6 cups a day including reduced chance of depression and even reduced risk of heart disease) 

then I let the food settle and coffee kick in do my exercise for whatever muscle group I'm working on that day and finish with some intense cardio via punching bag routine and boxing drills. (Intense cardio is wonderful for your mental from improving memory to performance. Look up the benefits it's nuts)

 then I basically go about my day making sure I'm eating the correct amount in healthy foods and getting things I need to get done, done that day. With everything out of the way I've been enjoying the hobbies I used to have like video games (been playing nier automata recently and I absolutely recommend this game to anyone looking for a 10/10 experience you've never had before) and music production. 

It's really simple stuff that only takes will power and consistency to achieve but im not lying when I say I feel the best I've felt in over 5 years. This is amazing and I've only just begun this lifestyle. I have absolutely no intention on stopping ever. I can't wait to see how I feel/what I'll accomplish in the years to come. And it'll all be thanks to me putting down the bottle and slightly changing my lifestyle for the better. 

To anyone reading and struggling I want to challenge you to try out what I've mentioned for at least a week and see if you don't feel better. If anyone happens to do so please feel free to leave a comment on this post or message me and let me know how it impacted your mood/mental. 

Just wanted to share this info in hopes it will inspire at least one person to try it because everyone should feel this good. Its the power our minds and bodies naturally possess no substances required. 

Best of luck friends and of course

Of course, that didn’t solve the depression, it just pushed it away temporarily and added anxiety to the mix. Pile on top of that the excessive amount of coffee I consumed to keep my hungover self working until I could drink again and the fast food I ate in the morning to stave off throwing up and the late night irrational snacking and I was extremely unhealthy. However, each time I’d stop drinking I’d be overcome with a desire to end my life. Drinking would put that off a bit and the cycle would start again. Over the years, the cycle time varied but it started to feel like too much. My drive to end my life or detachment towards continuing to live also increased between drinks/drinking. So, I got help. I got started on a prescription anti-depressant and have a therapist, psychologist, physician, and this group as supports that are holding me up and helping me to move forward. 

The thing is, I’m working against 20-some years of habit and with increasing frequency and intensity those things that drove me to drink come back. I’ve gone longer without drinking, but it wasn’t 2021 and hadn’t been 2020 back then. A lot has changed for me and the world, including the pandemic and so much other stuff. Stuff. I’m fortunate in so many ways. I have a family that’s healthy, an amazing job, don’t struggle to make ends meet... but that darn depression is still there and it’s getting heavier. Although I’m terrified of mixing alcohol with my meds, I’ve been feeling an increasing urge to throw caution to the wind, just to chase this feeling away and make it so I can wake up in the morning without the existential dread of confronting life. It’s reached a point where nothing feels good, nothing feels worth doing, eating feels pointless. Life feels pointless. I’m really at the point where I’m just ready to check out; whatever happens happens. 

Sober life has ups and downs. No doubt about that. My drinking life was always subpar but at least it was constant. I knew where the bottom was and as long as I wasn’t there (dead) I was doing fine enough. Now I’m working to improve and while I’ve hit some high points like I haven’t felt in years, the lows are so much lower than even my worst hangovers. There’s no steady state except constant instability in my head. And I’m frustrated with that. Very irritated. 

I’ve been sleeping more and better, I try to exercise. I make it to my therapy appointments, I read more books, I get to work on time, I cook, I try to eat, I help out with chores, I do so much. I’m so tired. It feels like there’s no rest. At least drinking would turn all this off. 

Ugh. I’m in a hard place. I want to get through this but I’m tired of pushing on sheer willpower to heal. Drinking will solve nothing and it’ll just delay my getting better by a disproportionate amount of time but the idea (admittedly it’s self-imposed) that I might need 20 years of this is just too much to think about. 

I’m not posting this in hopes of solutions, just venting because I don’t know what else to do. I won’t drink for the next hour, I can say that much, and I’ll take it at that rate until it’s time for bed. I’ll put kids to bed, go to my office, put on headphones and an appropriately loud metal album and wrap up some work. Maybe fit a shower in there. Who knows.

It’s not that I don’t appreciate and feel connection to those on that extreme, but I feel like I find myself doubting my own recovery and thus the nature of my drinking in the first place. I was someone who very much was extreme at times. There were periods of 1-4 months over the previous eight years where I averaged 10-14 drinks per day. But I was always able to either just stop one day and not drink for a few weeks or months in order to lose weight or get it back under control, and then I’d drink maybe just on the weekends, or maybe just have a beer or two at night every few nights, or a few drinks every night, or maybe just a six pack every few weeks. I had so many cycles and that’s one of the reasons I gave it up—it’s so much easier to not worry about controlling my drinking when I’m just not drinking. 

When I quit I was certainly on a heavier end at 6-9 beers every night for a couple months, but I’d love to here from anyone else here who may have a similar story, why they drank, and why they gave it up. I’m in that phase now where I’m expectedly doubting the reasons why I got sober, so if you’ve got something to add I’d love to hear it.",36,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5461252}"

\- I haven't slept more than an hour, maybe two, in over a week. Up until now, it hasn't bothered me, as I haven't really been tired during the day until today. I get it - by body needs to remember how to ""fall asleep"" rather than ""pass out"". But it makes the nights long and depressing, and it's beginning to get to me. I've tried everything - weighted blanket, melatonin, white noise, podcasts, even tried a little nyquil. Best I can get is that ""twilight"" half-awake, half-asleep. 

\- I really thought I lose a little weight. I mean, I did the math, and I was consuming 15k + calories in just booze every week.  But now, I can't pass a candy dish without diving in. My sweet tooth is out of control. Again, I get it. Body needs the sugar now that it's not getting it from alcohol - but it's certainly not doing anything for my self-esteem. 

\- I have an in-home recovery team that meets with me every day in my home for an hour. Which is wonderful - I don't have any complaints. Except it's every day. I love the support. I really do. But some days I just want to go to the gym.  

\- I need to find an AA meeting that I'm comfortable with. I've been to a few online ones - but all I get are people that say how wonderful sobriety is. I know.  But talk about how you get through the stressful days. How do you deal with temptation? Families? When your boss is riding you? I suppose I'll learn it - but I need more practical information. Honestly - and I promise this is not a dig - I get better advice from an episode of Mom that the AA meetings I've attended. 

I won't drink today. And I know it's only been 10 days, but I need to see a bright spot soon. At least a good night's sleep.

It really is fuckin wild for an 100lb (I was very sick at that point) girl to blow that, I am pretty sure they even asked me “how are you even standing right now?” 

It’s a weird mixture of emotions I’m feeling today, honestly very fuckin overwhelmed but I’m also really grateful. I didn’t think I’d make it this far. I have so, so many friends and even a mentor who after years of sobriety just didn’t make it. Too much damage had been done to his body maybe. :( it hurts to think about and sometimes I feel guilty. 

That was almost me. For some people alcoholism takes a decade or two to “do the job” but for me I had acute kidney failure and a fatty liver after 5 years. Maybe only 3 of going fifth-a-day hard. I was so weak at the end I had to take an Uber the four blocks I used to walk to get to the liquor store. O was throwing up literally every single day. I was so sick and hopeless and ugh just fuckin rock bottom miserable. It’s so sad, I can’t believe I used to live that way. 

But then I think about every moment I’ve been able to be present for. Every friendship that has grown deeper and is no longer superficial. My nephews have never seen me fucked up and never will. I went back to school for the first time since I dropped out in 2015. I got engaged, I was able to support my partner at his father’s funeral, and now, today even though it HURTS to even type, I was here for my sweet pup on her last day. I was able to thank her for everything she gave to me. I wouldn’t trade this for anything. I don’t know how to pinpoint what happened, what changed or when or why, but I don’t even want to drink today. I am weirdly ok with feeling this pain? I didn’t used to be able to tolerate even a single moment of it, I just needed that constant numbness. 

Today I am so incredibly grateful. Thank you to everyone who took a chance on me when I was completely fucking out of control and didn’t give up on me even though I had myself.

Thank you everyone here who shares your most vulnerable, painful, raw moments, and your victories too. It helps, it gets so much better, please don’t stop or give up. IWNDWYT.

I’ve been incredibly lucky to get this far without too much temptation (although the first few weeks were rough). My partner rarely drinks and has stopped entirely to support / encourage me. The few times I’ve been around family, they didn’t drink and had plenty of fun non—alcoholic options available - sparkling waters and juices, non-alcoholic sangria, tea! When I’ve hung out with my two closest friends (who I used to get absolutely shitfaced with), they both have abstained from drinking around me. Also, due to the pandemic, I’ve obviously not been to any parties or bars when I would have usually been extremely tempted. 

So yesterday. My best friend and I are on a staycation / local work trip. Staying at a nice hotel, lounging by the pool. She wants a few cocktails and I’m certainly not going to stop her. I was tempted (just one? maybe two?) but reminded myself I would definitely not stop at two. It would turn into a few days of non-stop drinking and hangovers. I didn’t want to go down that road again. I was feeling proud of myself and proud of the past 4+ months of progress. (I didn’t want to have to reset my day counter!)

My friend got pretty drunk and I asked her if I was still fun to be around even though I’m not drinking. She said I wasn’t, which really hurt. She sort of backtracked and said of course I was still fun, I’ve always been fun regardless, but it’s just different. Then she eventually admitted she was worried that I was judging her and that we were just on different wavelengths at the moment. I’m not judging her, lord knows I’ve been there and if I was drinking I’d want to indulge by the pool too! 

My feeling were hurt and I can’t help but dwell on the “not as fun anymore” part. I feel like being that fun, silly, outgoing and crazy friend is part of my identity and it just makes me sad thinking that may not be the case anymore. Does anyone else struggle with these thoughts? A change of identity? I don’t want to lose the fun part of myself. Logically I realize that alcohol does NOT correlate to fun, but I just can’t help but feel sad. 

Anyways. I’m rambling. I made it through my first “drinking social occasion”. I’m proud of myself.

TL;DR looking for ADHD addiction specialists, books or tools. 

Hi! I was diagnosed two years ago at the age of 46 as having ADHD while I was researching my own children's ADHD -- about 5% of the population have ADHD, so it's surprisingly hidden and common. I didn't have a clue whatsoever that I had ADHD but I always knew I was different inside. And I have always been an over-drinker. Serious over-drinker.  

I have a million books about both stopping drinking and ADHD, and for those of you who don't know, there is a much higher likelihood of an ADHD person becoming an over-drinker/drugs/pills/shopping/gambling etc.( I remember reading something like 25% of addicts in treatment have ADHD or something shocking like that) and every single book about ADHD mentions we have a much greater risk of addiction. 

As for stopping drinking, I have read tons of mom quit-lit, Naked Mind, Jason Vale, Russel Brand, Big Book, blogs, subs, podcasts, you name it. Plus I've been a member of r/stopdrinking for a few years, well before I discovered my own ADHD. 

My question is are there any specific ADHD addict resources or books that specifically are tailored towards the ADHD person? Seems like there should be if so many addicts also suffer from ADHD! My brain is different and I'm wondering if anyone has figured out how to help ADHD people as a distinctly atypical brain group.

In March 2020, I was in the best shape of my adult life, weighing in at 172 lbs. I did my best to stay fit during the lockdowns by going on daily runs and doing exercises in my apartment ... I was also careful to avoid binge eating and excessive snacking.

However, the one thing I didn't control was my alcohol consumption. Before the pandemic hit, I would often knock back three or four drinks per day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Even still, I made a conscious effort not to drink Monday through Thursday, unless I was going out for a special occasion. That all changed last March, when I began drinking on weekdays after the lockdowns started. By early 2021, it wasn't unusual for me to have several glasses of wine with dinner and one or two mixed drinks at night while watching TV.

The end result is that my weight ballooned to 182 lbs ... not terrible, but certainly far from where I want to be. With Lent starting this past Wednesday, I've decided to take this time as an opportunity to correct some of the bad habits I've developed over the last year. Therefore, I completely gave up alcohol and sweets, in addition to resolving to go to the gym at least four times per week. The goal is to get to 170 lbs by Easter.

We care about him, his family, but he is so sensitive to any commentary on his drinking, takes it as a personal attack. When he's sober he's a really nice guy, but I see that less and less. He's lost so many friends, he's lost romantic partners, he's lost jobs, and I'm afraid for his health. 

I just don't know if there is any way to get through to him anymore. He argues that alcohol is good for him (what?) He won't listen to medical science or any other logic. He gets so mad when it's brought up.

I also have totally noticed a shift in the way my body feels? Like I don't feel as tense and bloated. It literally feels like my insides are working better and I feel more nourished from food. I have ENERGY which I didn't even realize how much drinking regularly took out of me. 

BUT at about day 16 I started breaking out all over my cheeks, jawline, chest, and upper back with tiny little pimples?  I've always had mild hormonal acne and usually will have a little break out once a month—if you catch my drift—but usually one or two on my cheeks/jaw. 

 I've read after about a month not drinking your skin clears up, but nothing about it getting worse before it gets better. My gut feeling is this is a weird result of my hormones starting to balance out again without alcohol? Or like my body is detoxing and secreting that through my sweat?  I really don't know it's kind of a wild guess, but hoping this is just a part of the process and not a new thing.

Living hangover free truly is a superpower. Even on the mornings when I didn't have the best sleep and feel a little groggier than usual, it's a world away from the states I'd wake up in in the past. The horror of not knowing where I was, what I'd done, the person lying next to me. Those frantic moments trying to remember the night before, then the panic and anxiety slamming into my already pounding head as I'd begin to recall fragments of the carnage. Unable to move until I'd only left myself five minutes to do everything before work. Vomiting in the shower, shaking, groaning, in pain, swearing (yet again) I was done drinking. To think I put myself through that several times a week is absolute madness. All in the name of 'fun'. HA! That's the biggest fucking joke right there!

He's an absolute champion, his will for life is extraordinary and he's doing very well. I don't expect him to be in ICU for much longer. Very proud of him. We'll have cuddles at home very soon.

I'll be honest, it's been difficult for me. I've resorted to drinking every night this week. I don't like it. It's off the back of no drinking since NYE. I didn't think I'd manage dry January and the days leading up to my son's birth, but I did! I was sober for 45 days!

So now, I need to properly admit to myself and be open to you. Alcohol has always been a problem for me. I'm not a 7am vodka person, I have been a habitual bottle of wine a night kind of chronic user. It's a toxic relationship, and it's my drug of choice to turn my brain off every evening.

If someone said to me that I'd have to give up chocolate, I'd probably think nothing of it. But now, the prospect to committing to sobriety scares me. That is a red flag to me. If I was in control of this relationship, I should be able to dictate the terms. But I can't. So I need to cut ties and move on.

Sure, I feel better physically, my brain isn't foggy all the time and I don't have a panic attack everytime someone rings my doorbell. But lets be honest about it, I don't feel *happy* anymore. The calming tingling sensation in the back of your head, the shivers when you finally *feel* the first drink in the morning, that was - to some extent - pure bliss. I conveniently left out the last few months, where the first drink only stopped the withdrawal puking for a short while, until the puking blood took over.

But still.. it seemed to be an alright deal to give up all the ""feeling better"" and all the basic human functions that slowly came back, for these moments of the little happy shivers, for these moments of pure bliss, when you felt the alcohol kicking in. It probably would be a short life, but one filled with happiness, so I thought.

What kept me going at first was.. well, shame. I was incredibly ashamed when my family found out about the state I was in. They had no idea, somehow I managed to hide the two bottles of vodka I was drinking every day, I still don't know how. I couldn't handle the thought of them being disappointed and scared if I relapsed, so I kept going for a while, and a little more and then a little more.  It took maybe 6 months, when geniune feelings of happines were coming back. I vividly remember one time cleaning a very dirty fridge that I let rot away in my drunken days. I was sitting on the floor, scrubbing goop and stuff dropping on my head, and suddently I realized - I was happy. Not for long mind you, that feeling, like every feeling, went away eventually. But for this moment, it was clear as day to me, as I was sitting there - wait a minute - you're smiling. Actually, yeah, look inside yourself, that's happiness. Holy shit, you're actually having good feelings being sober.

Between this moment and today are something like 8 years. In this time, I got sober, went to therapy, found a job, found a girlfriend, married her, got a kid, got a better job, bought a house and just today we're back from the hospital with our second kid. In only 8 years, my life went from ""it might be a good deal to spend a remaining 6 months drinking and slowly dying"" to ""I literally have everything I could ever ask for, physically, mentally, relationship-wise and materially."" I feel like I've been speedrunning life, after wasting away for one a half decade.

My point is, as trite as it might sound right now, it absolutely does get better if you stick to it. I know it might not feel like it at the moment - it didn't feel like that for me, at all. And oh boy, will there be challenges, not only to your sobriety, but to generally handling your life which you have been avoiding by drinking more. It won't be easy, but it'll **so** worth it.

We got a cabin, rented a Jeep. Couple of our friends from the past were going to join us in the city for some food and drinks. Everyone knows I don't drink so there's no pressure. If anything I had conversations with some of them about how sometimes they have trouble stopping. The bars closed at 9PM due to covid, so it was nice to hang out with people before they got plastered. And at the end of the night I drove us back to the airbnb. The funny thing is that my inner alcoholic would get stressed out for them. We'd stop at Walmart and get food for the next day, and I'd say things like ""Are you getting a 12 pack?"" or ""You getting a bottle?"" Or when they're did the last call, I would get that feeling of something being taken away. When my friends would say ""Nah, I've had enough."" or ""That last beer did it for me."" There was no way my brain could process that. The entire time our Airbnb had two small cans of wine. Surprisingly the only hungover person in the cabin was me, because I drank too many red-bulls the night before. It's an interesting perspective, seeing yourself obsessively think like a drunk person, while over a year sober. Which just re-affirms the fact that I will fuck it all up if I decide to have that ""just one"".",70,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43482718}"

But February has been out of control. 

Anyway. I know alcohol is a depressant, but for me, it doesn’t work that way for a long time. I can drink for a week straight and while I’m drinking I’m actually happy and productive. 

I’m not working right now due to Corona. When I’m sober, I watch TV all day and nap endlessly. When I buy some vodka, I’ll take a couple shots and the buzz makes me feel like a human being again. I’ll do laundry, clean the kitchen, make a meal...all the things I don’t do while I’m sober and depressed. 

Like I said, I know alcohol is a depressant. That’s a scientific fact. But my real life experiences make me feel like I get my life going when I have a few shots in me. 

Of course, there’s always a wall. When I hit it, I hit it hard. But the fact that I know I’ve done more the previous week (drunkenly) than I will the next week (sober) is hard to ignore.

I don't even feel like I can say I'm a sober person, I still feel like I'm just ""trying to stop drinking."" I still haven't really earned back the trust of my family--I could see the look in my mom's eyes when she saw me washing out a wine glass that I'd been using to drink sparkling apple cider. I haven't lost any weight because I started eating a lot of sugar. I still drink NA beers. I still have relapse nightmares. I still think about drinking more often than not.

But. I used to daydream about being able to make a 100 day post because I never thought it was possible. I truly did not even think I would ever be able to quit. I had so many false starts where I thought stopping for a week or two would be enough to repair the toxic relationship I had with alcohol. But finally enough was enough. I asked my parents to get rid of all the alcohol in the house, which they happily did as they were also trying to cut back. I spent several weeks being so unproductive, playing video games and pounding NA beers and doing literally anything I could to distract myself to keep myself from drinking. 

And then slowly life started to become about more than just staying sober. I started hiking again. I started practicing the guitar again. I cross stitched a bunch of things for my family and friends as gifts. I stopped feeling like it was a struggle to get through every hour and now I feel the way you do when you're running long distance and finally get into the zone--it's not easy but I also feel like I can keep going, for now. I feel confident that I will make it through today without drinking. Idk about a whole week, a whole month--but today, I know I can do it because I have done it 100 times before.

I didn't really wanna make this post today because I don't really have any advice or realizations beyond what others have said on here before. I guess this is just a selfish post because I wanted to put myself back in the mindset of my brand new sober self and reflect on how unattainable this milestone seemed.

Some people have one or two key reasons for why they want to stop, but there are tons of other benefits and reasons to stop.

Body Health: includes your liver, kidneys, weight gain, bad skin, dried out hair, stomach ulcers, dehydration.  It reduces your recovery and protein synthesis for the athletes out there.  Dental health such as eroding gums or enamel and throat damage.  Lets not forget the hangover feeling.

Mental Health:  your mind will be hazy,  you wont be focused, youll drunk text someone something thats innapropriate, have a regretful hookup.  Dont study for that exam, or do that take home assignment to catch up on work.  You arent present for time with family or friends. Sometimes these things even happen the day after drinking.  Your mind takes a while to reset after a night of binge drinking.

Financial Health:  its not Just the cost of the alcohol.  Think about the chasers or mixers, the cost of the snacks or food.  Any other drunk purchases you might not have ordinarily made.

Time:  the time spent drunk, and hungover, are ultimately wasted.  You achieve nothing during this time.  Time is the only resource you can never recover. You Gain nothing substantial and only Spend your physical, mental and financial health.

There are many other issues to consider, these are just the ones i have noticed personally.  But remember what the actual cost of drinking is when youre tempted.  Its not just the bar tab and day hungover afterward.

I only drink once a week or twice a month. When I do, it's always too much (can't stop at one or two), and I overeat as well, and I feel like garbage, physically and emotionally. I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol.

This coming Friday I will be home alone. This often triggers a ""party"" mindset for me. I have nowhere I have to be, so I can drink. I have no-one around me, so I can be invisible. I have no restrictions. And it will be ""fun"" and I'll ""enjoy"" it. And also, I ""deserve"" it.

It's all nonsense. Stories I tell myself. I enjoy about the first half hour. Then the rest is a grind. I keep drinking (not a ton, but a lot for me). I feel physically gross by the time I go to bed. I sleep terribly. I tell myself this is stupid. And then the cycle starts again.

I know you all understand this cycle. Mine is probably a small fraction of what happens to many others. But it's my stupid pattern and I want to exit it.

So I am tracking my thoughts today and I am anticipating my ""party"" Friday night. I am asking myself, will I drink? Should I? Can I?

All the wrong questions. I am giving up alcohol and transitioning to life as a non-drinker. I will not drink this Friday night. But I know I will think about it all week.

The number one reason I am becoming a non-drinker is to RECLAIM MY MENTAL SPACE. I don't want to spend time planning, anticipating, buying, organizing, partaking, disliking, reflecting, resolving, repeating. Number two reason is to get away from excess drinking, even a few times a month, and preserve my health.

I was drinking a can or two of mikes or Smirnoff a night the last month or so but was able to push all day until 9-10 pm.

So comforting and reassuring and just routing for me all the way. I decided to stay a few days over the recommended time because I was getting a lot out of the classes and the little sober community of friends I'd made.

I came home on Saturday - it was a bit stressful at first, going from so much ""me time,"" completely focused on healing and learning how to love myself again...to back home with a husband and 3yr old (while very cute, is a typical insane 3yr old). Took a couple days to adjust, but I woke up yesterday feeling fucking AMAZING you guys. I could cry just typing that out. I have had so much energy, better sleep, am remembering all of the little things I used to love doing (yoga, reading, writing for fun, finding new music, creating art, etc...), things I haven't done in *years* because alcohol took away my drive and my joy. Hell, I'm amazed at how nice it feels to remember ANYTHING after years of daily blacked-out afternoons and evenings. I am set to start my IOP this week and have a ton of meetings on my calendar w/ zoom links all ready to go. I'm doing this thing.

If you are struggling right now, please know that I was terrified to get sober, terrified of the withdrawals.

Seriously this sub is amazing.... here’s an update if anyone is curious-

So after going through the replies I decided to send him a text saying “Hey, I know this is kind of random but I wanted to be upfront with you about something. I don’t know if you remember, but on Wednesday I made a joke and you said you didn’t date alcoholics. I totally understand and don’t blame you at all but I think it’s only fair that I tell you I struggle a LOT with alcohol. I’m working on getting to a better place with it but I just wanted you to know.... You can take all the time you need to process that. I know I probably should have said something sooner but I didn’t really know how.”

He immediately replies with “can I call you?” And of course I got super nervous. But he called and basically told me that there were red flags in the beginning (me calling him wasted) but after doing dry January and drinking together, he “knows I’m not an alcoholic.” :|

He felt really bad about what he had said and was supportive. I told him that this was something that I was still trying to navigate so to bear with me. But I think deep down I know this relationship just isn’t right, sobriety aside. I feel really bad because on paper this guy is a great person, but we have very little in common.

I’m glad I was honest and had that conversation. I learned that even when you think you know exactly how something will happen, you don’t. Honestly is always the best policy, even if it makes my voice and hands shake.

So basically, I’m not an alcoholic in HIS eyes and for him, everything is fine. I’m happy to not be looked down upon (fake validation, because I’m not THAT bad), but I also feel like he’s painting red flags white. How do you end a relationship when there’s seemingly nothing wrong, but also nothing quite right? (You don’t have to answer this- probably a question for another sub)

I’m 5 days sober from alcohol and 84 days clean from pot. I had my birthday recently and went completely overboard. Leading up to my birthday, for at least a few months I was drinking one night per week on average, sometimes two nights with a 4-5 drink maximum. I told myself that was fine and I had no issue moderating in my adult life but the truth is that I’ve been using it as an escape from reality my entire life. I decided to “celebrate” my birthday and binged for an entire week. 

Addiction is a lifelong struggle, it never really goes away. Maybe you are successful at moderation for a short period of time here and there but the call of the void is always there and you’re always standing at the edge. 

That’s how I feel right now, like I’ve always been standing at the edge and just in denial about it. Now that I’ve solidified my decision to quit alcohol, I’m having a flood of memories about my relationship with drinking. It’s never been healthy, I’ve always been an addict at my core. 

Missed my high school prom because I got too drunk pre-partying and passed out. Made this poor girl cry and ruined her night. Embarrassed my parents and myself, had to claim I had food poisoning the next day at school.

Joined a frat in college, one of the worst mistakes of my life. Just nonstop positive reinforcement of problematic addictive thinking and behavior. 80% of the people there had substance abuse issues. That was by far the worst period of drinking in my life, and I lightened up after college but  still made plenty of mistakes. Almost dropped out of college, too much partying, had to take a semester off but I pulled through and graduated. I’m lucky to be a functional addict I guess. I have a decent job, make decent money, but that’s no justification to continue abusing my body and mind.

Got a DUI ten years ago. You don’t have to tell me drinking and driving is stupid, at least I never repeated that mistake. I thought I was in control, thought I was totally functional while buzzed. My car was totaled, on top of court fees, insurance, etc., I paid about $10k and then had to get a new car as well. But no one was hurt, it was a highway accident going 60mph. Lucky is an understatement.

After college I started working but I was unsatisfied with my career so of course I turned to drinking/smoking. A 6-pack per night multiple nights per week on top of frequent pot use. I basically lost my 20’s to addiction, it’s all a blurry haze. Self-isolation was the name of the game.

I suppose that’s the worst of it. I want to stop fighting myself and be at peace for once. I want to love my life, I want to know what that’s like. I thought weed was my biggest problem and that I could be a responsible adult with drinking after learning so many lessons over and over, but it seems these painful lessons will never end if I keep drinking. I am taking steps to address why I’m always running from reality, this post is long enough no need to get into that too lol. I guess there’s only one thing left to say.

I thought how terrible it is not drinking, (or how it appears). How I am confined to a life of drinking and it's my life. How I am a useless boring person without it. 

I must tell you now, yesterday I woke up and had one of the most productive days I've had in a long while, I woke up full of energy, alert, clear minded. Early in the morning. That's weird, I never do that? Or I never do that while drinking daily. 

I feel an overwhelming sense of calm a lot of the time now. And I must say that yesterday, last night, I actually was indifferent to not drinking, as I usually would around 9/10pm. I got my studies done, 4 hours. I cycled a lot, I walked a lot. I'm feeling more healthy and generally better in myself. I socialised in the day confidently with a friend without alcohol.

For me to be indifferent to not drinking is insane, it's as if you were to tell me the sky is on the floor. If you were to tell me 2 weeks ago I would be like this I would have told you you're full of it. But there we are. I will not let my guard down however, this is still very early days. Worse days will come, the devil likes to play his tricks.

I was about to get in a taxi to travel to the nearby gas station to buy beer and say “I’m going to get trashed at home even though my girlfriend is there trying to sleep for work f##k it!” but I suddenly dropped my cigarettes in a puddle. In that puddle I saw my pathetic desperation.

I have made it past a lot of things since September. No drinks. I almost lost my apartment due to money problems and I've been close to admitting myself to the hospital for suicidal thinking. That's all a while back now and at this time I felt it was appropriate to share some of the positive changes I've seen over the last 150 days or so. 

Aside from all the standard positive effects on the body, I have been learning to feel all of the feelings and go thorugh all of the emotions. This is monumental for me as I have always lived my life on the edge. Not acting out and not blaming myself or people who actually care about me has been a challenge. To be able to sit down for twenty minutes and being focused on reading is an absolute blessing. I've started a course to learn how to do a certain job and it's going OK. If I successfully complete this program I'm pretty much guaranteed a job with a company I know lines up with my own values.

Last night I fell asleep just laying on my back on the bed. In the dark with nothing playing in the background. I don't know if that has ever happened to me before. There was no anxiety at all. I was so surprised I laughed out loud. My sleep is still far from great most nights but I have managed to establish a much more healthy evening routine and schedule. It's really great to have learned how important sleep is. I now appreciate going to bed. 

I didn't do anything more than to stay off the alcohol and stay honest. It has opened doors I didn't even see. All of a sudden I have a great job opportunity, friends who stay in touch and I'm getting closer to being ready to look for a special someone. In fact, there is already someone in the pipeline but the pandemic helps me to keep it slow.

Not much to discuss in this post but sharing is caring. I really care about this community. It has had profound positive effects on my life. You are all amazing. If you are struggling today I encourage you to share, it really does help in the long run.

I've been mostly a lurker on this sub (and with Reddit in general), but the amount of support this group has given me from doing just that is so amazing that I feel as if it is important to chime in once in a while.

My last drink was April 16, 2019 and life has sure been one hell of an adventure since. From the early days of wondering how the hell I would even make it through the day, to the entire first year of running around frantically trying haphazardly to put my life back together, to the introduction of COVID-19 lockdowns and ensuing feelings of loneliness, to attempting to work in treatment as a recovery tech at a detox and realizing the corruption of the industry, to where I am today. 

My recent struggle has been with returning to school. I am in my second semester as a Computer Science Major at the age of 27. (I originally dropped out of school at 21) Sometimes, I compare myself to other students that are much younger than me. I think to myself ""well shit, these kids have their whole lives ahead of them, and well probably get a great job in a couple of years and never have to worry about money"" and then I have to remind myself ""hey, I ALSO have my whole life ahead of me"". 

I guess my point (if I even have one lol)  is that it's easy to look on the negative side and lose gratitude. The fact is, my life is something it could have never been if I hadn't stopped drinking. More importantly though, if anyone here is new or struggling, feel free to reach out to me. It is important that we don't stay isolated with negative emotions.

I’m still waiting for that mental clarity and sharpness to come back that I remember having years ago.

I didn’t magically lose a ton of weight, but it is trending in the right direction and I’ve had the will to exercise more regularly.

I love the fact that my kids are seeing me completely sober. They are just reaching their teenage years and I want to be a good example for them. They see more than we think, and me trying to act normal while completely drunk on a Friday night probably wasn’t fooling anyone.

This sub, and in particular my badge are great motivators. For whatever reason I love seeing that day counter grow and I’m gonna be pissed if I have to reset it. Whenever I have an urge I think about that.

The biggest revelation is that I didn’t become some super husband or father once the alcohol was gone. I still get frustrated with my kids, still sometimes forget things my wife told me the day before, etc. But I’m ok with that-the difference is alcohol no longer has any influence on those things or who I am.

As you can tell from it being my 2nd time making this decision, I relapsed once. I started drinking again and let it take control of my life. I consider that losing.

The shame of having to read the messages I sent the previous night.


The shame of looking at how much money I dropped at the bar.


The shame of eating McDonald's and pizza.


I've been drinking since I was 16. So nearly half my life as I'll be turning 30 this year. I've always had an issue with it, but I was always able to be relatively functional up until recently.


Last year in February when my city locked down, I had two and a half months off work but was still receiving my full pay check. All the time in the world and money to spend on booze. I remember one day during the first few days of my lockdown I woke up hungover to sun shining in my window. I pulled my blackout curtains shut and didn't open them until April. Every cycle of waking and sleeping followed the same routine. Wake up, start drinking, order more beer to be delivered, drink until I'd pass out, wake up, do it over again. Time didn't really exist anymore and because I live in a place where I can get beer delivered to my front door 24/7 I never had to even leave my bed.


I finally went back to work, but I carried on drinking. I never used to drink on work nights very often because I can't deal with being hungover at work - my bread and butter has always been intense weekend benders.


I finally finished that contract and then took a new job in a new city. My new job is evenings and weekends, so even less of a reason to cut back or stop drinking because I can now sleep it off before I go in.


Christmas 2020 was my last drink for the longest sober streak I'd ever put together. I took it slow. First two weeks I just didn't drink - I didn't want to go too big too fast. So I carried on smoking and carried on with my shit diet. Then I added in my old gym routine - four or five days a week of lifting weights. Then after I'd done that for a few weeks, I decided to start adding in healthy meals every now and then.


I was doing great until Chinese New Year hit and then I fell off the wagon hard. I even made a conscious decision to drink the first day thinking that I could have fun that day, then get back on the wagon. That turned into an eight day bender in which I made so many cringy decisions. Did a video call with my folks while wasted. Sent some absolutely incoherent voice messages to a good sober friend of mine from my previous city. God knows what else.


I felt like shit after that. Decided I definitely needed to get back on the wagon. Did great at first. Then on Sunday, right as work was ending, I had a terrible last two hours. Asked my coworker, spur of the moment, if he wanted to get some beers with me after work. I drank beer and jager until 03:30 in the morning when I finally stumbled home.


I sent another load of cringy messages to this girl from my hometown who I've been talking to recently and hoping to see when I go back to visit. Now I'm scared to open that app because I don't remember exactly what I said. I sent out other terrible messages as well.


I've had my phone either off or on silent since I woke up on Monday because I'm scared of what I said. And I think I definitely fucked up because my mom usually sends me at least one cat picture per day. Radio silence from her since this last bender.


Just fucking tired of it. I don't want to do this anymore. I recently stumbled across a video of Bam Margera drunkenly ranting on YouTube and I can't help but see my drunk ass in him. The drunken passion, the slurred speech, the absolute conviction that what you're saying is worth hearing and insightful.


So, after starting this year off with a six week streak (my longest ever) I'm going to be hopping back on that initially wobbly wagon this week. Gonna get right back in the gym too.

I‘ve put a lot of emphasis on reaching today, I guess I just need to update my goal to 02-23-22.   


I haven’t posted much in this sub, but I have peeked in often and upvoted and this community has made me feel less alone and capable of sobriety. I’m posting this today for all my fellow peekers. My life is so much better today, in so many ways, than it was a year ago.

Last time I tried to quit cold turkey, my blood pressure shot up really high. Tried to talk to my nurse practioner, but she prescribed me Naltrexone, which the pharmacist said wouldn't help at all with blood pressure or other dangerous withdrawal symptoms. So I asked my mother, who is a drug & alcohol counselor, to wean me off by controlling the amount of wine I had for about a week (detox is not an option for several reasons). It worked until I f\*cked up like an idiot and thought I could drink again as a holiday ""treat."" :(

Anyway, now I'm trying to wean off again, but the anxiety and panic attacks (especially when I'm trying to go to sleep, which is terrifying) are really hard to bear.  I feel this prickling over my whole body, jump at every sound, feel horrified when I'm driving, feel like I'm having heart palpitations... I feel OK after having my ""dose"" of wine in the evening, but since it's much less than I was drinking, I guess by the middle of the night I'm back in withdrawal, because I wake up feeling terrified I'm dying and have to talk myself down by counting my fingers over and over. I feel like an absolute basket case. It's worse than the last time I weaned off. 

Does anything help with this? Supplements? Something? I can't believe I've done this to myself after more than 2 months sober.

I get lost in the “what would my life be like today if I had successfully quit earlier?” or the “what could’ve been.” I don’t think about alcohol anymore and how I could use a drink... I think about what if I never had those drinks and how different my life would be... it consumes me.

Does this stress anyone else out? I feel like I'm already getting fomo and I'm anxious that as the weather gets warmer, my resolve to stay sober will get weaker and weaker.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

******************************************************

Good morning everyone, happy Tuesday!

People drink for various different reasons; one popular reason is to appear rebellious. I was known as the “goody two-shoes” my whole life and I didn’t have my first drink until after I had graduated high school, long after most of my peers. 

I wanted so badly to break free of this label, for fear it would limit me in the future; although this wasn’t nearly the only (stupid) reason I started heavily drinking, it was a big part of it. 

I thought it made me edgy and offbeat; by the time I quit drinking, my “friends” would marvel at how much I could drink, to the point that I did gain a reputation for being “hard”. I’ve always been the type of person who wants to stand out in the crowd and go against the grain, but I realized I was going right with the grain the whole time I was drinking. 

The true rebellion is in sobriety, in fighting against the constant barrage of media and other influences that bombard us with false messages of booze=fun,cool,etc. It’s in finding the courage to not participate in something that *literally almost everyone* else does, to some degree. *That’s* hard.

Maybe someday sobriety will be the new “in” thing. Until then, we’ll all keep on being badasses marching to the beat of our own drums and blazing a trail for others to follow. Hope everyone has a stellar day! IWNDWYT!",143,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5505829}"

I 35f single mom of a 6m haven’t had a drink since last Sunday. You might be able to catch some glimpses of my story from comments. I haven’t formally introduced myself yet. Hi! I’m globeed23! 

Moving on. After Sunday, my partner and I went up to the mountains in nh to clear my mind and take a mental break. I had one hell of a week after gradually getting myself down to two a day from about 15-20ish depending. The week from hell wasnt drinking related, I was still at about 2 a day. It was a series of unfortunate events that I couldn’t cope with. Epiphanies happened, decision to take the final plunge commenced and the mountains were phenomenal. It was exactly what I needed and I didn’t crave at all. I  don’t know how I didn’t go into withdrawals. I was told my liver is on the brink of disease. I did have a low blood sugar due to not drinking and loss of appetite though (I was diagnosed diabetic last year—alcohol/genetics—and the alcohol kept my sugars high), which I had never had before. That was pretty scary. But all in all a great time.

Enter yesterday. Home. Reality. And I have a LOT on my plate. I didn’t realize I would be affected this way this MUCH. I am an emotional person in general (Pisces), and now they are intensified like an infinite amount. I know there is an obvious chemical imbalance going on, but what the FUCK!? I literally cried over the thought that I’ve been crying. The stress is unbearable. Everybody needs something from me. I’m in nursing school (that’s a story in itself), and taking remote classes. My kids father is incompetent and also an alkie. To be fair, he takes him most weekends, and my son loves him, but when it comes to responsibility like making sure he showers, brushes his teeth, does his homework for Monday, that falls right here. 

It’s so overwhelming. It’s like i just stepped outside for the first time after being locked away in a dungeon. I want to be outside but it HURTS. I don’t even crave a drink. I don’t WANT a drink. I just don’t want this. How do you guys deal with it? And I’ll be honest here as well, I don’t know how frowned upon other substances are here, but I switched to pot. It helps tremendously. My doctors are cool with it even knowing my alcohol history so long as it helps me stay away from drinking. I have my medical card. Only thing with thc is that you build a tolerance a lot quicker than you do with alcohol. I know a crutch is a crutch, but it’s keeping me alive right now.

2021-02-23 01:58:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lqbw5k/18_months_ago_i_stopped_problem_drinking_mostly/,"18 months ago I stopped ""problem drinking"" (...mostly). Now I feel truly ready to stop drinking alcohol forever. (Trigger warning: moderating)","(Sorry this is so long. It helps to write it out.)

I was a ""normal"" take-it-or-leave it drinker for most of my adult life. After some traumatic stuff 7 years ago I started drinking more. At first it was social, but by 2 years ago it was just a bottle-plus of wine almost every night by myself. Not happy times.
  
18 months ago I quit entirely for about 6 months. I used therapy and other resources and did a bunch of work on it and myself. I then started to have one or two drinks socially very occasionally, like less than one a month. (I apologize if this is triggering.) This was possible for me for a time -- I didn't crave additional drinks if I had one. And I still don't, in a social setting. 

In the past 18 months my life improved dramatically in almost every way, and I didn't have any desire to go back to what my life had been. 

But then there was sometimes a weird lingering desire to get actually fucked up -- just once. I also quit smoking 18 months ago, and I'd crave a one-night vacation to my old wine-and-cigarette escape hatch, with friends or without.

I gave into it a few times. Maybe once every couple months, with complete abstinence in between. It was what I craved, but I'd mostly feel sick and dirty and depressed. And then I'd go right back to my sober life. Then life got ultra stressful this fall for reasons and I started doing that a little more often. I was still drinking and smoking *vastly* less than I had been, as well as maintaining many of the healthy habits I acquired during the past 18 months. I was in a really, really bad place emotionally all this fall -- like, worst of my entire life -- and from a harm reduction standpoint, the fact that I hadn't relapsed to drinking and smoking daily and was still at least sometimes doing yoga and stuff felt like a victory. At least my compass was still pointing north and I was really trying to be healthy rather than just saying fuck it.  
    
About two months ago it started to get dangerously habitual again -- for a few weeks, I was drinking maybe 4 nights a week, so most definitely in problem territory. I stopped again for a month, and figured I'd go back to my old ""occasional"" way and just stick to it. Whether that is really possible or not, or if I always would have ended up slipping back into more serious problem drinking over time, I'll never know, because I decided I'm ready to just be done.  
    
I've learned and changed a lot over the past year and a half, and my perspective on this desire to get fucked up, and what it really does to me and my life and what it feels like, is much, much clearer. I know now that I get to choose how I make my life. And I want to really be here for it, present in my senses and emotions even if they're unpleasant. The only things in my life I've ever regretted are things I did while drunk. When I think of the saddest, emptiest periods of my life, they were always while drinking. And I'm really not sure if I can moderate forever -- I could for *part of* this year, but I'm very aware there's no guarantee that I wouldn't slip into a really bad, life-destroying place with alcohol again later in life. My life truly blossomed in the last 18 months in ways I never would have dreamed of when I was drinking daily. When I think of the most alive moments of my life, they're always sober ones. That's what I want. I want my real, whole life, and to really be vibrantly here for all of it, even the really shitty parts. I don't want to sleepwalk through the one life I have or simplify or deaden my feelings; even my bad feelings are important and I want to know what my actual feelings are. And I do not give a f* anymore if someone thinks I'm an alien for not having a drink at some gathering when everyone else is. Who cares.

I work in a pretty high stress sales job and a lot of KPIs (key performance indicators) are out of my control. It causes a fair amount of anxiety. But had a decent day at work.  I felt like I had more energy and a much better attitude in my appointments. Heck, I even made and ate breakfast this morning. Had not done that on a weekday in a long time. I did not have any cravings for alcohol today. I think a big part of that is that I ate 3 square meals. I used to like to drink on an empty stomach because it made the buzz better (and the hangover worse). And I’ve realized one of my triggers for cravings for alcohol occur when I get really hungry. So I made it a point to eat. As soon as I started to feel a little hungry I’d eat a little snack and made sure to have a proper lunch and dinner. Not over indulging but not letting my body get to the point of major hunger. I didn’t wake up and exercise early this morning like I originally planned but I’m ok with that. The major win today/tonight is I didn’t drink. I’ve decided to give this week, while staying with my mom, a pass on some of the other goals I have. My major concentration is on staying sober and if I don’t exercise 4 times this week, that’s ok. The goal is to not drink and continue to give my body time to detox and recover. I’m going to soon have so much time on my hands from not drinking I will certainly find the time for my other goals. Just trying to get in the habit of breaking the old habit.

I think I’m finally done. I did force myself to drink some throughout these days, which was awful. But I was worried about going into wd and not really being able to distinguish between it and the gastritis. Seemed risky.

Or at least it was the moment where I unknowingly decided I would eventually end up in a world of shit. 

It was around 10am on a Wednesday morning. I was 32 years old with 3 small children and I was neck-deep in a divorce. I reached for a bottle of vodka and mixed it with some cranberry juice. I distinctly remember the cold, gray sky that morning when the alcohol hit my bloodstream. You know, that warm, numbing, soothing feeling?  It was right then and there I almost audibly made a declaration:

“Wow. This really does help.”

It’s completely irrelevant at this point the horror I inflicted on myself. The sheer volume of alcohol I consumed. The truly and utterly embarrassing shit I did. All the lies. All the deceit. ALL THE EFFORT and ENERGY you put into covering up all the little tracks you leave behind when you imbibe (literally) every waking hour. Your only Achilles Heel is that you might get so oiled you get a tad too sloppy and leave behind too many clues. 

One of these days I’m going to write it all down. A final, cathartic send-off and acknowledgment to the insanity just to, you know, shine the light on it all so the demon doesn’t think that he’s got a little corner in which to hide. 

But that’s for another day... today I am grateful for just being able to simply see it for what it was and being okay with it all. Certainly not happy about it, but just not getting too caught up in the past. 

What’s done is done. The only thing the past is good for is hopefully using it as guard rails for not ending up in the ditch. Which is to say, at this point I’ve learned I don’t have to live like that any longer. 

I’m happy about that. And for today that’s good enough.

Fast forward to Valentine’s Day weekend - not six weeks later. I had been drinking alone pretty regularly heading into the weekend. And then Sunday we got snowed in and I downed an entire bottle of vodka by about 2pm. Took a nap. Woke up and downed 6-10 beers. The scary thing is that I wasn’t even that drunk. Even with that much booze in my I was just buzzed all day. I had a great day! 

But the next day I felt... different. Not so much hungover but more sick. There was a problem. Like something wasn’t right until I could have alcohol back in my system. My heart was racing. I was exhausted. I had chills. Headache. I was irritable. Nauseous. Of course it was withdrawals. 

I drank small amounts of whiskey throughout the day which brought temporary relief. Then I weaned myself over the course of 3 days. It was hell. At one point I genuinely thought I might die. I’m not trying to be dramatic and doubt it was that serious, but the last night I had a few glasses of wine and took a bath and thought my heart was going to stop. When I said goodnight to my kids I thought I might not wake up the next day. 

I didn’t wake up in a dumpster or get a DUI or even feel that drunk, but it was my rock bottom. I realized in that moment that I truly don’t WANT to drink because I never want to feel that again. I don’t want to die that way. And that really is the only way that path ends. 

Not a drop since Thursday. I feel so much better already. Physical scheduled to assess the damage. But I’m moving forward. Its just not worth ever going through that hell again. Never again.

So, the weird ass grief I felt (am still feeling) caused me to go off track a while back. Started drinking heavily after 97!!!! 97 whole entire sober days!!! UGH SO MAD ABOUT THAT!!! Lost my sober streak, lost my food logging streak. Anyway, what's done is done and all I can do is be kind to my past self, and move forward with better choices. At least that's what my therapist says, and she's usually (frustratingly) right about these things.

It kept happening to me since I started drinking alcohol occasionally as a high-schooler. Once I started, I couldn't stop or I wanted to keep up with everyone else and I never left a party as the last one. Then a few years later (when I was 20-21 years old) when I lived on my own I started to get drunk on regular basis, always with people, I never had the desire to get drunk on my own. And then I was drinking alcohol daily, always had a drink in my hand. And I didn't really realise it, I also started to look awful, bloated and puffy in the face and I didn't even notice. I didn't take care of myself at all. And my mental health suffered as well of course - I didn't really do anything I liked anymore, didn't have any hobbies and dreams or aspirations. I also showed up to my work drunk so many times, I didn't care at all. After that, I lost my flat and had to leave the city - which was actually such a blessing because I realised everything that was wrong (I was still 21 years old at that time). I have to mention that I also owed some money for the alcohol I drank and other financial problems. Well, after that it was no problem not to drink, I didn't have anyone to drink with anyway. But I would occasionally go out and I always had in mind to only have a few drinks to get tipsy and that's all - but it never stopped at that. Once I started drinking, I couldn't stop. I used to have this stupid motto: ""Never regret anything, because at that moment it was exactly what you wanted."" Which actually wasn't true anymore - I would regret every night I would get drunk, I would embarrass myself, stay out late til the morning which I didn't want to etc. I tried this a few times to go out and have one drink or something but then I realised I'm not able to do that. So I decided not to drink any alcohol this year. At first I thought about going back to drinking - once this year is over, trying to contain myself to just a few drinks again, see if I can do it, but now I'm thinking it would be better for me to never drink in my life again. The thing is, now it's easy not to drink - with pandemic, not being around my friends. But I plan on going back to the city where I lived and was leading a lifestyle full of alcohol and I think that's gonna be much harder. I still want to hang out with my friends but only now I'm realising we were only hanging out while drinking and to be honest I am a bit scared they are gonna pressure me to drink - which I know is wrong and if they do that, they're not really my friends anyway, I just don't want to lose my friends and stuff. And I'm also scared of the temptation - but my plan is to remove myself from such situations immediately if I feel tempted. My other problem is that I am usually the one who initiates the drinking and encourages other to drink with me and party with me all night. It will take some getting used to to my new lifestyle. Even though I still like going out (after the pandemic of course) and partying and going to raves - I'm just gonna skip the alcohol.

I just felt the need to share this somewhere. I just think I have a problem but I'm also not sure if it is a problem for my whole life. But for now I am determined not to drink any alcohol this year and while I'm moving back to the city etc. But I should honestly probably never drink again because I'm scared of becoming the person I was when I was drinking every day - I din't care for other people, not even my friends, I was just using everyone, I didn't take care of myself, I was putting myself in dangerous situations and I didn't even care if anything happened to me.

I’ve been doing way better at having stretches of sobriety in the weeks rather than days, but I slipped yesterday. 

Long story short I spent about 2 days helping a friend get into a mental hospital/treatment facility where he can get sober and get his suicidal ideation treated. It was a rocky couple of days, let’s just put it that way. 

And when it was all over and I could just go home, exhausted, I went to the liquor store and bought a bottle. 

I didn’t drink all of it like I used to do, but I’m still feeling pretty low about the whole business. 

I saw my friend in such a horrible state (drinking-related) and I was able to be sober to help him. And then BAM I wanted some relief, or more accurately, to feel numb for a bit. 

Guess how it worked out?

Also it's both my cake day (which I never seem to catch on reddit) and day 111 in sober living... sorry it's so long.


I started drinking when I was in mid teens at highschool parties but only very rarely until I was about 18. At 18 I was a senior in highschool, I had straight As and I was reasonably well liked by most of my peers for a variety of reasons. Around that time I started drinking more often because parties happened nearly every weekend, though very few negative effects around this time outside of some embarrassing moments and a good number of random hook ups which again mostly resulted in awkward conversations but nothing else.


As I progressed into University the drinking did not increase immediately as I really did not have the funds to pay for that alcohol until I was roughly 21 and had an ok job, living with my then girlfriend.  Turns out living with that girlfriend and the ensuing cheating on her part that begun my progression into the bottom of the bottle. I ended that relationship and was living on my own for the first time and didnt care what I did so I continued drinking more, going out every weekend night and drinking until 3 in the morning getting up and doing it again. Around this time I was still mostly a weekend only drinker and this rarely had an effect on my job performance. I should note that I had gotten really good at my job at a very young age and was able to complete work about twice the expected speed and could do this hungover (or drunk to be honest) because it was so imprinted on my brain that I didnt have to think about it.


Fast forward a couple of years and I had completed a diploma in college, had cycled through a couple of partners and got a new job that was more stable and paid better. During this time I had a complicated relationship with my girlfriend as we came from complete opposite upbringing (she - verbally abusive, alcoholic bringing up, me - limited alcohol use by my parents, extremely loving and quiet family).   We drank together often and had many arguments and while drinking that often ended up quite negative the next day. We understood we both had issues and we worked seemingly effectively that way.. though always some underlying issues. During this time is when the drinking worked it's way into daily use. At this time I was starting to get a couple negative reviews at work which drove me to drink to cope with doing a job I wasnt enjoying..  which as you all know doesn't work out well. I was able to work through those issues with my boss and came out of it positively somehow with good year end reviews and even a promotion along the lines. 

Fast forward about a decade (because it all whooshed by in a drunken haze) and I'm married with 3 kids a nice bome and a fun job but still a daily drinker (~10 drinks a day minimum). I start getting severe gastrointestinal issues that keep me from events and meetings and enjoying travels and family time. In jan 2020 I begin to see a doctor who I do not share the full extent of my drinking with and he does his best to figure out what my gastrointestinal issues are. We cycle through food and medication to control it and not much is having a significant effect. Here comes covid lockdown 2020... which along with many others pushed me to work at home and severe daily anxiety and panic attacks and increased drinking..  drinking some days starting as soon as I wake up to control the shakes but usually waiting until at least mid afternoon on work days. I fell into a severe depression  for the first time in my life and felt like I had no exit. At this time my doctor recommended that I get help in the form of CBT with a therapist which I have never done before. It took a lot of convincing as I tend to be a private person, but I finally took the step and called my employee assistance program which connected me with a local therapist.  I was very skeptical when I first chatted with her. But I listened.. a lot.. I told her almost everything about drinking.. anxiety... panic attacks.. depression.. and I continued to drink. The therapist pushed AA on me heavily and I gave it a fair shake but knew it wasnt for me. I did however, finally, think about it.. hard. And convinced myself I needed to stop and needed to change. It took about 4 months of on and off stop and start ... numerous days 1s.. a few day 2s and a handful of day 3, 4 and 5s.. but never completing a weekend drink free.. until I finally hit a Sunday..  then I hit a Saturday another week. And on november 2nd 2020 I had my last drinks... in 111 days! 


It was hard...

It was painful (mentally and physically)...

It was scary...

It was worth it.


What helped?


Exercise (walking, running, strength training).

Podcasts (this naked mind and a variety of science ones)

This sub

My wife and kids being supportive.

Cannabis (not over indulging and next on the list to tackle)


I made it through 2 thanksgivings (dual citizen here) an interesting election, numerous holidays, lockdown #2, remote learning with children, meetings with people way above my pay grade, wife and mother having major surgeries.. and I did it all without drinking.


On the plus side I just got offered a tentative new job today.. about 2 levels above what I've been doing because i have finally been recognized for the work I've put in and it feels great.


I sincerely appreciate everyone here, thanks for sharing your stories and hit me up if you need someone to chat with about your own journey.

I threw up for HOURS. I don’t even know how I had that much stuff inside me to throw up. And my head felt like it was physically splitting in half. I felt like I was actually going to die and if I wasn’t actively dying I kinda wanted to just to make it all end. It was horrible.

I’m on a lot of medication for mental health and physical health problems and a bunch of them say not to drink. My husband is a doctor and he says it’s fine to still drink a little bit despite those warnings, so he keeps an eye on me. I don’t drink super often and I don’t drink a lot when I do drink. But when I drink I always have this MUST KEEP DRINKING attitude that is really unhealthy that I don’t like. It’s like a weirdly competitive thing like I feel like I need to prove that I can keep going or something idk.

Anyway I learned the hard way why they say don’t drink because holy shit the experience was miserable and I can’t believe I did that to myself for 4 beers. Totally not worth it.

I’m bipolar and 60% of bipolar folks are alcoholics so I’ve always been sensitive about it to make sure I don’t have a problem because that’s a big percent. I’ve always compared myself to my husband who I’m pretty sure is an alcoholic. My habits REALLY pale in comparison to his. So it’s always seemed fine. But this incident really crossed a line for me to think there’s a problem. I’ve also thought that since I can go long periods of time without drinking that it meant that I couldn’t have a problem. But I think it’s still a problem how I drink when I do drink.

I should also add that when I was in college (2010-2013) I was in a sorority and even though I was functioning it was definitely full blown alcoholism at that time. I would’ve never recognized it as that at the time but I can admit that now. But as soon as I started working I rarely drank and I never drank to excess anymore.

Anyway I’ve decided I no longer need to have alcohol in my life at least for Lent to see how it goes. I’m on a weight loss journey and it’ll be nice to not have to factor in the total waste of calories too.

My hobby for years was making wine. Lots and lots of different wines. I loved the science, the work, the smells and sights. I felt accomplished with every batch and dumped money into winemaking every chance I got. I was sitting on close to 30 gallons when all the batches added up plus another 50 more I did with my brew buddies. I posted really frequently with my main account on several of the homebrew subs.

1 year ago, when I would top off my airlocks with vodka, I would top off myself as well. Just a quick shot. Then, I would sip my wine. 1 bottle. Then kick open my favorite bourbon to cap the night.

1 month ago, I needed to finish a full 1000ml bottle of vodka to get drunk. My SO had to hide the beverages she wanted to try. My stock of wine bottles for aging started to dwindle due to bingeing them just for the alcohol. I spent nearly $300 in one month on the cheapest vodka to get me by. I took a one week break after a horribly bad night of withdrawals and swore the beverages off.

3 weeks ago, I had my friend come pick up all my brew supplies and alcohol in the house. $1000s of dollars in supplies, ingredients, and days/months/years of hard work...gone. I was determined, though.

2 days ago, I relapsed with whiskey out of habit because it was available. I was disappointed at first. However, this is the first time I have felt accomplished in the last year with anything. I will not be drinking tonight or any other night!

 Our emotions that fuel our thoughts show each of us our road, our unique path to recovery. That is one map we can follow. And it is our privilege to live and heal that route because along the way, we find and nurture our unique selves. Also, we can share our experiences with others and help them heal also, once we are ready to share and once they are ready to work on their own route.

Our abusers trashed our lives with their hatred. The painful wounds that keep playing out in our heads points us in the direction we need to go to heal those wounds and remove their obstacles. Those obstacles nag us because they are not a natural part of us. They aren’t at home; if they were, they’d chill out and settle down.

Our one of a kind soul is trying to kick them out. So, what bothers you the most is where you start. No one has the right to tell you any different.

For me, I had to begin by facing my monstrous family. I had to face the pain they buried deep inside me that haunted me, that drove me to drink, drug, act out, and overeat that still bothered me decades after I severed ties with them in late 1979 or early 1980s. I changed my location physically, but emotionally my path, covered in seething anger and bleeding, went with me everywhere.

Back then, I didn’t know the extent of brain damage and emotional hurdles I faced. Being fragile, I needed the time to heal and gather my thoughts. I think in spring 2011, I began with my then therapist, and having recorded the sessions, I listened to them at home, alone where I could cry, uninterrupted.

In the past, I worried about hurting someone if I allowed myself to feel what I ran from. But I didn’t; when I accepted my pain, I cried and it hurt. But I got through it.

I saw and felt better firsthand. Not a huge amount, but better. The tiny voice inside me suffocating under the cruel lies and bleeding, hurt wounds that caused me to live my life in lies, distorting everything I did, breathed a little stronger.  So, encouraged, I kept going.

Looking back, I see how my path is unique to me, just as your path is unique to you. The events that shape us will vary. Our perspective will be ours alone; it will differ even from our siblings. No one sees our world the same way we do. It is individual to each of us, alone.

But the emotions? The emotions will be the same; shame, humiliation, embarrassment, isolation, and the rest we share.

Our unique selves are suffocating underneath that pain. So, for our beautiful, one of a kind genuine, authentic selves to breathe and thrive, those obstacles need to go.

Because pain that nags us, desperate to go because it is not at home inside us, never gives up on receiving our validation so we can release it. Our soul, our inner self, is doing its job. It is looking out for our well being and urging us in the direction we need to go so we can heal and live our life, the life we were born to live, including the pain we overcome and healed.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4934139}"

Never really had a lot of people in the same sorta situation as me to talk to about drinking, so I’m not really sure where I stand or what to do. 

I’m almost 21M, studying at university, and I work in 2 different bars, and pull some crazy long hours, sometimes 55+ a week across the two. There’s loads of different reasons I’ll drink on a given day, but for the last 6 months it’s been almost every single day, and usually more than 4, but 6-8 over the course of a day feels like what I want to do the most if money and driving weren’t concerns. I drink at work, after work, and before work, but it’s never noticeable or impacting negatively, so that’s not really an issue for me. On nights I have off, I’ll jump up to 10-12 drinks, and going out or to parties tends to be around the 15-20 mark. So on average I’d say I’m sitting around 40-50 drinks a week, but I might Inadvertently go a day without or only have 1, so I don’t think I’m physically dependent but it’s hard to tell with all my other mental health symptoms and the occasional discomforts/physical symptoms from taking Ritalin for my ADHD. 

I think work is making this so much worse for me, as it feels like a reward and the only thing I have time to enjoy for myself in my life, as I don’t have the energy to do the things I enjoy anymore because I just tire myself out so much.  

Alcohol is definitely hurting me, as apparently I’m one of those lucky people that blacks out easily, and my doctor says this is my brain being damaged each time. Blacking out REALLY upsets me because I’ve done some embarrassing shit and I never know if I’ve done something shit in the morning and I’ll stress about it and stress about it and get super worked up about it until I’ve asked all my friends if they’re SURE I didn’t make an ass out of myself.  

Other than that, my memory feels fucked. It was always a bit rough from being in a depressed fog, but I’m not really that sad anymore after picking up Ritalin, which has been nice, but I feel like it’s gotten so much worse than it ever used to be. I’ll tell the same stories to the same people over and over again because I’ll forget who I spoke to about what and when, and shit like that. 

I’m just not super sure at the moment how to go forward. I’d have to quit my jobs and find something else to do, but pouring beers is all I’m good at. I’m scared that I’ll have trouble socially, and that It’ll be really hard for me to relearn how to hang out with my friends, and that I’ll miss out on stuff. I’m 20, do I just take a break and come back to it when my life is less chaotic? Or do I need to go sober forever, and if so is now the best time? There are other things I like doing, but if I can get my drinking to a point that it’s not hurting me the way it is now, would I be better off than if I was just sober for the rest of my life? If I go sober now with the goal of doing it forever, and I relapse and it’s not destroying me is that ok? (Are there acceptable relapses?) 

I’m also worried about how I would look, cuz I personally just absolutely can’t stand straight edge people or people who virtue signal/holier than thou about not drinking or doing drugs. 

I also worry about, well, doing drugs. While I’ve dabbled, I do still want to experiment more with psychedelics, but sober means sober right? Obviously these are different to weed (which I could also see myself swapping in for booze so that’s an obvious no-no), but who should be making these rules, cuz trusting myself to set these things out seems like a shit idea. 

Idk sorry about the huge post, and I know a lot of the questions I have are ones that I need to answer myself, but I just sorta want some sort of idea of where I stand relative to others, where to start, and what sorts of things I should start to consider.

Today is Day 1.,"Like the title says, I had a miscarriage a month ago. While I was pregnant, I obviously didn't drink for 2.5 months and it was amazing. I didn't miss alcohol one bit. I have been a pretty frequent casual drinker for most of my adult life. My main issue is that I have a hard time stopping. I never really drank daily, but when I did, it's NEVER ever ever just 1 or 2 drinks. It's like I can have 0 or 8. Even when I tell myself I'm going to have 3 drinks MAX, the second the first one goes down, it's game over. My brain takes over and I suck down 6 or 7 drinks without even thinking about it. 


So after my miscarriage, I started coping with alcohol (always a terrible choice). It just felt good to be drunk and not think for a while. I've mostly just been drunk at home, and the hangovers haven't been bad, so I didn't really realize what a problem it had become. Recently I looked in the mirror and realized my skin looks like shit, my face is puffy, and I've gained 15 pounds in the past month (when I drink I also don't care what food I'm shoving in my face). Worst of all, I realize I'm starting to really CRAVE alcohol, in the afternoons and into the evening. My drinking before was always motivated by social situations. The past month though, I've just been drinking vodka at home for no real reason. Yesterday was my breaking point. I had 8 drinks at brunch with a friend and when I got home I passed out until 6 pm. The whole day, lost.  


I realize this is not as dramatic as many of the stories posted here....but it just hit me that I don't want to live like this. I don't want it to get worse...what's next, drinking during the work day? Needing a drink right when I wake up? I don't want to find out but I know that if I don't stop it's only going to get worse.

Sleep sucked last night. I woke up from a dream drinking wine with really a huge EARLY morning craving. It felt so off. I think I was still partially in my dream state and had to convince myself that it was 3am and I hadn’t drank. I had this weird disappointment and remember thinking “since I blew it I can drink again”.

But, since sleep sucked, I’m hoping I’ll have a solid rest tonight. I usually sleep pretty well when I’m not drinking (no middle of the night anxiety attacks).

I tried NA beer for the first time yesterday. The first two sips seemed fine then it started tasting funky for me. I think I’ll be sticking to kombucha. At least now I know I can opt for one of those when my mind feels the need to crave hops.

Anyway. Onward and onward and onward.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

***

In my early days of sobriety I had a very ambivalent relationship with the AoK. I either felt guilty for not having good deeds to display, or I felt guilty for displaying them, cashing out on my saintliness. After a while I realized that the AoK wasn´t about showing off to the world what a kindhearted fellow I was, but striving to be aware of all the good things that actually happen - not just by chance or the laws of nature, but as a result of human interaction. The AoK helped me believe in people - and in myself. So here we are!

***

**When I was young,** noone seemed to have any problems, except for me. Everyone seemed to do so well, train, find love, have fun, except for me. Years later I realized that was how they often felt and thought of me, too.

After my wife miscarried for the second time, I chose to tell people about it, because the pain was too big to carry, even between the two of us. The effect blew my mind: People began sharing their pain too.

This last week has been a roller coaster. A dear friend told me they are bipolar, and I bet noone really knows. My sister in law admitted that she´s got an eating disorder. Through my job I´ve spoken to two friends who used to be suicidal, a Syrian refugee, and a man whose son vanished without any trace and any clue if he´s dead or alive. I´m still moved by these encounters, and endlessly thankful that people show me this trust.

So, I choose to trust. Yesterday I went through with something that has been fuelling my anxiety all week, and when people came to thank me, I shared that fact, not for irl karma points, but to give the other person an opportunity to open up about their life, should they need it. Just like with our sobriety, honesty is the first step to change, and if my honesty can make something happen in other people, I´m willing to take the risk.

That's me for this week. How's everyone else doing, any AoK that you'd like to share?

I worked hard all weekend cleaning and doing laundry and also taking care of my son who broke his arm last week. Last night, I went to bed at around 11 after putting on clean jammies, brushing my teeth and hair, and washing my face. How novel! I was asleep basically as soon as my head hit the pillow, and slept straight through until about 6:30 am. Sleep has been evading me since I quit, so this was a welcome surprise. I woke up feeling actually rested.  Took a shower, made coffee, ate breakfast, all in a pleasant calm mood, and done in time for work at 8:00. It was just so... Nice. I always say I'm not a morning person. Well yeah, who is when they stayed up half the night before drinking and wake up hungover on like 4 hours of sleep?

Most of my family are alcoholics (one had a liver transplant but died shortly after) so I grew up thinking everyone drank all the time. I've done things I regret; I've never hurt anyone with my actions, but I wasn't kind to myself. The last two years I was very self-destructive. I've ruined relationships; after many years I have finally grown close to my son, and that is the greatest thing to come from it all. I wish my mom was still alive because she would be so proud of me. 

But as happy as I am about my achievement, today is one of those days that would normally cause me to grab a bottle and drink it dry. My aunt (who raised me as her own after my mother died) passed away in October. My uncle, her husband, had an aortic aneurysm last week and miraculously survived and made it back home. But after watching my mom and his wife die, spending their final days bedridden and attached to tubes, plus the severe depression he had from losing his wife of 45 years - four months to the day that she died, he shot and killed himself on Saturday. 

He is the only uncle I had left, and I am going to miss everything about him. He was one of the few family members that never judged me, even when I was drinking and at my worse. The first thing he did when we'd see one another is smile and tell me how happy he was to see me. When my aunt died he called to comfort ME, when he should have been the one getting a call from me, and he was the only one in my family that took the time to make sure I was okay and aware of the fact that she loved me with all her heart. 

I'm not a religious person at all, but I have always hoped that there is an afterlife of some sort. The idea of them all being together again is the only thing that brings me the smallest bit of peace.

I survived a week, 1 day is okay right? Well long story short. We got in a fight (no shocker) about me drinking and he walked out on me.

I’m almost two weeks sober now, after I finally checked myself into a rehab center. I was dry a couple times before but always fell off the wagon again a couple months after. I’ll be staying another week or two and have everything regarding aftercare figured out. Therapists, meetings, all that stuff. 

Now I’m taking the train for the first time by myself to get to a doctors appointment. And even though I love being sober, love my new face, the energy and the happiness that comes with being sober, and even though I’m so determined and I know I can never have a drink again, that stupid alcoholic voice inside my head keeps telling me how amazing a sweet buzz would be to numb the pain. I’m so sad that I can never drink again, even though I know how it almost killed me. Sad that I can never smoke a joint again, even though it took so much away from me.

How can I hammer that knowledge into my brain? 

I took horrible before-pictures and have amazing after-pictures after just two weeks, I survived so many alcohol poisonings, so many concussions, so many terrifying hangovers.

I couldnt be happier that I made that choice. Here are a few things I have learned in the last 90 days-


1. I CAN sleep without booze. Its not impossible. 

2. I have spent way too long being angry and upset with the world. I have been working on being more optimistic. 

3. Turkey bacon is god-awful

4. Boredom is my worst enemy. It was imperative to find other things to do besides drink. Now I read, run, cook meals, go for pointless drives... 

5. I used booze as an escape from life. When I wanted to pull the ejector seat. Things that scared me, bored me, annoyed me.. I would just drink. Its been nice to face these things head on and develop the skills to deal with them. I feel stronger now. 

6. I can drive ANYWHERE I want anytime I want. Its been very freeing. I cant believe I spent so much time being imprisoned at my house, or anywhere else, because I was drunk and couldnt drive.

i'm currently approaching my first week sober which (i know!) isn't that long but damn this is the longest i've gone without drinking in 6 years. my sleep, skin, diet, and overall mood has been better than it has in a long time. 

i left an abusive relationship mid-pandemic in which we were living together and i was drinking upwards of a bottle of wine a night just so i didn't have to sink into the reality that i was afraid for my life. i was at a really low point with my depression/anxiety and \*shocking\* but alcohol was always the biggest trigger - saying things i later regretted and having intense hangover/shameovers after just a glass or two of wine.

 reading ""quit like a woman"" has completely changed my perspective on sobriety and allowing myself the space to not feel like i ""failed"" or that there's something inherently wrong with me because i want to get sober. in some ways i thought i had worked through a lot of the pain of leaving an abuser, but this past week, free of any substances, i have entered into a new and much deeper level of reckoning with what happened to me. i've cried more, but also felt more compassion for myself and finally feel like i have a shot at moving past one of the darkest times in my life. 

i guess this is all to say that i am really grateful that something inside me pushed me to work towards sobriety - and i listened. i didn't have any sense of how much i was choosing to bury within myself each time i drank and having to go through every second, every emotion, and every thought of my days with a clear and uncompromised mind is bringing me home to myself. i think i was worried that my life would start to feel small or boring if i didn't drink but i am already discovering an internal life richer than i could have imagined. 

i don't have anyone in my life that i'm ready to talk to about this yet (everyone close to me drinks a lot and tends to see sobriety as a moral judgement of everyone who drinks). But i don't know, this journey is already beautiful and i feel like my life is just beginning.

I’ve felt better, slept better, and been far more present as a parent. I was feeling really good about this.

Yesterday I spent 5 hours in the hot sun doing yard work. I was sun burnt and sore. My wife grabbed some hard lemonades after the work was done. 

I didn’t even think about it. I popped the top on the can and took a sip. It was exactly as I remembered. And I felt like a few would be ok, and that didn’t mean I had to drink all of them. I could just have a couple and go to bed. I earned it, right? I worked really hard and unwinding with a grown up drink was justifiable. 

And somewhere around half the can in I realized I would not do that. I would not have a couple. I would have 6, stay up too late, feel like death today, be slow and sluggish all day with a job that needs me to be ready for emergencies. I would add to the dehydration from the work in the sun, which would make it hard for the nurse to draw my labs scheduled today and increase the headache. I would have night sweats (again) and I would wake up at 3 am. I would struggle through the day and want to go to bed early and I would be too tired to do anything fun with my kid. 

I got up and poured it out. I ordered Chinese food and drank a ton of water. I slept well and had zero problems getting up. My wife drank 3 of them and went to bed, and I didn’t feel like I missed out on anything at all.

I did Dry January, and it ended up being relatively easy - I actually also didn't eat meat all January and that proved to be harder. I work at a brewery and wasn't really tempted. But after getting pretty toasty a few times the first week of February and dealing with a flood of emotions surrounding my ex-wife getting remarried, I told myself I was done.

Overall it's been easy, but the last couple days have been tough, and I'm arguing with myself. On one hand, I made the decision so I should stick to it, and my relationship with alcohol wasn't super healthy. On the other hand, if I've been able to give it up for a month and a half, save for three rough days, maybe I don't really have a problem and I just need to find a better outlet for my stress.

Even at a younger age (early 20s) I realized that my pattern of drinking was not like those around me. One beer was never enough but rather one case was more my speed. I always got validation of my friendships and who I was through being the “fun” guy. This quickly consumed my identity as the guy that will meet you at the bar and he will make plans with the next morning but we both know he won’t be there. 

I knew this was a problem and quickly realized that I wasn’t in the driver seat but rather the booze was. I woke up silently every morning telling myself I needed to sober up just to crack open my first drink hours later. Of course this is furthered my problem while taking away all my confidence, destroy my health, ruin virtually every friendship in some facet, and just leave me empty inside. 

Now my story isn’t as linear as it seems but for the sake of getting to the point I will speed this up. Just excited to be putting my first post up after years of lurking! But during this period of drinking and intermittent drug use, I met my wife (non-addict) but still I never opened up to her about my lifestyle instead I just gave her a front row seat to the show. She watched for around 7 years me destroying myself and didn’t stop me because I wouldn’t let her by telling her lies of my control over it and “you think a liquid controls my life? Come on now.” 

Fast forward to November 2020 (15 years of hard living) I broke down, told her I need sobriety and help. Instead of that afternoon cracking that drink a mere 2-3 hours later, I embarked on this new lease on life. I clued my five year old son in on it, by not telling him I am sober directly but saying that there is a “new” dad in town. Then here comes the dagger of the whole story: sitting at dinner last week where we are all crying laughing about building a robot that farts, which would have not got this much laughter or creativity out of me previously while drinking sadly. He stops mid sentence, looks at me and says “I love the new dad. Is he here to stay?” Queue the waterworks. I lost it, shoot I am welling up as I type this. He is here to stay forever, I promise.

Sorry for the rambling. It is a combination of me overly excited for my first post here, too much coffee before work, and also mobile typing. Thank you for this community and for the random posts that people put over the years that got me here.

First of all my badge days are not good.  I stopped changing it because I kept going back to the booze.  But this time is different.  I have not been feeling well in the last couple months.  I wanted to relay my symptoms then and now, after only one week of zero alcohol.  

The last two years - high blood pressure (150/100) even on pills, dehydration, no consistent sleep, waking up tired, napping in the day, messed up stomach and intestines, going 5x a day, which cause hemorrhoids and ass hurt, gaining weight, and high anxiety and eating rolaids like candy.  Even with all these symptoms, I kept drinking, even knowing through my research that alcohol causes most of these symptoms.  Last week on Tuesday night I had my last drink.  I have drank my entire adult life progressing from 1-2 per day to 10-12 drinks (incl mixing isn vodka here and there) per day for at least 4 years.  Since Tuesday it has been zero, even at restaurants and parties.  I stopped this because I have just been feeling like crap all day long and then not sleeping at all.  

So here it is less than a week later with zero booze.  And these are the results, literally - after 3 days of no drinking I have slept all night long (6-7 hours).  Last night I slept 8-1/2 hrs straight!  I haven't done this in years.  I wake up feeling very refreshed and energetic.  I have been pooping now only once a day, no more ass burn.  My blood pressure, before taking my meds has been dropping all week from 150/100 to 135/80 this am.  After meds its even better, down to 120/75.  I hope to get off of the BP meds  in a few weeks.  I have lost 7 lbs, from 237.5 (my max) to 230.5.  My goal is to drop to 215 before a trip to FL in April.  My bloating is gone.  No rolaids in 4 days.  And my anxiety level has gone from 9/10 to maybe 2/10.  I have read that it takes 6 weeks for a liver to fully recover, if no perm damage already.  I am feeling good.  No desire for booze yet.

After a good 2-3 months of not drinking, I started again about 2 weeks ago. I'm hoping this post can help others who might be on the verge of drinking and also help myself through reflecting on this 'holiday'.

Firstly, the hangovers. Dear lord they just are not worth it. Walking around and feeling like a zombie, in constant discomfort and having guilt and regret coursing through you. Waking up hours before you want to just to fill yourself up with water and hang your head over the toilet bowl. Alcohol is sneaky, because if anything else in life made you feel this way you would cut it out without hesitation, but I always seem to conveniently forget how terrible alcohol makes you feel. 

Secondly, the weight gain. I had been making good progress with my weight-loss, however I've managed to pile a bunch back on during this period of drinking. This is due to a combination of forgoing runs due to being hungover, eating terribly whilst drunk/hungover and consuming thousands of empty calories in these demon drinks. I remember Craig Beck saying in his 'Happy Sober Podcast' that it's virtually impossible to lose weight whilst being a drinker, and I completely agree.

The real clincher came the other day when I finished working on a van to campervan conversion I'd been working on for weeks. I should have been elated and full of excitement and wanting to go somewhere fun and take it for a spin. Instead, I just went back to bed because I felt terrible and just wanted to eat pizza and try and stave off the temptation to drink some more to 'ease the hangover a bit'. I don't want to feel that way on a regular basis.

Apologies for the long-winded post. I'm hoping these reflections will help serve as a reminder to some that drinking is just not worth it. At the very least it's helped me feel a bit better and excited to get back on the wagon. IWNDWYT",47,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.457137}"

2021-02-22 08:28:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lpnzsp/got_mad_felt_very_out_of_control/,Got mad. Felt very out of control.,"Hello sober friends! I had a very interesting experience this last evening and i needed to get it off my chest. I’ve been sober for 2.5 + years and my life has changed in extraordinary ways. I got married to the love of my life, I have hobbies and passion, and I’m just happy to be not be stuck behind a bottle every single damn day/minute of my life. 

My wife and I adopted a puppy 6 months ago. She’s playful and fun and kind of obnoxious most of the time. We take her to the dog park every day at the same time because it helps her and she loves it. She (dog) has lots of puppy friends and they wrestle and play every night. My life is very structured and routine (mostly because of the puppy) which I find helps with my sobriety.

Tonight at the dog park there is another puppy that my dog wants to play with. She has been around this dog and wants to play with it but the owner doesn’t like my dog. In the past he’s yelled at my dog to leave his dog alone... frankly the man doesn’t like to see his dog (pit bull) not be the alpha dog in a situation. My dog is the runt of a litter so she’s usually the submissive one. Anyways, My dog (non-violently) grabs at the scruff of his dogs neck. Not the throat, nowhere on the dog that would hurt, but the place where mothers pick up their animals. The new dog owner freaks out and starts hitting my dog with the stick in his hand. My dog walks away whimpering and holding its paw. The guy hurt my dog. 

Now, I’m a very mellow person. When I was drinking I would have lost my cool right away and caused a scene. I didn’t do that, but my wife was pissed and yelled at the guy saying that it was abuse and he wasn’t allowed to hit our dog. I wasn’t getting involved in her behavior because it wasn’t unwarranted. The guy at this point is arguing with my wife and denying that he did anything wrong. He said call the police in which my wife responded she would and then he yelled, “call the police or shut up.”

So that’s when I lost it. I blacked out of rage and remember getting inches from his face yelling at him. I remember yelling, “you don’t get to talk to my wife like that.” But then it was blank. I didn’t touch the guy (thank god) and I definitely scared him but the whole thing was so uncharacteristic of me that I scared myself. I had this huge adrenaline rush and felt incredibly out of control.

On my way home I stopped at the store to get some dinner groceries and had pretty typical reaction to walking past the liquor aisle - mostly just “no” is what still goes through my mind. But this time there was more of that itch. As I went through the altercation that happened at the park over and over again I felt shame for my behavior, embarrassed, and proud all at the same time. I felt like I had stood up for my family and been what they needed but I didn’t want the feelings that coincided.

I didn’t buy alcohol at the store to numb those feelings. I went home, made dinner, and put on a Sunday night movie my wife has been wanting to watch for a while.

But those feelings didn’t go away. We (wife and I) talked over the events that happened and we were there for each other. I had drinking dreams last night that were pretty normal. For all of you that are new to being sober mine are less frequent but still suck. I suppose I’ve gotten more accustomed to them and don’t wake up in panic anymore. Anyways the dream was rather insignificant - just that I was sneaking around taking shots when people weren’t watching and hiding airplane shooters in my pockets for later.

All in all I’m up writing this huge wall of text to hold myself accountable to not putting my sobriety first. I haven’t gone to meetings of late and I haven’t checked in with my sober circle in a long time. I felt isolated when the event happened and realized that I have in fact isolated myself in my recovery. I’m gonna reach out to my friend/ old sponsor to connect and I’m going to go to a meeting. 

I hope this helps someone else in their sobriety. I spent a lot of time trusting my better senses and inner voice telling me what to do to get sober. I REALLY wanted to be done with my cycle of abuse. My inner voice is always telling me what I can do to do what is right. It’s a much easier life living the “right “ way vs the easy way. 

I’m Hopefully going to get some sleep tonight. I worry about my dog becoming aggressive because she watched me yell at a man. I worry that I became a side of me that I can’t control when it’s unleashed, I worry.

Tl/DR : At the dog park a man hit my dog with a stick because he thought my puppy was too aggressive with his puppy. Wife yelled at him, he yelled at my wife, I yelled at him and scared him. I’m feeling torn emotions about the whole thing as I felt out of control when I was yelling at him and it’s leading me to have feelings that are uncomfortable in which I used to repress with alcohol. I’m reaching out to sober circle and attending a meeting to help me get centered.",14,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.40165818}"

I've maintained an active lifestyle throughout, which I don't think would be possible with alcohol in my life. It's taken these 100 days to realise that alcohol kills momentum in any endeavour. The relative stability not drinking provides means that even after illness or injury, your motivation remains relatively consistent. 

My mental health has also greatly improved. I used to drink in order to make it through any time where I had to interact with people. That gradual descent into depression that regular drinking enables means that it becomes almost a necessity to be able to hold a conversation with someone. Whilst the progression is slow, one thing I have noticed is that my baseline has greatly improved and become more stable. I actually enjoy talking to people sober again and don't feel like alcohol would add anything to the situation. It's a nice feeling. I liken it to how cigarettes only have a relaxing effect on people who are already addicted. Kick the addiction, and it no longer has that effect of bringing you back to a functional state of mind. 

I went on a date yesterday. Totally sober. It was great.

In my personal life and that in others whom I have assisted in ceasing daily consumption of alcohol, the one constant trigger that shows up is boredom. Sure, your alcoholism might be chained to emotional trauma or general anxieties, or partying just became a habit for you, but if you strip it down: boredom is when these uneasy emotions get freedom to surface. 

For those who have just quit or are planning to quit, plan out a packed schedule and prepare new non-toxic vices, whether it be exercise, sports, gaming, reading, watching movies, learning new courses etc. Anything that keeps your mind occupied is key in the beginning. All the relapses I have witnessed have occurred, not when someone was under intense emotional pressure, but when they were merely sitting alone with nothing to do one day, started ruminating over negativities and decided to quench that annoying whisper with ""just one beer"" which then turned into a binge. Those who stay preoccupied until late in the evening have more will power to resist. Few even feel the urge at 11 pm to pick up the bottle, as they are going to sleep soon anyway, so ""what's the point?""

And rather than spend the weekend bingeing on alcohol, I spent it instead bingeing Prof. David Nutt's book ""Drink? The New Science of Alcohol and Your Health"". It's incredible how much ignorance I've had towards alcohol over the years, and how most of my drinking has been so mindless and done in ignorance.

I thought I'd share my review of the book, but would highly recommend to read it in full too!

Review:

*Drawing on research conducted over the recent decades, Prof. Nutt is a leading ICL scientist in this area and presents us (in admittedly a dry account) with all the known science of alcohol to date. I believe something like this should be required reading for all who intend to drink alcohol.*

*We all are aware of some the dangers of alcohol, from short-term ones such as alcohol poisoning to the longer term ones like liver cirrhosis. But we learn here about all the other impacts alcohol has too, from  alcohol’s effects on our brain’s neurotransmitters, our hormones, mental health, cancer risks, sleep quality and quantity, other physical health effects, economics, politics, and more.*

*I am particularly amused by the effects alcohol has on our sex hormones. Drinking appears to be something that in our society is part of the “lad culture”. Yet alcohol has been shown to reduce levels of testosterone whilst increasing levels of oestrogen. So much so that if you drink enough, a man can become feminised, developing male breasts, losing muscle mass and facial hair, and seeing reductions in sperm count. Alcohol makes a man less of a man, not more. The irony!*

*So, is there a safe limit of alcohol consumption? Yes, there is. The science shows that one glass of wine, per year, is the safest limit. I shall (not) drink to that!*

*Technically, my last drink was a year ago yesterday, but I was still drunk the next day (a year ago today), so take that as you will. 

At first, I was not ready to get sober for myself. My motivators were my daughter, who was then 14-months old, and my husband who deserved a MUCH better wife than me at the time. I also take a lot of pride in my job, so being blacked out at a work function was very embarrassing and shitty of me.

First, I cut off a ton of my hair (normal in a crisis, right?) and got my ass into therapy. I stayed consistent with weekly sessions for six months and it was the most difficult, yet profound experience of my life. 

When I managed to get three-ish months sober, I found out we were pregnant with our second daughter. She was born last month and is absolutely perfect. 

Even though 9 months of these 365 days I was pregnant, I’m still proud of how far I’ve come and the work I’ve put in (IDing triggers, consciously switching to seltzer water and pomegranate juice in triggering times, reading This Naked Mind, etc.). I’m so happy our oldest daughter will have no memory of me as a drinker and that our second won’t know me drunk at all. 

Of course, the hard work doesn’t end here. Like I did in those first three months, I’ll be consciously deciding not to drink every minute, every day from here on out for my own health (not because I’m carrying a baby). I will continue to show up for myself and my family every day and be the best version of me.

During this year, I’ve learned that I’m extremely introverted. I love to read and cook and am perfectly fine not seeing friends in person for months on end. We’ve kept our close circle to strictly parents and siblings, which is all the social interaction I need.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning everyone!! Thank you for all your posts yesterday; I did read them all but I didn’t have time to respond to many, so this is my inadequate gratitude!

Alright jumping right into today’s topic; a popular one with a twist: the idea we all know and love of “playing the tape forward.”

If you’re new here, this means using your imagination to picture how the day/night would play out if you decided to drink. Usually this is used as a helpful tool to dissuade us from drinking during times of temptation. 

However, I’ve more recently used it in a different way (I apologize if someone else has already mentioned this, I promise I’m not trying to steal your ideas!); I love to play the tape forward as more of a reward for not drinking. 

For example, if I have a great night with my family and girlfriend, and I’m lying in bed thinking about how happy I am, I enjoy playing the tape forward to see how the alternate experience would be; I revel in the stark difference between the two and fall asleep thinking about how lucky I am to be on the better side of reality. 

I invite you to start playing the tape forward, not just to prevent yourself from slipping, but to remind yourself how much better things are playing out, whether you’re on day 1 or 1000.

First time in a long time.
Don't know why: probably something mundane like how bright the moon is tonight, or that I ate a large lunch and a really light dinner, or something.
But sometimes it feels more neurotic than that.

I was catching myself thinking about beer and missing it, and then I became agitated over my impulsively positive feelings. I keep thinking I've 'finally' overcome and reprocessed those. :)

And yet.

I guess that's one part of addiction: oscillating between easy, hopeful and even complacent recovery, and pacing near ancient neural pathways in search of urgent relief.



It's been almost a year.
I count it that way, myself. My badge says otherwise. I had a few beers in August and got worried and reset my badge as a recommitment to myself.

First, I had a drink while camping in the desert. Honest to God, my first drink since late February 2020; I was feeling proud of myself. Then, a week later, I had a couple drinks near the river. A week and a half later, a few beers, on a rare trip out of quarantine to see some old friends. I felt so guilty about what was becoming a pattern, I reset my badge the next day, wrote my thoughts here to revive my recommitment, and I talked with my supportive partner about it, one of the few people I've reached out to about my sobriety. But still, now. I think of it as almost a year.

I had a drink on (the US) election night. I'm guessing that I wasn't alone that night, and I've given myself some self-care about it. My thought was, well, forgiveness builds a much kinder, safer path than regret: a path I can be much happier walking. A path I can rest on. A path I'm likely to walk a lot further down.

I guess I just want to normalize relapsing in recovery, where streaks are such prevalent and useful tools. I guess I just want to encourage giving yourself kindness, especially when it's hardest to give.

So that's where I am in recovery.
I still haven't had a drink since November, and I've been committed to quitting forever for about a year.

...

But nights like tonight? Anxious and sleepless in bed?

Sometimes I think it's more the hell I've already lived than the heaven I'm trying to live in that keeps me sober.

The next night was a lot better becuase everyone started drinking heavily for the whole day on the mountain and got wiped out.

The third night: Pure anxiety hell.

We walked back to the air bnb and that's when I wanted to crawl in a hole. The drunk angry boyfriend cranked up the radio and a dance party emerged. I'm not much of a dancer when drinking and non existent in my current state. I snuck away took a shower and bought an early flight home. I'm leaving early in the morning and I'll just leave an apology in note form in the countertop.

and my memory is absorbing my surroundings again. I hated feeling like my head was trapped in a thick haze or my thoughts were imploding.

Even on the hard days deja vu will hit me, and I love it then too because its important to feel those thoughts sober, those feelings that make you wanna pop into the bar for quick one or six. Sitting with those feelings, twiddling your thumbs and not letting those thoughts wear you down is the pits but thats what the real accomplishment is. Sometimes I just need a reminder to keep it up.

Then he moved in with his new lady, T. T drinks. P started drinking with T. He seemed to have his life together and could drink socially again. Turns out she drinks a lot more heavily than we thought, plus mixes booze and benzos. I saw her on a bender two years ago and she was completely incoherent for my entire 3 day visit, which she has very little memory of. 

After many conversations and fights about my dislike for T's behavior (and frankly, for her; I directly said ""I'm not her biggest fan"" and he took that very hard), P ignored me for 6 months. Wouldn't answer my calls or texts. In November, I learn from our other brother that P has been on a huge bender, hit his head, and is flying out to sober up at our brother's house for awhile. I sent $1000 to help cover the costs. P now talks to me and says he's sorry for the six months of shutting me out. Gets sober and flies home.

January, he's back in the ER. Assault charges from pushing past T when she was trying to keep him home and safe. T calls me to apologize for causing a fight between me and P (she is shitfaced during this phone call, btw). Then he's out and he's OK. February, back in the hospital. Panicked texts from T. Then he's fine again, and that's where we are now.

P has partial custody of his 10 year old son, who has (according to P) not been there for any of P's episodes, but has seen T incoherent for days at a time. I worry about the kid a lot, seeing his father and stepmother figure both dance the toxic tango. T calls in sick for P on days when he's too drunk to work. She calls P's ex wife on weekends he's too drunk to take their kid. She shields him from every consequence and enables his behavior. He does the same for her. It's classic addict codependency.

I don't know what to do. I feel horrible for saying this, but I'm getting really tired of the cycle and I'm not sure how many times I'm going to have to answer the old ""should I call him an ambulance? What do I do?"" text brigade from T. I don't think it's possible for P to get sober while T is still drinking. Frankly, I doubt it's possible for either of them to get sober while still in this relationship. I do want to help my brother, but ultimately, it's him and not me who has to do the work and make the hard decisions. 

I have quit drinking in solidarity with him. Never had a problem with alcohol myself, but I do enjoy some cocktails and occasional silliness. No more. I've shared my decision to quit drinking with him. I call at least once a week to check in (although things change very quickly; this last time, we talked perfectly normally on Saturday afternoon and he was gone by Monday morning.

I am afraid he's going to die. If not directly of alcohol poisoning (his benders are scarily intense) then of liver failure (which is an awful way to go). I want my brother alive. I want him sober. I want to help, but I don't know how. Any advice is appreciated, and I'm sorry for anything I said that sounded mean or callous. I'm just real tired",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.60224545}"

But I'm home now, sober. I'm thinking about all the reasons why we broke up. My drinking was definitely a big part of it. Honesty I can't believe she put up with my drunk ass for two years. I don't want to be that type of person for my next partner. I want to be a sober present loving man who doesn't forget import conversations because he was drunk or who can't be responsible because he's drunk.

Still laying in bed hungover miserable wallowing in self pity .It makes me so upset that we live in a society that promotes alcohol as a coping mechanism.

I have a somewhat stressful job in health care and my normal habit is to come home, make drinks with my husband,  and go outside to throw the ball for the dog.  We have a couple of drinks, stay outside about 30 minutes, then come inside and make dinner.

Only my couple of drinks slowly turned into three or four very strong drinks.  Like, 8 or 10 oz of vodka within 30 minutes, mixed with soda.  Then more while cooking.  Many, many nights I have blacked out, burned myself, dropped things, or wandered off to bed with the stove still on.  Or skipped supper, kept drinking, started a fight, threw up, you name it.  

Valentine's night I blacked out and ruined a nice lobster dinner my husband spent a lot of time on.  I realized when I woke up stinking and ashamed at 3am that I had to stop for good, and I've been sober since.

Mornings, of course, are great.  But I am really, really struggling through ""happy hour.""

How my life has changed:

1. Bought a house. Honestly don't know if I would have had the stamina to do this if I was still hungover all the time. 

2. Started investing in shares. What? I know. Cause I'm not drunk all the time I have energy to read and learn about the market. 

3. Started a course to learn how to regulate emotions.

4. Way more productive at work.

5. Freezing my eggs! Again, being drunk and chainsmoking would have made it much less likely to have healthy eggs. I am on round 2 and hoping to maybe add a little one to my life in a couple of years (already have a son who is 2). 

6. My son has not tipped out my red wine once. Ashamed to say 6 months ago this happened a fair few times - he would knock it off tables etc. 

Things that still require work:

7. I have a bit of an addiction 'whack a mole' thing happening so my diet has been pretty bad but I will fix that!

8. I am also a bit too addictive and driven about work which feels a little like an addictive behaviour.

Dark side:

9.  There's been a bit of grappling with my emotional outbursts in the past and a bit of shame etc etc. But the only way out of it is through it! I'm tackling it all head on.

How I did it:

I just white knuckled it, read this forum, read a few books. I just had had enough. No AA. Not for me but know that it is amazing for others. 

My goal is to stop drinking until I am 50 years old. I am 38 now. I can't do 'forever' as a concept. I feel like if I get to 50 I may not take it back up but if I say forever, I will drink.

I hate my parents, with all my heart. I hate people who abused, used and raped me, I hate people who seem to be unaware of how ugly life really is - for a lot of people. 

I hate that we give the attention to those who have the ""inspiring"" answers that provide no answers. To those who either never tasted the ugliness of the world, or came up on top so they don't cause any unpleasant feelings in privileged minority who feels uncomfortable hearing about sh#t.

The thing is, this hatred for the abusers, for silencing those who speak truth you can't work out to, for the unaware, blissfully ignorant bling bling speakers talking in round vowels (including this sub - I've heard I'm ""making excuses"" when trying to address the early sobriety issues I experience, and then a mod took down my post under the ""you were drinking"" reason which I didn't and I don't know where it came from) - All of it is eating me alive. 

Alcohol is not the answer, but if you're in this with me, neither is sobriety. It takes a huge deal of willpower and work to weed out the need for revenge and the hatred and anger that sprouts from it. I can barely hold a normal conversation these days. 

But - it's easier to do when I'm not drinking. Alcohol can numb you, but it will numb you to both good and bad. And while the bad makes me wanna bite walls, the good can still surprise me. I get yoga, meditation. I try to rebuild my sense of self on something else than disdain, disgust and disappointment, despite having reasons to be that way. 

And it's hard. I'm feeling like I'm betraying myself. Like I haven't repaid the fu#kers who hurt me yet, and I'm gonna just let them go about their business? 

Well - sometimes it's the way it is. It's either that or become a living, walking black hole with suicide as the only option. 

It's a rant, I know. But it's hard. It's way harder to just ""go sober"" when the reality has crushed you over and over. It's not that you gotta clear your heart and try again. You don't HAVE to do anything. But if you don't, you will suffer - with or without the drink.",14,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.91136694}"

The nice thing about going to different types of meetings is that I don’t feel that I need to make any decisions about following a rigid path. I hear words of wisdom in many respects, and I feel comfortable just ruminating on things without feeling a desire to accept or reject any particular suggestion.

I like how SMART doesn’t feel the need to label a person, and how it uses REBT techniques to help a person feel empowered. I also like how AA gives me the sense that I can surrender my “shoulds” and think, “wow, I really could use others’ help with this thing.” I liked how the LifeRing meeting I went to was small enough that people could really go back and forth and take some time with a person’s issue or thoughts.

I saw my doctor In October and he checked my liver, which was fine. I told him my whole story and he didn’t seem concerned about my drinking other than that I wanted to quit. I was very honest but he wasn’t worried about liver damage etc. 

I was doing so good and had about 6 months sober then I slipped on NYE. Drank for a few days then on and off drinking weekends, not during the week. Was doing Good again then Friday went on a date and had two margaritas, and the following day of course ended up drinking 4 beers and half a fifth of whiskey Friday, making a fool of myself in front of a friend at dinner. 

I’m probably partially panicking but yesterday I was feeling fine, a little hungover - have had worse. But today I’m really hurting and my liver area is really bothering me. Idk. I feel hot and sick.

So since I have quit drinking I am starting to realize my drinking friends were just drinking friends.

They would also put me down and intentionally say shit and jabs at me cause they thought it was funny. If I said I didn't like that or kind of snapped back they would be like ""whoa dude its  joke not a dick don't take it"". 

I wanted friends because I didn't want to be alone, insecure, and drunk so I would brush it off. Now that I think about it though it makes me angry. At them and at myself. I am starting to figure out my self worth through sobriety and I don't understand why I let people do that to me. I also don't understand why I went out of my way to be nice to people that didn't treat me well back.

Just looking for some help or kind words or something to get my mind off this. I'm so mad at myself and I am mad at them too but it's not worth it. 

TL;DR - Drinking numbed me to the way ""friends"" treated me. I'm angry at them and myself. I want to let it go but I need help with it or advice

At best, maybe 4 beers a night, at worst, a litre of vodka (very rarely)and everything inbetween. i'm a musician, so the touring basically comes with drinking, and I think I took that mentality into normal life. I'm currently writing this with a fractured hip after a horrid argument with my partner (not even sure if she is or not. she's been too good to me, and says she won't meet me until im tee total, but i'm not doing it for her) and an unfortunate trip over a guitar cable after a 5th of scotch. I went to the hospital, assuming I would be in for a week or so. Being fairly self aware, I mentioned my addiction so they helped me along, I went maybe 4 or 5 days with no issue. I self discharged because I'm a very claustrophobic person, strangely not because of the drink. What i've learnt from the last lockdown, is that 1. Im not essentially physically dependant. I freak out if there's no booze in the house. If there is, I can take it or leave it (although that's a struggle). It's 90 percent psychological if I have the guts to get the right meds. 2. Looking back, drinking has never made me achieve anything. Maybe the creative juices flow after one beer but after that it becomes shit. 3. I stand to lose a lot, i.e shaking too bad to play a guitar (i've been there before, broke my heart). 4. I use it as a plaster on an axe wound. any excuse. something good happens, i celebrate, something bad happens, i console myself with it. it isn;t my friend. I love it, but it doesn't like me. 5. Health wise, I am beyond lucky. My last blood test came back with slightly high liver count, but the doctor said that is easy to pull back if I behave. But I'm under no impression that will last if I carry on. I'm definetely on thin ice.

Not to mention the embarrassment, random injuries, self denial, lashing out at people that in hindsight clearly knew better than me, missed opportunities, burnt bridges, ridicule, being ""that guy, how is he playing tonight after the state he was in this afternoon"", the raised eyebrows everytime I open a beer before 5 o clock etc etc etc.

My point is, is that i'm scared, but going on anectodal evidence ALL from other guitarists. why is that?, it wil be the best decision I could make. I don't want to be one of those jaundiced ex musicians in a pub telling war stories to younger musicians. I don't want to be a cautionary tale. My question is what to do next in terms of getting over the psycholocigal side of things, whilst at the same time safely quitting without dealing with a fractured hip at the same time. Any help would be appreciated.

Since COVID hit, I've really struggled with depression and alcohol. My partner doesn't really drink and so she doesn't seem to understand why I can't just stop if I want to stop (and believe me I have been trying). 

She's more the type to ignore a problem or distract herself until it goes away. But I need her truly be a partner and a support for me in my recovery, since I really don't interact with many other people in person since COVID. Isolation fuels my dangerous drinking habits more than social situations.

If I am sober for an extended period of time, she doesn't acknowledge it, making me feel so worthless, when every effort I put in to stop drinking is ignored. And every time I slip up and relapse it's magnified and she ignores me even more.

I don't know how to bring this up to her without making it feel like I'm blaming her for my problem because it's not her fault I've become a lying, deceitful addict, but I know I need her to be more supportive.

**11th**: GF and I have plans, she ghosts me this evening for some reason.

**12th**: Still no communication from GF. We were chatting for literally hours daily over facetime for nearly 3 months, up until this abrupt radio silence.

**13th**: My valentines day plans are wasted. GF is sick it seems, hence ghosting me. Feel lonely. Go out that night. I get a DWI.

**14th**: Day 1 sober, hire lawyer, still no word from GF other than 1 or two sentence texts. Spend all day angry and wallowing and severely depressed.

**15th**-16th: Work keeps me distracted. Feeling ok. Still no reliable word from GF. Starting to feel suspicious. 

**17th**: Work has a policy for getting arrested. Decide to report my DWI as if they found out without me saying something I'd for SURE get fired, if I follow policy maybe I can keep it (I don't drive for them or need a clearance, so it shouldn't matter really). Immediately get suspended without pay, pending investigation.

**18th**: Unwanted day off. Use PTO so I get paid. Stuck in my head all day. Bracing for the inevitable with GF.

**19th: Morning** - investigation still ongoing, still no word from GF. Another PTO day off. Stuck in my head again. FULL of anxiety, my number 1 trigger. 

**19th: Evening** - Get a call that I can resume work on Tuesday; Monday I have some reports to file and ""talks"" to have. Get ""the text"" from GF -- she doesn't have time for her job, he kids, and me anymore. Didn't even get to tell her about the DWI, so this would have happened regardless. I get it, but man... we were together for 3 months. I REALLY liked her. Let my walls down and get close and vulnerable. Why now out of the blue? The whole time I was patient, understanding, willing to help out and work around her schedule. Anxiety is gone at least, replaced by a renewed depression and hopelessness/loneliness. Huzzah. Walls going back up. Tall, thick, strong walls. Hardwon Surefoot would be proud (char from a podcast).

**20th - Today**: Spent all day each day on the couch playing PS4 since the 18th. Beat the game though. Temp license is expired. And so it begins. Still sober, but fuck everything right now.

This next week... I sure hope it's more normal. I can't handle many more surprises, and honestly I don't really have anything left aside from my job/home. It's still something at least. But at this point I'm assuming the only reason I can work on Tuesday is so they can fire me on-the-clock. That's where my heads at. I mean, I've struggled with depression my whole life, but this is the worst it has been in a long time. Even more so than my divorce last year (which triggered me drinking again).

I’ve never been a super religious guy, but I do believe in a higher power. I have an intense sponsor and sometimes it’s difficult, but I’m not going to quit. I’m going to finish the steps, mainly to see what it’s like on the other side of them and then reevaluate.

He met me right where I was, and said, “Please don’t. You will regret doing it.” His words struck me to my core, but I still couldn’t stop thinking about it. He rode to the store with me as an act of support. Ultimately, I bought what we needed and got the hell out of the store. I still craved that buzz, though.

Hours later, I realized how right my husband was. I have been able to make the choice to not drink every day for over 100 days. I don’t like to talk about it with others because I want to do it on my own, and it’s hard to share the journey with others who aren’t going through the same thing.

I've plumbed the depths of old posts for hours, gained great insights, found relatable stories, and gathered strength from this amazing community. 

Looking for similar experiences... Has anyone experienced burning hands and feet due to drinking? I had been an every other day binger for a decade. Last year started to get the old pins/needles/numbness. Neurologist did all the blood work MRIs, EMG, etc and found nothing. Symptoms progress to muscle twitching, and finally burning in my hands and feet. I've suggested alcoholic neuropathy to my neurologist, but they dismissed it since ""I wasn't drinking a fifth a day"". Neurologist spent a good 6 months trying to convince me it was all anxiety related (never had anxiety). Finally a skin biopsy revealed small fiber neuropathy. My neurologist isn't exactly Doogie Howser...

Just looking to see if anyone has experienced similar feelings. I obviously can't conclusively tie it to drinking, but it fits. 

I did dry January and haven't had a drop since.  My symptoms haven't improved, but I know it can take a long time to see improvements, if any can he had.  Going dry was a shit ton harder than I thought it'd be, but again I can attribute my success in large part due to this community.

My dad turned 50 on January 23rd and I got to thinking about it. I want to be around for my 50th birthday. My grandpa died at the age of 42 from alcoholism. It is difficult for me to imagine someone drinking as much as I did, and I have no idea how much he used to drink, but it was enough to kill him. I'm certain I inherited alcoholism from him. Did I drink more than my grandpa? If I continued, would I even have made it to 42? Probably. Surely he drank more than a third of a bottle of whiskey a day to kill him.

Starting in 2009, I would drink casually. At parties. Went to school, got good grades, got my degree. In 2013 when I was on my own, I got a job, started having a six pack a night. Eventually it wasn't enough so I started buying the tall boy six packs (8 standard drinks per night).

And then that wasn't enough. I still had an 8-5 so I would crush 12 beers between getting home and going to bed. Wake up, hungover, but still work, get the job done.

Then I got transferred to another company that was strictly work from home.

It got worse. 12 at night became a 12 pack starting when I woke up. Sometimes I'd run out before 5pm and leave to go get another 12 pack.

Then I started buying 18 packs. Between 12-18 drinks a day. Then 24 packs. Pretty much a new 24 pack every other day.

It's a miracle my weight never went over 185.

Over the last few months, I've been sort of weaning myself, although much of it was a lie to please my boyfriend. I tapered down to 5 drinks per day, as far as he knew - he never knew about the whiskey bottles I hid in my dresser to chug whenever he was showering or walking the dog. I had constant alcohol withdrawals. Could never sleep. Woke up freezing cold, sweating, shaking, red in the face with pale clammy skin, every morning without fail.

Started counseling. Didn't help much. Quit a few weeks ago.

And then on my dad's 50th, I had exactly one month left til my 30th. That day, I thought about it. No time like the present, eh? What better birthday present could I give myself on my 30th birthday than to be able to say I was one month sober and started my 30s as a nonalcoholic? (I know I will always be an alcoholic - it's my curse - but that doesn't mean I have to drink).

So, on Tuesday, I turn 30. And it will also mark one month without alcohol. One month without cigarettes.

Has it gotten any easier? Physically, I suppose. I don't wake up hungover/withdrawing. No more nights laying in bed tossing and turning for 8 hours completely unable to sleep. No more days laying in bed unable to move. Mentally, no, not really. I want alcohol. I want a cigarette. 

Maybe someday I will be able to have a glass of wine with dinner or a beer with a buddy without losing control of every part of my being except the ""pursue and consume alcohol"" monster in my brain. But, for now, I've got something to stick to. 

The 20s is for figuring shit out. The 30s is to get it together using what you learned in the 20s. I learned I'm an alcoholic. And it is very bad.

I know I sound gloomy but that's just the 12 year habit speaking.

I'm Qorr Sozin, I'll be 30 in two days, I've lost 3 pounds in 28 days having changed nothing but alcohol consumption, and I haven't had a drink or smoke in almost a month, and I will keep this going as long as I can.

But when I do, I don't like to stop at one drink. I invariably have 4 or 5. Maybe that's not a crazy amount, but it's too much for me. It's a little binge-y. I always feel physically awful. Then, a week or two later, I do it again.

I tend to look at times I choose to drink as ""exciting"" or ""special,"" like for a party or event. I might look at the calendar and choose a day, for an event like the Super Bowl or just to give myself a little party on a random Friday night. I am careful to space it out and not do it too often. 

But when I actually do the drinking, I don't really enjoy it after an early and transitory buzz - which is, to my understanding, a temporary dopamine boost. So why not stop at one drink? I just don't. It would make more sense to have one drink a night, but I don't even entertain that option because I know I won't have just one. So I plan and make sure this is a maybe twice per month thing for me as a control measure. 

I want to leave behind the fantasy that drinking is fun and exciting and special and be more accurate and honest. It's none of those things for me in reality. It makes me feel gross. And I know that alcohol is literally a toxin to my brain and body. 

Why tf would I continue with it in any form?

So I have decided to transition to life as a non-drinker. I am posting this to mark this day for me. I don't know if people here can relate to what I'm saying. But it's okay if not. I need to get out of this dynamic for myself.

I've come to the realization that I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. 

I've been drinking since I've been about 15 and ever since then its been a regular part of my life. Mostly on weekends through high-school, but that slowly evolved into drinking a few beers every night, and getting as close to black out as I could on the weekends.  I told myself a few months ago that I was going to stop drinking for a month just to prove to myself that I could. Hell I quit smoking for the same reason, I didn't want to be controlled by something. 

I knew at the time I was drinking too much and my state of near constant panic and paranoia (unless I was drinking) probably wasn't coming out of the blue and that I needed to quit for a while. I was successful for 23 days, and I felt awesome! Thought I'd stay sober for as long as i could, then my Ex and I split up.. 

A few of my friends went out for dinner to try and cheer me up and I told myself I was going to make it to the 30 days sober, no questions asked. That didnt last long and i got hammered. It started slowly at first and I told myself I wouldnt go back to the way I was before, but a few beers on the weekend, changed to a few beers every night, then to a pint of rum every night. I think I may have gone 4 days sober at one point which was cool. I feel like I was slipping right back into that pattern, if not worse.

Just like the first time, I don't want to lose that idea of myself, the guy who loved to get drunk and socialize and party. I had to stop hanging out with the people who I used to surround myself as much as they are all heavy drinkers, and I began to feel isolated (especially with covid restrictions) but I stayed strong and knew that there was hope being sober. 

I want to feel confident again, I want to stay organized, I want to feel free again. I want to STAY sober this time. As of 3 days ago,  I'm making that commitment no matter what happens.

It’s been sort of numbing this time around - like I’m going through the motions. But, maybe this blasé ride is the one I needed to hop on to realize my true potential here. 

I got some quick thoughts last night that flashed images of the wine section at the grocery store in my mind. So I asked my SO to come with me to the market and I bought two kombuchas and a pack of strawberry Bublys. I popped the kombucha as soon as I got home and the thoughts of a drink were gone (god I love those for that).

I went to bed proud of myself and I woke up thankful. I think it’s because this is the clearest I’ve felt in 6 months or so. Looking out the window isn’t reminding me of the confinement and boredom I feel while working from home, drinking and miserable, in this very spot I’m sitting. But the views look crisp and clean and I realize how fortunate I am to be doing this. 

Not everyone wants to quit or ever realizes that they need to quit, but here we all are you guys. For me, that’s the huge first step and we’ve all done that much.

One of them was hearing me drunk-fall down the stairs late at night.  I mostly drank while playing computer games in my office on the 2nd floor but the beer was in the basement.  This meant that 2 flights of stairs were traversed many times on most evenings.  Often it was just a small slip, but occasionally as the evening wore on I would tumble down half a flight of stairs.  Sometimes I would wake up the next morning with bruises I couldn't quite remember how I got.

Not that long ago I fell down while trying to hide the quantity of my nights consumption by taking the recycling out before passing out.  I fell on the porch outside, loudly smashing a bin full of beer bottles for the whole neighborhood to enjoy at 1:00am.

But I'm definitely there now (it started yesterday on Day 7.) I even remarked to my husband how wonderful and peaceful I feel. It compelled me to Google, and I found out about the Pink Cloud.

I’ve dealt with a lot of loss over the last three years-my childhood home was sold, I lost my father to cancer, my mom and I discovered her live-in boyfriend dead one morning, a couple bad relationships, etc. I turned to alcohol to cope. A couple of weeks ago, my grandmother passed away (whom I have always been close with, and have lived with for the last year and a half), and without realizing how much of a trigger it was I descended into an insane spiral of drinking. My go-to beverage is Jameson-usually a pint (maybe a few shooters of it thrown in as well), but I don’t usually go more than that. Over the last week I cannot myself even fathom how many liter bottles I went through. Been working from home since March, and there have been days of drinking on the job or being supremely hungover from the night before. On Wednesday, I got so messed up that I passed out in the afternoon while working and came to at 8:30 PM. My boss sent me a text very early on Thursday morning saying how much he cares for me and always will have my back but that what happened was unacceptable, and I was suspended without pay for the rest of the week. I should mention that I had gotten a DUI almost 2 years ago, and that he knew about it and was very kind and understanding about it. Anyway. That fueled me drinking so I drank on Thursday as well-so much so that I was still drunk on Friday and spent the whole day sobering up. I called god knows how many different friends and cried to them. And I finally, for the very first time ever, admitted that I have a problem. Yes, I had thought it and had known it deep down, but somehow saying it aloud to others is such a different experience. I had had wake up calls similar in the past, but this has been a new low. I nearly lost my job, and I’ve also lost two of my very best and oldest friends recently because of drinking. 

I’m so ashamed even because of this very brief summation of what my behavior was, but I know that I can no longer do this. I cannot do it to my loved ones, to random strangers I meet, and I especially can’t do it to myself any longer. I know a large portion of my problem is, not only all of the loss, but the fact that I almost cannot deal with what it means to grow up. Being an adult is so very difficult, but being alive is so very beautiful. I don’t want to die early-not only from drinking itself but also from the bad situations I’ve put myself into while drinking-especially as a young, somewhat attractive, girl. No. I’m ready for this. I’m ready to own my actions, and I’m already reaching out to friends who I know are also recovering themselves for advice and for strength.

So for the past three weeks since I got my new truck I've been traveling down to my hometown to work on the old house in which I grew up.  The house is old and run down.  Drafty and cold and in need of a lot of work.  First and foremost it needs to be cleaned out of all the stuff that is in it.  All of it!!!  I haven't started on that stuff yet.  I've been going there and doing small things to make it look ""lived in"" since there is no one occupying it.  So this week, I replaced the bulbs in the back of the house and installed a front porch light both with light sensors so they automatically turn on at dusk.

Little by little I will get there.  Like chipping away on a huge task.  

My nephew Joseph joined me.  We've always enjoyed each other's company.  He's different than I am, but he likes to hang out with me.  He likes to learn about what I know and asks a lot of questions.  He's a very good, decent young man.  He wants to know every time I come down to work on the old house so he can assist me.  I find it incredibly heart warming that he wants to do this.

And to be honest.....I think I needed this.

Hope all is well.

I always wonder about this.  I was a ""normal drinker"" until I wasn't.  In other words, I drank only for social occasions and not at home.  Then I drank at home.  Then I drank every night.  Then I started resenting anything that took me away from drinking hours.  Then I would look forward to getting home from anywhere so I could have that glass of wine (and three more).  Then travel became all about the airport lounge, making sure I had long connection times in the airport for drinking time, the wine with corporate dinner.  Watching the waiter to make sure he saw my glass was getting low.  Planning events around drinking.

I have no alcoholism in my family.  My family could all be viewed as ""normal drinkers"" (and I think from the outside, I was seen that way too).  My parents drank on social occasions but by the end of their lives, neither drank at all.  I have no DUIs, no missed work, no embarrassing moments in public.  But it was gradually taking over my life.  As I read books like Alcohol Explained and learn what alcohol really does to a body/brain, I wonder about the truly addictive nature of alcohol for everyone, despite background and circumstances.

So my question--is there any such thing as a ""normal"" drinker, or are all drinkers at risk of immersion at some point depending on circumstances?  If you pour enough alcohol down someone's throat, will they all head down the same road?  With society pounding home the wonders and the fun of drinking, are ""normal drinkers"" becoming fewer?  Things that make me go ""Hmmm.""

Packed up my doggos, sold my house, and moved to an entire new city. 

My drinking turned to a daily occurrence for obvious reasons. I got mad that he was still somehow controlling my life so I decided to cut down to weekends. Then I cut it all together. 

I made it two weeks. But....Like so many on here... I thought ""oh, I've been so good lately. I can definitely have just a couple"". A couple won't hurt, right??  Well, that was Friday, which led to Saturday drinking all day/night, which led to a lovely hangover this morning. 

Why do I expect it to be different? It's never one. It's insanity.  

I always thought, well I don't drink during the weeks anymore so I can't possibly be an alcoholic. I was using it as a crutch through a bad time, that's it. I have it under control now. I'm not addicted. But it's a deadly cycle and will eventually go back to daily drinking again. I'm done spending half my week (after drinking) struggling with terrible depression and anxiety...

I love the taste of craft beer, love visiting new breweries on vacation... love tasting new things.

To make it worse, since the pump was already primed this normally just  kicked off a day of making my way through a 12 pack of Bell’s Two Hearted.

NA craft beer has really helped with my cravings.  I was warned that drinking NA beer would lead to triggering me, but I feel that it’s done the opposite.  Now when I feel the urge to have a drink, I grab a NA IPA.    Instead of one beer turning in to 6-12, I maybe have 2 now.  I also find it easier to be in social settings with my ‘fake beer’ and not feel like I’m missing out.

I’ve known for years I had a problem but was able to keep it together for appearance purposes. It started as weekend binges in high school, day drinking and blackouts in college and besides quitting for my two pregnancies, I’ve been drinking heavily since then. I could drink 2 bottles of wine a night and not even feel it. People around me knew I liked to “have a good time,” but since I could function fine during the day, I don’t think anyone would believe I have a problem.  Definitely a functioning person with an alcohol problem and once I read “Mrs Dee does without it,” I realized, holy shit that’s me. I knew how badly I craved wine and what it was doing to me, but it wasn’t until I found this group that I realized I could overcome it. 

I have two school aged kids remote learning and wasn’t ready for meetings, so I’ve quietly been reading this forum for a year now and put the wine glass down for the last time on New Year’s Eve. My friends and think I’m doing a 90 day no booze challenge with a couple of friends, but I know I need to continue past that. 

Addiction runs in our family, and my Great Grandma was a founding member of an AA group in our hometown. When she passed, she was sober for 43 years and her funeral was full of friends that loved her that our family had never met. We knew who they were of course and now I can appreciate what they meant to her, because I have my r/stopdrinking Reddit group that helps me the same way. 

My husband told me last night he’s proud of me— he didn’t think I could do it since I “needed” my glass of wine to unwind every night after a long day. Now I enjoy tea and a hot bath instead and sleep so much better. I don’t snap at my kids (as much) and I am a more patient mother and wife.

I finally pulled the plug and stopped following them and the other bars. 

Kind of, sort of feels like saying goodbye to a friend. But, it's gotten harder than ever to stay sober now that the bars are open and the weather is crummy. Right before I hit 90 days last weekend, I got **so close** to caving and riding out the snow storm with an 8-hour day drinking binge at one of the most fabulous dive bars in Seattle. **So close.** I'm grateful I stayed sober and I know that I need to support myself by unfriending those friends.

I have been a heavy drinker for almost a decade now. For 5 years it was mostly a daily habit. I kept on lying to myself I could stop at any time, I am just chosing not to. I am 29 now and have experienced massive changes (just graduated university, doing a job hunt and moved back to my home country). 

I figured, after the ""christmas/NY party time"" period I just had enough. I started cutting down from almost every day to 2-3 times a week - not for the ""want"" but because I started experiencing massive anxiety on a day after. Soon enough anxiety became depression and I cut down even more. The other day, I had one beer and a shot and woke up in the most depressive spiral I have even been in and finally connected it with alcohol. 

Yesterday I went to a get-together with some friends and they were all indulging in heavy drinking and I didn't even want or feel compelled to participate.

Now to the strange part - I am still early into this process and I am really confused with what I am feeling. Sometimes I feel aimless, heavy and depressed and sometimes I feel lighter and better. It also feels like a lot of my negativity - guilt, shame, doing things in my life way too late (due to alcohol as well), sadness are starting to surface. I am not sure if this is due to cutting down, if it is normal and expected? If so, how to combat it? Also, how does one feel simoultaneously happy with the decision they have made but also feel all this negativity? 

I know I am just 3-4 days in, but with the massive cutbacks since early Jan I feel like I have been a part of this process a bit longer. I hope I am just not lying to myself. And I hope it gets better.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.48247707}"

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Even in ways that we might not realise at first; however anything you can literally think of in your life is improved without alcohol! 

Health- your sleep gets better, inducing more rounds of REM sleep which contributes to your overall mood and wellbeing. You will also be more likely to develop a consistent sleep schedule, no longer going on late night benders. This is crucial to getting good sleep as it tunes the body's circadian rhythm. Even the improvement of sleep alone is enough to quit drinking! Your muscles also become stronger when you are not consuming alcohol, as well as your skin, organs, brain and every other part of your body improving when you are not consuming a poison (who would've thought?). This carries over into improved self confidence & wellbeing,

Relationships- Due to you being fully present and aware of your emotions, feelings and thoughts without them being clouded by alcohol, you are able to communicate and express your emotions fully which leads to greater communication in your relationships. Alcohol is known to exaggerate your emotions even to the point of delusion, so being fully in control and aware of what you are saying and expressing is obviously key. 

Career- Yet again, due to the absence of poison from your life, your body grows stronger and fitter. This results in a fit and strong mind, which then results in a productive, for-filling and vibrant life. You gain back the energy and buoyancy that mankind was always supposed to have, and this allows you to work on your career, hobby or interest much better. You will also have so much more time without the long drinking sessions and subsequent hangovers, with alcohol sometimes taking ten days to leave your system. It's like you gain a second life.

Wellbeing- Most of all, once your brain has healed from alcohol (this could take days weeks, months) your brain starts to receive the natural and normal level of dopamine and serotonin it's supposed to; and this feels GREAT. The cognitive dissonance is also gone, and there is no guilt (although we should not feel guilty anyway- the fault is in the substance!). You truly start to feel the way we were designed to feel as humans. 

I have not even scratched the surface on the benefits of quitting alcohol, but I thought i'd share my realisations this morning in the hope that it could maybe dissuade someone from reaching for that drink today, or in days to come. I'd love to hear what benefits you guys have observed in your lives:) IWNDWYT.",6,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.82712907}"

Eight Whole Weeks. 56 Days.,"I honestly never thought I'd be able to quit alcohol. And I absolutely never thought I'd be able to do it without the help of weed as a crutch. But this is the longest I have gone with zero vices in my body and I genuinely am surprised I made it this far.

&nbsp;

I totally appreciate that 56 days is not a long time in the grand scheme of things, but it's a start. 56 days ago I was drinking at home alone and doing cocaine alone. I spilled a pint of water all over my brand new laptop by being drunk, something which never would have happened had I been sober. From that moment on I vowed not to carry on being drink dependent.

&nbsp;

Lockdown in London has been tough, and quitting drinking has made it even harder. But for anyone reading this and thinking of doing it, I promise you it gets easier with each passing day. And if you don't think you have it in you; if I can do it then you definitely can. Because...


1) I am Irish and kind of predisposed to having a drink, very much a cultural thing.


2) I have worked in music and then advertising my entire life; two industries built around regular alcohol consumption.

I check this subreddit regularly. Usually when people say 'oh it's such a wonderful community,' I take it with a pinch of salt because that saying is so overused. But I really believe it is true and meaningful in this case, r/stopdrinking is full of amazing people and I really appreciate each and every one of your stories and triumphs and failures and triumphs again.

I've no doubt I've still a lot of issues to work through, not going to pretend my life has suddenly became immensly better or that every problem has left but things at least seem bearable now.

Didn’t call out because of a hangover or still drunk the next day so I deserve to unwind.

Our friends were drinking, smoking, and eating edibles all day. The weed doesn’t bother me, I have zero interest as it gives me panic attacks. Hangovers do too, so I’m not sure why this is so hard for me.

We went to a park and walked for awhile, then went out to eat and of course they were ordering cocktails. I ordered a strawberry lemonade and honestly didn’t even crave the alcohol. Maybe it’s because my fiancé has been staying sober with me (we’ve had this issue before with me trying to quit and him not wanting any part of it and saying stuff like “that’s your problem, not mine”), or because I’m still feeling so much guilt, shame, and the freshness of my last brutal hangover from a bender last week is still fresh.

After work, my typical routine is to go to the liquor store and get a 3 pack of tall cans. Take em down, maybe eat or maybe go get another pack. 
Wake up feeling terrible. Take a long hot shower to try and sweat things out and attempt to be productive in my job. 
Then rinse and repeat. Everyday. 
Weekends I’d do the same thing only earlier in the day and no work... I dread weekends because I have little excuse not to drink. Crazy right. 
I have attempted to get sober before. Usually after a rock bottom event.
About 2 months ago, I managed to get 4 months of sobriety. Looking back, it was probably the best four months of my late 20s. I felt great, I was working out and had been in the best shape of my life. My relationships with friends and family were going better. I had the best sales quarter of my career and managed to get additional annual bonus. I felt “in control” of my life and really felt like everyday I was improving my life. I was excited for the next day.
Then I bought a bitching condo next to the beach. 
And the alcoholic brain really kicked into overdrive. “You should celebrate” “what a great drinking den” “just one night to celebrate, you’ve earned it”. 
I feel like I have a much better understanding now of why people say, don’t make any major changes (new job, move, new relationship, etc.) in the first year of sobriety. 
It was incredible how quickly I slipped back to my old ways. Within a week I was again drinking at least 6 beers daily. I’ve been doing that for two months. I’ve been reclusive. I’m not doing poorly at work but I know I could be doing sooo much better, my family is concerned, my friends are concerned. My body is quickly getting out of shape from all the hard work I had put in during those 4 months. The funniest thing, this condo right next to the beach - I hadn’t been to the beach once because I was either too drunk or felt too terrible to make the 0.5 mile walk. Until today. 
Last night I took down about 14 beers. I woke up took a shower and immediately went back to bed because I was so hungover. Woke up at 11 looked myself in the mirror and just laughed. 
I decided I won’t drink today... if I can just get through today, I can kick start the good habits again. 
At least 5 times since that thought this morning my alcoholic brain has tried to tell me why I should start that tomorrow and just have drinks today / tonight. 
I didn’t drink. I went to the beach (beautiful), I went for a bike ride, I read a few chapters in my book and watched 2 movies. 
I had a great day and I didn’t drink. 
I’m actually looking forward to tomorrow and looking in the mirror to laugh at myself and my alcoholic brain and say “ if I can just get through not drinking today, I’ll have a drink tomorrow”. Instead of “have a drink today and start sobriety tomorrow”.

I’m weighing back down in the 180s now at a reasonably healthy weight (still work to do).

As part of this process, I decided I was going to temporarily stop drinking to get down to my desired weight, and as a bonus I could reset my alcohol tolerance. No real desire to quit in the long term when I stopped, or even for the past several weeks. I’ve been a weekend binge drinker since college (typically minimal or no drinks during the weekdays followed by heavy consumption on Friday and/or Saturday - 12+ drinks on a given night easily). I could take a week off of drinking if I didn’t feel like it (rare), but pretty much never really saw an issue with my drinking even when I decided to stop earlier this year. I just knew it was a trigger for me to stop working out or eat excess calories so it would interfere with my weight loss - then my plan was to try and keep things a bit more moderate when I was happy with my progress.

I had a revelation this morning, going on a walk around this lake near me with some friends. It was weird but it was like my senses were overloaded with the good company and cold air I just felt so much joy. The whole experience honestly felt euphoric - and that’s when I had a revelation: “Why do I want to go back to drinking?”

A bit stupid to do on a day 5 when those are hard for me... but I went out with a friend who desperately wanted to meet up today and she asked me to go to a brewery (she wanted a drink). I’d already previously told her that I wasn’t drinking due to my new anxiety meds (not a complete lie - but the doctor said I can still have like 1-2 drinks and be fine while on it). 

I didn’t even fret today because I was so determined not to drink. I noticed that the place had sodas on tap and got a draft blood orange cream soda. It was super good. And who coulda guessed - I still had a good time. I could still carry a conversation. I could still laugh. 

Do I want to be in that setting again? Not for a while. But I was glad when I went I realized they had the draft soda option. I just hadn’t really been looking forward to going to meet her since I just didn’t want to be near it all. But I handled it.

2021-02-20 23:53:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lopcsk/a_year_sober/,A year sober.,"In March 2019, I visited Boston during St. Patrick’s Day weekend. I was so drunk the whole trip that I didn’t get to see anything I had planned. I was either drunk or hungover, and miserable in both states. I remember standing outside of my hotel, hungover beyond belief, smoking a cigarette, and hating myself. My last night there I threw up in the Uber, and crawled up to my hotel room and threw up the rest of the night. The next morning while waiting to leave for the airport, I made a post here announcing that I was going to quit drinking. You wrote to me and encouraged me. Some of you sent messages. It was the first step. Thank you r/stopdrinking.

It took nearly another year to actually get sober.

From the moment I knew I needed to quit drinking until the time I actually got sober was terrifying. It’s kind of like when your diet starts Monday, so you pig out over the weekend. Except I knew I needed to quit drinking, so I’d go hard on Fridays and Saturdays. During that time, I’d sometimes get wasted then go outside and run in the cold Chicago weather while listening to Goo Goo Dolls, “I want to get free... I know it’s out there.” I would cry because I didn’t know how to get free. I was surrounded by and lived with hard drinkers.

I don’t know what happened, but through this sub I found Annie Grace. Then Laura McKowen. And Holly Whitaker. These were cool ass people I admired and they were sober. It was amazing to me that people could be cool AND sober?! Impossible.

In the last year, I got an amazing job. I was able to dedicate myself fully to the position, and when my boss called me for late night emergency projects I was around to take care of them. I got a raise in December. I moved out in my own apartment for the first time a few months after I quit drinking. I learned to be at peace with myself. I lost 20 lbs without really trying. I’m moving into the nicest place I’ve ever lived in in one week. The people I surround myself with actually reflect my values. I’m still alone, but my interactions with men have been real and not drunk illusions. The people I meet now don’t know that I was once addicted to pain killers, smoking a pack a day, a drunken mess, waking up in strangers’ beds and trying to construct relationships out of those encounters. My new friends are amazed to hear stories of things that took place over a year ago, because it doesn’t reflect the person they know today.

Did all of this happen because I got sober? I don’t know. But I cannot deny the correlation of when my life dramatically changed for the better and my sobriety.

I truly didn’t think I could do it. This past year despite all drawbacks has been the best year of my life. When I was thinking about committing to sobriety, I always wanted someone to assure me that my life would be amazing if I just did the thing. I was skeptical, but I took the leap, and it is amazing and rich, just not in the loud, flashy way I thought it would be.",98,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5757821}"

I think I’m doing well and can handle a casual drink, then it becomes drinking everyday again for months. In the past year I have gone to the hospital 4 times because I got absolutely shit faced and wanted to kill myself and just didn’t know what to do. It wasn’t enough when my BAC was 0.6, i went back to drinking less than a week later. Now I’m done.

I also have ptsd and alcohol made that so much worse, idk if i’ve reached a breaking point or my antidepressant has finally started working but I actually feel GOOD in my sobriety. I’m not an anxious mess, I’m productive and dare I say it....happy. I don’t miss alcohol. 

Now i feel like after a year of heavy all day drinking (i’ve been unemployed since april thanks covid) and being a recluse, I finally feel like I can be more normal, more social. I’m the past few weeks my friend H has called me multiple times saying she misses me and wants to hang out etc, the only problem is she’s wasted every time she calls me. I can’t just not answer because she has picked up my drunken desperate calls, and I was a crying depressing mess, not calling to say I love and miss her.

Problem is, these calls are super triggering. I’ll be having a good time not thinking about alcohol and just doing me, then bam H calls and my whole mood is soured. H says this is her last weekend drinking and she can’t wait for us to hang out sober, but idk, H loves taking about the past and i’m really not trying to think about my last because I can’t do that without thinking about trauma, and now is the first time I can be free of those thoughts while sober and I cannot mess that up, but I also can’t abandon an important friendship, especially for such a hypocritical reason.

It was nice, had a nice enough time til some people turned up, friends of someone else there. Came expecting a party, a party occured.

I am fucking boring, I forgot how boring and socially fucking incompetent I am. I have been drinking for 2 years straight and I realised a key element of why I like to drink as much as I do. 

I have aspergers, and naturally am quite introverted. I am honestly known to often be the life and soul of the party. I am always off it a bit, always tipsy at least at such gatherings so socialisation comes a lot easier and I can go wild. I'm known for it. 

Tonight was a fucking disaster, it was an embarrassment for me. I was just sat there like a gawking freak not saying a word, everyone drinking around me with their drinking games. The cravings, the intensity, I was sweating, uncomfortable. Feeling like a joke who just can't be an interesting person sober. I just can't. 

And no, I didn't drink. I didn't have a sip, though I was offered. After some time of just sat like some weirdo, extremely uncomfortable, I got up and quietly slipped out unannounced. I just walked the 2 and half miles home. Felt relaxing, calm.

 I have been doing great. I've been using my new found free time with projects around the house, which helps immensely in clearing my mind and forcing me to focus on other things besides alcohol. I've also become a huge fan of sparkling waters. They give me the mental edge. I started drinking them because I could mentally trick myself into associating it with a gin and tonic. Fortunately, I don't think about the mixed drink anymore, I just enjoy the crispness of these bad boys. So here's my deal..


This freeze came and it shut everything down. I sat around my house for a few days with no power, no water, and nothing to do. Aggravated, bored, mostly just tired of all of the b.s.


Typically, during any other event like this, I would have filled my empty time with beers and whiskey to ease my worries. 


 Nope. I cant. I won't. So, I didn't. 


However, I did end up at the grocery store and found myself walking down the beer isle. I would have loved to grab a case of ale, slam em', and get right. Hell, at that point I'd settle for some hard lemonade. I wanted to taste a beer. I'd settle for anything. So I bought a six-pack of Non-alcoholic brews. I drank them. They tasted like shit, but they tasted like beer. My wife was thrilled to see that the beer in my hand was in fact, Non-alcoholic. She had figured I'd caved...so you can imagine her shock. She congratulated me and the day went on.


But, I feel guilty. Like maybe I cheated myself. Like I was too weak. I guess my question is, should I feel guilty/ashamed for purchasing and drinking a non? And did I fail my journey?",18,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3925923}"

I started here just like you.,"I’m sitting here pouring over angulations for radiography.  I have a lot of weird shit I have to remember for this next test.  Forty five degree’s for this, rotate the head parallel for that.  It’s kind of boring, but I’m almost done with this degree.  This will be my second since getting sober.  I have a lot of free time now that I don’t get wrecked every night.

I looked up and realized, it’s my “birthday.”  In a normal year I would be at an in person meeting.  This year I got a zoom meeting on Wednesday, and that will be good enough.  What’s remarkable about all of this, is how unremarkable it is.  These “year birthdays” aren’t that big of a deal anymore, let me tell you why.

I don’t sit around thinking about drinking all the time anymore, or not drinking for that matter.  If you rewind say, seven years, it was the major theme of my life.  “Can I afford to get hammered tonight, how early do I have to wake up?”  “Jesus my stomach hurts, way too much last night.  I think drinking on an empty stomach actually makes it better.”  These types of thoughts were endless, besides the ever present one, “what the fuck am I doing with my life?”

These days I rarely think about booze, and that’s what I find so amazing.  I go entire days without thinking about alcohol even once.  It would probably be weeks if I didn’t do meetings.  When I do think about it, the thoughts are flashes, “yep, beer is a thing that exists.”  The cravings are so many years in the past.  I just have other shit to do.

I frankly wouldn’t do sobriety if it was hard.  If my whole life was like early sobriety, where I had to fight my brain on the regular, it would be too difficult.  I don’t think anyone can keep up that mental battle forever, which is why we give in, “If this is sobriety, it isn’t worth it.”  The thing is it’s not.  It gets better over time.  It’s not a straight line on a graph, but in general, every day from that last drink is a little easier.  It gets to a point where the old life seems like a hassle.  I can do what I want now, alcohol feels like a cage I escaped.

I ain’t gonna blow sunshine up your ass.  Life is just life.  I get just as much heartbreak and tragedy in my life now as I did before getting sober.  I’m just a person, and shit happens to people.  It’s easier to deal with now.  Mostly, I just don’t hate myself anymore.  There’s joy too, and beauty often.  That was missing for quite a while.  It’s like waking up from a long nightmare, only to find the world is still there, and you can make what you want of it.

Getting sober is hard.  Cling to recovering alcoholics, they get it.  Use all the resources, treat yourself with kindness.  You can do it, I swear you can do it.  I drank for twenty plus years.

Like many here, I starting drinking much more than normal during quarantine, and slowly began to realize the negative impact it was having on my life. My real ""wake-up call"" was actually at the dentist. I had been brushing twice a day and flossing semi-regularly, but the dental hygienist told me that the space growing in between some of my teeth and gums was starting to become borderline-irreversible, and if my gums continued to recede I would need to see a specialist. I know that alcohol can contribute to gum disease, and due to my relatively good dental hygiene routine, I suspect this is the case. Proud to say I have now been flossing almost every single day - I've probably missed ~5 days since my November appointment. 

More importantly, I've been drinking a lot less. While I'm not ready to quit entirely, I've been keeping my drinking to maybe 1-2 days a week, only for social occasions. Often with 7-10 day stretches of complete sobriety. And I feel so much better for it! Definitely more clear headed, less anxious, less mood swings, better sleep, better overall health. Both of my parents had alcoholic fathers. My father claims to have never drank, and my mom probably has 10 drinks a year. My dad told me that he never had the urge to drink because he saw how it affected his dad. Both of my grandfather's passed before I was born, and growing up I never really knew anyone with an alcohol problem, so I guess I was pretty ignorant to the damage it can cause. I'm definitely becoming more cognizant of the damage potential now, and I think I hope that the alcoholism that might run in my family will skip more than one generation. 

Finally, in trying to be more aware of my drinking habits, I've been marking an ""X"" on my wall calendar for every day I have even one drink. I figured it would be a good way to hold myself accountable, and to try and space out the distance between X's. I recently noticed that my marks have been leaving an impression on the next month of the calendar too - so now I can see a month ago I drank Friday and Saturday, maybe this week I'll just keep it to Friday. Or hey, I didn't drink at all this weekend, whereas last month I drank Thursday to Sunday. 

Anyway, if anyone else is just trying to cut back, give my calendar method a try! And I've also found that reading this subreddit is a great daily reminder that alcohol doesn't have to be part of a fulfilling life. Thank you everyone.",2,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4362223}"

Today is the day I told myself I could drink again. I don't know that I want to drink again.,"I stopped for a week to see if I could. I think once in college I stopped for 3 weeks and then went right back to it. It has been such a habit, such a constant in my life. Almost 20 years now.  I would just drink and it wasn’t a problem most of the time. My wife and I are very social and we have lots of dinner parties, and go out often, so it seemed a normal part of life. I would  have a couple a night minimum. There were times when I drank too much, a few times a month I'd have a bad hangover, but most of the time it wasn't a big deal. But a week after I stopped I was able to look at my drinking more objectively and I started to feel that there really wasn't a need to drink so much. So I said to myself that I would go a month and then I'd start again, but only at dinner parties and or when out with friends.

But over this month I’ve been thinking and trying to look at my drinking. It’s hard to be honest about it. It’s hard to admit I have a poor relationship with it. Most of my best memories involve drinking because it’s been such a big part of my life. Drinking was there when I met my wife, on vacations, at my wedding, at holidays with friends and family, so it’s scary to think what life would be without it. But I've also had a lot of bad times drinking, a lot of bad hangovers, embarrassment. I know if I'm honest that I'm usually the drunkest person in the group, I always want another and another once I get going. I drink more than my wife. I am the one to encourage friends to keep it going. It’s hard to keep it to just a couple. Not to say I always take it to the extreme, but it happens more than I'd want it to. And I worry even with this distance of a month now, that if I returned to drinking it would just go back to that. I'd like to have a cocktail while making dinner and a glass of wine at the table. I think I could but I don't know. I know how I get when I get feeling good. I might want another and then next thing you know I'm hungover. And I don't want to be hungover anymore. It's not fun. It feels shitty. It makes my anxiety sky rocket.

This past month I've felt great. My anxiety has decreased. I've finally lost the little extra bit of weight I've been trying to lose. My face isn’t as blotchy and bloated. It's been great.

I guess I'm scared of admitting to others that it wasn’t just a month I was taking off, that maybe I want to stop all together. I worry about the dinner parties and the social aspect. I mean we have had a few friends over since (a couple at a time and outside) and its been fine. I was actually surprised how much I enjoyed myself without drinking. A big thing I was scared of was that things won’t be fun anymore but this last month has been fun. I've been fun and my wife has noticed, my friends have noticed. It's just scary to make it concrete and say I won’t drink again. It seems so permanent and like I'm breaking up with a long time friend. One i love and won’t see again. 

I'm not sure what to do or what I will do, but I thought maybe you all might have some thoughts or insights to help. I think I know what I should do, but it's scary and the thought of admitting that I don't have control over my drinking makes me feel like something is wrong with me, like I have some sort of disability.

I managed to go over 6 months after starting here the first time.. I can't remember why, but I stopped visiting the community all together. 

Somewhere after 6 months of no drinking, I tricked myself into believing that I was better and could handle my drinking. Slowly over the course of the last few years, its gotten back to my old levels without me even realizing it. For some reason coming back into this group had always slipped my mind, In fact, there were stretches of weeks where I didnt drink these past few years, but they never lasted more than a month. 

After a bad stretch of binge drinking these past few months, something has clicked in my head I believe. I can't keep living this way, or else I'll lose everything I've worked for. Finally coming back into the community and seeing where my badge would have been if I stuck with this the first time was a truly humbling experience. It was 1070 days. I was only ever fully sober the first ~175 of those days, I had just stopped visiting this community. 

Here I am, over a 1000 days later, starting at day 1 again. It almost makes me sad wondering where I would be if I had stuck with it that first day I found this sub, but I realize that doesn't help me now either. All I can do now, is take this one day at a time, and see where it ends up.

I then did the think it all the way through trick which I picked up in this sub (THANK YOUUUUU) and turned my mind elsewhere.

Then this morning when I was up with zero hangover and out walking the doggos at 6 AM, I started to think about all of the things I would have missed had I had a drink last night:  I wouldn't have done my usual 2 mile walk (or any length walk really) with the dogs, I would've neglected my vegetable garden and let it pass the day with no water, I wouldn't have fed my kid or partner good food this am and would've opted for greasy no-nutritional value  comfort food for hangovers, I would've missed my physical therapy this am and been a no show, I would be stewing in shame and I wouldn't have slept last night, I wouldn't be able to run errands, etc.  Essentially, I would've canceled my life for a day and I don't want to do that ever again.

I’m giving it a real go right now, and I have been really down in the dumps for the last two days. Everything seems bad, life seems bad, I’m lonely and have no friends, I suck, etc. This morning I woke up still feeling bad, but instead of being hungover, I had energy to do things. So I took my car to the auto body shop ( I knocked my side mirror off in a parking garage 4 days ago when I was SOBER), picked up my dry cleaning from 4 weeks ago, did some shopping, took out the trash because I needed to, cleaned the kitchen, dealt with bills, and none of it seemed as overwhelmingly hard as usual! I just kept doing things because they needed to be done and I could.

I remember the misery of the last months of drinking, the anxiety of early sobriety, the sheer boredom of suddenly having lost my main pastime. I don't so much remember the things that happened gradually, like the first day I didn't think at all about a drink, like whenever it was my family started to believe in me again, or when I finally had enough other things to do that I'm rarely bored anymore.  

The patience was the hardest thing to learn. Having to just keep doing this thing every day even when I can't see the rewards yet, hoping that they're out there. Looking back and knowing I can't go back into that dark tunnel, so just giving a big sigh and slogging forward another day. There were a lot of days like that, where it felt like I was standing still. They were all worth it. They weren't as bad as my worst days and they made it so I can have these days, which are some of my best.

The last 6 months have been the most transformative of my life. Before I checked myself into detox and rehab, I was drunk and miserable all the time.

After a long pink cloud phase, I’ve just recently been needing to actively remind myself why I want to stay sober. Luckily, nobody ever exaggerates the benefits of sobriety - they really are that great. From feeling actual joy, to no more hangovers, to finding a purpose again, sobriety can feel magical. I’ve really enjoyed getting to know myself for what feels like the first time - while it hasn’t always been easy, I love feeling like ME.

I am now slowly drinking less each week to wean myself off of alcohol per Dr. recommendations.

I felt ill, didn't want to eat, my heart was racing and my vision blurring. 

I thought it was medication and called my Dr. well it wasn't. I am going through withdrawals. It's hard to sleep, my heart races, I feel anxious like something bad going to happen, and get really feverish at random when I don't have alcohol in my system.

The reality is these symptoms are normal after the body adapts to having a depressant in it most of the time. These symptoms are caused by a stimulant our bodies release to keep us balanced and aware when under the influence of a depressant (alcohol).

I thought I was different and I was wrong, very wrong. It's going to be alright though, I now have to treat alcohol like dosed medicine and keep track of what I drink and how much. I'm down to half my normal intake and the withdrawals are uncomfortable but, I'm making progress.

Let's get into it! This is a completely sober Saturday night. I've just had a date with my girlfriend, writing this on the train home. I feel like something is missing, it's the beer and the buzz. I feel depressed, right now. I didn't want to go home just yet, but have to - due to a lockdown. I've walked past several stores thinking: just one beer should not be bad, but then I would get another from some other store, and when I get home I would want more and more, then probably wake up feeling like shit, cause no stores will be open, and if I order drinks, I will be hangover the next day - incapable of doing anything productive and useful. I don't want that and also the dehydration, dry and bad looking skin, shitty taste in the mouth... No, don't want that. 

I've got a slight headache that would I think go away if I drink. It's Saturday night, so many people are out there having a beer and preparing for house parties. Looking at them - I was jealous. Like, ""man, what a night could it be."" Instead I'm headed home, sober, I will continue my work tonight to reach goals I want! Can't do that while buzzed, hangover and lots of money spent on drinks I shouldn't even had.

I've been drinking every day I think for a week again now. It was 2 or 3 bottles of wine, but I started today with beer and just bought some vodka.
I'm 28 and have struggled with this problem probably since I started to drink at 19 to combat my social anxiety.


I would drink before my shifts at work (sometimes starting at 6am) and then drink on the way home.
The longest time I managed to stop was when I did outpatient rehab last year and I stopped for 11 weeks. I think it was more manageable to stop because I knew I was getting picked up a dropped off 6 days a week and had that accountability. 


I was starting to like myself being sober that long. Then lockdown cut the rehab short and I relapsed not long after.

I don't trust people to tell them things I've done. 


Where I live groups are able to be face to face with a 15 person cap. So it's the same people more or less at the meetings and there's cliques and I don't fit in.
One woman I was kind of friends with rang me about a month ago and was telling me loads of stuff I didn't know about a few people in the rooms and she said she's a gossip, so if she gossips to me, she most likely gossips about me - someone who I hadn't told I was waiting for residential rehab asked me when it will start and they'd found out from said woman 


She is also in the clique and she's quite gobby. I'm introverted and use alcohol to make me feel care free and be more open and chatty

If even one person reads my posts and feels better about not drinking another day, I feel like that's worth it. If no one reads my post, I still made it 75 days and that is an amazing achievement in my book.

I've been a drinker my entire adult life.  I started drinking in college and dropped out shortly after. Back then it was a beer here and a beer there, weekends with friends or after a ""hard days work"". It wasn't until 2017 that I went from weekly to daily.  Keeping a six pack in the fridge and having a beer every night never seemed out of the ordinary. After all, everyone does it, right? It's what our society is built around, sharing a drink with a friend seems like not only normal, but necessary. 

In 2019 I became a bartender. Around alcohol nearly everyday, always able to pour myself a drink.  I never considered the beer I snuck while on the clock or the second and third ""shift drink"" as a problem. After all, everyone did it, right? I didn't realize how wrong I was.  Everyone in my life drank. Everyone let loose. I counted myself as better than them because I could always hold my liquor, and no one ever called me out for being a drunk. I never realized that fact alone should have been an alert to the problem I was developing.

Las year in 2020 when the COVID-19 virus got me laid off from my job as a bartender, I could have used it as a reason to stop drinking. Alcohol was no longer as accessible. But I did the exact opposite, I leaned into it, I kept drinking, and it got heavier and heavier until I was taking down a six pack a day, or a handle of whiskey over the weekend alone.  I kept working hard through the alcohol, launched my own business and by many different levels was a successful drunk. But I was barely functioning, even if highly, barely.  There were many days when I was angry with myself for drinking while working and not getting as much done, many days when I'd drink at noon and fall asleep by 4pm, a day wasted.  Many days when I would drive from one place or another with a beer in the cupholder, telling myself I wouldn't ever get caught because no one would ever be able to tell. So many kisses with my partner tasting beer or alcohol, or weed.  Weed had the same exact hold on me that alcohol did, and I was in the same exact denial.  I never considered alcohol and weed as a contributor to my bad behaviors, my anxiety, my lack of motivation, because when measuring myself to most of the people around me, I was achieving a lot!

&#x200B;

But at a certain point I had to stop measuring myself against other people and start measuring myself against myself.   


On December 7th I woke up and just, was fed up.  Weed wasn't getting me high and alcohol wasn't letting me push through and reach the goals I had set for myself. It has not been easy, but I have not looked back. Sometimes I consider what life would be like if I had just one drink or smoked just one joint.  The thing is, a lot wouldn't change overnight, but eventually, my life would slide back to where it was, and I never want to move backwards again.

&#x200B;

Today is 75 days sober. 

  
I feel like a new person, a new resolve for life, for my work, for my relationships. I am finally not living penny to penny, paycheck to paycheck.  I have everything I need and everything I want, and for once in my life I am truly, truly happy.   Learning how to sit in uncomfortable feelings and emotions is a daily practice that I am excited to move through each day.  Finding new value in so many levels of life.  I would not trade my sobriety for the entire world.

The cycle ends here my friends.
Much love to you all.

Edit update: Thank you all so much for the collective support🙏 I am blown away, and I love you all for it! You are such a blessing and I'm greatful to not be alone.
 One thing i would like to note in my experience so far, is that this is the first time in my life that I have dealt with a loss of a loved one sober.
Because of this I was forced to sit with my feelings and raw emotions. 
So I sat there. Just observing these very intense and painful things in a sort of meditation. And what I found was so profoundly beautiful and bittersweet that it's impossible for me to really put words on it. 
But the fact I can feel again. Really FEEL these human experiences. Embrace them with love consciously and blossom in spiritual growth. 
I am no longer numbed and distracted and will forever strive to embrace every experience life has to offer. 
Thanks again everybody and I love you bunches❤ stay strong!",975,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.87144536}"
2021-02-20 11:55:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lob7u5/so_heres_whats_going_on_with_me/,So here’s what’s going on with me,"Feels long and rambling but here’s my story:

This is my first time reaching out in a sober and honest fashion. I am incredibly ashamed of so much that I’ve done and been a part of, that nobody knows the truth about much of what I’m going to share. I’ve never physically harmed another person, so I guess that’s a silver lining. That’s the end of the preamble. 

I’ve always been introverted, my friends have always been the odd ducks because I’m one too. However I longed to fit in, I disliked feeling like an outsider. I disliked not being invited to things and being forgotten. 

At 16 I started hanging out and drinking with a group of people and suddenly I was comfortable around these people. Weird thing was, I drank with them in moderation and we didn’t do it very often. I only had one hangover in my first two years, and I had thrown up twice. That group never forgot about me and really wanted me to be around because they liked sober me just as well as the other one. I think the trouble started in college. 

I was far from my friends alone in a new place faced with the prospect of finding new ones. Being myself has only gotten me abandoned and forgotten in the past, but drinking made me good friends. (I know this is not true, but it’s the best explanation I’ve got for the nine years that follow) I started drinking, only on the weekends but I blacked out at least once a week, usually both days. I joined a fraternity after I pledged to get free beer, then my mom told me I never see anything through, so screw you mom watch me follow this through. Unfortunately my extravagant drinking habit was celebrated and encouraged in this environment. Highlights from my first semester of college include peeing in my bed, falling asleep in my own vomit and refusing to move, failing every single class except English, and being asked to leave the university. I told myself it was because I was too young and it was too much pressure. Next I spent five years in community college. 

I moved into an apartment with some friends of a friend and we all had a blast drinking together on the weekends. I was 20 when I first started really craving drinking on the days I wasn’t. I had met a girl, she liked to party. After I turned 21 I realized nobody in the house questioned if I had a couple drinks on a weeknight but I craved more. So I’d drink malt liquor on my way home from school. Things got progressively worse. That girl I mentioned earlier, we fought a lot, my roommates and neighbors were subject to some screaming matches I’ll always be embarrassed for. And even more sorry to that poor girl. 

I’m 27 now. While under the influence I’ve destroyed relationships with two different women who made the mistake of loving me unconditionally. The most recent one just last spring, that girl I mentioned tolerated me and stuck by me for 7 years and after all that I forced her out. I guess at least I did that right. I broke my hand hitting a fence, crashed a car into a curb with a passenger, crashed another car into a median while alone, made a scene at my roommates wedding, broke my collarbone blacked out, lost multiple jobs for sleeping too late while hungover. After community college I transferred to a university where I got a degree in physics. I held a job with decent money until a few months ago. I lost the person I loved who incidentally was my only friend in the area and work was barely holding me together, I was drinking during my lunch break and afterwards until I fell asleep. 

So now I have moved back home and I’m unemployed. I got on unemployment and started going out walking at night so I could drink and not be seen by my family doing it. Then I got mugged the week before Christmas. I’ve been in therapy and making a concerted effort to manage my depression and stop drinking but it’s so hard. In the six years since i turned 21 I’ve managed four days one time and a handful of three day stretches. 

In the early hours of the morning on the 18th I got into a fight with my older brother, we were both drunk. I don’t remember what I said but I remember him yelling and then the first punch. The next thing I remember is stumbling down the street and checking my phone and seeing it was around 4:30am. Nostrils clogged with blood and my shirt wasn’t in very good shape either. Also, no mask. No mask, no Uber and no bus. After being refused entry to three gas stations, either because of my appearance or lack of a mask, I screamed and cried and punched the ad window of a bus stop, thankfully not breaking my hand but it’s not very useful right now. Two gas stations later an old woman took pity on me and let me in to buy masks and clean my face up. I thanked her, called a ride, and went home. 

It was 6:15am, my light jacket ilwass not holding up to the cold, and I did TV n’t have my keys. I had hoped to slip past the parents unnoticed. Nope. My brother isn’t allowed in the house anymore, effectively cut off except for support where his infant son needs it. 

I’ve tried to stop drinking many times before but as I lay here with a hand the size of an apple, cracked and bruised ribs, a black eye, a concussion, and the very real possibility of my brother losing his only child and me losing my only brother, I’ve never been more motivated. 

I share this here because I feel this is a community that understands and respects that this is me committing to keep trying, even if I fail. I hope to eventually be able to enjoy moderation, but I won’t even know if that’s possible until I can comfortably leave the stuff alone. I understand the difference between trying not to drink and making a conscious decision not to drink. 

I am determined to stop. I will reach for help when I need it. I may slip back to zero days, but I’ll keep trying everyday to make the right decision. 

Thanks for sticking with me if you’ve read this far.

Days 1-3 were pretty tough and last night I really wanted a beer. I found myself going through my rote rationalization process: do I have to work tomorrow? If so how early before I need to be fairly spry? Do I have access to enough to make me pass out? If I have one and it inevitably turns into ten, is anything likely to fall apart? All signs led to “it’s okay to have one”.

Instead I came here. I read your stories and I asked myself more relevant questions:

1.	Who really wants this beer - is it me the dad, husband, friend, professional? Or “me” the alcohol? The one that’s landed me in the hospital, incarcerated, literally lost, and worse over the last 25 years.
2.	Play it forward - if I have the beer, what’s the next week look like? Regret, disappointment, or worse. What does tomorrow look like? Anxiety and not being emotionally available for my family, at the least. What does the next hour look like? I get buzzed enough to stomach a cigarette and get that elusive moment of clarity and peace? Bullshit. That’s not even a thing. Maybe the most relevant question - what does 10 years from now look like? Sad? Dead? Disabled? Alone?

Read sales books.

Hazleden and daily devotionals are very good but I know we all like to switch it up sometimes. I stumbled on reading sales books by accident. I work in a field with a lot of salespeople and started reading them because I figured I’d have to make the leap. I never actually have, even though I might one day.

I drank because of rejection, isolation and getting stuck in negative loops. Most sales inspiration books actually tackle how to deal with these topics head-on. One of the first I read was Sell or Be Sold by Grant Cardone. If he seems off-putting, I actually agree, can’t watch the guy personally but I love that book. He talks about how if you feel depressed, you should do more towards your goals because it’ll get your mind off what’s bothering you and move you forward.

I also like Tom Hopkins (a lot!) and Zig Ziglar is just wholesome. I’m reading the Official Guide to Success (Hopkins) rn and it would fit well with Steps work or SMART, it’s all about breaking negative thought loops and setting goals.

If you’re a sponsor of any kind, you’re to a degree practicing some of the skills of relationship management that top sales people do. I found out a salesman I work with who has a multi-million dollar book is over 30 years sober. He is one of the most soft spoken, calm people I’ve met but reliable and always flexible with situations- the real gold standards of a salesperson. Feel free to tune out anything that is gimicky, focused on hard closing, etc. What I’ve found that helps me is a sales mindset born from a positive way of life.",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.80096084}"
2021-02-20 11:03:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/loa47a/i_made_a_decision/,I made a decision,"Hey fellow IWNDWYT-ers,

I haven't checked in for some time. I like to pop by and share some personal insight now and again in hopes it may resonate with someone struggling at the moment. I was a full-time, semi functional alcoholic for many years. I did pretty much anything and everything to ensure I could get my fix (with the exception of a few things). I was a sad, anxious, angry, and unmotivated MESS! I did drugs when I was intoxicated, I put myself and others in uncomfortable and occasionally dangerous situations. I was a slave to the sauce. Most of all, I was miserable.

Then I made a decision, to try life a different way.... It was tough at first, and talk about discomfort! I had to relearn how to live, shit... I had to LEARN how to live. I had to sit with (and still do) and process some heavy stuff. I had to FEEL. I cried, I laughed, I had moments of enlightenment, I felt boredom, and occasionally heartbroken. I survived.

Today, I have been sober for two years, three months, and fifteen days. I AM THRIVING! I finally got my driver's license at 30 years old. I quit a toxic job and got my insurance license, I have a growing client base and I am deeply fulfilled doing this work. I have beautiful flourishing relationships with my loved ones. I hold myself accountable, I have a personal spiritual practice that brings me peace and joy. Everyday is a little easier to navigate. I still cry, laugh, and get confused but it's not nearly as overwhelming. I guess I just want people to know, if you want a different life... You have to do different things. Please don't be afraid to see what potential you have. You ARE WORTHY OF GOOD THINGS. I genuinely hope this reaches someone who needs it. Also, I am happy to befriend and speak with anyone who may have questions or just want to share experiences. Much love my friends, stay strong.

Three years ago today I nodded along as he patiently explained that you take it once a day in the morning and it'll make you sick if you drink on it (ha!).   

Three years ago today I filled my first Rx on the Nal. 

Three years ago today I set it down on the counter while I took my coat off and my wife asked ""What in the FUCK is this?"" (HA! I had half planned on not telling her bc I'd been gaslighting her for years about how much I was drinking HA! as if, nah baby it isn't a problem, stop making such a big deal of it sheesh)

Three years ago today I explained that contrary to what my doc said, you take this pill an hour before you drink, every time you drink and, over-time, it slowly de-couples the drinking from the addiction. Re-winding your brain to a state of non-addiction. 

Three years ago today she told me she didn't like this plan and thought it sounded like some bullshit an alcoholic would make up to avoid stopping drinking like they know they should.

Three years ago today I told her I ain't going to be able to do AA and Imma give this thing a try. 

Three years ago today I popped half a nal, had a little snack, drank a glass of water, waited exactly an hour and cracked into my first and last tallboy of the night. (half a pill to start bc it can make you a bit nauseous.  

Three years ago today I changed my whole fucking life.   

Three years ago today I started using the Sinclair Method (""TSM"") to murder my addiction to alcohol. 

Three years ago I did not stop drinking, it took till July of 2018 before I was ""done"" 

Today I am no longer addicted to alcohol (but I could get re-addicted)

Today I woke up and had a calendar reminder to myself that this was the day. I have a calendar reminder for this day and the day I officially called it murderized because otherwise, there's no way I'd remember. 

Today I don't think about, crave or want to have a drink. I'm only thinking about it because of the calendar reminder. 

Today I there's a bunch of beers in the fridge, whiskey and wine in the cupboard that looks like so much milk to me, I might cook with it but I sure as shit ain't gonna drink it. 

  
Today I could have a pill and have a drink no problem. I had a glass of wine on thanksgiving and one on either xmas or new years and boy was it boring after the first third (why yes, I took a pill each time of course). I am pretty sure those were my only two drinks in all of 2020 (if ever there was a year to go back to drinking, curiously none of the stress ever caused me to even remotely think of actually having a beer. At most I had the oft curious thought, ""why doesn't drinking even occur to me as a thing to do at this of all times?"")

Today my doc has switched over to offering TSM to his patients. 

  
Today my wife is a believer. 

I know that TSM isn't really this sub's jam but I also wanted to take a moment to celebrate me getting off the wagon (being on the wagon is a fucking terrible metaphor for not drinking, drinking is the wagon and you can't fucking control it) and it is my hope that you get it all sorted out if you're having trouble and that you check out TSM if you want, I'd call it a miracle if it wasn't just plain old science in action.

Nearly 7 years ago I discovered my husband was having an affair.  It absolutely devastated me.  We tried to reconcile but ultimately it became clear he was jerking me around and continuing to maintain his relationship with the other woman.  Our kids were 4 and 6.  I filed for divorce.  My heart was broken, I had to sell my house, I lost people from my life I thought were “family”, my life turned completely upside down and I had to sit back and watch as he built a new life with the other woman.  All while handing away my kids to them nearly 50% of the time and trying desperately to bite my tongue for their sakes.  At the same time my Dad was battling Parkinson’s disease and Parkinson’s dementia and his situation became dire.  My dad died just 2 months after I filed for divorce.  I just about had a nervous breakdown from it all.  

One of the worst parts was not just the betrayal by my husband, but my sister, while initially there for me, started pointing the finger at me and saying that I somehow deserved his cheating.  She also started working on our mother so the two of them were basically blaming me that I somehow deserved what he’d done.  The betrayal by my husband AND my sister AND my mother cut so deep.  My mother and I have since talked this all out and she regrets how she acted when I needed her most.  My sister notsomuch 

I have since rebuilt my life after the divorce.  Brought a house, have a great career, financially stable, good friends and figured out how to navigate single motherhood.  I was in a lot of emotional pain for many years, but thought I had really moved past it.  I used to have lots of nightmares about my ex husband cheating, about the new life he built being more lavish and the kids liking being at his house better than mine.  I used to wake up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night confused and terrified wondering where my children are when they would go to their dads.  

Last night for the first time in a long time I had one of those nightmares about my ex cheating, I dreamt my sister was going to his house for a lavish party and she kept telling me how close she is with his girlfriend (affair partner) and basically how awful I am.  I felt all the betrayals again.  My head is hurting this morning and I’m so sad.

I lost a lot and went through unbelievable stress. I know it was a tough year for a lot of people, so I'm not trying to say I had it worse. But it was traumatic beyond belief. My drinking was also at an all time worst as was my health. After years of trying to stop, I somehow managed to do it for 5 months, lost about 40 pounds, and got into a really good mindset. I think the main wake up call was that I KNEW I was going to die if I continued. But recently I have continued to get bad personal news and it drove me to break again. The demons are back.

Over the past couple of months my drinking has been very sporadic. It has not been an every day, pass out drunk event. But when I do drink, it's as bad as it was, and I feel myself losing myself in the vicious cycle again. I'm terrified that it will continue to get worse and become an every day thing again. 

One of my problems is that I have several liquor stores in my area that I pass by on the way home from work. In order to avoid them, I have to go well out of my way, which is annoying but doable. The sad part is that I was able to avoid them for 5 months. But all of a sudden my power to just drive by is going away.

I am not in the position to get professional help. I know it might sound stupid, but trust me, I just can't. Having done it myself before, I know it's possible. But I'm desperate for some kind of advice right now. Something to push me back into that frame of mind I was in a couple of months ago. I'll take any help....anything....

Regular guy who used to drink far too much... mostly because I thought I needed to in order to stay entertained with living. Stopped drinking 2 months ago. When I think back to my past self and where I am right now it’s staggering. I used to wake up tired and stressed out about work and life responsibilities. Now I wake up, EARLY, and have energy like never before. I’ve actually been tackling my responsibilities instead of avoiding them. 


I’ve combined sobriety with: waking up at the same time every morning, riding the exercise bike every morning, taking a few vitamins/supplements, packing healthy lunches. My thoughts are clearer. That is amazing in itself. Clear thoughts!


My lifestyle is not sloppy anymore. I’m in the driver’s seat of my life. Waking up confident and ready to tackle the day after a refreshing night’s sleep is a gift. Also, I’ll give credit to the “Productive” iPhone app. It’s a habit tracking app for positive habits. My goal is simple: consistency. That’s it. I do these daily:

Bike 5+ min


Lift 1+ sets


Vitamins


Protein shake for breakfast 


Make my bed

""If you could just do X, Y, and Z you would be fine to keep drinking"".  ""There were only a couple bad days back then but you don't have to do THAT one stupid thing again"" Honestly, my last few days I've been pretty down.   

So yesterday I started writing a list titled WHY I QUIT.   After 2 solid pages of reasons, it is more clear than ever I have to quit and it has to stay permanent!   I will keep this list.  Add to it, and hope it is just another source of motivation for me.   The list itself is very personal and some are quite painful to admit even just to myself.    I must always remember why I quit.

I was drinking every other night, but only because non-drinking days were hangovers. I felt like I couldn't get my weight under control and when I went to a new doctor I was 5kgs heavier than I realised. I was already 10 more than I wanted to be and the extra weight shocked me. 

The drinking was feeding my depression and anxiety and stopping me from being the Mum I know I can be for my little one.
I'm so glad I didn't hit rock bottom because I could feel it on the horizon and I have too much to lose.

I'm eating healthier and all the little things feel better, like a morning coffee without a headache, the desire to be silly or playful or creative with my daughter without a glass of wine calling to me. I'm less irritated and happier and have more patience. 

I'm focused at work and remember so much more, the mental clarity is something I expected and hoped for, but actually experiencing it has been life changing. 

I'm a nicer, happier, healthier and more energised person without the booze. It was weighing me down, literally, and I don't ever want to go back to being a functioning alcoholic.",108,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.69839275}"

I've burnt a lot of bridges here. And im a stay at home mom so I feel like I only look forward to drinking. (I always make sure my kid has what they need before I ever touch a drink)

I feel like im drowning and im not sure what to do anymore. My days are redundant and feel bleak, I give my kid too much screen time to just get through until i can drink. I've posted here before and the longest I've gone without drinking is maybe 4 days in a long time.

Police found me face down on the street covered in blood and bruises some mother fucker taxi driver beat me with a metal pipe which I remember since I wondered off and couldnt find my way back but I did find a taxi station and probably I went in and tried to ask for a taxi. I dont remember why he did it but I dont think I did anything to him since he was with a group of men but he was the only one beating me and I remember after he hit me on the head the first time I said 'why did you do that I didnt do anything to you' even when he hit me I didnt fight back I just wanted to know why lol so my drunk dumbass stayed when I shouldve left to find out why lol. When I went out he followed me outside and he kept hitting me. I think because he didnt knock me out and I was still standing pissed him off and he really started to beat me until I just said enough and walked away lol I probably walked like 5mins before I passed out and collapsed.  I don't know how I feel about this but I'm kind of already suicidal and when I woke up this morning I just wanted to kill myself. Im in some pain I have cuts and bruises all over my body, I can hardly walk and my head is killing me.

I took two calls from the same individual this evening and their coping strategy is alcohol. Now, we are a non-judgmental service and if all someone has to get them through is alcohol we do not imply they need to have it taken away for any reason. That said, it clearly wasn't working for this person. Listening to their story I could hear my own justifications and the cycle that can happen: feeling overwhelmed, needing a break, using alcohol, not taking great care of basic needs (eating or sleeping well) and waking up feeling just as overwhelmed or more so. 

I stopped drinking in January after many attempts, went a full 40 days, moderated drinking a bottle of wine over a week, and have gone back to not drinking at all again now with the desire to never pick another glass up.

Life has been so much easier to handle without alcohol. I couldn't have believed, before, that not drinking would make such a difference. Listening to someone else's reliance reinforced my own choice for freedom in the same ways reading everyone else's stories on here has slowly influenced me to try giving it up.

And, giving it up was hard! I didn't feel addicted until I realized I couldn't go a full week without desiring one glass. I could drink just one, but I couldn't drink none. Until I finally did. There's a lot of envy given to those  who could ""moderately drink"" but I'm here to say that doesn't exist. We are all at different places on the gradual slope towards addiction when we drink. That bottle I slowly worked my way through gave rise to thoughts that, well, beers might be nice to have now and again... When I hadn't desired beer at all prior and don't especially care for the taste but know that the alcohol content is lower than wine. I was already justifying. It's scary.

GO PLACIDLY amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.

Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.

And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.

I wanted to use this last post to take the opportunity to express just how much this community means to me. I arrived broken and damaged, mired in a fathomless pit of despair that I couldn’t imagine escaping from. But here I am, almost nine months later, feeling renewed, revitalized, alive again. Participating here is like wrapping yourself in a kind of chrysalis and slowly emerging more nourished, more beautiful than you were. And this would not have been possible without the fellowship and warmth that I was so lucky to find here. I know it’s been said many, many times before. But there really is nothing like SD in the virtual world, nothing remotely as welcoming and unstintingly supportive. Its defining feature is its kindness, this community practically vibrates with compassion. I would never feel comfortable sharing myself to this extent anywhere else. 

&#x200B;

I want to thank u/SaintHomer for giving me the chance to express and, in a way, unburden myself by allowing me to host the DCI as well as Thankful Thursdays. Both of these venues have been vital to sustaining my sobriety, helping me to work through whatever is going on in my head and remaining accountable while contributing to the journey of others, however small those contributions may be in the grand scheme of things. Being of service is life-affirming. It makes me feel part of something larger than myself, which has been absolutely crucial to staying sober because in my drunken days I was alone, withdrawn, insular. What a pleasure, what a gift it has been, to read of all your milestones. Your triumphs. Your struggles and insecurities and doubts as you brave the hazards of this difficult endeavor. It brings me such immense joy to see your badges continue to steadily grow, and to meet those who have summoned the courage to embark on what will prove to be one of the most rewarding journeys.

&#x200B;

The DCI is an integral institution within SD, a central pillar of support, a constant source of comfort that so many of us rely on, count on, look forward to. My day always starts with coffee and you, my DCI comrades. I’d undoubtedly feel bereft if I lost it. How comforting it is to know that, without fail, I’ll wake up to u/YouWillYouWont telling us “I didn’t drink in Aus with you today and I won’t tonight!” Or reading Trumie’s invariably insightful comments. Or Andy’s witty remarks that never fail to put a smile on my face, to make me laugh. Or the sheer delight of simply seeing cinq pop up on my screen. I could go on and on and on celebrating you all and reveling in the friendships I’ve forged here. Earlier this week u/kc9134 said something that deeply moved me, letting me know that I had been one of the first DCI hosts they encountered when beginning their own journey. To play even a minor role in another’s sobriety is profoundly humbling. It made me think about how I still remember my first host when I arrived here, u/Yangsi, and was introduced to the acronym that changed my approach to life: IWNDWYT. That we remember these experiences and people is a testament to the singular importance and indispensability of the DCI.

I think I’ve subjected you all to enough of my long ramblings this week. So let me just end with one final thought. I’ve been thinking a lot about when I was a boy. That magical period of innocence before all the heartbreak and hardships and just bullshit that accompanies adulthood. When life was about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Sega Genesis, Michael Jordan. When my greatest tragedy was that my beloved Buffalo Bills lost yet another Super Bowl. I think about that little guy often, his wonder, curiosity, simplicity. How much joy was derived from just playing, how simple it all was before the barrage of expectations, demands, and anxieties struck down upon me in this bizarre stage most people refer to as adulthood. I know I can’t go back to that time and place. But I can certainly learn something from him. My eyes are capable of being filled with a similar kind of wonder. I can learn how to play again.

I’ve stopped drinking, but I’m not sure that I changed much. 

Don’t get me wrong - the small things about not drinking are really nice. I don’t spend days with general nausea or that horrible tight headache at the base of my skull where it meets the back of my neck. I don’t think about drinking and when to start drinking in the evenings and how much I’m going to drink on a particular night. I have probably saved a lot of money from not buying alcohol. 

However, after several months sober, I’m realizing that being alcohol-free is just the baseline of where I need to be. To climb up above the baseline, I need to develop habits that grow me in the direction I want to go. I need to cultivate the conditions for me to thrive. I don’t know exactly what this looks like, and I’m having really one horrible week, but hopefully I’ll get closer in the coming months.

During this time of limited entertainment in the freezing cold I had a few victories I wanted to share. 

For starters, I was not tired, hung over, or irritable. I was alert and able to take care of and enjoy quality time with my son and SO without any distractions. I did not immediately think ""bourbon makes you warmer"" and drink the days away. 

I was able to go to drive to the store and wait in line for supplies. While in line to get into the grocery store I had to stand in front of the liquor store I used to frequent. An older gentlemen pulled in and paid no attention to the long line for groceries. Instead he went into the liquor store and left with all he needed. I couldn't help but see my future self of I would not have stopped drinking. Rushing out to get liquor and have nothing to show for the entire week. 

My final victory was when bringing water to my mother in laws house. She invited me to stay a while since she just had power restored. She offered me bourbon knowing it was my favorite. I simply said no thank you I stopped due to starting to love bourbon a bit too much. And that was it. No awkward moment or judgment. 

I made it through a stressful week of freezing cold and boredom. I had some laughs and our first ""camp"" experience with my 2 year old. I had my whits about me and was the rock my SO and family needed. I would not have traded that for the bottle or more I would have otherwise drank. I'm grateful to be where I am today.

From there I never made it past a week except earlier last year. Come legal age, it was nightly. A few years later, all day every day. Spaced apart so i was never truly drunk unlike my younger days but a drink every 45 to 60 minutes still adds up over a day.

Truth is i was tired of it for a while. Here is where I mention I'm epileptic. I get seizures when I quit even if I only drink a week or 2 and rather bad. The periods end in massive doses of phenobarbital and then a librium taper, usually followed by relapse.

So why is 105 days significant? Well I have seizures no matter what, just not as bad as after a binge. That would always lead me to drinking because alcohol would give me a little reprieve. My last record was about 100 days. I was determined to beat it.

I finally found a doctor that believed I didn't want to drink. Aside from working with my other doctors on my epilepsy he gave me a script for emergency meds for if I need to stop clusters of seizures. It has been a godsend as they say.

No, seizures aren't the only reason I get urges. I used to drink to party and have fun. Lately when people are stressing me out I still find myself wanting to get smashed. A different kind of drinking. More like fuck it I wanna just get drunk so I can be an idiot too. Doesnt help a couple roommates drink.

But, I've been maintaining control and pushing those thoughts away. My wife has stuck with me from quitting heroin to finally quitting alcohol for what I believe to be for good this time. I dont get violent with her but I still feel guilty. Guilty that I'm slowly killing myself. Without her I wouldn't be here. She didn't guilt me. I felt it naturally. She never pushed me. She would even drive to get it for me knowing from the H I would stop when I was ready. She has been supportive and without that I can easily see myself being a cliche drunk homeless guy from a bad movie.

I've a pretty bad fatty liver. Was borderline almost screwed. Constantly puking, stomach pains, random bruising all over. ALT and AST floating around the 500 to 600s every test. Bad enough I could drink one day and still test drunk days later even sober. Even breathalyzers would register the alcohol, not just blood tests.

I'm happy to say as of a couple weeks ago my liver function is basically normal. Enzymes are normal. Need to get another ultrasound in a month or two but the fatty liver should be working on clearing itself up. Luckily I didn't hit alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. 

So 105 days. Literally the longest alcohol free time in half my life. Here's to 105 more, 1050 more, 10500 more and so on.

I don't miss it. I used it as an escape. Whether from medical things or wanting to hide from life annoyances or anger it was mostly an escape. I've been learning to cope though. All is going well.

I see some of you posting that it is day 1, 3 whatever. You're at the hardest part. Just stick it out. You'll almost definitely be happy you did. The urges may not go away completely but they will die down and you'll be able to remind yourself it is not worth it.

#4 - I’m starting to find joy in things that don’t involve drinking. Before I quit, I thought every activity had to include alcohol to be fun. That was a lie. 

#5 - I don’t feel guilty anymore about being drunk in front of my kids.

#6 - it feels like a new adventure. A new change with endless opportunities and possibilities. I’m no longer shackled to a bottle. 

#7 - I have not lost weight, but I have been pigging out on sugary snacks and drinks and have not gained any weight. 

#8 - mental clarity. I know this sounds weird but before I quit drinking I felt like I had brain fog 247. I could never come up with words to describe something, also forgetful. That’s gone.
 
There are a few cons like dealing with things that I’ve been avoiding by drowning myself in alcohol for years but heyyy those things need to be addressed anyways.

(post contains season 5 spoilers),"Hey all! So season 5 of Summer House started airing on Bravo 2 weeks ago and I was wondering how watching this new season was going to feel to me now that I’ve stopped drinking. After my kids go to bed in the evening I enjoy my adult shows, especially a little trashy reality TV (thank you, Bravo). This show is about a group of 30-ish single New Yorkers who rent a summer house together in the Hamptons for all the summer weekends and proceed to host parties, drink, interact, and of course drama ensues. If this type of show is not your thing I get it but I enjoy the mindless nature of it and how it’s wildly different from my life. To each their own. Anyway I saw new episodes on my DVR and was excited, and then I remembered that I’m a different person now and I was wondering how it would feel to me watching this behavior. In season 4, Carl’s behavior while blackout drunk was becoming increasingly erratic and concerning, including day drinking and pre-gaming, and having his work negatively affected, so I was really pleasantly surprised to see Episode 1 starting out with Carl recognizing that he had a problem with alcohol and had been “mostly sober” for 4-5 months. I can’t imagine spending 6 straight weeks (their Covid adjustment this season) in a party house, but he’s communicated to his friends/housemates about his issues and that he’s not drinking, and really seems to be setting himself up for success with accountability. Most of us know that admitting we have a problem with alcohol and getting accountability in our daily lives is incredibly difficult but I’m so excited to see this becoming more mainstream! I think this is crucial for decreasing the shame surrounding people who have a problem with alcohol. In Episode 2 Carl’s mother gets married and Carl and the housemates attend via Zoom and then Carl does have a sip of champagne so maybe that’s where his “mostly sober” definition comes in, but it’s so beautiful to see his excitement for his mom and him being present and purposeful in his actions while celebrating, instead of just getting trashed. That episode also gives airtime to his new heathy habits, such as making his bed every day and drinking lots of water, as well as enjoying how much better he feels and looks with his glowing skin. Even though his housemates are still drinking, no one is giving him a hard time or pressuring him to drink, they all seem to be supportive and really respect his commitment. I’m definitely going to keep watching and keep rooting for Carl. Like someone else’s post this week about Sia’s song “Chandelier” I think the awareness and inclusion for people who are getting/staying sober helps all of us on our journeys.

*Quick History* : Alcohol and Cannabis have been part of my identity for over a decade. It was part of my career. I spent years going to events for beer, wine and spirits. I got really good at talking the sommelier/cicerone talk. I was sought out for private functions. It felt glamorous. As time went on, the accessibility I had to alcohol made things too easy and I was losing control. I should have been fired but got out of the industry through a series of events which in hindsight I am eternally grateful for.

In recent years I drastically cut back on how much I consumed, but I still consumed both drugs every day. I would classify my recent self as the ""functional alcoholic"" as I would only touch beer and wine, and always purchased amounts I would only consumer that day after work. I could never stock a wine cooler or a beer fridge. Once the ride starts, running out was when it was over. 

Last month I cut back even more, and managed 6 weeks of weekends only.

&#x200B;

*Threshold Moment* : My threshold moment happened last weekend. I've always struggled with moodswings and depression, and believed that alcohol and cannabis could help me manage the episodes when they hit. The episodes started getting more and more intense, which I thought taking CBD would help. Last weekend was the worst state I've ever been. Maybe its the combination of the pandemic, losing my grand father, seeing my father struggle with alcoholism, uncertainties with my career, but my mental health nose dived **HARD**. 

&#x200B;

I connected with my work benefits to find a therapist. With my healthcare background, I know that my drug consumption would be the first thing recommended to change. My brain chemistry is in shambles. 

u/secretsquirrell2020 recommend Craig Becks audio book “alcohol lied to me” on this subreddit a while back, and I finally got around to grab the pdf version off their website. Talk about perfect timing. Definitely recommend it!

The amount of time I spent planning my days around alcohol and cannabis consumption, with the false reasoning that it wasn't an issue as I was never ""that drunk or high"" … the amount of money I spent … the amount of time I wasted … I am done with it all.

Then I just decide I want to drink and I can’t pinpoint why that happens. Sometimes it’s a day, other times a week, other times months. I frequently question why I’m doing it. My mind is always pointing out that it’s not very fun, and I would rather be sober. I make notes to remind myself to be better. But then again, the next day, I’m drinking.

I have had problems with my drinking off and on for my entire adult life (so about 20 years now.) I have been sober for years at a stretch during that time, but I always eventually seem to slide back into it.

This past year has been (for me and I'm sure everyone else) really bad, and my drinking has been the worst it has ever been. I'm home all day alone with the kids now and guess what, drinking during the day a lot of days now too. I'm so ashamed to admit that, but it's true.

I don't know what came over me last Saturday. I was drunk by dinnertime when my husband came home on Friday, and I was just wracked with guilt for everything. The house was a mess, my kids (7 and 13) are basically without adult supervision, it's just a bad scene. So I woke up on Saturday and vowed that this was it. I'm not drinking any more. Sat and Sun I was dealing with horrible anxiety which I know is one of my withdrawal symptoms, but I kept at it, cleaned the house really well, cooked real food, just trying to get back to the mom I know I can be when I'm sober. All this week I didn't drink, kept cleaning the house more and more, et cetera.

Yesterday, my 7 year old was jumping on the couch, fell off, and broke his arm really badly. Thank God I was sober so I could react appropriately to this and call 911 and deal with the paramedics, the doctors, et cetera. Thank God my house wasn't a total pig sty when the EMTs came in. Thank God everything is going to be okay with my son. Just.

I can't stop thinking about what would have happened if I had been drunk. Would I have been ""with it"" enough to realize how badly he was injured? Would CPS have been called if they showed up and I was drunk and/or the house was a disaster? What would have happened? It scares the crap out of me and right now the idea of ever taking another drink makes me feel queasy because I feel like I narrowly escaped possibly completely destroying my life and my family. Escaped it by 5 days. Too close. Way too close. And I hope I never forget what I feel like right now, and that for the rest of my life I remember that if I start drinking again, I am opening us all up to that kind of pain and chaos.

My son is going to be okay, and he has a sober mama to take care of him while he heals. Thank God.

There is just this emptiness inside of me. An emptiness I don't know how to fill. An emptiness that eats at me from the inside. Who else here feels this? 

*Where did you start?* 

*What did you do?* 

*How did it go?*

For too many years, I filled this emptiness with booze.  Then I gave up the booze, and I tried to fill it with other things.  I was succeeding, until I failed.  Last night, I drank.  I threw away 200+ days.

It isn't the lack of human contact.  In the UK, we're ""locked down"", but I still see my two sons for half of every week, and my girlfriend and her kids every week.  I speak to people every day.

It isn't outside interests. I play guitar.  Sometimes I convince myself I'm pretty good.  I write, I draw.

It isn't lethargy.  I run 20-25 miles each week. 

It isn't religion.  I'm agnostic, and I am comfortable with my choices.  I have no burning issues I wish to address to God.

It isn't even my ""life"", taken overall.  I am genuinely happier than I have been for years. At peace with myself. As at peace as I think I can be.

I feel it all today; the weight of those 200+ days, plus the anxiety I thought I was rid of, plus the shame of relapsing.

Maybe I don't need to fill the emptiness with anything.  Maybe this is just how I am. Maybe I need to adjust my expectations, not my reality.  Maybe we are all a bit broken.

Prior to this last weekend I had 50 days, those 50 days were my first real attempt at being alcohol free. I’m realizing I made it pretty hard on myself by basically white knuckling it with no support. No therapy, stopped checking in with this subreddit, no literature, etc. Just basically decided to wing it, but that didn’t allow me to understand the reasons why I was drinking or to learn coping mechanisms/new skills for cravings. 

Once things started to feel really good around 50 days, I thought surely I could have a couple drinks to celebrate. I am now reading about the connection between alcohol and dopamine, and understanding that this was basically my unconscious mind tricking me into thinking alcohol would enhance my good state of mind; when in fact it will ruin it. 

So I’m going to do some things differently this time around: 

-Signed up for therapy with a therapist with experience in addictions and anxiety 

-Started reading This Naked Mind (last time I read maybe a chapter then just put it down. I don’t know why. But this time I’m going to hold myself accountable to reading some every day.) 

-Ordered some other literature: Quit Like A Woman, The Body Keeps The Score (more for general trauma), We Are The Luckiest

-I am going to hold myself accountable to check in with this sub every couple days 

-Support group: I’m considering maybe checking out SMART recovery groups, but I’m not sure. I really don’t think AA is for me. I think I want to discuss this with the therapist and get her opinion. 

Let me know if you have any other insights that could for support and holding myself accountable.

I realized at some point last night that, sometimes at least, I don’t have just one chattering monkey in my mind though, I have a large, rollicking troop of them! Some are relatively calm and harmless, but then there are the rambunctious teens causing all sorts of noise and the insecure, crying baby monkeys. And they’re all running around madly, shrieking, bouncing off trees, shaking things. You get the idea.

And these past few days (days 9 and 10 for me), they’ve been particularly hard to ignore. They’re different from the Beast/Wolfie/Voldemort voice, mind you. They don’t necessarily want or need me to drink. They just want to be heard or entertained or soothed or paid attention to.

It's exhausting.

I’d like most of them to wander off into someone else's mind and for those that remain to chill the f\*\*\* out. Without wine -- whose one superpower (that still works for me, at least some of the time) is to shut them up for an hour or two. OK, maybe the wine doesn't exactly shut them up. Maybe it just stuffs some cotton in my ears and gives me a pair of blinders so I can more easily ignore them. Don’t get me wrong. I know it is absolutely NOT worth the trade-offs and the terrible price I pay after that first hour or two when the buzz gets replaced with feeling hot, woozy, disgusted with myself, and desperate to keep drinking everything I can get my hands on. But I do think it’s important for me to acknowledge one of the main  reasons I’ve given The Beast so much power over me for so many years.

It shuts the f\*\*ing monkeys up, however briefly!

I wanted to open up about my progress with quitting drinking so far, the ups and downs I've experienced and my new optimism on life looking forward.

I'd like to start with a little bit of a backstory. I'm 30 years old and been drinking heavily since I was 18. I've never been an all day everyday drinker but a heavy binge drinker on weekends, events, social gatherings and every other excuse to drink. My goal was always to get drunk and rarely I failed at that. My father is still a heavy alcoholic, I grew up around him getting drunk all the time and parties he had for his friends and family. With that influence, and media influencing me, by the time I entered adulthood I already considered partying and drinking the height of socializing. 

The only time I ever felt normal was when I was drinking or drunk. I always considered myself an anxiety riddled, depressed and grumpy person and just chalked it up as my lot in life. But when I drank, all those feelings went away. I was normal, I was liked, I felt like laughing and having fun and everything felt relaxed. But then the hangover would happen, and for the next several days I would feel like my brain was pickled, that I was the biggest loser, my anxiety made me nervous to talk to anyone and I just felt like a grumpy prick wherever I went. Then I'd take another drink, and the cycle was created.

That went on for, well, 11 years almost. I'm skimming over a whole lot of specifics because I've had plenty of bad times while drunk that I refused to see, hurting my girlfriends, family, getting into fights, losing jobs... none of that mattered in wake of my addiction. I'll speed things up and get to the tilting point of my viscous alcohol circle; In November 2019 I got into a vehicle accident. I rolled my truck off the highway after a snow storm. Luckily I only suffered minor bruises, my truck was a complete write off, I wasn't drunk or had been drinking (very thankful) but when the police dropped me off at the place I was staying I got incredibly drunk to numb the shock. I spent the next 5 days drunk. It got to the point when I went back to work after that binge I was having panic attacks, I was extremely irritated and exhausted and scared of my own mind. I knew deep down in my subconscious mind something had to change. 

I started to eat better, and get more exercise. I cut back on my drinking, I think I made it like a month. I never intended to quit drinking but I knew alcohol wasn't helping me. I started to do yoga and completed a couple months of yoga ""journeys"". Everything was going good, my mood felt better, I had more energy but I would still binge booze on the weekends with friends. My crappy mood, lethargy and anxiety slowly creeped back into my life. I'd falter on my ""new life"" and my old habits worsened. Back to the old, anxiety riddled, no confidence, depressed, emotional me. This continued up til September of 2020 where I had a massive argument with my boss at work. Mind you, he was in the wrong that got proven later, but I realized the way I blew up that  I was in no fit state of mind to be at work and I needed help.

I got therapy and was prescribed an anti anxiety medication. I took in total three months off work to better myself. I spent everyday with my dog, going on walks and letting the medication start to work its magic. I stopped drinking again, because I knew it wasn't helping but, as you guessed it, that only lasted about a month and I started binging with friends. I completed my therapy and went back to work.

New Years Eve rolls around, and I rang in the new year drunk as a skunk. Spent the first day of the year sick. I got better the next day and the day after I got drunk as a skunk again with a coworker. A couple days later I'm back at work, feeling tired, irritated, semi-anxious, moody. At this point I was starting to get a grasp on whats causing me to feel so poor. I always knew alcohol was pretty bad but never had any information taught to me so I looked up something to read and came across Alcohol Explained. I was completely absorbed by the book. Not everything related to me, but a lot of it did, and I found myself nodding in agreement to what the author was saying. I realized I needed to stop before I destroy my brain and my body. I'm tired of being numb to emotions and being apathetic to everyone around me. 

I haven't had a sip of alcohol since January 5th 2021. It hasn't always been easy. Within a week I noticed my mood was stable, my thoughts clear, my nervous thought patterns lowered, my sleep habits better. Some of my weight started to fall off. Then a few weeks in I noticed my energy was extremely low, I had a hard time sleeping for shift work on days, that I would come home and be exhausted. I think that's my body getting used to running without all the added stimulants in my system. The last few days has been great, I feel great and looking to the future with new optimism. 

I owe it to myself to stay sober, for my future family, my family, for my dog, for my health, and to my coworkers. I am thankful for everyday that I didn't drink. I am thankful for all you wonderful people posting on this subreddit sharing your experiences. Thank you for reading my journey and I'm looking forward to the future sober.

Two months ago my evening would have looked like this: after work pick up my kid, drive to a supermarket to get groceries and wine, obviously. I would hang up my jacket and rummage in the drawer for a bottle-opener. And start drinking and “relaxing”. In about an hour I would possibly be tipsy enough not to be caring about what’s for dinner. This is mommy quality time! Wine o’clock! My son would ask what’s for dinner and I’d throw a pizza in the oven (we are healthy eaters but fridays, not so much). I would eat a slice, then revert back to sipping wine. The first bottle would be finished quite quickly, as if it were a starter. It could be that I had bought a 3 liter box, which I would not be able to finish, but I would do my best, as a true trooper. I would be nodding off on the sofa at around 22-23, while my hubby would have entertained our kid. 

I am now stone cold sober instead. I picked up my kid, we went grocery shopping together and got lots of yummy stuff. I bought us some good quality steaks.

I never lost a job--and in fact, have been relied on at work--never drank and drove, or any of the other pitfalls that I could easily have fallen into. I'm writing this in case there's anybody lurking out there who might be considering quitting *despite holding it together*. I say it's worth it.

Starting in late college and continuing until a couple of months ago, I was drinking nearly every night. It started with a glass or two of red wine, then a couple years later two or three a night, and a couple years later later three or four a night. Then four a night. And four was a bottle. But at least I was watering the wine, as the ancient Greeks, the Romans, and the Medieval Europeans did! Oh, wait...that's still a whole empty bottle. Also, none of those cultures were famed for their good decision-making.

Ah, but I was smart. I wasn't going to let it get the best of me. I switched to beer, instead, because I wouldn't be tempted to have more! Obviously, though, it wouldn't be rat's piss beer. I'd have to get something that tasted good--oops. One bottle became two became three in the course of a year. I could at least hold myself to three, because half of a six-pack was ridiculous enough (I told myself, feeling guilty and assuaging the guilt with some beer the next night). Of course, some nights--if I was feeling bad--maybe I'd have a whole six-pack. But at least it was only one six-pack a week! Until it was two. Or two and a bottle of wine. Or two packs and two bottles a week.

Well, crap. I had to show it who was boss! My new smart idea: switch to liquor. There was no *way* I could possibly be tempted to overdo it on that garbage! Hah! And I'd carefully measure the amounts, too. What a brilliant plan! As will come as a surprise to absolutely no one reading this, one shot a night became two a night became three became four. I never went beyond four...well, except maybe to have a beer or two! Why not, amirite? (No, no I wasn't right.)

During this decade and change, I was doing fine at work, but hey--I'm a workaholic. That was never going to be a problem unless things got disastrously bad. But I didn't really have any close friends, I stopped working on my hobbies, and I was in near-constant emotional distress that I tried (and often failed) not to let anybody see.

A few years ago, I started working on my emotional baggage and developing friendships some. Grew up a lot, became a lot calmer and a lot kinder (if I may say so myself). But still drinking, still exhausted all the time from working myself too hard and then following it up with way too much booze, then repeating the next day and the next.

COVID hit, and I weathered 2020...but was drinking even more than previously. I was under a lot of stress, I was worried about my family and friends and colleagues, I was picking up extra load at work because I'm a workaholic and that's what I do, but it still leaves me drained...great excuses.

A couple of months ago, I decided to get healthy, just because. I've been losing weight, I cut out drinking, I've been trying not to work all the time.

Quitting drinking has been amazing. Granted, the other things have helped a lot, too, but there's a lot I can lay at this particular door. My mood every day is improved--being a perfectionist, I still nag myself really hard about any mistake I make, but it's been much easier to shut down the extreme self-blame for trivial things--I have so much more energy and sleep better, I'm not just a useless lump drinking and vegging out to YouTube videos when I get home. Now I do things like, I dunno, cook for myself, take walks, read, watch movies, do things I enjoy, clean up the apartment (it's actually organized, for the most part!), write letters to friends in distant parts, and more. Even at work things are improved: I still do very well, but it's a much more chill, less intense experience (and I don't have to waste the effort to make it *seem* less intense).

I had really, really strong cravings for the first couple of weeks, but the difference in daily experience was so shocking starting around day three or four that I was able to stick with it just to feel *actually good*. Lurking on this subreddit helped a lot, too, especially early on. I just passed the two month mark on Tuesday. I'm in Texas, so I can tell you that I would've spent the last few days drinking because I wasn't working. Instead, I've been reading, cooking, and walking around town.

My original plan was just to cut out drinking long enough to improve my overall health, but quitting has made such an improvement in my life that I've decided to quit forever. True, it means that I have to accept that I have yet another flaw keeping me from that unattainable perfectionist ideal--when I drink, I drink too much. But that's okay. Some weaknesses you can fix once you're aware of them. Others can't be fixed, but once you know of them, you can work around them. Addiction, even high-functioning addiction, is one that can't be fixed and will only get worse if not addressed, so the solution is simply not to drink--and that's how you beat this thing.",19,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4283383}"

Unrelated to the DWI, the girl I had been seeing for the past 3 months broke things off this morning. I saw it coming. Over the past week she went instantly distant. From talking for 2-3 hours a day to nothing. Zero communication except maybe 1 world answers to a text, hours or a day after I simply said good morning. I was trying to talk to her so I could tell her about the DWI, but she didn't want to talk. This morning I got a message saying she can't make time for me and I (as in me, not her) deserve better, or something. That sort of canned response. Very disappointing, but after a week of no comms, I expected it. Still sucks though.

Additionally, my job requires me to report any arrest, which I did reluctantly. Got suspended pending investigation. I don't drive for them and I work remotely anyway, no clearance or anything, so there shouldn't be any real reason to fire me. But It's just another unknown added to my pool of anxieties. 

Days 6-8 are historically the hardest for me when I would take a month off to 'reset' or when I stopped drinking for a year.

The stress involved with my job, their care, and feeling like a single father when she's working just compounds the issue, so I use booze to relax.

She had a bad experience (as did I, so another point of affiliation) and wrote it off forever. Hopefully my shared experience can offer her optimism and direction.

Went out to pick up some weekend supplies earlier - sweets/candy, cans of pop, fancy cereal. Booze distractions basically. Grabbed a quick coffee on my way back from my favourite place (supporting local business!). As I got back to my front door I was, ahem, well, desperate for the toilet.

Suddenly I had a very vivid flashback to all the times I've stood swaying on my doorstep, fumbling around with my keys trying to get through the door and make it to the bathroom after a night out drinking. I then recalled all the times I didn't quite make it...

I used to think this was funny. Never told anyone of course, and never got caught. But somehow because I got away with it I thought it was amusing. A grown adult pissing themselves on their own f**king porch. Seriously. How messed up does your relationship with alcohol have to be for you to see things like that as normal, acceptable behaviour?! 

Anyway, safe to say there was no risk of history repeating itself today. And nor will there ever be.

After a tumultuous few months last week I moved into a sober living home. Had you told me two years ago that I would have actually LIKED being in a place like this I would have called you crazy.

But its been pretty chill.

When I got here my roommate was the kindest person I've met in a long time. He knew I didnt have much and so he took me to dinner the first night and then to Walmart and gave me $60 to spend on supplies.

Over the first few days he checked on me constantly. We had long conversations about each others lives. He made me feel at ease.

Then the day before yesterday he comes home from seeing a friend. He proceeds to lock himself in the bathroom for over an hour. Repeated attempts to get him to come out and move his vehicle (was blocking some of us in) were met will yelling he would be out in a minute. 

Some of us went to a meeting and when we got back he was very subdued. Yesterday morning I wake up to him packing telling me he'd been kicked out.

This place has been VERY clear from the moment I first had contact it was zero tolerance. We ger breathalized every day or when there is even the slightest suspicion. Random UAs. They can't let anyone slip up and get a pass, as that would just tell everyone else they could too.

He left and I already miss him.

It sucks that this disease can hit us so bad that even knowing he was going to be homeless, and knowing he would 99% chance be caught, he still did what he did.

I'm not really asking anything I guess. Just venting. Because the insanity of this is that this situation has triggered cravings. I'm not really in danger (this moment) of a relapse but I figured it was healthier to rant a little than keep it bottled up.

2. A friend from work has been sober since July 2020, though she has never disclosed any particular issues with alcohol, if they can do it then why can't I.
3. I have put on a lot of weight since this time last year and I am sure that it is largely because of the frequent bottles of wine (or at least not helped by that)
4. I am probably at the best point in my life socially to stop drinking, 1) because of the lockdown and 2) because I can't think of any of my friends that would have any issue with it like they might have done in the past.
5. I took up rollerskating recently and there's no way that I could drink and do that, and it's really fun without having to drink.
6. I caught up with a friend a while ago who used to be a big drinking buddy. We haven't spoke in a while and she said that she can't remember the last time she woke up after a night out not being able to remember the night before.

I have been lurking in this sub for a while but never found the courage to post anything.

For a few years now I have been drinking way too much and this is like my 100th time to try to stop. Everytime I seriously try to stop drinking, I find some dumb excuse to start again.

Like last December, I seriously tried to stop and went to get my liver checked out by the lab. I managed to not drink any alcohol for about a week until I got my test results. My liver is actually fine even after years of drinking 3 beer every evening but instead of thanking the gods for my good fortune my dumb brain took this as in invitation to start drinking again.

I feel like I lack the self control to stop and don't know what to do anymore. I considered getting professional help but in person therapy is banned at the moment because of covid and honestly I also lack the courage to tell anyone. Not even my closest friends and family know because I am ashamed.

I’m thankful for that and have no plans to go back. But recently I have been thinking I would like to stop drinking too. I have been careful about cross-addiction and fortunately my drinking has not spiraled out of control as I’ve been getting clean from weed. I’ve been drinking on average one to two nights a week since I quit smoking weed.

Doesn’t sound too bad on paper, so why do I feel I need to quit? Well ultimately I feel it’s pretty maladaptive behavior. I drink for the escape, I drink for a buzz, to shut my mind up. I drink alone and I don’t give a shit. I have a lot of regret about my career that I’m running from, also general loneliness, and this goddamn pandemic is not exactly helping the latter. I am not really happy with my life, I’m not sure I ever have been. I still have hope for the future but escapism isn’t going to help me with my goals. 

Even though I find alcohol much easier to control than weed in terms of cravings and frequency of use, I have this unpleasant feeling like I’m just living for the next high, the next time I can escape reality. I have hobbies I enjoy, I’m taking care of myself mentally and physically, I’ve learned a lot about myself in my journey to quit weed. I’ve come a long way in my ability to try to enjoy my life, but here I am still fundamentally unhappy and still seeking escape from reality. Maybe it’s depression, I don’t really know, but I don’t really have the typical symptoms of depression.

To be perfectly honest, living life 100% sober without any kind of escape sounds terrifying. Or maybe terrifying is the wrong word. It just sounds shitty. Boring. I spent so long deriving my “fun” from getting fucked up, now I’m supposed to just completely and permanently alter my definition of “fun” like it’s no big deal? I don’t know where I’m going with this. I want to quit and that probably is the right path to contentment and peace, but I’m just fucking pissed at my brain, at my DNA, at fate, whatever. What kind of shit luck is this to end up with a brain that’s so fucking hard to please? What do you want from me you pink worthless sponge? Why has regular reality never been good enough for you?

“Before we begin today,” my therapist said, “I need you to clarify something for me. That night at the hospital you kept saying ‘my head’s not working right.’ What did you mean by that?” I had given this some thought myself. “Have you ever read Poe’s The Black Cat,” I asked. A bit incredulous, she said “the story where he kills his wife and conceals her behind a wall in his basement.” “That’s the one,” I remarked. Looking somewhat concerned and shifting nervously, she began to say that she didn’t follow but I had retrieved my laptop and begun reading a passage. “The fury of a demon instantly possessed me,” I intoned, “I knew myself no longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body; and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fiber of my frame.” 

&#x200B;

I thought this was a sufficient explanation requiring no further elaboration. But after a long, tense pause she asked, “I don’t understand, are you saying that you hurt…” “What? I exclaimed, “God no. I’m saying that I was demented, made mad by the amount of alcohol I was consuming.” That when combined with the insomnia and stress, I had lost my mind. She asked how much I had been drinking. “Four bottles of wine a day, give or take.” “Give or take?” she looked shocked. Even I was startled when I heard the words tumble out of my mouth. 

&#x200B;

As we delved back into the other needs that remained to be discussed, she began to understand why I invoked Poe to explain my predicament. Take, for instance, The Need to Fit In, “to feel like others in important ways.” I had been drinking so much that, like the protagonist in The Black Cat, I had become divorced from society. So much so that my understanding of reality had become radically distorted, a severe disorientation compounded by my solitary existence as a grad student who had no obligations other than to write something every so often while marooned in my apartment. “It is important to find people who share what is meaningful to us,” the document explains, “This has a way of confirming and consolidating our own sense of who we are.” Now, if we form a sense of who we are through meaningful relationships with others, if we construct one another, I had no god damn clue who I was. Rather than consolidating a sense of self, I was fragmenting, rendered a collection of shards that didn’t quite fit back together. “These experiences help us in the creation of our identity.” I thought long and hard on the concept of identity. I came up blank.

&#x200B;

There are other basic requirements such as the Need to Be Effective, which relates to having a sense of power or agency, and the Need to Feel Safe or secure, a sense of safety or comfort derived from faith or convictions. But I was more concerned with the Need to Disagree without Losing Support. While deep in drink I had absolutely no control over my emotions. I was textbook passive-aggressive, known for being so mercurial that people were weary of me and thus incapable of fully engaging me for fear that they might upset me. I was wrathful when drinking, with chips firmly on both shoulders. I could be enraged, seeing only red. Certainly not murderously so like in Poe, but I did seem possessed by “the fury of a demon.” I lacked “the ability to disagree with those that support us without them withdrawing support from us and becoming non-responsive to us when we oppose them in some way.” On a fundamental level, I was incapable of doing this. Of moderating or controlling my emotional responses to anything or anyone I found disagreeable. I was, as a former girlfriend called me, a ticking timebomb. 

&#x200B;

“We need to know,” the paper continues, “that those who care about us and who we care about will not turn away from us or withdraw their love from us when we disagree or get angry at them.” It’s healthy to disagree, to have a difference of opinion. But I can’t recall a time when I had a constructive or at least respectful argument with someone when I was drinking the way that I was. Any conflict or critique, however minor, was a declaration of war to me. I drove away so many people who loved and cared for me, and I don’t blame them for leaving, for withdrawing. The ability to disagree while feeling safe doing so “encourages self-expression and individuation.”  I could express myself alright, just not in a way anyone would consider appropriate by any standard. The notion of individuation, well, there wasn’t much about this that was appropriate either. 

&#x200B;

I feel much more capable these days navigating and maintaining healthy relationships, not only with others but with myself. I’ve always struggled a bit with “fitting in” or finding my place, but I do feel a stronger sense of self. I’m far more intact psychologically speaking, enough to wrestle with those thorny questions regarding identity and try to figure out who the hell I am. And with sobriety has come a degree of emotional balance. The difference is night and day. I used to be hysterical, creating so much drama and inflicting so much undue stress and pain. Now I strive to be measured, and value composure and poise. I want to be graceful, whatever the circumstances. I’m liking this new person I’ve become and I think others do to. 

&#x200B;

I’ve reached out to her a couple times but for the most part I’ve been doing things on my own.

She has had a history of relapsing many times since she’s started her sober journey. I don’t judge. I can usually tell when she’s drinking. She has severe mental illness and a habit of getting into very tumultuous relationships. When things get too hard she relapses. Like clockwork. She’ll just say “I had to.” Like she has no choice.

When it comes to assisting me she will tell me that it’s not worth it. That I shouldn’t drink. In the past when I was struggling and failing to stay sober she’d tell me it was ok. That I had a good enough reason to drink. Now that I’ve got a streak going, she tries to inspire me to keep going. I just wish she could do the same for herself.

Now on top of keeping myself sober, I’m trying to help her through her divorce and provide support but I can only do so much. I know I’m my priority. But I feel like I already lost my only sober friend because she will so quickly relapse due to her inability to sustain a stable life for herself. I know that I will never understand what it is like to have such a severe mental illness, to have so little help and support from family and to be stuck in a cycle of being drawn to people that aren’t good to be with.

Sorry just ranting. I see all of you posting such wonderful things about how much you have benefitted from sobriety, and I am sitting here like a sourpuss, complaining about it. 

I guess one blessing is that work has gotten insanely busy and I am working really long hours, and I don't think I would be able to manage it hungover. On the other hand, it's hard to not have wine when I am facing a long evening of doing boring stuff at the computer. I used to let myself have wine to compensate if I had to work late, to make it less boring. (These aren't strategic, thoughtful tasks). Now I can barely keep my butt in my chair - I'm constantly running down to the kitchen for another beverage - La Croix, coffee, decaf, etc etc etc.

It’s the two year anniversary of my brother-in-laws funeral - he was killed in action a couple years ago. Thanks for the early morning grim reminder, Timehop, but it’s manageable. 

But then I had to say a hard goodbye to my little baby boy. I’ve been venting about this moment in the DCIs the last few days. I am moving out Saturday from a toxic living situation with my ex who is an active alcoholic. It’s a thing that needs to happen for my own sanity and sobriety. But I’ll be leaving behind a piece of me. A gigantic piece of me, and I am terrified of a future without this kid. At this moment, I don’t see a point in staying sober, a piece of me doesn’t even see a point in staying “here.” My entire life revolved around him as soon as I found out she was pregnant. The moment I held him in the hospital, I was changed and I don’t know who I am or who I will be without him by my side. While his mom was out drinking, I was the one raising him, taking care of him whenever he was sick, sleeping next to him every night. He’s at his dads for the rest of the week/weekend, and although I’ve been assured that I will get some sort of visitation, I know that it will never be the same again. It’s for the best, it’s the right thing to do, but god damn does it hurt. I feel empty and hollow and overwhelmingly sad. 

So I’ve been packing and crying and getting through the day. I can do this. And then I found a stash of pot I forgot about. My last drink was April 22, 2017, but I’ve only been truly clean and sober since January 22. Finding it was all it took to start planning my relapse for both. Before I could, I got a call from one of my AA buddies to let me know that another lady in our zoom home group had a massive heart attack earlier this week and is not expected to make it. This lady has been so kind and loving and patient with me in my very short time back in AA. She’s been sober about a year, she works so hard at her sobriety and helping others and spreading the message that you can get better, all is not lost. 

I got rid of my stash, there’s no alcohol in the house. There’s no chance of a relapse tonight. But I sit here thinking what the fuck is the point.

There's a few factors that led me here, but none are really an excuse, more like an explanation, and in hindsight should have warned me that I needed to probably start making sure I didn't get to where I'm at. Currently don't know how to motivate myself to drink less while I figure out my life's mess.

I got out of an abusive relationship with my ex last year due to a wonderful woman who I befriended, and now am looking to marry. It's a bit fast of a turn around, but this woman has helped me realize what's not healthy and that I haven't really had a healthy relationship with even my parents. She's accepted me into her life and the life of her family, and nothing else has felt quite like home, so for her I'm ever grateful.

The ex she helped me leave I knew I needed to a while before I did, and I just wasn't sure how to. She'd always promise to do things with me that I wanted to do with her, as long as I did her stuff first, which always resulted in her feeling ill or not up to doing my thing after, which made me not want to try to do anything at all with her, let alone myself. I'd try to do things like record videos, make music, really anything I wanted to do, but I couldn't get past saying I wanted to do a thing before she got me to stop that to help her with anything, which usually resulted in me just looking at her doing the thing and wondering why I couldn't leave if she had it covered.

My mom is the kind of person who only likes to talk good of me or anything I do to other people for the sake of making herself look like a patron saint of social media and most recently told me that u shouldn't worry about my current predicament (which I'll get to later) because she lost two pounds on Jenny Craig. She took over a bar from my grandma, and when selling it procured the alcohol from it, to give it to me because she doesn't drink and thinks my dad is some sort of an alcoholic (dunno the logistics of that, and also not this story I don't think).

The last few years I've had to deal with trying to be myself still while recovering from a car accident that took my job from me (I'm fine aside from minor back stuff that flares up once in a while) and through that I realize now I've been taken advantage of by my ex for above mentioned reasons, and also come to terms with the reality that my mom is a manipulative person in ways I still am finding out and trying to understand how to put to words, because it's abuse in one sense, but still not the big destructive types you see in the news or here usually. While my now fiance has been my rock and has been helping me realize all of this, I have been also getting help in the way of the bottle. And when you got 30 boxes of alcohol in your storage unit and a way to get there every day to and from work you don't really realize how much you consume. You don't really realize how dependant you are until you have to buy it yourself and are forced to ration due to no income. And I am bad at it.

I just went to the state my fiance lives in to be with her for a week cuz it's been a couple months since we last saw each other. I had money to get me here and back, I have a job when I get back. But weather hit and I've been here going on three weeks past when I planned. I was planning on being here come the end of March when I could get a job after dealing with my storage unit and could help with hers that it also over here. Now I have no money, no job to get me money for the last month, and have realized how dependant I am on alcohol. My last vice.

I spent the last year quitting cigarettes, I've even regressed to a few edibles once in a while vs four or more dabs a day. I feel like I'm doing alright in managing vices except this one. I don't know what to do to try to better stop my consumption cuz I don't want to have the health risks of drinking so much. I'm only 26 come next month.

No man in my family has lived to see the age of 60, they either drank themselves to death or killed themselves before that point. 

That pretty much sums up my drinking problem. It helps a lot with my bad mental health (It feels like) makes me not have to think about the issues in my head, it feels like a genuine friend to me, one that doesn't ask silly questions, that doesn't judge, that just understands.

However over the past few days I have come to the realisation that my drinking has gotten out of hand. 

I was in the store the other day, in front of the cashier, on my daily booze run. I was shaking, sweating, shaking so much that I was struggling to even get my bank card out of my wallet, the cashier gave me a look. It was at that moment I realised this cannot go on. 

I very quickly came to realise that tapering down just won't work for me, I was in bed last night, had planned that day to just have 2 bottles of beer, that turned into me going and buying yet more beer once I ran out and then crying in my pillow over my lack of control, and how gripped I currently seem to be by alcohol.

It is making me suffer now in my academic life, I am not putting in the hours I was in 1st Semester, of which got me 1sts all round. I am spending the days waiting and thinking of when I can start drinking, I am planning all of my activities around drinking, it is costing me more than money now. It is beginning to cost me my pride and success thus far. 

I am so sorry, for fuck sake I am so off and shaky at the moment from not having drank today I can't even string together a simple few fucking paragraphs. 

I seemed to have it all under control until the past few weeks, I could work and drink, hell, sometimes I would be sipping on a brandy in the pub as I got an essay done. But seemingly out of no where I am now a raging alcoholic. And one that needs help. I am going to an online AA meeting this Sunday. I am also from today not going to drink for a while at least. Tapering down won't work for me, cold turkey seems the only option.

2021-02-18 17:06:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lmyopk/today_is_one_year/,Today is one year.,"A year ago today I woke up feeling like crap.  Not even totally from alcohol either...was dealing with what everyone called the ""undiagnosed early covid"".  Plus my occasional neck spasm issues that cause me to feel like death.  I didn't feel like drinking honestly...so, I didn't.  And haven't since.  

I had started the sometimes a six pack a day or one or two before work in probably late 2015.  Things were stressful.  It was a release.  Then, in Oct of 2017 I was at the gas station and realized I had never had Brandy...and that shooter sounded like an ok way to see what it tasted like.  Well...throw in some job loss, financial stress, being lost as a person...and soon I was doing most of a bottle a day.  I quit in April of 2018, but come June a stressful event got me back on.  That escalated into 12-15 high lifes a day.  Sometimes more.  

I was never a drinker before, because I felt like crap afterwards.  But...I was amazed at how well my body adapted.  I didn't feel bad most of the time despite my tremendous intake.  But, things were going on.  High BP.  Hearing loss in one ear from that.  Neuropathy.  Blood sugar.  Weight gain.  Random pains.  Just godawful sleep.  

I don't have to tell anyone here about how it affected my relationships with people.  On one hand opening up way too much to some, being an ass to others.  People stopped talking to me and I understand.  

Honestly, I was stressing out over me opening up way too much to a gal I liked and had ran off.  Like, she showed up in my dreams bad.  I remember searching ""how to get a girl back"" videos on youtube.  That led down this rabbit hole of what would eventually lead to me finding a series of videos about the root causes of my anxiety, stress, relationship issues, drinking, etc.  I learned the why of my behavior...some of which went back to being a kid in a divorce with no real father and all the things that brings later.  But in that, I realized that not only had I been through some real stuff now and could survive most anything, I realized what it took for me recognize the triggers of drinking and not react by drinking.  

It was challenging at times.  There were days I wanted just a couple drinks to get by.  But I knew I couldn't.  And ya know, I still have issues and stresses.  But I don't let them get to me.  I handle them more responsibly.  I know I've dealt with some shit and can get through it.  

Alcohol certainly made it all worse.  The clarity of not drinking, even just a little, truly exposes how much alcohol messes with your thought processes and emotions.  ""Alcohol is a drug"" is very true.  It messes with your mind in ways you don't realize until long after.  It hijacks you.  

I'm more confident and mature than I have ever been.  I feel like a man, not a boy.  I feel like this is one of those big accomplishments in life, like college or the military or whatever...like I DID something.  But...I have also moved on enough to not even think about alcohol most days now.  It's not in my mindset.  I don't foresee myself being one of the one more year people...I want to know, but just forget it all and live forward.  That said, I kind of woke up today like it was my birthday...an odd feeling.  

I thought I might text a select few and tell them and apologize if appropriate...I haven't done it yet...kind of that just wanting to move on in life thing...but it was a lot I put on some of them at the time...maybe I do, maybe I don't send them a message...I'll keep thinking on it.

Maybe I was just at the right point in my life for all of this to come together.  But my advice if you are trying to quit is to address the deep down root of WHY you are drinking.  I guarantee there is a reason...alcohol isn't that much fun to drink it all the time for no reason.  It will be uncomfortable and difficult for awhile...but you will see things you knew, but could never really quantify.  You will want to learn more for awhile...then start changing and adapting and not look back...and if you do, you will know why.  When you come to peace and understanding, you can then accomplish the self control that allows for a true feeling of accomplishment.",255,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.56035984}"

> ""We have the uncanny ability to unknowingly deceive ourselves."" *pg 70, end of 2nd paragraph.*

This is me right here. I'm generally speaking a pretty self aware guy. I know my faults, I know my weaknesses, I know my strengths. I knew I could handle 1 drink an hour. Except I couldn't. 

I was so sure I had the tried and true system down. It's what everyone does, so it should work for me, too. I'm a big guy, 6'4"", 240-260 lbs, depending on the season and how much I was drinking. If my 5;6"" 140lb friend could do it, then goddamnit so could I!

I'm sure this is a revelation we have all had during this next step in life, or if not, it might be one now or soon. But My brain was lying to me, trying to lump it in with other aspects about myself I was confident in and fly under the radar. And it worked. so now I'm re-assessing life in several elements. We'll see what comes from that.

Additionally, I did reach out to a few drinking buddies, who we all prided ourselves on looking out for ourselves and each other when drinking. I've let them know to beware the 1 an hour rule. It lies.

**Second Quote:**
> ""We seem to pay more attention to the side effects of ibuprofen than we do to the beverage society consumes most."" *pg 78, middle of 2nd paragraph.*

This one hit home on a strange level. My drunk logic was ""I'll have one 200mg tablet of ibuprofen for each drink I had tonight."" then when counting the beers out I'd think ""woah, that's waaay too much ibuprofen! I'll just take 4 and more in the morning. I don't want to fuck up my body!"" then a quick pat on the back for being self-aware enough to take care of my body and off to bed.

I've tried EVERYTHING for supplements to help and nothing.  

But I have recently started practicing the Wim Hof method of ice buckets for hands and feet (mon, wed, friday) and a cold shower everyday, and breath techniques. 

According to Wim by taking a cold shower we are practicing connecting with the reptilian brain that of the brain-over-body consciousness.  The Consciousness allows you to truly trust your judgement based on intuition and instinct.  Cold puts your body into a great deal of stress, so if you are able to control your mind and body throughout your ice shower you are able to control your stress and emotions better in everyday situations.  As for many of us stress is one of our tickers for cravings.  Once you have become started practicing....  The cold become the teacher.  Training our responses to extreme stress.  By following the breath and relaxing into the cold you will decrease your heart rate and lessen your anxiety.  But there is a profound courage you go into the cold.  It is merciless,  brutal and will shake you to your core.  

But let me tell you! I'm only onto week two of training and it has significantly affected my life!  Stand in the shower face the cold.  Face your fears! Then watch how it positively affects you and how you treat your addiction and every day life!

My parents were bingedrinkers when i was growing up and told me alcohol was their medicine. 
unfortunately i started drinking heavily at 13, then abusing any other substances i could get my hands on from the age of 16.

I knew in my heart from my late teens that sobriety would be best for me.

 I did a lot of stupid and shameful things under the influence, i messed up my education,  i lost friends,  mistreated family members, made a fool of myself infront of colleagues, acted promiscuously, drunk drove many times, went to work drunk many times, had blackouts weekly and ended up in hospital twice.

I had insane anxiety with every hangover but instead of stopping i had a drink to numb and blur everything 

I finally went cold turkey and stopped drinking at the age of 29 when i decided to try and get pregnant. And i haven't touched it since. 

AND I NEVER WANT TO AGAIN! 

i can't just 'have a beer' like my fiancee. I want ten, then to head out into oblivion, stay up all night then another day and another night, black out and end up in some part of the country where I'll have no idea where i am, off my face with a bunch of strangers

Dear alcohol,

You were fun. What happened? Actually, you’ve never really been. Even in college I remember regretting you. I remember standing on my porch talking to Aaron in my early 20s talking about how you aren’t worth it. Which means I’ve had that running dialog in my head for 20 years now. You weren’t a good investment physically but also mentally. You took WAY more than you have given.

Still we kept at it in my 20’s, 30’s and now 40s. Although most of my fond memories involved you, I’m becoming pretty sure they weren’t because of you. You were just there, because, well, you are everywhere.

The day after has been almost always bad. Whatever you gave to me, you took twice. Waking up in a haze, demotivated, regretful.

Speaking of regret, almost everything I regret was under your influence. Fights, embarrassing things I’ve said. Slurring my words. Behaving poorly and at times unfairly to people I care deeply about. You make me the person I don’t want to be- and it is me, but it is mainly you.

Your toll on me has only escalated. In the last 10 years I’ve seen countless doctors chasing issues that are probably in part, or in whole because of you. This has been all consuming.

Yet, I still imbibe. Why? Well, I am somewhat addicted to our toxic relationship. You used to give me hours of pleasure, and some pain after. Now you give me a sliver of relief and non-stop pain. And the sliver isn’t pleasure, just a momentary pause in the pain. 

The only answer is to separate. I don’t know if it’s a month or forever. Maybe I’ll let you join once I’m back on my feet, when you are small. So small I don’t think about you. So small that I don’t need to. So small that you are an absolute spec in my existence. But I’m not sure why I would, as you are literally toxic.

You’ve caused immense pain for many, many, many people. You’ve robbed lives, too many to count. You are literally one of the main causes of death, divorce, job loss, and abuse. You gave my sister a stroke and cost her a divorce, a job loss and then a major stroke that’s left her unable to speak. All this stress took an enormous toll on my parents, her kids and me. And you’re doing this to far too many people. The collective pain is extraordinarily sad.

Yet, you’re marketed as FUN. Refreshing. No beach, deck, sunset, party, happy moment, sad moment or accomplishment doesn’t likely involve you in our society. You’re one of the greatest lies ever told.

I didn’t like you at first, but for some reason, as soon as I started you, I immediately overindulged. And, I’ve been overindulging nearly every day since, for 20 years. You do that to people. Some more than others certainly, but it is definitely how you operate.

And here I sit. Shaking from stress chemicals released in abundance because of you. You’ve robbed me of ease, of peace and the clear headed boredom that seeds creativity. Of engaging in meaningful activities. Of joy and feeling. I speak slower. My memory is poor. I’m perpetually exhausted and googling you. I’ve become introverted with anxiety. What a mind fuck you’ve become for me.

I’ve always been one to go against the grain. And at first, I rejected you because, well, I thought drunk people behaved like idiots. I’ve always known who you are. I’m sad that I let you into my life, but glad I have an opportunity to say goodbye and good riddance. 

I look forward to re-engaging in life and returning to a present, soberish me. I’m drunk enough on life without you.

I've worked in remote sales for about 5 years, which has allowed me to visually hide from the world, slam shots of tequila, turn on that liquid-fueled confidence on the phones, and crush my sales goals. On the outside, I was professionally and financially progressing much faster than my peers. On the inside, I was stuck in Groundhog Day.

Anything and everything used to be an excuse to drink. Close a big deal? I deserve a shot of tequila. Have to call my dad? I NEED a shot of tequila. Going on a hike with friends? That sounds like way more fun after a shot of tequila. Time for a trip to Costco? Holy fucking shit where the fuck is my fucking shot of tequila. 

So here I am in my early 30s with the coping abilities of teenager. Simple things break me because I have zero experience just simply existing without alcohol. Don't get me wrong, I have good days and those days are better than I could have ever imagined. But those good days come with a looming shadow and I'm quickly crippled by the fear that this fucking noise in my brain will come back, and without alcohol to quiet it, that noise might kill me faster than another shot of tequila.

The answers usually the same that I could lose friends once I became sober.

That worried me the most, out of all the things good that sobriety could bring, losing friends would be worse. I have quit and relapsed many time over the years. Then the pandemic happened and it has really changed my life and thinking. I just want to make it clear my friends are not bad people, I have a group of 3 close friends. Two of them I can tell resent me a little for changing, for quitting drinking and therefore changing my relationship with them. The other one has her own problems with drinking and supports my sobriety. I am no longer the fun time girl that will go for a drink and then stay out with you till 2 am. I’m not down for anything and that changes thing.

I have had a lot of sad nights thinking about my relationship with these two friends. I thought we would always be a part of each others life. Maybe we still will be. But I have to accept our relationship will change. Maybe it will change forever or only a few years. It’s a hard pill to swallow and it is for me the scariest part of sobriety. But I will no longer ruin my self to hold on to these relationships. I will make new friends and I will have strong connections with sober people one day. Sobriety is so hard because it does change so much. I am committed to do doing all the fun things I said I would do while sober. Like hiking, camping, and traveling.

2021-02-18 12:53:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lmsnhk/drinking_alone/,Drinking Alone,"Drinking alone has become the biggest problem in my life - especially since the pandemic started. But even looking back to my college days almost 10 years ago - I was drinking nightly then too. I was hiding it from my roommates then (how much I would actually drink). I’d drink while they were away and I’d shop while they were away. I’d hide my fat bottles of wine behind things in the pantry so they couldn’t see how quickly I was going through the bottles. 

It took me a while to realize my problem didn’t start in the pandemic, but it started in college. It took the pandemic happening for me to begin to realize my behavior wasn’t normal. 

I had been sent to work from home with and SO who still had to go to work each day. The “wine in the tea cup” zoom meetings were what got me to start day drinking. It seemed to be this sort of social media joke and phase to actually have a spiked drink while in work meetings. But I began to start drinking throughout my days and I wasn’t even sure why I was doing it. Boredom? Depressed? 0 self control? I don’t fully know but probably all of those to an extent.

But drinking quickly became dashing to the store when my SO went to work in the morning so I could start the routine. It became multiple stops to different markets in one day. It became hiding bottles or running out to recycle them outside after I’d quickly finished them. It became passing out when I should have been working and it became speaking to co-workers while buzzed and waking up the next morning horrified that they would find out and mortified by my stupidity.

I started to physically and mentally feel myself deteriorate to the point of waking up with crippling anxiety attacks at 3 am. I knew it was because my thoughts were racing with the fear that I was killing myself “what does my liver look like?” “Wasn’t my piss and stool too off color?” “isn’t my heart beating too fast - am I having a heart attack?” “yep, web MD says I’m already dead”. I began to wake my SO up to help calm me down. One of those mornings I finally fessed up to how much I’d been drinking.

I was able to go a month without and it was honestly the best I’d ever felt in my adult life. I felt like I had a grip on myself and finally a grip on reality. Things finally felt normal and vibrant and I hate to admit that sometimes I even began to feel above those who were drinking in social settings (“hah, I have the willpower to not need that shit to have fun!”)

But once that month was up I decided to try the “moderation” method. I lasted about 3 weeks with that. And for about half a year again I began to find myself falling back to that low point I already reached.

Something recently clicked again and I’m here again. I’m feeling hopeful this time despite a few failed attempts at a restart. I’m stupid with the choices I’ve made, but I’m smart enough to know that if I continue the path I’ve been on my co workers WILL find out. My pee and stools WILL be off color. My heart rate WILL be dangerously high. Web MD WILL become right.

Drinking alone stole my happiness, my self confidence, my hobbies, and my work ethic. It’s made some of my relationships feel weird because I feel like I’ve made a fool of myself in front of the friends and family that had to put up with my texts, calls, or pregamed-self.

I hope this post will serve as a reminder to myself when the urges come creeping in. It’s not worth it and it never has been. It’s time to get the person back you were growing to love when you were sober.

I just felt like I had enough, it's time to grow up. I'm going to be 30 soon...I need to take better care of myself. I knew inside it wasn't fun anymore and this whole thing wasn't what it was when I started in college. Those days are over. I had my fun, I can close that book and open a new one now, it's okay to let it go. I'm not an alcoholic but I definitely has the building blocks to become one. Little moments like this make me appreciate that I figured this out when I did, that I'm still very young, and the only damage is psychological and be repaired. 

Regardless of whether you've struggled quitting from 1 beer a day or drinking all day every day, you're reason for quitting is valid. Keep up the good work and don't give up, you can do this. 

Stay true,

We all know the shame, the 3am anxiety, the “oh my god I did NOT do that,” that comes with our drinking. My recent drinking bout (starting in December) lead me to believe I was “drinking better” as I was experiencing less of these emotions. In reality I have been drinking mostly at home, thus reducing my likelihood for social embarrassment. That changed 2 weeks ago. 

My company did a team dinner at a beautiful outdoor farm-to-table venue. They serve only wine, but my boss brought a flask in which I indulged. I got drunk, something I swore up and down would not happen again after last summer - the first time I went too far with coworkers. 

Queue me telling a wildly inappropriate-for-work story about my youth that involves me, guns, Mexican military, and a human trafficker. * Important to note * I never have been, nor will ever be, a good story teller. I can only imagine the sighs, the looks, the embarrassment-by-proxy that moved around the table as I held them hostage with my memory vomit. 

Dinner ended and I was driven back to the office/my car by the two oldest and most sober people in the company. I proceeded to go on and on about how my fiancé used to be a pro snowboarder - something no one asked about. More memory vomit. 

As I was dropped off, they asked if I was good to drive and I said I’m good and that I’m actually going back inside to keep working (lol). It was 10:30 pm. 

The moment they left I got in my car. I drove home. I have never been a drunk driver, but...there I was with 2 broken headlights, absolutely flying back to my house on country backroads. 80 in a 30. Jesus fuck. 

I got home without incident and proceeded to realize just how drunk I was as I leaned against the wall of my shower. I went to bed.

When I woke up the next morning, the shame, the anxiety, the “oh my god I did NOT do that,” came back like an old dog. 

I’m not drinking better. I’ll never drink better. I don’t want this. I’m diving back in, doing the work, staying vigilant, and back on day 5.

My gramps decided he isnt gonna get another bottle of his scotch, so like a week ago when i poured the last of it into his smaller bottle..i left a little sip in the bottle. I'm not even counting it because it didn't make me go buy more or anything, and it was at most like.. half a shooter? if even that lol


it was more symbolic. grandpa's scotch is definitely part of the whole story that is this last decade. Everything just feels so fucked up and weird right now, i needed that little homage to a world that yesterday swallowed to make room for tomorrow. Lord help us and I sure hope this ride aint over yet. It was definitely time for me to not be spending my entire day/wallet on booze.

 That little kiss of scotch was just a little farewall to some good times, some bad times, and that middle ground that makes a memory. I just wish it coulda been a REAL ""last drink"" with him, but.. I know myself better than that. if i do that, i'm gonna want more and that voice in my head can probably negotiate me into gettin more. He actually doesnt even know i had that little moment lol


That said, that little nod to the past excluded, this month went much smoother than January. Last month, I let that kiss turn into a full body deep tissue massage and I can't be doin that no more lol. tbh i dont even want to anymore... there was no magic in that week i drank again, it just made me feel shitty (both physically and emotionally)


if this frozen winter woulda hit last year i prolly woulda spent the entire thing with a bottle glued to my lips so im happy thats no longer the case. Next step is the mota but one that'll be rough to unroot (no pun intended). Cant say I want to entirely STOP smoking, but.. i'm ready to stop making it such my identity. the smokin and the drinkin went together so it just feels weird havin one without the other. 


Good time for me to wrap up the Hashtronaut name too. Everything has its chapter... SupaNovaHelix got phased out just like simply NoVa did waaay back. (or Desk if you knew me THAT young, like William lmao). the MotaVated is still somethin i'ma rock with until i figure all this shit out, but tbh im thinking after i get this project im workin on done i might just be done ""being a rapper"" ... like, i'm sure i'll always still make music but i dunno it just feels like in the current stage life (for me and for everyone in general) is at a weird place right now and it'll eat me alive if I don't adapt and evolve.  I aint really made a dollar off this shit anyway, what I got to lose? lol. Plus it felt so ritualistic to drink when i rapped...maybe ending those identities i used will help get past that feeling cause god damn do i miss when i loved to record. 


(""im so fuckin tired..cant tell if im done or just uninspired"" -eyedea)


I'm just following my gut and that's whats kept me rockin into my 30s now and I sure never expected to make it that long. Life has taught me the people who meant to stick around will and those that aint supposed to...well, where they at today cause i dont see em lol. I know i got people out there that would love to hear some new music if/when i directly send it to them like Ian and thats good enough for me. never liked the popularity contest aspect of the game anyway.

 That being said this ""i wana smoke drink and rap"" version of myself was born in a world that doesn't exist anymore and maybe it's time he dies with it. Especially now that i'm working on my 1st installment to my dads poetry books and mine is about this ""Journey"" that comes with gettin sober and what unexpected roads it leads you. (Which is a familiar theme to all those who read his books).

I'm going to do a brief recap of year five, and set intention for year six.

Career wise, it's been, for me a f'd up year.  I actually have my  year review this afternoon.  I work with geriatric patients living in close quarters.  My hands burn.  I have pressure ulcers forming behind my ears.  I get tested for the rona 2 x week.  I don't give a flying fuck if I get fired or not.

I work overnight.  I live in another dimension.  I've been labeled a hero.  I'm reluctant to reveal my identity.  Because we either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain.

I had a doctors appt.  They always want to give me an std screen.  I hate this part more than the other parts, like when they tell me I need to quit smoking and you need to go see a therapist and you need to lose some weight and then why'd you lose so much weight?

I asked a girl out the other day.  Actually on Valentine's Day.  I hate Valentine's Day, but even if nothing comes of it, it will maybe give me a fond memory of the day years down the road.

I haven't gone on ONE DATE in this five years.  I really  like this girl and I don't really put my self out there like that, and with this one, there will be consequences.  I imagine it will send shock waves through the work place.  Technically, also her supervisor.  I will embrace my roll as villain as needed.   

Year Six: get my shit together, quit smoking, and have a use for std test.

After five years, my life still isn't perfect.  My house still isn't in order.  I'm still not in perfect physical shape.  My finances are still out of whack.  My life is still hard as fuck.

My life is also good.  Very good.  And it can get overshadowed by things.  I try to not let a day go by without being cognizant of that.  Things can always be worse, and there are much worse things than death.

I have a home, with heat, internet (sometimes), a ten year old daughter(sometimes loves me), a two year old dog(almost always loves me), a car(with new tires), a license, and money in the mfing bank and pay checks I still haven't cashed on my night stand.

No one or no thing can ever take those five years away from me. Except maybe a time machine, eh we'll put that tangent on the back burner.    Tonight, I'm not sure what there will be, cake or steak , or steak **and** cake!?",1046,{'rona': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6761847}"

I am realizing that I’m a very heart strong person and have been prone to making decisions based on feelings rather than logic. 

If I was making the decision logically, I would have never drank alcohol. Alcohol is a poisonous, carcinogenic substance that has addictive qualities. For me personally, alcohol is a substance I have never been able to moderate. These things are just objectively true, and in my opinion the only logical thing to do based on these facts is to not drink. 

The next time I get a ‘feeling’ (a craving), I need to remember that not all my feelings are true. I felt like having some wine on Valentine’s Day would help me celebrate and relax, it did neither; which I logically should have known would happen. I’ve always had a ‘follow your heart’ mentality, but in this case my feelings sometimes are directly in opposition to logic and science and I need to be very mindful of that. I’m not going to be the one exception, even if I feel that way in the moment. Also going to try to remind myself that feelings pass, but proven facts about the dangers of alcohol remain consistently true.

I thought I’d introduce myself. I think this sub is probably the best place for me to start building some sort of community around myself for trying to stay sober.

I am neither a grey-area drinker nor a super-problematic drinker. I’m somewhere in between. I’m a 4 glasses of wine a night kind of person who feels insanely bored without alcohol, and can’t seem to quit. I’ve tried so many attempts at moderation, and every time I try, I end up being like “what the hell” and getting back to 4 glasses a night.

My biggest problem is maintaining a quitting mindset after a period of sobriety. When you don’t get blackout drunk, don’t cause your work or family life any problems, don’t throw up, etc, it can be extremely easy to justify going back to drinking.

My fiancé and I are going to start trying for a baby after our wedding this summer. I’ve been looking forward to pregnancy as a way to “force” myself to avoid wine, as horrible as that sounds. My own mother was an alcoholic and died from alcoholism when I was a child.

I went to an AA meeting once, but found that I couldn’t relate to anyone there. Other people’s problems with alcohol always seem so much more intense than mine. So my plan for now is to be active in this community, work with my therapist, and complete the SMART recovery handbook.

Even as I’m typing this, the thought in the back of my mind is “maybe if I just abstain for a while, I’ll eventually be able to drink in moderation.” How do I change that line of thinking???

Right now I live in London, England. I am looking for work and during a pretty extreme lockdown. So everyday is the same to me. We can go on walks for fun, and we can grocery shop. Every store has alcohol, and you get to stare it down at checkout. 

I am here with my wife. She is fully aware of my problem, she knows how sneaky I can be, and she also knows she can always step to me. She just found a bottle that obviously had vodka in it, which she pulled from our recycling.  She's a great one, very supportive, and only wants to help.

My current drinking is one where I look to drink all day. I wake up, want to take some sips, and maintain a buzz the entire day. I can crush a liter of vodka a day and still be an effective person (well, at least no one asks, ""Are you drunk, dude?""). When I am out of booze I am anxious, but am then comforted by the idea of it being there and a pull is just a step away while my wife is busy. I've recently realized that the sneaking of it provides me an additional buzz. The Hardest part is I've seemingly forgot how to enjoy all the old hobbies I used to enjoy - photography, videogames, working out, just the intentional watching of movies and tv shows. I don't have a crazy rock bottom to share, but I know I have not been as good a friend, brother, son, spouse, worker, etc. as I could have been.

Really appreciate this sub. In addition to great examples of people that are doing it, there's a lot of poetic language, eloquence, and parody here that explain this addiction, make me feel more normal, and feel like I can do it too - even though it feels fucking impossible right now.

Today I got a text from my sister in law asking me and my oldest brother if my other brother (her husband) had tried to call us last night. I guess he got insanely wasted and wasn’t answering his phone, and he was supposed to take care of some important things this morning.

She said something along the lines of “It’s up to you guys if you want to worry about it or not”, and I immediatly thought of the safety lecture they give on planes before takeoff, specifically when they tell you to make sure you get your oxygen mask on before helping others. I am worried, but I need to help myself right now, and I feel selfish saying that but its the truth.

Our dad died a few years ago on the 16th of February, and this time of year is particularily hard for all of us, I know I was drowning out the pain by drinking myself half to death the last few years at this time. However, I’ve been doing really well, almost 100 days sober under my belt, and no end in sight as far as I’m concerned. Being sober has really allowed me to focus on good memories of our dad, while when I was drinking I couldn’t help but focus on his drinking problem and how I felt like I was becoming just like him, pushing everyone away just to get drunk.

Maybe I am being selfish, but at the same time I think its okay to be right now, I’ve had support through this but I’m the one in control and I’m helping myself heal which can be mentally exhausting at times. I’m a people pleaser and not being able to help definitely hurts, but at the same time I just know that I need to focus on myself before I try to help other people.

He’s fine now, and he knows he can talk to me anytime even if we don’t live in the same town anymore, but I definitely feel like things have been weird between us since I’ve been sober. We’re basically best friends, and part of that was being drinking buddies for years, and I feel like it hurts him that I can’t be that way anymore.

Anyways, rant over, I guess my point in all this is that we’re all going through something that most people won’t understand or feel like they can’t do. If you focus your energy on helping others, you run the risk of not having the energy to help yourself and falling back to where you started, and I for one want to leave that place as far in the rearview as I can.

I used to go to the grocery store every 2-3 days for wine, depending on how much I’d bought the last time. I looked for an excuse to buy something, *anything* else along with my wine. You always need SOMETHING right? 

Well 2 days ago I realized I was starting to run low on toothpaste and started making a mental grocery list. But I didn’t really need anything, since I just got groceries last Friday. This morning I was trying to figure out when I should go to the store today, what else I needed etc, and found myself dreading going to the store basically just for toothpaste because I still don’t really need anything else. 

I decided to search my overflowing bathroom cabinet again to make absolutely sure I didn’t have some extra toothpaste anywhere because I didn’t feel like going to the store just for one thing. It’s a little thing, but it struck me how crazy it was that I was searching for an excuse *not* to go to the store, whereas in the past I was always looking for an excuse to go. It’s been almost a week now since the last time I went, and I found a couple travel size toothpastes in my cabinet so I can manage not to go until next Tuesday. That’s a week and a half between trips!

This is my 4th week on this journey and in each of those weeks I have made it past day 3 and failed on day 4. Just a few weeks ago I would have taken even one day dry as a win as it seemed so far away. 

The sober days are great. But then come the 3-4 drinking days and it’s hard to explain but it is hell to be dipping in and out of sobriety. The best way I can describe is that when a person is a smoker they don’t smell the smell of cigarettes on them. But if a person gives up and then smokes - the person can actually smell it on themselves. That is what my drinking has been like. The first week when I woke up in day 3 my hangover was gone. I was just tired but clear headed. And then the snap back to drinking is harsher because I default to testing my limits.

I guess what I’m trying to say as I ramble on is that day 1 was yesterday. I have been here before. And I know where my failure point is now. But the thing I need to do is to take control when that is needed and then accept that I will not have all the answers in every given day when that is needed. The only consistency has to be not drinking. Everything else - needs to be managed.

I feel that not being able to check my feelings has been an issue. Going from highs of feeling liberated and planning ahead to lows of back in a bottle is a rollercoaster ride. As much as I can, today I want to focus on trying to even out the peaks and troughs. I know the journey is a long one but the only thing I need to do right now is commit to not drinking today. What happens tomorrow will fall into tomorrow. What happened yesterday is history and does not define me today even though it may impact me in some way.

What I’m finding is that I am trying to run before I can walk. The slipping at day 4 is always because I have planned ahead. Even now, it’s Thursday and I’m thinking I want a sober weekend where I can just rest and sleep. But I need to forget that. Today is day 2 and day 3, 4 and 5 are not a given. I need to tackle day 2 first before I even begin to think about what is happening in the future.

I feel bad,"I have been sober for the last for 4 years but I unintentionally had a sip of Prosecco last night. Oh and it tasted like shit.  
So it was my mums birthday last night. Family was drinking prosecco and I had some sparkling elderflower juice. I like it. However it almost looks the same as Prosecco. I put my glass specially apart from the others during pre dinner drinks. Then when we moved to the table my Mum moved all the glasses to the table. I thought she had paid attention to which glass was mine (so did she). She usually is always very aware of such things. However my glass had somehow been swapped anyway by mistake. So when I wanted a sip of my elderflower drink I unintentionally had a sip of Prosecco which out of reflex I swallowed. 
Not only did the Prosecco taste as shit. 
I joked it off by saying mum made me fall off the wagon.... 
My counselor said not to worry as I had been doing so good and it wasn’t intentionally.

“I think you’re terribly unhappy,” she told me. “I think you’re sad, sadder than you know.” My therapist said this after I had sat silent through almost an entire session. My silence was meant to be a sort of punishment for her after she referred me to a crisis stabilization residential home where I spent three days sequestered in the bedroom they provided, leaving only for meals. She had done this after I arrived in the ER early one morning telling the staff only that “my head isn’t working right.” Prior to arriving at the hospital, I hadn’t slept for a week. I was under an incredible amount of stress trying to finish my dissertation, and was drinking an ungodly amount to try to quell my anxiety. When I continued to sit in silence that day in my therapist’s office, watching the clock until I could leave, she slid me a handout listing six basic human needs to reflect on for the next session. 

I had no intention of doing this little homework assignment, let alone attending next week’s meeting. But I happened to look it over one day and as I read through these so-called needs I realized that I was literally meeting none of them. And the more I read the more I knew why. Booze. Lots and lots of booze.

I’ll talk about other needs tomorrow because I think that they’re important to consider for our sober journeys, but I want to focus on two in particular today that left me dumbfounded when I first read them. The need to be recognized. This one really got to me. “To feel affirmed,” the paper read, “recognized, accepted, and appreciated when we share ourselves in some way.” Jesus, I thought, when was the last time I felt affirmed? At the moment I had felt whatever the exact opposite of affirmed was. Nullified? I certainly didn’t feel recognized or accepted because I had been hiding, drinking alone, avoiding everyone and everything. And during those awful times when I had tried to gain acceptance by venturing out in the world, I ended up alienating everyone due to my drunken behavior. And the real kicker: appreciated. Impossible because I didn’t even appreciate myself. “Receiving these experiences promotes the building up and maintenance of self-esteem and self-confidence.” I could only weep. 

Number four on the list: The Need to Belong. Or “to feel ‘one with’ that which we respect and admire and affirms us.” This one particularly stung. What did I feel at “one with” other than alcohol, something that I certainly didn’t “respect and admire.” “We need to be part of individuals, groups, and efforts that are important to us and in relationship to which we feel understood and cared about.” In my drunken haze, I was part of nothing, and definitely not part of anything I’d consider important or substantial. Drink had left me shallow, barren, hollow. I didn’t feel understood or cared about because, again, I didn’t understand or care for myself. “These experiences help us to feel significant and valued.” Again, I wept. 

I had plenty to talk about when I returned for my next appointment. I opened up, finally, about why I was so unhappy, so sad. It was because drink had taken precedence over nearly everything else in my life. If these were indeed essential, basic needs for mental health, I was living quite an emotionally and psychologically denuded life. With sobriety I’ve been able to forge those significant connections to the people and things that I value that I had once lacked, finding that in return I feel, for the first time in a very, very long time significant and valued myself. And by being more actively involved I now feel understood and cared for. And that’s what I really needed. To feel cared for. Because I didn’t think I deserved that prior to my sobriety. But you want to know the best part? I finally have built up an ample reserve of self-esteem and -confidence, concepts previously unknown to me. Now I could weep thinking how far I’ve come. That odd feeling I’m experiencing right now is pride. I’m not quite used to it yet. 

How about you? Your needs? Did you feel that drink was preventing you from feeling a sense of belonging? Of the types of connection that makes our lives significant and meaningful? How about Self-respect and self-dignity? I sincerely hope that you are proud of yourselves for being here and doing this thing. Here’s to our mental health and wellbeing!

Until the last spell. I drank to be comfortable around a toxic ex (bad sign but I thought maybe it was just my anxiety) and then I kept drinking after the break-up to feel better, not realizing I wasn’t processing the experience or healing at all or moving on. It’s like I was just stuck in a nightmare of trauma. Not even realizing that’s why I was drinking. before, drinking was fun. We were fun. I couldn’t understand how I’d become the drink and cry girl...

Let me just tell you, I’m pretty damn sure that alcohol doesn’t help pretty much ever. Sometimes, I thought I’d processed things bc I felt better but it was just the alcohol talking. I’d cry too. Talk about confusing. After 7months clean, I’ve had enough thoughts and moved on to realize I couldn’t do this under the influence. My brain literally couldn’t do it. And I wasn’t drinking every day or very heavily but it was enough. healing from trauma and from alcohol have a lot in common.

Alcohol can make the good times ‘feel’ better, bad times feel ok, bad times feel worse, dark times feel hopeless and impossible... alcohol can make us feel so many things. But it’s artificial. It really messes w/our brains ability to process difficult emotions in a healthy way. At least for me. 

I remember listening to a song I really loved though, drinking a couple beers and dancing around in my kitchen just being so happy. Hearing the song tonight was bittersweet, I cried a little. Thought about how happy I’d felt that night when things were still good, hopeful... but how a while -what was it really? Months, year(s), I don’t even know it’s all a blur- of drinking stole that happiness and hope into despair and hell. It all just slipped away and I was too tipsy to notice. That makes me angry, in a good motivating way. Alcohol made a fool out of me.

Tonight when I heard the song, yeah it was bittersweet I teared-up over what I’ve been through but I’ve done so much work I can actually see being that happy again. I won’t mess it up w/alcohol this time. Better to let my brain deal w/life’s highs and lows on its own. Life’s fucking hard, I need my brain, in my right mind, to get through it. It’s taken 7months. It’s a journey. A little bit better, clearer, healthier on all the days adds up.

This is a little bit of a long story. But I really hope you stick to the end.

I was born with a condition called Dyspraxia. It mean't I struggled, walking, talking, had sensory overload, everything was just harder. But I was diagnosed at about really late, at 20. Before that I got badly bullied and had low self confidence. I started studying, first I got a mental health certificate. Then a social work degree. But I couldn't shake off this crippling anxiety I would get for interviews and practically everything. I worked at youth groups for years and helped a lot of teenagers with autism (cause I could relate to them).

But I struggled still to get a job, and after a while I stopped trying. I thought as long as I have my mother and my friends. I can live life and I don't need a job....but that's when things started to come crashing down. First my mother get's diagnosed with cancer in august 2017. But she doesn't get real bad until 2019....then my best mate of 8 years gets killed in a car crash. October 11th 2019. It broke me in half, I felt like I lost part of myself. Then my mother dies 3 months later....January 7th 2020...I fell into a depression, with my only friend being Jim Beam, Johnnie Walker green and Talisker...the depression got worse and Talisker turned into Bell's and Teachers. Going from a 750 mil bottle a weak to a 1 litre bottle, then two and lastly three.

I was drinking day to day, shutting down, sleeping all the time...until I realized that is not what my mother would have wanted for me. I put the bottle down, went from drinking 32 shots of whiskey in two days to 3 shots (1 and a half shots a day). Next thing I was hit with withdrawals....tremendous withdrawals. Felt like my head was on fire. I called the ambulance...they gave me a few Valium and sent me home. I detoxed within a week. Took my last drink on the 8th of October. Now I'm over 4 months sober. Walking three times a week with some walking buddies. Having more salad's and fruits.

I too got a job interview a few weeks ago. They said I did pretty well but I did get very depressed when I didn't get it. But I'm just going to keep trying. It helps to know we are all in this together. Every day I mark a day off the belt, I sometimes think about Jimmy and ol Bells...but with each passing day it's been getting easier.

The body is amazing,"So 25 days ago I SMELLED. I had just ended a binge and was turning yellow. Especially around my eyes. I couldn't sleep, was hot/cold all the time. My thoughts were almost all irrational. If someone knocked at the door I yelped, I was so jumpy. My urine was dark no matter how much lemon water I drank. Enzyme levels all over the map. I felt like my body was rotting and I was terrified that I had finally done it.

Fast forward to the blood test results today. I smell like myself again. Get great sleep. I am rational and happy. Lots of energy, hiked 2 hrs today. Most of all, a blood test today shows my T Bili is 1.2 which means liver function is already normal. Wow. I also had an ultrasound of my abdomen (terrified of what I'd hear after binge drinking for 15 years) and all organs are healthy. Everything looks good! 

I can't say I thought this would be happening. Especially not at 25 days.

I was like whaaat! I've spent all this time on WebMD thinking terrible things and it's going to be ok now. Grateful doesn't begin to describe it. And I never have to put myself through this again.

So moral of the story, don't get yourself all worked up during withdrawal about feeling that way forever or the damage you have done, unless maybe it is motivation for your sobriety.

I am an adult child of two alcoholics. I have been thinking of quitting for some time as it has seemed to become an unhealthy coping mechanism when I'm triggered ( I have anxiety, depression, ptsd from my household situation growing up). I am about to turn 23 and have undergone a tremendously tough year in regards to my mental health. I go through periods where I drink often, and crave alcohol. Then I can go weeks without it. Nevertheless it's a crutch, and is often an unhealthy one. I love a drink socially, I love it when I watch movies, after work...it's not always an issue but I fear that that doesn't excuse when it is.  Any other Adult Childs who found that quitting alcohol was a good move?

His mother was very health conscious and generally used fresh ingredients, almost no processed foods and very little sugar.  He told a story about when he was a little boy and didn't want to eat his vegetables and the way his mom taught him about the things your brain tells you it wants or doesn't want.  I'll do my best to paraphrase from his point of view:

&#x200B;

One night at dinner I told my mom: I don't want to eat the vegetables!

My mom wasn't one to lie or otherwise coerce her kids, so instead she used this approach: But you should want to eat your vegetables, they're good for your body.

I don't want to eat the vegetables!

You don't want to eat your vegetables?

No!

Who...Who is ""you""?

Well...I..I'm me? I said, a suddenly very confused 12 year old boy

Oh ...She paused..... Are your lungs ""you""?  Is your heart ""you""?  Is your liver ""you""?...I think the ""you"" that you're referring to is your tongue!

&#x200B;

It was a lesson to a 12 year old boy about eating his vegetables, but I thought it was a brilliant story that framed how our desires are sometimes nothing more than a particular part of you yelling over the rest, so to speak, but not necessarily what's best for all of you.  Our brains have many voices, we wouldn't all be here if we didn't have a voice that said ""You WANT to quit"".

&#x200B;

When my brain says ""I want to get drunk""....who am ""I""?  Is it the me that wants to live a healthy life?  The me that wants to be a good husband to my wife?  The me that wants to be a reliable friend?  The me that wants to go hiking with the dogs?  The me that loves doing small projects around the house?  No.

So now when I start to try to rationalize getting a drink I see it for what it is, a desperate attempt by my brain to trick me into getting drunk because of one particular and narrowly focused voice.  One that I know is destructive, one that lies, and one that robs me of other goals and dreams.  And just keeping that in mind has been helpful for me in fighting the desire to drink.",370,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49078336}"

Feeling grateful is a skill we can develop. This is an opportunity for us to practice*.

Late one night I happened to wake up suddenly, just as my dog began to birth her litter. I’m lucky I did because she attempted to bury the first pup in a pile of clothes I had on the floor. Normally queasy when it comes to these types of things, I proceeded to puncture a little hole in the sac so that the dog could breath. A little black ball emerged that would forever change my life. I still marvel at how lucky I was that for no reason at all I woke up and was there for him. I would never have gotten to know the best friend that I’ve ever had. 

For the next thirteen years I had a constant companion. We were inseparable from the time he began walking. I remember how he feigned a leg injury, walking around limping, just so he could be by my side all day away from the other dogs. I knew it was a clever ruse because that night he miraculously gained the strength to leap onto the bed to lay next to me, brazenly taking his mother’s spot. I knew I had something special, but I could not possibly have known how special it would actually be. Just as he was drawn to me, I was to him. His unbelievably vivid brown eyes that contrasted so sharply with his jet black coat. The smudge of white on his muzzle. His prancing gait. The way his body convulsed from excited happiness when I walked through the door after a long day away. 

He had to be one the most well-travelled, cultured dogs to have ever lived. I had been at the very start of what would be an absurdly long stint as a student. I dragged him across the country as I pursued my degree. We walked the streets of Philadelphia together, Lansing, Michigan, Seattle, and finally Chicago. He was there for the entire journey and helped me see it through to the end. He was my only source of familiarity in all these strange places, and often my only comfort. Utterly dependable in a way I’m yet to discover in another human being. He was there for me on those nights when I couldn’t figure out a chapter, or a paragraph, sometimes even a god damn sentence. When I felt like giving up, he was there. “Let’s just go for a walk, take a break and everything will be ok,” he seemed to say with those remarkable eyes. 

He taught me a lot. To be present, always in the moment. To find joy in the smallest, most basic of things. About loyalty. Forgiveness. I’ve seen what unconditional love looks like. Felt it intensely. He showed me that I’m far stronger than I had thought. That I had to accept certain things, regardless of how much it hurt. That I’m compassionate enough to do the unselfish thing. To appreciate what I have, and what I had. There’s a scene towards the end of Sigrid Nunez’s fantastic novel The Friend where she asks, pleads really, for one more summer with her dog Apollo. I had to set the book down for several minutes because I had said almost the exact same thing once. One more summer of walks in the park and sitting in the sun by the lake. Of lazy afternoons watching him lay in the shade while I read. Unfortunately, I didn’t get that one last summer. But I am so grateful for the time we had and what we shared. He really was the best and I miss him.

I just want to give a little status update and speak about a new found benefit i have realized from my sobriety . 

The other day I posted about really wanting to just let go and how that would probably be terrible for me and how it bothered me . Long story short , I stayed the course and maintained my sobriety. This sub was super supportive and helped me keep my focus for that i am forever grateful !

Fast forward to the past couple days and thats where it gets better . I recently had a falling out with my job of 5yrs , long story short i was passed over for a promotion and it bothered me pretty bad. That company was supposedly like a family and I gave them blood ,sweat and tears ( literally) . 

So i quit yesterday.  Now normally this is the part where my life is completely screwed and i have made a rash decision because i don't have the emotional abilities to handle the stress . Que up the depression and vibe on the whiskey / whatever i can concume to forget train.

NOT THIS TIME ! This choice was made from the mind of a sober person . A person who slept on the emotions and processed them and then made the decision that i felt was best for ME ! . That person did not exist 5 yrs ago or even last year . 

I have another job already to fill the gap and they understand it is just temporary. I am still looking for something more secure and that is in the works already.  I have my finances planned out with cushion  to work with for emergencies . Overall i have never felt more confident about a stressful/kind of hurtful situation . 

This feeling alone is worth not drinking today . Good job everyone and thank you for letting me share . IWNDWYT !!",56,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.45178673}"

If I think about the future or too far forward the anxiety of ""not drinking"" get's a little overwhelming, so I remind myself, just don't drink today.

Just wanted to share my **huge thanks** to this community, for the support, the advice and the genuine care shown to me, a stranger on the internet. I'm 35 years old, and realising/facing the truth I've not been sober for more than 20 years was pretty confronting and I felt some deep shame around it, but now I'm learning to feel re-frame it in my mind, and am empowered by the decision I've made for myself.  

I still have moments where I want to give up; I am a stubborn person, but I'm learning to use that stubbornness as a way to help me, instead of hindering me. 

Keep up the amazing work internet strangers, no matter what stage you're at with your sobriety, you're all bloody amazing.

The gym is my favourite place to workout and I love going. I just don’t know if I would be risking too much by going!

One thing I've found in sobriety is I can deal with my problems now. I'm not putting things off due to hangovers.

The financial issues I have has become clear. I waste money. A lot of money. Amazon, Target, Etsy...they all got me. Anyway, as I haven't been drinking, I've realized how much I've been wasting and have now come to a complete halt on that entirely.

All solutions to my problems seem more obtainable now that I'm not wasted all the time. Although it's daunting to see all the problems I have, seeing goals within reach makes me hopeful. I can kill these petty debts in less than a year. I can fix my car. I can have a savings. I can cover emergencies as they come. I can have money in the bank and maybe spoil myself with something really nice every once in a while instead of something cheap and stupid every payday.

**I can be free of these problems.**

**Alcohol was the center point of gravity for 99% of my issues.** Now that that force has been made powerless, many problems that orbited it have vanished. Leaving only a few bigger issues that can now be dealt with.

I believe and know this was a good choice. Every few weeks I have a realization like this and it just further proves my point. Alcohol is a waste of time, and I just don't care to bother with it anymore.

It does get easier the longer you go. I promise.

The day before, I met up with some friends for a Sunday funday and had promised myself I wouldn't drink. I never liked day drinking to start and didn't want to be hungover on a Monday.

What happened? One beer led to five plus two margaritas before sundown. My husband had to come pick my drunk ass up and I spent the remainder of the evening spinning, miserable, and literally wishing I had never been born. 

I never felt like I had A Problem, but it was always difficult to predict what would happen after that first drink. Would I moderate effectively and stop at one? Or would I order drink after drink until I was passing out at the bar? Every first sip was a roll of the dice, and I was miserable. I could go weeks without a drink but it would only take that one to throw everything off course.

Not to mention the hangovers that only got worse as I got older, to the point where one beer with dinner would sometimes make my entire next day a waste. Or the sleepless nights caused by a single glass of wine. How did I ever think that was relaxing??

Anyway, I can proudly report that after a year of sobriety, I'm happier, well rested, and have a solid handle on my anxiety and self-loathing. Life is so much better that I ever thought it could be! Even in a pandemic, even with all of the other crazy events of the past year, and even in this miserable winter chill, I can always be grateful for and feel centered by my sobriety.

I'm a mum of 3. 7 year old and 5 year old twins. I've always had a 'relationship' with alcohol. Except during my 2 pregnancies. I had a reason not to drink then, because it wasn't just my body I was messing with.
I've been a strictly Friday Saturday drinker for afew years now (school run) but obviously due to the lockdowns I haven't had school runs to think about, thus nothing stopping every night drinking. I'm the kind of drinker that thinks about how much alcohol I have in the house and when/how much I need to drink. Example: if I have 12 cans in the fridge, I need to drink 6 both nights. If I have 18 cans I need to drink 9 a night, otherwise I have some left over and need to top up that 2/3 cans for an extra night because it 'won't be enough'
So although I can moderate the days I drink, it's very calculated and on my weekdays I literally count down to Friday and work towards it.

So, I've stopped... 7 weeks in and it's been relatively easy. But I am seriously lacking motivation right now. I know I don't want to drink, because it will turn into afew weeks of binging to make up for lost time. But golly gosh, I feel like I'm staring into a void of nothing at nighttime.

I guess I just needed an anonymous rant about it.

I can't believe I am at 100 days, even though I am increasingly aware that this is still very much early days. I'd like to say everything is better, but it *feels* remarkably similar minus the hangovers. Here are some of the things I have noticed or that helped me.

* Most importantly, I gave myself full agency for my decisions to drink. For ~~years~~ decades, I kept searching for the switch to ""not want to drink"" so I could finally quit. I am not a big fan of the powerless perspective, but had never really thought about what it meant to be fully empowered. I finally latched onto the notion that it wasn't that the choice to quit was mine, it was that the choice to drink was. I gave myself permission to drink whenever I wanted, as much as I wanted, and as often as I wanted - no guilt - I only had to fully own that choice and all consequences. Immediately once I adopted a ""do or do not"" mindset, I never made the choice to drink. I think a lot of this was alleviating the stress and guilt of ""not getting it"" as far as sobriety is concerned.
* I started building a better life, slowly. I didn't opt for an Oprah total life makeover, but would look at adding a new habit every 3 weeks, but only if the last habit was solid. So far, I have stayed sober, I am eating much better, and I am getting a much better grip on my finances. I realize that is only three new habits in 100 day, but I was serious that if one habit wasn't solid, then I would wait to add a new one. 
* The first days of sobriety seem so difficult and seem to last forever. I really had to embrace that. I had done nothing to deserve a free ticket to sobriety. It was going to be a bumpy ride, but everything I experienced, good and bad, was a sign things were improving. However, on the sober side of sobriety, the early days of sobriety pass very quickly and there was nothing to be afraid of. I have survived every single urge, bad day, celebration, and moment of boredom sober. 

Life is infinitely better than before (Wait, you said it was remarkably similar! Yes, it's both.). Simply waking up without a hangover is a huge win. I am doing so much better at work and in family life. Long ignored home projects are getting done. I recently put my dad into memory care and have been managing that well, but I also participate in some support forums. It is tragic how often dementia patients drank themselves into that state. They likely have no idea of what kind of burden they have created for their loved ones. (For the record, my dad has nearly 40 years of sobriety.) Sleep is far from perfect, but is getting better. I haven't lost a pound. After work boozing has been replaced by 1-2 NA beers (Athletic!) and far too much snack food. I am phasing out NA beers now, although it is more about money and calories.

This last week was so rough. I was fighting cravings left and right and was just at my wits end to give up. It all culminated in a late late Christmas. 

My aunt and uncle are some of the best people you can meet. However they are huge huge wine drinkers. Anyways Christmas dinner with them always involves a ton of wine. I was starting to stress and I opened the fridge and what do you know there’s Fresca in it. I have not had one in years. Wound up drinking 3 of them. 

During the dinner it came up about how long I have been sober and all that. They all said how proud they were of me. Then they asked if it was ok with me if they had some wine with dinner. By this point I had calmed down and told them yes. We sat at the kitchen table for a solid 4 hours every one just talking and laughing. It was such a good visit and one I did not ruin by drinking.

The battles are so damn hard but god the victory is so worth it. I prove to myself every day that I am finding strength I never knew I had. It’s such a rewarding fight.

I feel like I’ve arrived late to my life. But I’m so happy I even managed to show up.,"I recently got sober - I’ve needed to for a long time. For almost a decade I’ve gone through cycles in which I drink 6-8 beers to a bottle of tequila per day, but no matter what, I’ve ALWAYS been drinking. It’s the only way I could stop everything - all of my out of control emotions... Or at least I thought. For a few months, I would feel “happy.” Happy most of the time meant numb.

But inevitably, I would end up horribly depressed (the suicidal kind of sad,) sometimes to the point of being hospitalized. I have a pretty severe mental illness and drinking never helped my fucked up brain (as much as I’d like to pretend otherwise.) This on top of the shame of not remembering conversations, texts, actions - the shame of not having a life or personality outside drinking - would snowball. This sick cycle, over and over and over again. And I would never learn.

Three weeks ago, I found myself driving to a bridge in my city known as a suicide hot spot. I did all the research to make sure it was a high enough jump to really kill me, planned the fastest route - it was days in the making. I was so, so desperate for relief. And of course, I was drunk.

My mom called about something stupid - like getting tomatoes for dinner or something. It was very hard to turn around, but I did. I texted my psychiatrist as soon as I got home.  

The next day I told her I need help, my meds aren’t working, I want to die... And she said that I would never stop feeling that way unless I stopped drinking myself into oblivion. She was kind - she knows it’s hard. But she was also firm. Medication can only do so much. I only had two choices - live, really live, and stop drinking or drink until I was dead.

Something clicked this time. I don’t know why, but it did. It was like I never saw sobriety as an option - I didn’t WANT to see it as an option because it scared me. I thought, “I’d kill myself if I could never have another drink,” but the drink was killing me in the now and I had no power to stop it - it was finally clear. My only other “or” - besides drinking and death - was sobriety. I had a way out that didn’t involve a bridge. And I so, so badly wanted an out. Even more than that, I want a future. I want to know me and love me and love the world around me. I don’t want to be numb anymore. And I certainly don’t want to die.

It’s not been long, but it’s been the first time in a long time that things have felt manageable. I am content. I know it will be hard, but it’s already worth it. The best things in life are the most difficult. But I have people who want me to succeed - even strangers like you.

Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

….I first wanted to say thank you for all the thoughtful and moving comments yesterday! I’ve been reflecting on much of what was said, particularly regarding self-compassion and establishing boundaries, as well as the power and sense of freedom that follows from letting go….

&#x200B;

I can’t remember the exact moment when it occurred to me that I was in deep trouble, that I had made a huge mistake. Maybe it was after I drank that fifth margarita, the whiskey sour one in a new Mexican restaurant that everyone was raving about on Yelp. But in that moment I decided I was going to make a run for it, the old dine and dash, to evade a staggering bill that I could not possibly afford. So I scouted the place out to devise my escape plan. I could say I had to use the restroom and then casually exit through the restaurant side separate from the bar. And then bolt for the street. 

After quickly realizing the futility of this ill-advised scheme I decided not to cash out but rather to take it even further. I’ve come this far, I thought, no point in stopping now. So I tried the remaining five specialty margaritas, and topped them off with a few more beers. The anguish over the impending bill dissipated with each drink, even though I knew that I, a grad student with severely limited funds, had just enough money left over after rent and utilities to pay for essentials. This was a defining moment for me, the moment I knew I had a problem that could no longer be dismissed as random acts of stupidity. I knew I could not possibly justify this. I was, after all, very much aware of the consequences of my actions, how my negligent behavior would directly affect those who depended on me. I knew this was untenable, reprehensible. But I did it anyways because I couldn’t stop.  

Let me go back a bit further, before making my way over to the restaurant. I had been experimenting with moderate drinking, limiting myself to two pints of beer a night. I have this under control, I finally have this whole thing under control, I convinced myself. But on this particular night, while finishing my second pint at my favorite Irish pub, I happened to overhear a conversation between two men sitting next to me. They were going on and on about these incredible tacos at this new joint that just opened down the street. And these craft margaritas, or whatever they called them. Was this the moment? The moment of no return? I had made up my mind that I wanted to try these tacos, and the margaritas intrigued me as I looked at the menu online. So I’ll grab a couple tacos and have one, ONE, margarita, I told myself before venturing out knowing full well that if there is one drink I absolutely cannot have it is tequila. In a way I knew that my stint with moderation was about to end abruptly. But I went anyways. 

I woke up the next morning feeling an indescribable sense of dread. Mercifully, I only remembered bits and pieces. I knew I had behaved badly, obnoxiously at the bar. I scrolled through the series of excruciatingly emotional texts to a person that I had swore I’d never speak to again. Well, actually they were the one that stopped speaking to me. And then I remembered the bill. And all the drinks. And the food. And the obscenely generous tip, which is ironic given that I had intended to run without paying in my drunken stupor. I recall sitting on my bed, paralyzed, with tears streaming down my face as I stared at that little slip of paper that revealed, unequivocally, the depth of my debauchery. I was fucked. I thought of those pre-Prohibition stories I had read where men had cashed their paychecks at saloons and proceeded to squander their earnings, leaving them penniless and unable to support their families. 

I wish I could say that this experience was the final straw, the beginning of the end of my profligacy, my selfish insatiability. It was not. I continued to drink heavily, maybe not $15 margaritas but I continued nonetheless. But it was certainly a significant event in my drinking career, a stark dividing line between a before and an after. Because I often recall that night to remind myself now that I cannot moderate. That I can never again imperil those whom I love. It’s why I adhere so zealously to the philosophy of taking it one day at time. Because promising not to drink today dispels any beguiling thoughts that I can have just one or two. And because there are priorities in life that must be attended to. I may still wince with shame when thinking about that night. But I know that I will never let that happen again, that I’ll never again wake up and look in horror at a small piece of paper that quantifies, that coldly and unmistakably tabulates, the despair and degradation caused by drink. 

These days my finances are much more in order, not great but better. And just as I count my sober days, I count money saved or well spent as a part of my sober journey, as progress. Every dollar not spent on alcohol is money I can spend on something else to improve my quality of life. It’s remarkably motivating. I’d enjoy hearing how giving up the booze has impacted your financial life, big and small. Bought anything neat? Or if you’re relatively new at this whole sobriety thing, what kind of changes do you envision or hope for?

It's wonderful and seems to speak to me exactly where I'm at in life in some ways even across the barriers of time, nationality, dialect, and class. There's nothing about alcohol or sobriety in this one. Just a really good read about human nature.

Which is pretty funny in hindsight given I was barely past the 2 month mark. I also started feeling that familiar delusion that I wasn't actually an alcoholic, since I wasn't drinking every day when I stopped. I mean, I did at one point, but never longterm. But that didn't stop me from blacking out more times than I can count. Ending up in dangerous situations. Having multiple people say they were worried about my drinking at some point or another. I might not have drank every day, but when I did drink I could rarely stop. I embarrassed myself and worsened my mental health. I stole my parents alcohol during quarantine when I was too drunk to drive and buy more. (Over and over and over again... it's a mystery I was never caught.) And none of those things are ""normal drinking behaviors."" I've never been a normal drinker.

But I let the addiction voice convince me that I could drink normally because I wasn't a ""real alcoholic."" So I obviously proceeded to drink at least 7 drinks Friday night. Didn't remember going to bed. Woke up and spent Saturday so nauseous and sick that I could barely move until I went to bed the next night.

Then, I made my list of all the evidence that I was at least in the early stages of alcoholism and I would never be able to drink normally. Never. I reminded myself of all the physical and psychological harm alcohol does to the body. And I recommitted myself to sobriety, forever. Not just until I want to ""test"" if I can drink like a normal person. This took a lot of honesty--I really had no idea how much I'd lied to myself and others in a way that had completely skewed my perception of my drinking and addictive behavior. That cognitive dissonance is a bitch.

So, hello everyone! My (user)name is choosingstillness and I'm an alcoholic. Wow. Still feels sort of fake to say!

Anyone else take a while to warm up to the idea that they were \*actually\* an addict because you didn't feel you fit the mold?

I don't even know what feeling I was chasing; I never get there, I just go from ""not really feeling it"" to ""completely and totally gone.""  I was a terrible host.  We had been looking forward to this.  And I ruined it.

Drinking always seemed so glamorous.  For years, it felt so liberating and fun.  Now it's just sloppy, messy, and embarrassing.

This all happened yesterday.  I have no energy today, and I can't even sleep.

I've wanted to cut back for a while.  Do the moderation thing.  Drink more responsibly.

But I can't.  I just can't.  Once I get started, I can't stop, I just keep going.  And going and going and going.  Like I don't even think about it.  What's one more shot?  One more bottle of wine?  Spike this, spike that, it's all for the sake of fun, right, it's all supposed to be so fun.

I’m still afraid to tell anyone, I fear I will be treated differently.  I’m not sure how that will play out once the world starts up again, but I will no longer torture myself with fantasies inevitable doom as I had been doing the past few weeks. 

I am finally ready to accept myself as I am- with all my imperfections. I am finally able to exist in the moment.  I AM, more than before, living my life by my rules. **I am doing this because I truly want it, no longer because of guilt or fear.**

I was frustrated by my lack of progress for a while. But I feel like the next chapter is finally beginning. And I am so grateful.

I know it sucks and when you are in the very beginning, it feels like there is no way it will ever be normal. I want to tell you it’s not only normal; it’s fantastic.

For me, being sober is not a battle anymore. I don’t struggle everyday and drinking doesn’t consume my every thought. Being a non drinker is simply who I am now......who I am proud to be. 

It’s not easy, and I still get cravings (am going through one right now) but it’s so much easier now as I know I’ve come so far, and have too much to lose; Not because it would be a failure to relapse (it’s not, we all have done, and it’s just part of the journey) but because I like being sober.

I already feel so much better. I'm sleeping well, I don't feel bloated, and my appetite has returned. 

At the risk of sounding cliched, it was a slow, slow descent into unhealthy usage that got me to this point. I hardly drank in college until I turned 21. Then, able to keep some on hand all the time and living with a few roommates who drank relatively heavily (and never at parties, always in our apartment), I found that a glass of wine or whiskey most nights of the week became commonplace. It was a toxic friendship: one of my roommates definitely had/has a drinking problem, but since we all abused alcohol together,  we normalized our behavior and kept any worries at bay. 

Flash forward five years: I'm in grad school, the job market is grim, my research and writing haven't been going as smoothly as I need them to, and I'm constantly stressed, overworked, and burned out. Oh, and then I got surgery 3 days before my entire university shut down due to the pandemic. The surgery left me inactive for six months while I healed, and I gained a little weight. Probably five pounds, but I've always had pretty bad body image issues. 

So, naturally, I self-medicated. A glass of something helped ease my stress. A quick drink cleared my mind and made writing easier. I felt less inhibited during endless, anxiety-inducing Zoom meetings if I took a shot a short while before. One drink in the evening became one (or two) some afternoons--in addition, of course, to one while making dinner, one with dinner, and a couple after dinner. I was seldom drunk, but rather always maintaining a ""functional buzz"" as I'd call it. When I could finally throw myself back into a good exercise routine, recovery wasn't going as well. My body composition stayed relatively the same. I felt insecure and stressed, so I fed the cycle, having more alcohol to cope with the problems that alcohol was making worse. 

I realized after a particularly bad hangover five days ago that I wasn't in control anymore. I'd grown weak leaning on alcohol as a crutch, and my ability to stand strong in the face of challenging circumstances wasn't what it used to be. So, on the 10th, after a day of awful nausea and a pounding headache, I decided I needed a break. I was still living under the fantasy that I'd have a cooling-off period and return to moderation shortly thereafter. Has this ever worked in the past? No. Did I expect it to work in the present? Deep down, I knew the answer was no. 

Then I came on here and saw someone drop the absolute best metaphor I have ever read to describe this kind of scenario: it's easier to keep a tiger in a cage than on a leash. It resonated so profoundly with me. I don't have much control over my drinking when the aim is to keep it in check; I do have control when the alcohol isn't present to push the limits of my impulse control. I hate to be an all-or-nothing person, and I doubted people who told me that the struggle with drinking is often that, but I have come to agree. That tiger is locked in its cage indefinitely. 

To go five days feels like such a small achievement compared to some of the incredible triumphs I have read about on here, but all of your posts really help remind me why I'm kicking this habit. IWNDWYT, and thank you.",24,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45024443}"

I was a heavy drinker (binging on the weekends for 10+ years and then a pint or more of liquor a day the last year), so I'm really scared. I have some very faint bruising on my forearms that won't go away and I've convinced myself it's liver related. I have no other symptoms of liver issues (and trust me, I have researched them!) at this time.

I'm 50 days sober and I know that the liver is an incredible organ that can heal itself if it's not past the point of no return, so I'm trying to hold out some hope. I was wondering if anyone here has any success stories to tell about getting their health back after becoming sober. I could really use some inspiration if it's out there.

Over the weekend, we got a lot of snow, so I shoveled my driveway and walk, then my elderly neighbor’s driveway and walk. Twice. I was super sore last night and my partner offered me half a Vicodin, which seemed like a great idea. As soon as it hit, I found the scrip and took another (full) tablet. I started to feel the high coming on and knew I’d fucked up. Yet I wanted more. And I wanted to mix it with booze. I did not have more Vicodin, nor did I start drinking with my partner.

Dammit, I’m super disappointed with myself right now. I cannot go down another rabbit hole in this lifetime. I already know where they end up.

Thanks for all the posts, SD community. I read a bunch of them this morning and feel power over my demons. Such a slippery slope, though. Just a little high and all of a sudden I want all the boozes. 

BTW, I went to three meetings yesterday between snow shoveling bouts. Even that support didn’t deflect my poor choice-making.

I know for sure me quitting drinking has caused some friends to take a good look at their relationship with alcohol.  While they probably will not quit for good, they are healthier for examining their relationship with alcohol.  I had a great time and did not even think about alcohol after we entered the restaurant.  Good luck out there.  Remember you are not alone.  Myself and many, many others have struggled with alcohol and are living proof you can live a better life without alcohol in it.

The usual back and forth of justifications to drink *(Quarantine is making every day a monotonous colourless blur - just have a glass of wine!)* vs reasons not to drink *(Alcohol is crushing my dreams and ambitions and stealing my life away!)*. 

Usually I would let this debate go on for an hour or two before caving to the desire to drink. But I decided to talk to my fiance first. This was partly to suss out if he was going to be busy this evening *(Justification: If he has to work all night, you'll be so lonely - have some wine!)* but also because I wanted his help in the debate. And I told him I was really craving a drink, and how hard it was not to give in, and how shitty it felt.

We talked about it for a bit, and he said he's here to support me. And it really did help. The craving is still there, but after talking to him I managed to shut down the debate. Whenever it pops up, I deflect it with the definitive thought: I am not drinking today. 

In my experience, the debate of ""should I drink today or not?"" is one of the most draining parts of alcohol addiction. The scientific term for it is *cognitive dissonance* and it's so fucking exhausting. And when I'm tired, I'm more likely to lose the debate and give in to the craving. Talking with my fiance about my desire to drink made me feel like I had another member on my debate team, and I didn't have to work as hard.

I've always had trouble talking to my fiance about my struggle to stop drinking, even though he's very supportive. Partly out of shame, partly out of fear that he'll realize I'm even more fucked up than he thought, and partly because he's not a drinker so I'm doubtful he can ever truly understand my struggle. But it was worth it to talk to him. It really helps to remember that I'm not as alone as I think I am.

None of you are alone either! Talk to your loved ones and talk to the other wonderful humans on this subreddit. Or talk to me! There are always people who want to support you.

2021-02-15 16:34:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lknsaq/stopped_drinking_in_january_at_34_sharing_my_story/,Stopped drinking in January at 34 - sharing my story,"I started drinking in my early 20’s after not really doing it much in high school or college.  I enjoyed it responsibly, and honestly it was a huge part of making great memories during that time.  Either out with friends or staying home playing video games with my wife or alone.  It had never really been a problem, more of a fun pastime.  However, over the years especially once I turned 30 I noticed certain warning signs.  Inability to not drink on the weekend since it’s much more fun and I “earned” it, hiding alcohol from my wife and friends, inability to stop myself from drinking certain special beers or liquors if my wife bought them for herself, and generally a fear of keeping alcohol in the house since it was difficult to resist drinking it.  I’d also pour things out in the morning if I was really disappointed with myself, then buy more after a day or two anyway.

Despite these red flags, I never felt like an “alcoholic” per-se since I was otherwise doing well in life.  During the pandemic I definitely drank a lot more, because didn’t we all, right?  Towards the end of 2020 was when I finally started to feel like this wasn’t something I could do anymore.  I was working from home and drinking on the weekend turned into “why not Friday?” which turned into Thursday and Wednesday, then just why not every night.  Once again, I was still able to succeed at work despite drinking enough to not usually remember going to bed the previous night.  After so many days in a row and just getting used to feeling like complete shit, I recall noticing how dramatically better I would feel when I took a break.  I would have more stamina, stopped getting winded all the time, more attention span, stopped needing naps, etc.  

So my final straw was actually two-fold.  First, I realized that I didn’t have control anymore.  I would literally drink every single day, and I couldn’t stop myself from having 4-5 high % beers and several shots, or rather just a swig of whatever was in the cabinet.  I knew that even if I could do this and still function, it was a dark path with very real consequences.  Eventually it would harm my career, marriage, and health if I didn’t break these habits.  The second straw was on a night out with friends, I had several beers and then did a swig of 151 rum.  Turns out I greatly underestimated this shit and I vomited that night.  It’s been years since I did that, and it was a major wake-up call, like why the hell am I doing this? 

So now, here I am.  I’ve generally stopped drinking for the past 2 months and the difference is incredible.  I generally feel like I’m the best version of myself, and every day I get to wake up feeling happy and healthy.  I’m not tired, my memory is better, my attitude is better, and I feel more in-shape than I have in years.  I’ve filled the time I would normally drink with working out, and drinking a shit-ton of tea.  At night I’ve changed my habits to focus on relaxing with tea and candles, and enjoying my hobbies that way rather than with a beer.  I go to bed earlier and wake up earlier since I don’t need to sleep off a hangover until 11:30.
 
I won’t say it’s been perfect as I have had 3 nights in the last 2 months where I have drank.  Each time it’s the same old song, I can’t control how much I have and don’t recall going to bed.  But I’m relieved to say that each time I don’t really have fun, and feel like shit and annoyed the next day.  I don’t count those episodes as having to “start over” or a failure, more of a reminder of why I’m doing this. I have watched people kill themselves with alcohol in horrible ways and I know the danger is real.  

My greatest fear with this was that drinking would continue to be so much fun, it would be impossible for me to break away from it, but each time I keep trying it now the experience has been just awful.  I’ve actually reached a point where I have much more fun sober, and that’s how I know I can stick with this.  I know I’ll be a much better person, and avoid much of the trouble that the path of alcoholism leads to.  This is the future I’m going to choose for myself.",8,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.44850662}"

At this point of my sobriety in the past, I would have the most violent, horrid & vivid nightmare imaginable multiple times a night that would shoot me right out of my bed & pacing back & forth. 

This time around of sobriety (and final) I added joirnaling in the morning & in the evening to summarize my thoughts, emotions, interactions through the day, 3 positive things that happened to me in the day, what I would improve upon if I had the opportunity etc. 

All my anxiety and perceived bad emotions are gone along with my nightmares.  I am having the happiest dreams I can remember about old friends, places I love, or just something funny. More often than not I wake up with a smile on my face and sleeping through the night in its entirety which improves my following day. 

I'm a 29 year old male thats always had a difficult time expressing my emotions and this has been honestly a groundbreaking & seemingly life changing tool that's just so simple. Idk if ill ever not journal for the rest of my life.

If you want to start journaling but don't know where to start, just write what you're thinking. You'll be amazed how much is truly on your mind AND BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF.  Nobody is going to see it so use horrible language if you want, write down those bad habits people don't know about that you want to change. It's judgement free.

I quit drinking in late December when my friend had a drinking episode which sent her to the hospital. I usually take Feb-Apr off but I started early this year to support her. I made agreements with her family to not bring her around alcohol and I've kept good to my word. I've been reaping the rewards of sobriety, and hoping this is the year I quit forever. She's been looking forward to drinking again and I just found out she has resumed.

The issue is that we spend time together being sober and hooking up. It's been great for both of us. But now I'll be on my own and she gave a concerted effort to convince me to try her new moderation method. I can't moderate; I find ways to break my own rules and then completely stop trying to moderate. Not good.

I don't enjoy drinking ""a little."" I drink big. So since it's ""go big or go home,"" I went home. It's been a great chance to resume actually living life. I'm worried that losing a sober partner is going to undermine my support and that there will be drinking and alcohol around me when we spend intimate time together. I'm also concerned that she could have another relapse type of event that it would send me into a panic.

Our relationship has been great during the pandemic. I'm an extrovert and all the alone/virtual time has been problematic. I don't want to change the relationship we have but I don't control the actions of others. If I don't like the relationship or don't feel safe, I have the option to leave. But don't want it to end because it offers me so much, especially now. Being lonely has had a hugely negative effect on my drinking.

I'm unsure how to constructively consider my situation. There's not been an ask to drink around me yet but it's unwise to pretend it won't happen. We've been very honest with each other but I've already seen signs that is breaking down.

Have others been here? How did you approach the thinking? What would you have done differently, now that you know what you know in hindsight?

I've been reading 'Why We Sleep' by Matthew Walker and I just read a chapter which finally explained why. Wanted to share the excerpt, just in case anyone else might find this interesting too.

""Alcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM sleep that we know of. When the body metabolizes alcohol it produces by-product chemicals called aldehydes and ketones. The aldehydes in particular will block the brain’s ability to generate REM sleep. It’s rather like the cerebral version of cardiac arrest, preventing the pulsating beat of brainwaves that otherwise power dream sleep. People consuming even moderate amounts of alcohol in the afternoon and/or evening are thus depriving themselves of dream sleep. 

There is a sad and extreme demonstration of this fact observed in alcoholics who, when drinking, can show little in the way of any identifiable REM sleep. Going for such long stretches of time without dream sleep produces a tremendous buildup in, and backlog of, pressure to obtain REM sleep. So great, in fact, that it inflicts a frightening consequence upon these individuals: aggressive intrusions of dreaming while they are wide awake. The pent-up REM-sleep pressure erupts forcefully into waking consciousness, causing hallucinations, delusions, and gross disorientation. The technical term for this terrifying psychotic state is “delirium tremens.” 

Should the addict enter a rehabilitation program and abstain from alcohol, the brain will begin feasting on REM sleep, binging in a desperate effort to recover that which it has been long starved of—an effect called the REM-sleep rebound""",109,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6877128}"

Didnt even need an ice box just throw that shit outside. That kinda set these days as habitual party days for me. So instead of thinking about that.... imma write what has happened over this time for me. 

I remember reading a post titled something like ""im still fat and ugly"" the post was emphasizing the fact that ""results may vary"". And i feel that. Life goes on. 

1st hardship - my brother (college friend but family) got into a fucking plane crash just a few months in. Broke his neck. It was a single engine plane but it had a parachute on it so that saved his life. For about a week straight i didnt know if he was going to make it. But i made it without drinking. How i did that was leaning on people in various programs be it AA or Smart recovery or alumni at my rehab I called everyone. I was in some shit emotionally and in early recovery our emotions are like exposed nerve endings... very fragile, very exposed, painful, and real. I was not equipped to deal with them because i had been drinking emotions away for over ten years. I thank those people everyday. 

2nd Getting a demotion at work - I was an engineer and now im on the floor. I had to change the way I looked at it. I wasnt being punished i was being given an opportunity to be an even better engineer or engineering manager one day. After a talk with my boss he told me im never going to trust an engineering manager that has no floor experience. Again what got me through understanding it as a growth opportunity instead of punishment was community. Being able to talk it through with SANE people. As i am sick and am in the process of returning to sanity i view things very differently. It affects every aspect of life and this proved that to me. 

My grandmother died - the last time i saw her in person I was drunk. Very drunk. Passed out at the dinner table drunk. She was scared of getting covif so we have had alot of facetime conversations but it still gets me that the last time i saw her i was hammered and on benzos. Trust me its not a good feeling. What got me through this was a stupid AA phrase thats repeated way too often... ""Just do the nect right thing""... so i thought about drinking the pain away and just kept thinking of ""the next right thing"" and did whatever the fuck that was instead. And guess what it worked. 

The point of this part of my post is to let you know life is still going to happen. 

***The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!*** - Rocky 

That quote defines my last 307 days. 

Results:

* i did lose weight. I was at 210 lbs when i went to rehab today im at 182 lbs.

* I still feel hungover when i wake up and have been trying to get a sleep study (sleep apnea). 

*I have reconnected with my family and talk to them everday

* i dont waste time drinking rather im productive with my time 

* i have started enjoying video games again

* i remember the TV shows that i watch

* my dog seems to snuggle more 

* i got a girlfriend and had my first valentine's day since highschool. 

The list of positives is a great way to remind yourself why you do what you do... but they arent always obvious. It takes practice to ""live in gratitude"" which i certainly do not do well and am working on. But the point of this journey is always about progress not perfection. So today the next right thing is probably building a snow man and trying to get some hot chocolate.

He was 18 years old and they were headed to a no-alcohol dance club. I decided the world would be a better place if everyone quit and everyone included me. I was not as chemically dependant as other people but the drinking culture was strong with family and friends. I was definitely the odd man out at family and work gatherings.

Both of my grandfathers were teetotalers and I looked to them as I struggled giving up the habit and dealing with the drinking culture. I think my sons drink less because I don't drink at all and maybe I can be an example if they decide to quit someday. 

One of my sons' friends started drinking hard in high school and just kept drinking. We kept praying he would hit bottom and then turn around. He got a good government job and then lost it. At age 32 he ended up in the hospital, his liver had finally had enough. His brother offered part of his liver but the boy never got strong enough for the transplant. After two months in the hospital he died. I remember him playing pickle in the yard and video games during sleepovers and I just can't believe he is dead.

Our culture is just so totally at odds with what is good for us. When I actually stop to think about it, it just blows my mind.

I believe what they said was, 'it's great to see you back at 100% you'. Until I woke up this morning, I didn't realise how long I'd been waiting for someone I loved to remind me I was doing well. It made me cry.

When I was at my worst, I was fairly isolated physically from anyone who cared about me. I fell into old habits instead of doing the difficult thing and reaching out - tale as old as time.  The upside to being out of sight and out of mind is that no one ever saw me at my worst or had to worry about me. The down is that no one but me can compare who I am now to who I've been. I have to be proud of me, because no one else knows how far I had to claw my way up.


It's no one's job but ours to cheer ourselves on. There is no parade or fanfare for making these changes, but for what it's worth, for anyone else who really needs to hear it, I am proud of you for whatever steps you're taking today towards your own happiness and health.

I saw this on here and this has helped tremendously, whenever I had the temptation of drinking, I took a moment to think about what would happen if I took that drink and how I would feel. 1 hour, 4 hours, one day, one week. This alone has been a huge factor in keeping me from drinking because all the thought processes thinking forward every time I've been tempted have reminded me it would never be worth it. 

\-Keep track. Keep the mission fresh in your head.

Seriously, keep track of the process and progress. Track every inch of ground you gain. Relish in it. This is a battle and every moment you don't drink you gain ground against the enemy. Look at it everyday. Think about how long it took to get to this moment. Think about everything you stand to lose if you falter. Keep coming on here daily and posting and reading. Read the happy stories and sad ones. Know everyday why you're here and what you stand to lose. Hold the line! 

\-Focus not only on not drinking, but undoing the damage through good sleep, exercise and eating well. 

This one has been another big one for me. I've always been big on health and fitness before the drinking took that away. But whether you're recovering from alcoholism or not, there's no denying pursuing a healthy, active lifestyle will not only help you feel good, but it will also help you look good, feel good about yourself, and keep you busy from not drinking. Plus, you'll think twice about drinking after you've begun to make progress in fear of losing it. 

\-STAY BUSY.

As you've read above, health and fitness has been one of the things keeping me busy but if I had a gun to my head and I had to give someone sobriety advise it would be this. STAY BUSY. I bought myself a gaming PC as well. I've been cleaning my house and doing projects. I've been going out on my boat and doing projects there. I've been spending more time with my wife. Point being, I haven't even had time to consider drinking! Honestly, I've been so busy I'm kind of perplexed about how I ever found time to be drunk all the time. I've actually started to grow a fear of being drunk because I won't be able to do all the other stuff I want and need to do. I think this has been the back bone of my sobriety honestly if I had to source it to one thing. 

\-Fess up, you need help (your close circle) 

This actually is one I didn't do the first time around I think this is why I ultimately failed my first real attempt at sobriety. I tried carrying the burden alone, and it's a burden. While I told people I wasn't drinking. I never was honest as to why. I told everyone I was doing it to lose weight. I only told one person(My wife) I had a problem but I was never completely forthcoming and honest enough to actually explain the gravity of it. I had no real support. Just a bunch of people who were like ""Well why don't you just drink less?"" Now that I've totally outed myself to a few people, and lightly fessed up to a few. The burden is far less. It was painful admitting out loud, but was ultimately a huge relief. It's still something I struggle with and probably will continue to until I have more time under my belt but it feels better knowing I won't have to worry about the people I've told being unknowingly inconsiderate and actually having a few people rooting for me. 

\-Avoid alcohol only situations.

I come from a boozy family and run with a boozy crowd. Cutting everyone off isn't going to happen. That being said, I am around a bunch of people who are drinking pretty consistently. I've politely turned down offers to drink while present and have even gone as far as grabbing a non-alcoholic beers (which are awesome!) and mocktails. But what has really been a help is trying to gear scenarios towards locations where drinkers can drink and dry drunks can well, not drink. For example, lately I've been gearing hang out sessions to arcades/virtual reality places that serve booze, driving ranges, axe throwing, boating/fishing etc etc. Just so the activity has been non-booze centered. It's important to note that I've been avoiding situations where I'm by myself with someone who wants to drink (other than my wife) because I've noticed these scenarios are more difficult to navigate if they want to drink and don't have someone to drink with.

I woke up with the very best of intentions. I made a batch of fresh green juices. I exercised. I ate super healthy. This was the start of the new, healthy, clean me!  I was doing so great!  Then at 6pm, a wave of depression and exhaustion came. You can probably figure out what came next:

I just wanted to numb my brain and forget my problems. I went to the liquor store and bought whiskey. I downloaded a couple of my favorite shows to watch, but was too drunk and tired to watch more than 2 minutes.  In the end, it was exactly the same thing as 12 days ago: me alone on my couch, drunk, not watching the shows I had planned on watching, instead just posting stupid nonsense on Facebook then deleting it. Just so lame, stupid, not fun.   By the way I do not work today because of President's Day, so that also factored into my alcoholic logic: ""You have Monday off! That gives you a full day to recover before going back to work on Tuesday!""  Us alcoholics think we are so smart and sneaky, but really we are only fooling ourselves!

I just feel disappointed in myself because prior to 6pm I was doing great:  10 full days sober, eating salads and drinking fresh green juices, walking and exercising.  Then I essentially sabotage myself. 

I am right back on the wagon, but this sh*t is hard. Once I get a strong craving to drink, I really struggle sometimes to overrule it.

Things are fine, cravings have passed and my anxiety is way down, but I realize I was hoping for so much more out of sobriety.  I have bipolar II, and my mood seems to have evened out, which is good, but also frustrating.  

I guess I was hoping that quitting drinking would solve all my problems, and for the first few weeks it seemed to.  I was developing fantastic new habits - working out almost every day and cleaning my house every night as my way of coping with cravings.  I went to bed every night feeling like I had accomplished something.  

I realize now, though, that I was going through a hypomanic phase, and while I haven’t exactly crashed down completely, I’m basically back to where I was in my pre-drinking days (ie, my childhood and teen years).  I was diagnosed with inattentive type ADHD at age 30, so I understand why I’m so lazy, but I  desperately miss those 3-4 weeks when I had a reason to do more than scroll on the Internet all day.  I can really kick ass at life when I absolutely need to, but when there’s nothing urgent that needs to be done I just can’t motivate myself to do anything.

I’m not tempted to drink at all right now, but I suspect that when my current laziness ultimately leads to anxiety and depression that might change.  I’m just so ashamed of the way I live, even when I’m sober, and for awhile I had real hope that I had turned a corner.

I've started writing this post to ask for some tips and tricks on how to be honest with myself, but in the process I've felt that what I really needed was to get some things off my chest, so it turned into a kind of (incoherent and unfocused) rambling. It also got very loooonnng but I hope it is okay to post anyway. If you guys think that this should be posted somewhere else - please feel free to tell me. Also, English is not my first language, so I apologize for any mistakes. 

So, when I (29F, if that's important) thought about my alcohol consumption before, I've always felt like I'm not that bad compared to the people who have a REAL DRINKING PROBLEM (you know... anybody but me): I've never had any long-term physical effects from alcohol, no issues with the law, I have a good job, social life, etc. Once in a while I would even go through a period of time when I would be able to moderate my drinking pretty well (although I haven't learned at all to predict when and why it would start - or end). Other than those periods, most of the time I'm a weekend binge drinker: it's not hard for me to stay sober for days - no cravings, no withdrawals. It's just that when I start drinking, it's really, really hard for me to stop until I black out. But if I can organize my binge well - Friday night and/or Saturday, no commitments for the next day, no responsibilities - it doesn't hurt anybody, right? Right?

So, it seemed to me that I had everything under control. But of course there are some things - demons that get out when I'm drunk, some memories, dark things that I learned to ignore over the years, because they hurt too much when I really tried to think about them. So I packed those things into some neat boxes inside my head labeled: ""Everybody fucks up like this sometimes, so no big deal"", ""It wasn't that bad"", ""Despite this I'm still doing well"", and many others; and also, ""It's okay because I don't talk to anybody from back then anymore"". And it's this last box which I guess broke the whole system now. 

For years I've left a way out for myself for when my drunken shenanigans got too crazy and I couldn't deal with shame and guilt and pain - here's what I told myself: don't get close to people, don't trust them, don't let yourself love them too much, and then when you need to - just run, leave them and don't come back, you don't have to see them ever again, don't have to miss them, just find new people who don't know who you are yet and start all over again. And it worked for a long time. I'm not proud of it.

So, the thing that led me to this sub is simple: this past weekend I've done something that really hurt my boyfriend, and I'm too embarrassed to go into the details, but long story short, I don't even know if I still have a boyfriend, and he's still too mad to even talk to me. And it's around this moment that someone like him would be left behind with all the other ghosts, I would move on and that would be that. 

Except I suddenly realized that this time is different. This guy is different. He's a good man, an amazing boyfriend, he's better than pretty much everyone I've ever been with, and I love him so much, and I hurt him, and now I really miss him. This one time when I am truly not ready to let someone go it may well turn out that it is actually me who is being let go and it's too late for me to do anything about it. And I know that this Saturday, when he remarked that maybe I shouldn't have this beer, I should have listened, but I've always gotten away with it before (of course, it was not the first conversation about this, far from it). Of course I've had that beer, because I'm an adult, and don't you try to control me, and it's a great party on a Saturday, what could go wrong? No commitments, no responsibilities, it doesn't hurt anybody. You know. Like those stories usually go.

So, now I don't know how to deal with my emotions and what to do. If I'm being completely honest with myself, I realize that I've never learned how to deal with many, many things, because I've had a (real, yes) drinking problem for a long time - basically, I've been drunk throughout my so-called formative years; it's always been binge drinking for me, even when I was in my teens. I feel like denial doesn't work as well as it used to anymore. 

What I also realize is that it's time for me to start getting rid of my bad habits instead of the good people. And maybe, slowly, I will figure it all out and will be able to earn back all the trust that I lost. Or at least I will know that I did all I could. So, this is my second day - not much, but it's a start. IWNDWYT.",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4985759}"

I have 3 kids of my own (i never drank during pregnancy) and my husband has 2. We've been married for 13 years this June. I have tried quitting drinking countless times,  i literally couldn't tell you how many times. Drinking has always been a sore spot in our marriage but on the other hand, my husband admits to being an enabler. Drinking ""got me through "" some painful times (the death of my grandmother and the death of my 30 year old brother) and it caused some painful times (the fights, the name calling,  threats of divorce,  etc)
My husband has a genetic heart condition (cardiomyopathy) that will ultimately kill him, sooner than later. I wont be able to grow old with him into our 70s or watch his granddaughters grow up. He truly is the love of my life and I have broken his heart and trust so many times. 
We had agreed I could have a couple light drinks with Thanksgiving and then came Christmas and then new year's.  And then it became once a week. And last week, it was 5 days I drank. When cautiously asking for a drink on day 6, he looked so discouraged.  He said that his only wish before he died was for me to stop drinking.  He said he is worried that I am going to drink myself to death. 
I do ultimately,  want to be sober, not only for me but for him also. I know that I can't be successful in quitting by doing it for somebody else. But something just keeps holding me back. I dont even really get much of a buzz when I do drink. I havent been truly drunk in several months. It's that ""high"" I get when I know I'm going to have a drink, I cant explain it. I'm afraid I wont ever be able to replace that feeling. I know in time different things will be able to replace it. I know this doesnt make sense.  Basically,  I want to quit drinking but I don't.  Right now the cards are in my hand.  I can continue how I am, slowly getting worse or I can quit and have my husband, kids and sister proud of me. I'm afraid of losing my best friend but at the same time I know I can gain even better without it.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

***

In my early days of sobriety I had a very ambivalent relationship with the AoK. I either felt guilty for not having good deeds to display, or I felt guilty for displaying them, cashing out on my saintliness. After a while I realized that the AoK wasn´t about showing off to the world what a kindhearted fellow I was, but striving to be aware of all the good things that actually happen - not just by chance or the laws of nature, but as a result of human interaction. The AoK helped me believe in people - and in myself. So here we are!

***

I stumbled upon the African concept of ""ubuntu"" a while ago, through quotes from Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela. As a wide and varied philosophy, it´s too much to dive into here, but the main idea is that we create both ourselves and eachother through our interaction. We are all one, and cannot exist apart. We can tear eachother down, or build eachother up, through distance and closeness, firmness and vulnerability, action and attitude.

The thing is, this applies to *everyone* I meet, even strangers passing on the street. My gaze or smile might break or make their day. It´s not my responsibility to save the world, but I have an *opportunity* to make someone´s world just a little bit better, like you do mine. I thank you for making my day better, by paying it forward. (At least I try to!)

That's me for this week. How's everyone else doing, any AoK that you'd like to share?

Dealing with a wonderful significant other (SO) who I love and am committed to, but who doesn't want to be sober. Dealing with depression and self loathing. But I still have 42 days without alcohol, so it could be worse.

Just had the worst day. My SO and I dont really celebrate Valentine's day, but this was by far the worst v-day we've ever had in our 15+ years together. I made poor choices on Saturday night.  SO and I stayed out partying at a friend's place until 4am. I did not drink, but I spent the day with other people who were drinking.  I feel luckily since I had/have no desired to drink, but other substances were involved and I partook. Why? Must be becuase I am addicted, but I told myself it was just because my SO wasnt ready to go home yet and I was tired and needed something to stay awake.  I thought the hangover wouldn't be so bad as long as I didnt have alcohol, but I woke up Sunday morning after only 3 hours of sleep feeling absolutely awful.

 I panicked about plans/commitments I had later that day (bbq with friends, I said I'd bring fresh baked bread and dessert) and my emotions spiralled out of control. Mostly self-hate, anxiety about letting my friends and my SO down. I could not stop crying and feeling panicked.  Ate a bunch of junk food and smoked canabis to try and calm my nerves. 

My wonderful SO was so supportive and loving even though they were obviously very hung over and not feeling great either. But they really wanted me to suck it up and go to this bbq. Because it was Vday, they didn't want to go alone (understandable, it was a double date sort of thing) but they also didnt want to cancel last minute. I am so ashamed of myself. My SO begged me to just go for a little while, promised me that I could do it, that they would help me through it, but I just could not.  The more they pushed, the more I panicked and freaked out. Curled up in the fetal position while gasping for air between sobs and rocking myself back and forth. My SO gave me a quarter of a Xanax and eventually I cried myself to sleep. 

I am so depressed. I cried all day thinking about how much I hate myself.  I can't stand up for mysel and what I want to do, can't say no to people/drugs. How I'll never really enjoy life, because I don't know what I want for my life, and don't want to even live life anymore.  It feels like it's been so long (for me, ~6 weeks) since I've had suicidal thoughts. Its like how you don't appreciate clear sinuses until you have a cold. Feeling so bad today made me realize it has been a while.

So what have I learned? Just quitting alchohol isn't enough for me. The devil's dandruff also fucks up my mental health just as bad as alcohol.  That I don't want to keep doing this to myself. Dying seems like a nice escape, but I'll keep trying at being sober.  I guess I expected to be better than where I am at after 42 days sober.  I still feel overwhelmed by life.  At least without alcohol I have the desire to get better. Even as awful as I feel right now, I think I can keep going, and I will continue to try and make better choices in the future.

2021-02-15 06:52:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lkc7gq/one_week_sober_this_is_amazing/,One week sober - this is amazing!,"Today marks my first sober week in a long, long time. I've been a heavy drinker for almost 25 years, starting slowly in high school up to a point where drinking 3 bottles of wine or 8-9 pints of beer almost every day was not the exception, but just another weeknight. I work from home as an engineer for a tech company, so if anything, Corona has only made things more convenient. I very rarely slip up, and due to my level of tolerance I can hold a normal conversation even when seriously inebriated. I am pretty sure my family does not suspect a thing.

The start realization that I needed to change something came around Christmas, when I drank a whole bottle of Honey Jack Daniels mixed with Coke during an evening, and.......nobody noticed. Neither during the evening, nor the next morning when I woke up and stumbled to breakfast with the mother of all hangovers. As many of you can probably relate to, I was waiting for the ""right"" opportunity to stop (Christmas, New Years, something), but continued drinking half a gallon of wine until 2 in the morning every night.

Then an opportunity presented itself: Snow! 10 days ago we started getting a ton of snow here. The wife needs the car with the winter tires to get to work, so I was more or less stranded at home. Last weekend my supply of wine ran out. At that point I was close to putting my snow boots on and hiking a few miles to the next supermarket. Fortunately, I didn't and stopped drinking myself to sleep. 

The first nights were rough. I've read the reports on insomnia, craving, etc. and they are definitely true. Last Thursday I was crawling up the walls, so I started sports as an outlet. Situps, jacknives, hours on my indoor bike. Over the years I had ballooned up to almost 300 pounds (alcohol has a lot of calories), so this wasn't much fun either, but I started sleeping better.

Now, one week in. I feel pretty great. I sleep a lot better. 11pm to 7am, instead of 2am to 6:30am (all that fluid you drank before going to be needs to go somewhere), and no more reshuffling work stuff, to catch naps in the morning, because you are still zonked out. 

I feel well rested in the morning and during the day

My work performance improved immediately

So! Much! Time!: Even on Sunday I got up at 7am, spend some time cycling and actually did hike a few miles (without going to the supermarket to get drinks), and when I was done it was still before 11am. I actually ran out of stuff to do and just relaxed and watched some TV. That never used to happen, because when you are suffering from a hangover until noon, work can get pretty frantic for the rest of the day.  
I lost 5 pounds already, my complexion has started to clear up a bit, and even my skin isn't so dried out anymore that it is flaking off.

I really hope I can continue on this path. Right now it seems almost too easy. Whether or not I started this in time....only time will tell. 25+ years of abuse have surely left their mark somewhere, but right now I feel very positive.",23,{'rona': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6672449}"

Dear Addiction, 

We met years ago. When I was just a kid. And I admit we did have fun at first. But it wasn’t long until things got ugly. My family noticed it first, and soon I realized too I had a devil by my side.

Some say I was born with you there. Others say that getting rid of you was as simple as not picking up the phone or showing up at your door. All I know is I have tried one hundred times to kill you, but in the end you won and damn near buried me.

Looking back, you’ve been the cause of a lot of wasted years, a lot of tears. And too much disappointment to begin to count. 

Relationships have been sabotaged. My physical health deteriorated. You fucked up my career, my education, my motivation and my mental state. 

The amount of money I have spent on you makes me absolutely sick. 

I was never able to live up to my full potential having you around. So now it’s time you go. 

In my heart I always knew I would thrive without you by my side. 

I do not know what the future will bring. But I know won’t be spent with you. 

I’m going to trade you for co-workers that respect me, a family that loves me, friends who appreciate me, and a nice girl by my side.

Whatever this life brings I will take it on clear-eyed and sober.

I was walking to the bathroom and woke up to two paramedics standing over me. Luckily a roomate heard the bang and was able to call 911. I couldn't recall what day it was  for a solid 30 minutes and was extremely confused until they put the patient band on me and my memory came rushing back. For the past week I have been trying to taper off of alcohol and in my opinion I didn't do it correctly and had a seizure. The ER doctor said my vitals and CTE scan were completely fine and that I didn't look like I had a seizure and just hadn't eaten all day, was dehydrated, and simply fainted. But I still had my doubts and my room mate definitely said he turned me on my side because I was convulsing a little bit. Didn't get any Ativan or treatment and they released me immediately after test results came back. Everything looked mostly good except my elevated (but reversible) liver enzymes. Long story short, I'm done with alcohol. I'm not damaging myself anymore. Wish me luck.

After 1380 days sober from November 2015 - September 2019 I was peer pressured into drinking.... lots. I went from nothing to loads and loads of beer and wine while on a work trip. The worst part is that I lied to my wife (fiancee at the time) afterwards as I was so ashamed. I couldn't believe after _all_ that time, it's something that had so much power over me that I would trade the respect and trust in our relationship for one day of drinking.

I used that day as an excuse that I somehow now knew how to moderate and I was ready to start drinking again. From there/November 2019 I went back to almost my same habits. Sure, I wasn't drinking during the week anymore but on the weekends I more than made up for it. There were nights where my wife and I would share 2 bottles of wine and cocktails and not think it was an issue. I can see now that we become instigators for each other. She was always a fairly moderate drinker who could leave it at a glass but when I came off the wagon again, I made her much worse.

I'm ready to stop again. All of the ways I learned how to deal with difficult events I spent so long working up over those years I'm ready to remember. I'm ready to be back at my fighting weight both mentally and physically. I'm done with the excuses. Just because I haven't come to work hungover or I still exercise isn't an excuse to keep poisoning my body. 

I'm sorry for failing myself. I'm sorry for failing my wife. And I'm ready to do better. I find it hard to commit to something like this forever so I'll do it this time like I've done it before, one day at a time. This time my wife wants to join me in the adventure and I couldn't be any happier. We can egg each other on in a positive way.

When I opened up about my problems to any of my friends, they told me I am only putting on a show and drinking this much for attention, and it's not ""cool"" for a girl to do all of this. This just made me drink more. The first person who took me seriously was my psychiatrist, now I've been on an antidepressant for 2 months  (SSRI), and things are beginning to clear up.

So, I had realisation, again, that I need to stop drinking instead of kidding myself that, ""It's fine, it's a part of culture"", or ""I've not drank for a week, I feel good, let's have a drink"", or any of the lies I tell myself.

I regularly borrow money to buy beer or takeaway, usually both, but a few days ago I asked a friend to borrow a tenner and they said yes, but it took them hours to get round to sending it. This enraged me, because I wanted a drink. It got late so I just went to bed and all the shops had shut anyway. This made me realise I need help, again.

As someone who is incredibly introverted (I'm actually on a waiting list to get assessed for Autistic Spectrum Disorder), so group therapy is hell for me, I've tried and failed and won't do it again. I did find one place that offers one to one counselling but they are not open and won't be for some months. So I need a place to be, an app, or website that offers digital support.

Also, as much as it saddens me, I've realised that I need to move away from my area, away from my friends and away from the many, many triggers. I live in a small town, so regularly bump into people I know. I can't move for at least a year but I know I need to remove my friends of 20 years from my life, or at least for a considerable amount of time.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8000639}"

So there I was, 2 years ago - morbidly obese, jobless, neckbeard mentality, and worst of all - alcoholic. Like, REALLY alcoholic. From dusk to dawn kinda one.

One day a girl that i begged to be with me said no, cause you are a weird needy fat fuck. At least she didnt know i was an alcoholic.
I woke up the next morning depressed as shit, I said this is it..life ain't worth it. I went to the store and bought as many beers as i could, wanting to just end it all and drink myself to death.
Now there i was sitting in my livingroom with random youtube music videos blasting from my tv, i was like 8 beers in already. Nothing spectacular, not even close to my usual breakfast limit.
I wasn't a rock fan, but suddenly a random song came on - Metallica - Fade to Black. And it caught my attention, I was feeling like I was the one singing it: ""I have lost the will to live...Need the end to set me free"".
Then the song got to a part where it said ""I was me but now he's gone""...that's when i dropped my beer and started crying like crazy. Then i looked at the empty cans and thought: ""You...You fucking pieces of shit..you are the reason I am not me anymore. FUCK YOU!!""
I then cried my eyes out for the next 3 days or so when i began working out. I was deeply thinking: if alcohol is gone, then the worst of me dies with it.
I was so determined i didnt care i couldnt do one push-up. I was getting my life back, day by day.
I began jogging with more Metallica songs in my headphones, up to the point i didn't really care about alcohol anymore. The bad life i had it seems, fades away.
Fast forward 2 years - i am now engaged, have a great carreer, got a driver's licence and a car and my own place. I am never drinking again, I don't care. I am the one who's in control of my life, not that fucking chemical.
Planning to do the newlyweds' dance on Nothing Else Matters, as a tribute to that one day which changed my life forever.

So QUIT now. JUST DO IT, and NEVER look back!
Remember to always Ride The Lightning, my friends!

I was fully focused on getting the items I needed for my dog while still fighting with myself on whether or not to buy alcohol. The store was crowded, my anxiety told me to get to the checkout line and get the hell out. I found myself walking to my car with only eggs and frozen broccoli for the dog and a kombucha for myself. I still wanted to go to a different store for booze when I got home. The sad angries were taking over. I texted my sober friend, vented to her about why I was so upset and she told me it wasn’t worth it. 

I started making my dog’s food, walked her and she was so happy. 

I listened to my friend, I didn’t drink and she was so happy.

I sat with my feelings. I realized that I can’t control everything and things will work out the way they’re supposed to. Drinking will not help or change these things.

Its just walking right up the stairs to the drunk I used to be, while using the excuse of ""hey, its not easy. You can slip up. It's okay."" I drank over half a fifth of vodka last night chasing that warmth, and then oddly got up early this morning and went for coffee and breakfast. Then went to play disc golf with some friends who all no showed, but I picked up a couple white claws on the way thinking ""oh we'll all be drinking so it's cool."" Then as the only person who showed I played alone while there were other disc golfers around thinking ""Ha! Look at me. Dumbass out here drinking before noon by himself. SO COOL.""

Woke up a bit ago and instantly thinking about the little bit of vodka in the fridge.

I’m a 27 year old guy. I’ve been struggling with alcohol addiction since I was about 15-18 years old. I’m from Louisiana, and social/binge drinking everyday and/or every-weekend is the norm here. It’s what I grew up knowing. Fast forward from around 18 years old to 8 years later, in 2018. I realized I was tired of being controlled by alcohol, and I moved to Florida in December of 2018 and checked myself into a detox/rehab program. I spent the best 3 months of my life there, sober and kind of loving it. Before I left for FL I was drinking a pint-1/2 a fifth of Makers Mark every night if the week. After rehab I moved back home to LA and stayed sober for a couple of months. I bought a house and continued working my same job as a nurse. Fast forward from 2019 to now, and I haven’t been sober for more than 4 days straight in at least a year. I justify my drinking one or two nights a week with “I’m not doing it every night, so I’m not where I was before.” 
I don’t really know what my point in saying all this is, but I do know that if I learned anything during my time in treatment it’s that I should tell someone... anyone what’s going on in my brain. I want to be sober again, I want to enjoy my life.

This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is: A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn't: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I’m haunted by ghosts. Phantoms from my drunken past. They often visit unbidden, intrusive visions of a sordid past that can seize me with a stunning ferocity. There’s a tenacity to their grip that is alarming because, rather than diminish with time, they seem to intensify as my sobriety progresses. I’ve realized there is a futility in resisting. That in trying to wrest free from their grasp I only empower them. So I submit and allow them to work me over. Sometimes I even indulge these guests and follow them as they lead me through a landscape of loss, humiliation, and pain. I marvel at the ruination wrought by drink as I move deeper into this abyss, stopping to mournfully examine all the shards of broken things, people, and hopes strewn about in this winding path of destruction. The specter is always lurking, hovering somewhere out there on the horizon. The only question is when it will strike. And will I be capable of withstanding the onslaught the next time.

But there are times when I willfully summon these ghosts, like the urge to reach out to old friends from another lifetime in an attempt to preserve something from our shared past. There’s an inexplicable need to commune with what I’ve hurt. We all create our own narratives to define who we are. If I were to edit out all the wounds who would I be? Something fundamental to my identity would be lost if I let go of this past, however unsavory it is. And are these wounds not teachable moments and vivid reminders of why I cannot drink? Useable fragments salvaged from the wreckage and repurposed for fashioning a new self? Is there not something positive to be said for shame? For guilt? I suppose I could engage, actively and thoroughly, in some selective remembering and forgetting. Forge a new narrative purged of all the debauchery. It would be one hell of a revision. But I keep coming back to the stubborn belief that I need to remember in order to remain sober. That, in a kind of spiritual sense, through suffering there is a sort of salvation. Or at least consolation.

Even if I were to rid myself of these things and people, these ghosts, I can never fully leave that place of despair and disgrace. My drinking has marked me, its abuses inscribed on my body in the form of numerous scars acquired from innumerable accidents. And there's all the pins attached to the plate holding together my wrist after I thought it was a good idea to fight a wall one terrible night (my apartment turned out to be much more structurally sound than I had thought!). And, more troubling, this anguish sits deep in my heart. I can’t remember the good times without those awful endings seeping in and poisoning them.

But I dunno. I really don’t. A sneaking ambivalence had created quite the dilemma. To embrace this space between holding on and letting go is both comforting and a slow death by a thousand cuts. My ghosts torment and taunt, they push me right up against the threshold of what is bearable. But they keep me sober. Paradoxically, they prevent me from taking that first sip that will undoubtedly set me on yet another path of destruction. They force me to see, unflinchingly and with chilling clarity, the life I could’ve had and the one I can if I just hold steady and stay the course. Maybe they’re actually benevolent. Forces for good protecting others from experiencing the pain they had, shielding them from the unendurable. No, I have no idea what to do with them, these strange companions of mine.

How about your ghosts? Are they still out there, milling around? Or have they, and thus you, moved on?

I am a 30 year old single mom, who has wasted too much of my life on alcohol. After yet another night full of drinking and waking up with a terrible hangover, I realize I can not do this anymore. I mean, I literally can not mentally, emotionally and psychically handle feeling like this anymore. Yet another day wasted, pounding headache, churning stomach, off the chart anxiety. Not to mention the guilt and shame I feel for myself. I hate it- I hate how much control it has over my life and how little control I have. Maybe that’s why I’ve been in denial for so long. At one point in my early 20s I quit drinking and joined AA for 3 months. It was the best 3 months of my life- I picked up a hobby I loved and had an amazing amount of energy. But then I succumbed. And alas almost a decade later here I am. 

At this point, I drink to escape. Once we’re home from work/school I will have beer or two. Once she’s in bed, maybe a few more, maybe the whole six pack or more of strong IPA. I wake up early feeling awful, have to get us both ready for the day and by the time I’m home all I can think about is having a beer because I’m so exhausted and ran down from the day. And this cycle has continued now for 3 years. The guilt eats me alive as a parent and my drinking has become my shameful secret. I love my daughter more than I could ever describe. The anxiety/guilt from the drinking is so bad I am internally beating myself up constantly. Thinking my daughter doesn’t deserve a mom like me, she deserves so much better. But then she looks at me and says “I love you mommy, you’re the best in the whole world” and I don’t feel worthy.  Genuinely do not feel like I deserve to be loved by such a pure thing. 

I can’t fight this battle anymore. I’m losing and I’m exhausted. I know what needs to happen. I know alcohol has to go. And even though I’m terrified, I know my daughter deserves better and I know I deserve better. I can’t keep destroying myself like this. There has to be more to life. I know there is more to life.

I am so happy to get this off of my chest tonight. I haven’t told anyone how severely I’m struggling. It feels so good to type this out to people who might understand. To not feel alone and trapped by the drinking. Thank you to whoever reads this for taking the time to do so. I am very much looking forward to a new beginning and a community of people who know what it’s like. Seriously, thank you.",171,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7740595}"

I am so scared that it’s too late and that I’m going to die. I get this weird sharp pain on the back right of my head/neck, and my liver feels uncomfortable and it hurts sometimes too. My heart also just feels weird like I can’t breathe properly. I went to the doctor pre-COVID with discomfort in my liver and he said my results were fine, and my dumbass was like oh yay then I can keep drinking. Saw a new doctor this month since my insurance changed and it was a phone appointment so nothing was accurate. The same kind of discomfort and pain is in my liver but the brain and heart thing is new...did anyone else experience these feelings? I’m seriously so terrified, I’m thinking about going to the ER to make sure...

Turns out they were just glorified drinking buddies,"23M. I made the decision to seriously decrease my alcohol consumption come the New Year. Prior to that I was labeling myself as a “social drinker” but realistically binge drinking every weekend was more than just a reason to be social. I realized I was running away from facing hard truths and processing closure with my emotions I had remnant of a breakup this past year. 

I feel better now! Beforehand I used to start drinking and would always look for a reason to keep going “let’s go to another club!” “Let’s go watch the game!” “let’s go to the bar after the beach!” It was a mix of wanting to be social and wanting to continue the avoidant patterns of my behavior. The last time I drank was a couple days ago and I only had two jack on the rocks and the way it made me feel no longer appealed to me and I had no desire to keep drinking. Before that I hadn’t drank since December 28th. 

Anyways, main point of this vent. I told a lot of people I considered close friends I planned on seriously cutting down/stopping my drinking unless it was for a special occasion. They were supportive and wished me well, but these were the same groups of people I would hangout with every weekend and drink. I tried inviting them to do other things that didn’t involve drinking and they weren’t really about it. And they kept inviting me out to bars and clubs knowing I don’t drink but they felt like they wanted to include me but not enough to alter what they were doing. It just makes me feel sad knowing these people who I thought were my close friends are/were really just drinking buddies. We’ve grown apart since the new year. But at the same time I know it’s okay because improving myself and choosing growth over company will lead to me meeting better and more positive influences of friends. Right now just feeling sad and was wondering if anyone else could relate. Thanks all!!

2.  I am out of debt.  Literally I have more money now than I owed before I quit drinking.  I'm certainly not rich, but I have finally reached a point where I can comfortably call in sick without freaking out about making rent for the next month.  I am extremely lucky in that I have kept working during the pandemic.


3.  My appearance. To me it's the same old ugly mug, but I have hung out with people recently who only knew me years ago when I was a drunk and the first the they said was, ""You look good!""  I honestly feel sexy for a change.


4.  My appetite.  Now that I have energy I have been cooking a lot more and eating a square 3 meals a day (plus snacks!).  Took me a little while to get used to burgers without beer but honestly they taste even better now!  Everything's flavor has been intensified.  I was severely underweight before I quit but now I'm solidly in the healthy category.


5.  Adopted a new dog.  Now we've got a full house.  My boy Frankie obviously came from an abusive home, and sober me was able to give him all the love he needed to come out of his shell.   Now my old boy Marco has someone to keep him young!


6.  I am actually somewhat social now. Despite all the restrictions I have actually made friends during all of this.  Not going to huge parties or anything but certainly not staying at home drinking by myself.  I can even hang out with people who are drinking and more often than not when I mention i don't drink they are like, ""I should do that...""


Lots more but these stick out the most to me.  Anyways I've been looking forward to making this post for quite a while. If you're looking for advice all I can really tell you is that this subs motto really works, don't be afraid to ask for help, and to keep yourself busy.  Idle hands are the devils playground and all.


 Happy Valentines Day Everyone.  Which reminds me of number 7: my beautiful girlfriend has become my fiancé! Life is looking up!

 But the whole deal of me being here is to drink much less. A LOT less. But I don't want to tell anyone this personal journey of mine. There is a lot of judgment in my life, and it's hard to explain, but I have to keep this private.

I had some bites of ice cream to hopefully make the vomit experience a little more pleasant. I shouldn't know tips and tricks to make puking easier. I shouldn't have a vomit routine. I bring my phone in there and scroll through my phone between dry heaves, I treat it like it's a normal thing. 

Well, it's not. Normal people don't do that.
I can guarantee you not one person I hung out with yesterday woke up with regrets or a hangover. They sipped on their two beers over the course of three hours. (which, gross, because the patios are super heated and who wants warm beer? Whatever. Not the point.)

Now, my youngest (nearly 30) and her partner brought 2 jugs of juice because she has decided to radically cut back on her drinking.  Her mate doesn't drink much and often goes dry by choice. My older child and her spouse did bring drinks....3 cider for her and 3 beer for him. They each left 1.  My husband had a few glasses of wine but nothing in excess.  I had NA drinks all night. We all had the best time playing games and laughing! 

I don't know if my stopping has influenced my younger daughter to drastically reduce. I do know my husband drinks way less since I've quit.

I'm glad I was able to have a fun night without alcohol!  It was my first real attempt due to covid restricting so much and no-one getting together.

Even though I was sober last night,  I am still happy to fall into bed tonight!  Disrupted routines make me a little uncomfortable.

What I want to discuss, and what I am proud of as a small victory is this:

Bar delivery took like 3-4 courses to catch up to food delivery.  That was my first “from the universe” that I didn’t need to be drinking anyway. 

So, my server is like, “we will start you from the beginning”. And basically bring out 3-4 wines back to back as the bar has them ready, regardless of the course that I’m on. So, my mind goes to “I have to drink really fast! Drink 4 wines before my 5th course comes out in 5 mins”

So, instead, I ask for the wine that’s intended to go with my course. Then continue from there

So, long story short is that I didn’t “NOT DRINK”. But I drank wayyyyy less and with a much different attitude than I would have in prior times. 

So, I’m thinking about it, and writing about it. And I’m proud that before I would have been like “what kind of lush sits there with 7 unfinished glasses of wine? Everyone will think she has a problem”
Now I’m like “I have 7 glasses of wine in front of me that I have no desire to finish, even though they are over halfway full”

I have 6 dollars to my name until payday. I have been a daily beer drinker for probably about 5 or 6 years, gradually increasing from 1-2/day to about 8-12/day most recently. With the pandemic and working from home, I've been starting at lunch and doing about one an hour on average until bedtime. I typically drink IPAs, so higher abv than some beers but not super high.

I had my last beer Thursday night 2/11. It's now Sunday night and I haven't really had many withdrawal symptoms, thankfully. I've been tired and moody, and wanting to strangle my husband, but that's about it.

I WANT a beer, but I don't feel like I NEED one. 

But I know the first thing I do when I get some money from a job on Wednesday is get a case and go right back to what I was doing. 

Obviously, as is true for everyone I'm sure, there are a ton of reasons why I drink. Self-medicating for PTSD, depression, and anxiety is one big reason (I also for-real medicate with meds and marijuana). Another is social. I feel like this would be an ideal time to deal with the social aspect of quitting, since I'm not social ever lol (thank you pandemic). Of course, the other side of that is, well, I'm not social ever. My husband and I have been stuck in this apartment for a year, which is obviously not good for mental health...So.

Idk what my point is, really. Just trying to honor this gift/curse of financial insecurity that is teaching me I need to get this under control for more reasons than just my bank account.

I made it through though.","Woke up this morning, realized its Sunday and I still never got around to getting my drug test done for the job I start next month. Not a massive deal, I got time and I plan on doing it tomorrow, but my hungover brain made this massive deal out of it. Had no energy to get out of bed so I just sat there and worried about it for an hour or so. 

Realized it's Valentine's day when I went through my snapchat stories. Realized I'm alone af AND a drunk now. Last year I at least had some to drunkenly be fun and sweet around. 

Haven't held food down all day. Felt like trash. Flirted with the idea of starting to drink early and just take it slow and ""eventually I won't feel how sick I am and it'll be fine."" 

Probably spent a collective hour or so sitting by the toilet just in case, and you guessed it after eating some fish my dad ordered I puked and have everyone worried now. 

Dog ran off, we got him back no worries, but that was just a lot of running around, sweating like a pig, probably looking like a mess to the neighbors all the while. 

Because it's Valentine's day and all of my friends are in relationships, so I had no one to talk to distract myself like I normally do. I know it's whiney but it's so helpful to be able to pop online with someone and get my mind off drinking. Instead the alcoholic, hungover, anxious, sick, lazy mind had my attention all day. 

Anyways I did the whole one more hour thing, telling myself it'll be easier to drink once my stomach settled down. Hour after hour passed, and I can thankfully say I'll feel a little better rather than a little worse, and might even have the energy to work on the checklist. 

For those of you are ""experimenting"" with drinking, but starting to see signs it's going south, now is the best time to stop. I was there two years ago, posting on this reddit, asking if it's normal, and everyone here near unanimously said it wasn't normal and I was heading down a bad path. 

I won't lie, it was fun. For about a few months. All that fun though was slowly costing me. 150lbs... 160... 170... Now I'm 180 lbs. Feel like trash all the time. Hate the way I look. Rarely have peaceful thoughts. I can tell you, it is not, never was, and never will be worth your physical and mental health. For those of you I'm that position I was, take the next exit off that path and thank me later. 

Anyways, I'm back at it, gonna take some melatonin, lay down and watch youtube till I fall asleep. It's been a bad day, but that's as good an excuse as any to make the decision to feel better tomorrow.

I drank heavily for about 10 years. I, a 5'4f, could drink most grown men under the table and I wore it like a badge of honor. Waking up, I'd tell myself that I could get up, work through my hangover, and go home for an easy night. I always stopped at the liquor store. I never kept my promises. I was handcuffed to a bottle and it kept me from scheduling appointments, making plans with friends and actually LIVING my life. I'm so glad that I don't know that girl anymore. 

Over the last 9 months I've gone from underperforming at work to training new employees. I have become the wife and stepmom that I always dreamed about being. I'm an attentive friend, and a more understanding daughter. 

I used to love getting getting absolutely shit faced while cooking dinner. When I put the bottle down I thought I was putting my love of food and cooking on the back burner. You guys, I cook 1,000,000x better!!!  It's so crazy that I didn't think I could cook without booze.

I may have had a “spiritual awakening.”","I think I may have had last night what AA terms a “spiritual awakening.”  And that was that I am a textbook alcoholic. 

Sure, I’ve been saying this the last month in meetings. Sure, I was fully aware I drank too much for 20 years for relief from my emotional problems. But I wasn’t as bad as *actual* alcoholics. I didn’t drink sun-up to sundown, nor get rushed to the ER on a semi-regular basis. I held jobs, and have a family who loves me. I wasn’t crashing cars nor beating my wife. I drank, but “wasn’t a full-blown alcoholic.”

That was a lie, and I didn’t even know it. And I then realized that drinking is just the end result of actually being an alcoholic and possessing and practicing the undesirable behaviors and traits of one. 

I thought my problems with severe anxiety, panic, and depression were primarily a result of my parents’ divorce, which was my mother’s “fault.” Or with my Dad, who didn’t have enough “guy time” with me through the years. Or just genetics (which do play a role, of course).

My habitual anger and resentment towards so many I knew was justified, I believed. *They* were the problem, in their actions. I was the mature and intelligent one who lived how all people should. If I just cut them off, I would feel better. (Yet not stop drinking).  How odd that I *always* had someone available to hold a grudge towards. 

Alas, last night out of desperation (and after 3 days of sobriety; 28 total sober days since AA), I began sipping on a mixed drink to relieve intense anxiety and depression, but decided to begin reading the “Big Book” for some more stories. Thankfully, I had no desire to get a strong buzz nor drunk. While reading, I learned that, in traits and behaviors, *I am definitely an alcoholic.* Drinking is just something alcoholics like me do to cope with the overwhelming emotions that come about due to frequent isolation, bouts of intense anger due to holding grudges for years from being “disrespected” or “mistreated,” and the inability to accept my past and present and everything in it. 

Many of my issues were from the way I approached life and reacted to things. I was/am an alcoholic, and I needed to be rehabilitated. It was a real “lightbulb” moment. 

I awoke this morning feeling totally and completely empty, as if I’d been entirely hollowed out like a beached shell. I was very depressed, with zero energy, and I laid in bed for the next 2 hours barely being able to move. However, I also had this foreign sense of an inner calm and peace within my own mind, the likes of which I don’t think I’ve ever known. 

I finally got up, and went and got some coffee (I sip on half-decaf daily).  I openly repeated in prayer that I believed a power greater than myself could restore me to sanity (step 2). I then only had thoughts of my wife, and of bringing her back some breakfast and coffee. My energy started to gradually rise, and I then shared my thoughts in a Zoom AA meeting that I believe I may have had a spiritual awakening as the program teaches. 

My problems and issues were noone else’s fault. **I** am an alcoholic, and my own mind was the culprit. 

Even though I’ve felt small twinges of body anxiety/adrenaline rushes randomly throughout the day, the inner calm has remained. And I’ve also had moments of organic joy with random smiling, as if I’ve stumbled upon a buried treasure. I’ve taken no supplements to aid anxiety as I normally have needed lately. Only time will tell if this remains. 

It is taught that acceptance of what can’t be changed is the path to serenity, and I think I am finding that to be absolutely true. 

I hope this helps someone, and thanks for reading. For some of us, putting down the drink is only the very first step of a multitude of things that need to happen to rehabilitate and heal.",50,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.48212972}"

Feeling better than ever. Eating a bit too much though probably. Sweats have gone. Palpations gone. Sleep not perfect but better than it has been in a long time. Colitis meds/steroids helping so much. Colonoscopy at end of month to see whats happening up there. If doc says it is still treatable thats would be awesome. I shall be having blood work done in 7 weeks just to see if my liver is improving from previous test ( really hope I haven't left it too late ). 
Taking old interests back up, 3D printing, 3d modelling, making toys for my brothers step daughter, problem solving, cooking, walking. Focus has increased in work. My boss says I'm like a different person.
If my liver and my colon are recoverable, I am going to ask my boss if I can do my Engineering Masters Degrees. Will be another good goal to keep me straight. But one step at a time. I will be patient and wait 7 weeks. I don't feel ill, but I know that is nothing to go by when it comes to liver problems. Some negative part of my mind tells me that I do not deserve recovery ( I know this is silly ). If the test results are bad, I will accept it. I have gone through it in my head over and over the worst case scenario's. My only concern if I was to pass ( sorry for being morbid! ) is how my brother would cope. We do not have any other living blood relatives. I pray that God will give him strength and that his wife and their family will comfort him, he also has a baby on the way too! He is stronger than me and he has all this support that I'm sure will get him through it.

The step is ""Made a decison to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood him.""

In the 12 and 12, it talks about how we still have to use our ""self will"" to do the work that our higher power suggests we do. So turning our will over just means we let go of our ideas about what we need to do to stay sober, and align ourselves with the higher power. It's not saying we don't have to do a lot of hard work, and that it's not going to take discipline and perseverance on our part....right?

Another question I have is that it seems like at the beginning, my conception of a higher power pretty much has to include the advice/people with long-time sobriety in AA, the group conscience, my sponsor, etc.. I say this because if I decide my higher power is just the voice in my head telling me to do the next right thing, that's essentially me playing God. That voice is not perfect, I've been wrong a lot when I trust my intuition about things. I make assumptions that lead to fear and resentment, step four is showing me that. I feel like I can't completely trust my beliefs, and I'm told I don't have to, thankfully. I have faith that if I just keep showing up to AA and trying my best, the proper understanding will come.

Fortunately I'm moving into a place where I see step-work as more of a privilege than anything, especially step 3. It may be difficult to do what God wants me to do, afterall drinking is the clearest example I can think of of taking the easy way out. But I have faith that doing this work- mainly just abstaining from acting out of selfish desires- is going to bring so much joy and peace into my life. I don't feel like my faith in the program is slipping, I just want to understand what my attitude needs to be. What is the real value of self will? Shouldn't I demand a high level of discipline from myself if doing so is really an act of self-love? I want to identify the balance between personal accountability, and giving it to God. I guess I'm just agnostic about needing God's grace, there seem to be plenty of people who get sober without it and are happy without it. I view grace as something that has changed my life, but it's always just been people helping me. I don't see why it matters if I call that God or if I just say people helped me. Ok that was like 17 questions and pretty disorganized, kindof like my sharing in meetings. I guess that's just my style.

I have made progress. A lot of progress. However- I am not 100% where I need to be. Since October- I’d say I have been sober 85% of the time. That 15% is me choosing to drink for a day once every week or two. That is GIGANTIC for the woman who was drinking 7 days a week- most days to black out. 

I would bring my kids on my run to the liquor store (maybe once or twice a month). I would lie to them and call it “the coffee store” to... well, I suppose because I was ashamed. 

I’m a loud drunk. I yell. A lot. I’m not very nice after a certain amount.

This morning I got up and made breakfast and I made myself a coffee. As I sat at the table my son made a face. I asked him what was on his mind and he said “you’re having coffee. I don’t want you to get drunk and start yelling”

Heart. Crushed. 

My kids have never used the word drunk. My husband and I seem to avoid it as well. I think my husband is feeding their minds. I don’t think this is something my kid would come up with on his own. Maybe I’m just crazy. (Maybe trying to pull on the ol’ heart strings to get me to the 100% mark) 

And now my lie isn’t helping/hiding anything. Now they associate coffee with me changing personalities when coffee is not the problem- it is what I look forward to these sober mornings. 

I keep pushing to get sober for good- for them. They are young and I wish with my whole being that I can replace those crappy memories of me with better ones- ones with who their mom really is. I’m still having trouble finding her. But I know she’s under the layers of guilt, shame, self loathing... 

AND AT THE SAME TIME- I WANT A DRINK. BAD.

I threw a bottle (3/4 full) of gin in the recycling. 
I keep trying to figure out how I would get it out of there. (Very tall can- very short me) 
I also know that it was my alcoholic subconscious that didn’t dump it out before tossing it. So I could go back on my decision.

And then I remember how much I spent on it

Then I remember I don’t have tonic.

But I do have olives

Or juice

Or hell- I’ll drink it straight. Never stopped me before. 

And then I think about last Sunday- when I was sippin’ a few G & Ts, cooking, laughing, dancing with my kids- having a great time and then... I don’t. I switched to 100 proof liquor and woke up in bed. The drink that has always been my go to. My downfall. I originally bought gin- because I don’t get to that point on 40 proof.

(I personally think this act of going to the hospital was excessive and not necessary but so was throwing the phone). Per the hospitals protocol, the police was sent to get my statement. I was asleep by the time the officers came and they arrested me for domestic violence. I posted bail. My husband is trying to console me and I love him to death but I’m also so angry with myself and him for escalating this issue. I know it’s a consequence from alcohol which is now costing me a shit ton of money. Reality is I should not drink. It’s proven I cannot control the alcohol, instead alcohol controls me and it unleashes my anger relentlessly! I hope I stay strong and continue to be sober. It’ll be hard but I’m hoping I can stay strong. Cuz right now all I want to do is drown my feelings. Stay strong people.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8805591}"

Started drinking again after a divorce, light spiral lead to a 3mph car ""accident"" and a DWI.

The Long Version:
I was here a year and a half ago. Made it about 10 months without many issues. Only got close to slipping a couple times early on, but never fell off the wagon per se. During that time I was even MORE unhappy with my life, and then started the process of a divorce, which led to drinking again.

During those 10 months of not drinking I realized my Ex-wife had taken control of every decision in my life, including not drinking. Which my decision to stop drinking was something I had to fight her to let me do initially. But now, months later, I no longer had control over it -- I was never allows to touch it again, on threat of a divorce if I ever slip up. Not healthy, and I was sober enough to recognize it by this point. So when I decided to get divorced (amicably, eventually) for unrelated reasons I tricked myself into thinking drinking was now OK, since clearly it was her just holding me back. You know, that sort of mental gymnastics routine that happens to addicts.

It was fine at first, but as these things tend to go I quickly rebuilt my ""lost"" tolerance and then some. I didn't let myself harp on myself for bad decisions as I was struggling enough with mental demons through the divorce. My liking for beer took full advantage of that and I ended up drinking more than ever, now unimpeded by another human being, including myself.

Well, last night I was out at a bar trying not to think about my first valentines day (despite the fact that I never really bought in to it anyway) and I was sad. I wanted to see people. I masked up, thinking only to stay out for a couple and just chill. I felt fine, I was walking fine, conversing fine, no motor skill impairment. So when I finished I left, thinking nothing of it. I could barely feel the alcohol anyway. I was good to go!

I parked in the back of the lot, away from other cars, as it's a bar where lil car bumps happen. I'm in MN, so it was -15f outside and I didn't want to bring my big bulky jacket into the bar so I was sporting just a long sleeved fleece. I was cold coming out so I wasn't paying attention that someone in a small black car parked directly behind me, and close enough that I couldn't see it from my mirror (SUV height difference) or the backup cams (as it was black). I backed up a foot to allow extra room for a U-turn and apparently bumped into the car. No damage, no alarms went off. I didn't even notice. I was shivering, chattering teeth, driving in snow (which has a distinct loud sound), listening to music and just looking forward to a warm bed. 

The bouncer flagged me down and let me know that I hit a car, I immediately pulled over so I could find the patron and give insurance info but he told me no, you can't do that, stay put, he's calling the cops. I simply wanted to head back into the lot and jot down my insurance info for the guy in case any damage was done. Hard to imagine at 3 mph for 1ft, but you never know. Cold makes plastic brittle. Instead he called the cops, and I blew .11, legal limit is .08. 

Bam. Done.

It could be a LOT worse, but the universe is sending a sign so I'm listening. I blew a low number and being a first offense on an otherwise pristine record it shouldn't effect me legally long term. Hired a lawyer, and proceeding. I owned up to it. But it certainly was eye opening.

See, the scary part for me was this:** I always knew where my line was** -- when I was approaching being unable to drive. I was confident in it. I trusted it and myself. I had a line and never crossed it. But last night, I hadn't crossed that mental line. Yet I was passed the .08 mark. That means I no longer knew where the line was anymore or how it felt. It's all gray now. I can't trust myself that next time I'll be .16 or .20 or hit a moving car or something much worse. 

And thus, I will quit drinking again. For good this time, hopefully. I need to find hobbies, that's for sure. I'm too idle. But for now, for this valentines day, I will not drink with you.",15,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44083458}"

We dated long distance and got married youngish - at 21. My bad habits started when we were dating, and I got sneaky when we were married. Long story short, I had something to drink every day, even if it made me feel sick, even if I didn't feel like it... I was caught in a cycle of being bored so I would drink to pass the time and not actually live my life... 

Maybe I'll post about it later cuz it may be triggering for some, but I went through something deeply traumatic last year that was a direct result of my drinking. My husband was my rock through this time, and walked along side me as we went to court to find justice (didn't happen). He was so patient and understanding as I processed through the grief and pain. However, this didn't stop my drinking. I thought I ""had it under control""... hah... no it still controlled me.

I finally decided to stop drinking three months ago now. It's hard to put my finger on what flipped the switch for me, but I sat down with him and told him I'm done drinking.

WOW! Guys! I feel like myself again for the first time in years!! I have drawn, painted, sung, danced, and enjoyed life more in the last 2 months than I had in the last 4 years... 

So, you may be asking yourself, well why does she feel like a stranger in her marriage? It's hard to put into words but I will do my best. Then other day, hubby and I were having a miscommunication moment. He kept reacting like I was being snippy and nitpicking him. I was confused because I was intentionally going out of my way to speak to him in kindness. (It was all over laundry 🤣) When we did a play by play, after the fact, I had an epiphany. 

I had NO idea how I came across for over four years and for our entire marriage... sadly, every night I would have atleast one drink (usually more) and so my best intentions were often lost ""in the drink"". I was snippy, snarky and mean all while in my own head I was gracious, patient and kind. 


I have the privilege of relearning how to communicate with my loving hubby, and thankfully he is on board as well. It's easy to assume motive when that is the way someone has acted for years. It truly feels like I'm finally waking up and getting to know my SO all over again, and it gives my heart joy to do so.. My story is only starting.

In many ways I am still not ready to say, “I quit drinking.”  Since we haven’t been in many social situations due to Covid, I haven’t really had to explain to extended family or friends. 
As dumb as this sounds, I still don’t want them to think or realize my drinking was as bad as it was. 
Who knows, maybe as we all creep back towards some semblance of normalcy this year I will just tell them I quit. Or maybe I will just say I am taking a break and really feeling healthy and don’t miss it, so I’ll just see how long this break goes..... 

Either way, who cares!  I haven’t had a drop in 180 days, feel great, am better Dad, husband, employee, boss and Coach without it. 

After all, does it really ever need to be more than “a break” as long as the break doesn’t end today??

Have a wonderful Valentine’s Day, folks!

I didn’t think of myself as being addicted, just being a little too reliant on alcohol. It was probably a couple of glasses of wine or mixed drinks each time I drank, but I could go a few days without drinking so I didn’t think it was bad. But the hangovers were so bad. And the blackouts were embarrassing. So I decided I’d try one month of not drinking to see how I’d do. I didn’t think it would be hard. And at first, it wasn’t. Lots of sparkling water and mocktails really worked for me. My partner and friends have been supportive, but they all drink a lot and in front of me, and it’s hard for me not feel pressured even if they say I don’t have to drink. The more I read here, the more I’m convinced I don’t want drinking to be a part of my life anymore. I’m reading Holly Whitaker’s “Quit Like a Woman: The Radical Choice to Not Drink in a Culture Obsessed with Alcohol,” which has also helped immensely. 

Last night, for Valentine’s Day, I had a drink with my partner for dinner. He offered and at first I said no, but I second guessed myself and changed my mind. I didn’t think I could celebrate a “holiday” without having a drink. I only had one and had sparkling water for the rest of the night, which is definitely progress and I’m glad about that. But I feel disappointed and frustrated that I’m starting over now.

I bought another 12 pack Monday night after lying in bed all day feeling like shit. I ended up not drinking it and just leaving it in the fridge.

Fast forward one week and I managed to taper down by drinking 6 beers/1 beer an hour for the first 4 days. Last night I cut down again and only drank 3 beers without any issues. I haven't been drunk now in 7 days and this has been the easiest way I have ever quit in the 14 years I have struggled with alcohol, withdrawal seemed almost non existent this time around!

Even though physically my body is adjusting smoothly that little addiction monster in my mind is trying it's best to freak me out. In a sick way I feel like I'm going through a break up with a toxic girlfriend who I fought with all the time. Instead of feeling excited to move on im sad to see her go and will miss the good times (wtf?!?!).

I have read most of ""This Naked Mind"" and tried working some exercises from SMART Recovery in the passed but honestly while going through terrible withdrawal or being hungover I feel I never fully absorbed the message. 

I feel like now that I managed to treat the physical symptoms of quitting it free's up my mental bandwidth to deal with the mental aspect. Tapering has never worked for me in the passed but this round staying busy and not allowing myself to get a buzz seems like it was key! 

Anyways I'm excited to start this next week working on the next phase in my journey. Tonight after work will also be a test for me. I get home at midnight and I'm off tomorrow, Sunday nights I always get shit faced. I will be on super high alert tonight, my goal is to just drunk 3 beers to continue my taper.

I consider myself a heavy drinker and the past four days haven't been that bad. Just mainly fighting that urge to drink, try to keep myself busy, anxiety, and some wild mood changes. But I haven't touched anything and by now, when I have tried in the past, I break after 3 days. I'm on day 5.  But last night, I had a weird dream where it was Hunger Games style, and the last one standing remained sober. I lost this weird dream game because I fell to my old reliable, shots of Sailor Jerry with a diet Coke chaser. I woke up craving Sailor Jerry and I haven't been able to get it out of my mind.

I am not about to give up four days of solid work and I try to keep reminding myself that I was feeling like shit every time that I drank. I've noticed small changes...stomach doesn't always hurt, my bloated belly is going down slowly, I'm sleeping, and taking my antidepressants again which is making a world of difference compared to when I was drunk. I didn't take my meds when I was drinking because I didn't want to mix the two.

But I need to keep busy. Drinking was originally a crutch to self-medicating with my depression and anxiety and it has also evolved into how I used to stave off boredom. I'm trying to keep busy with work, writing (an old hobby), and playing Fallout 76.

How do you all handle these cravings, especially being newly sober? I just went to the grocery store to get some food for the week and cook. While I was there, I bought a root beer, sprite, and a bunch of flavored soda waters. I'm trying but it is so damn hard today.

Then I looked at what I've accomplished...three medals in Conqueror challenges...Mt Fuji, Hadrian's Wall a d Giza pyramids...294km in total in this time of not drinking. I've been focused on health and even back in the gym.

I'm not only worried about the health implications around this, but it really bothers me that I can't train my mind to think of something else.

He was my guest. He knows I've been sober for over 2 years and that I refuse to go to bars with him. We had an agreement that maybe he would only go out and drink heavily one night, likely the night of the wedding. I made sure I got a hotel in Clearwater so that we would be close. 

After the wedding dinner, he went to the bar with the bride and family. Which is fine, but I opted not to go of course. I caught a ride back to the hotel with the bride and groom after they were done. My friend stayed. I tried to get him to come, and he said ""you're ditchng me again"" I said ""I never agreed to hang out with you in this environment. I told you know and I think you need to stop drinking for the night."" He gave me a dirty look and got another drink. He was already drunk. 

Back at the hotel I kept face timing and calling with another friend of mine. A stranger answered his FaceTime (he was also drunk) and said how fucked up my friend was. I kept trying to get the name of the bar so we could send an uber. He kept hanging up. I kept my sound on and we stayed up for a while. I knew I wasn't going to be able to drag him out of the bar. 

The next call we get is from a cop. The cop told us that the friend was belligerent and highly intoxicated and that if we didn't get him a ride he would be arrested. We agreed and sent an uber. Which, he didn't even get in.  He got in a taxi. He had no money. We paid for it. We carried him upstairs. He passed out immediately. 

Fast forward 3 hours, he's violently throwing up in the bathroom. I go to use someone else's bathroom cause I can tell he might have alcohol poisoning. Been there. I come back and there's puke everywhere in the bathroom, the shower is on and there's a pile of shit on the floor. Literal shit. I said enough is enough.

I left a note, grabbed the key, set a wake up call with the front desk, left and got an uber to the condo I was staying at with him. Half of me wants to feel bad for leaving him, but the other half is pissed off that he would be so irresponsible when we had an agreement. People left me to figure myself out so I thought it best to let him do the same. I'm not his mother. 

I just really needed to vent. He isn't back yet. I'm nervous for when he does get back. I don't want to be around him, I'm angry and stuck in florida for 2 more days with him. Someone please tell me it's okay to be angry and to have taken control, set my boundaries and left him there.

I’ve not been tempted by any of the alcohol free drinks as I thought it might be a slippery slope. But I do miss the bitterness of an IPA and it would go brilliantly with what I had bought.

I took a few sips and was really impressed. Then I investigated the cool typography on the can. It reads ‘0.5% Alcohol’. 

I didn’t drink anymore of it, but I’m bloody annoyed that alcohol is in my system, even in such a small amount.

I bought myself a set of sobriety chips, and it’s so perfect that the [1-month chip](https://imgur.com/a/ffkJ7Ok) was red!

This is my second time giving up alcohol. Last time was spring/summer 2020 and I made it 44 days, then intentionally started drinking again. I had never intended to give up for good, just wanted a break. But once I started drinking again, it only took a couple of months before I was right back to my old ways and struggling hard. 

I hadn’t really thought it through much when I decided to stop drinking this time. I couldn’t, or I wouldn’t have done it. I always had an excuse: 
* well, I want to be able to drink for Christmas and New Year’s Eve of course!
* well I have to taper beforehand, so I can’t just start cold turkey on New Year’s Day
* if I start in January, I won’t be able to drink on my 30th birthday! The horror!
* but then Valentine’s Day will be coming up, what if I’m dating someone by then? I have to be able to drink wine for a v-day date!
* but then my friend’s birthday is in March & it’s St. Patrick’s day too, how can I not drink for that?!

And so on. So I finally just tapered down and quit on January 14. My birthday was fine without alcohol. I went on one sober, virtual date which was a fail, so I didn’t even have to worry about today. Turns out all of my excuses were definitely invalid. Who would’ve thought?! Haha. Anyway, I’ve checked in to this sub everyday and just want to say thanks for all of your help. You people are amazing, and this is by far one of the best little corners of the Internet.

At this point I was completely oblivious to the aftermath that was about to unfold. The bag arrived in the post, I positioned myself on the sofa and started munching on the sweets. This was great! I ate a lot of the sweets in one sitting. Not even an hour later, my belly started making strange gurgling noises, it was as if something was cooking in there! And then, the pain started creeping in. I cannot remember the last time I’ve had such pain (ok, during labour), and at that point I actually got worried as I could hardly get off the sofa anymore. What had I eaten, ffs!?!? I Googled sugar-free sweets and BOOM! There it was: Maltitol. Apparently this is a sugar alcohol (less the ethanol) which causes severe stomach-problems for many. I had no idea of the devastating effects of this stuff. I spent the rest of night on the toilet and grasping my inflated belly.

Success story - post 2 DUI’s

I’m responding to someone who asked for success stories after a DUI a couple of weeks ago - sorry I can’t find the OP, but hopefully they read this. 

I’m also posting here to share for my own sake because, well, there’s not many other places I can share. 

I have 2 DUI’s in my past. The shame, embarrassment, and guilt I feel and have felt for these occurrences is insurmountable. I stopped my pursuit of my dream job after the first one because I thought there was no chance in hell I’d get it after being arrested and convicted for drunk driving. 

Much like many of us think a DUI could never happen to us, I thought there was no way I’d ever get a 2nd. Then, almost 5 years later I found myself sitting in a jail cell under almost the same exact circumstances. I found myself there because I thought it would never happen to me again after making almost no changes to my drinking habits (who would’ve thought).

After that, I had no idea what to do with my life. Who would hire someone with 2 DUI’s? Who would rely on a person like that? After a few years of working a job that paid, but I didn’t love, I decided to say f*ck it and go for my dream job, because it was always still there inside me. I quit drinking and started taking steps. Every time I completed something I needed to do, I still had a pang inside me saying I’d get stopped at some part of the process, but I’d never forgive myself if I didn’t at least try and make it to that point. 

I got a conditional offer for a really great job that would bode very well for my resume and my future, a conditional offer *pending* successful completion of a dreaded background check. I thought, this is my stopping point. This is where I have to change paths again. 

I went through the background process divulging all relevant information, being completely honest about everything - what did I have to lose anyway? And if I’m being honest here, I thought each part of the background I wasn’t going to make it to the next part. 

But I did. 

And now I’m starting a job in a couple of weeks that I never, in a million years thought I’d even be considered for. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you. And no matter what you’ve done in your past, each day is an opportunity to be better than you were before.

The diagnosis came off the back of a tough time last year where I was struggling with working from home and I used Alcohol to self medicate for too many days in a row. I needed some valium in order to counter withdrawals and stop drinking, I was able to do this in a couple of days. I have been on Vyvanse since which has been amazing at keeping me motivated and not looking to drink to counter understimulation and restlessness. I have been able to limit drinking to weekends only and mostly not binge.

Last week I had a (now uncommon) big night out and was awful the next day. The Vyvanse helped with focus, but the anxiety, restlessness and sleeplessness were back. I managed to hold out until a reasonable hour to have a few hair of the dog beers, and drank a bottle of wine before bed. The next day things were far worse and the cravings for Alcohol were back. The last thing I wanted was a drink but I was craving instant relief, and the cravings were enough to sip wine before noon.

I have managed to get back on the straight and narrow, but did need a few drinks for a couple of days. Obviously the best thing to do would be to stop drinking or avoid binges altogether. I do have poor self control in social situations and despite best intentions, I get carried away. I don't have a constant dependence and can go days without drinking. I feel like if I had some valium on hand, I could easily get over the next day withdrawls and 1 big night wouldn't turn into 3-5 days of drinking.

I understand my Psych may be reluctant to prescribe me Valium as they can lead to addiction. I do not have a history of substance abuse outside that small period of boozing last year. I don't believe I am a risk as the anxiety is gone a day or 2 after not drinking. The initial alcohol consumption isn't to self medicate anxiety, but the subsequent consumption is. I found Valium in 5mg doses to be calming without having an over the top effect, again not something I think I would crave.

I also understand there is a risk that removing some of the consequence of drinking may lead to drinking more. I don't drink mid-week by choice and on weekends unless I am at a party etc.. I don't feel the need to drink anymore than 2-3 drinks (at which point I am fine the next day). I don't think this would lead to more drinking.

Do you think there is any chance my Psych would prescribe these for me to have in the cupboard for a rainy day? Not ideal, but they could break the potentially vicious cycle.

Our first in a long long time without the kids. We went out for a nice Italian dinner to relax. Our old spot. Looking over the menu she asked “what are you going to order to drink? I don’t mind if you have a glass of wine with your meal”.
“I’m good with my water” I replied with sincerity. “Not even a limoncello afterwards?” She asked as she knew that was my favorite ending to my favorite meal at our favorite spot. 
“Nope. I’m good. I’m enjoying our night, the food is just as good without wine, and I can’t go breaking my promise on date night”.

Yesterday I drank almost 1.5 liters (!!!) of wine. Before that I managed to last 3 weeks not drinking any alcohol (my maximum is one month). I lost any kind of self-control, accidentally broke kitchen appliances and even yelled at my sister over phone who was simply asking me something. Now she's is very angry at me and telling me (not without merit), that I should visit a psychologist over my anger issues. I didn't finish the assignments and work I was planning. Didn't read books I was planning. The entire day was lost. I honestly feel like I am in Hell.  

A bit of a background on me - late 20s, work and study mostly and recently ended my PhD thesis. Living in a country where drinking alcohol is the norm and not drinking is seen with a suspicious eye. The wine culture here is insane, probably even worse than in France or Spain. Any kind of social gathering must have wine (or some other hard liquor). Otherwise it does not count as gathering.

I didn't really drink until I was in my early twenties, unlike my father who was and is a big boozehound. Then it really stated to hit me, especially in mid-20s. Mostly it was wine, sometimes hard liquor. Beer I can't stand, TBH. The situation was only somewhat ameliorated by me constantly exercising at the gym and having to commute to work. 

But starting from last year, when all gyms shut down due to Coronavirus pandemic and I started to work from home... well you can guess where this is going. I did try to moderate my drinking (only twice per week, I told to myself), alternate with my ""cheat"" days, went dry for weeks, etc. But nothing seemed to work. I drank and drank, alone and  sometimes with others. Most people did not notice it, as I still did the work on time, finished my exams and thesis. But this problem is pervasive, it persists, it is here and I just want to get rid of. Enough is enough. 

It is not so much I am afraid of myself, as I am worried about the psychological toll on people around me. I deeply care for my sister, who tells me more and more than I should visit a psychologist (somewhat of a taboo here and insanely expensive, but I am already considering it), that I may have OCD or BPD. I ignored her long enough and only after all these years do I realize that she is correct.  

Basically, I now understand that only solution is for me to go 100% dry. No ifs and buts about it. I must cut this poison out of my life otherwise I know it is going to ruin me down the road.  And, most importantly, it may hurt, directly or indirectly, members of my family. And that's the worst case scenario I can think of.

The Cecil is getting a lot of coverage right now because of a Netflix documentary on it’s infamous history.

Years ago, I was in really bad shape in Downtown LA. I was working and plugging along but losing ground at work and all areas of my life, really. I went to old favorite dive bar and did what I always did - I bought an IPA I did the math on - the one that would get me the most messed up for the least money. Soon I was several in, stumbling deep.

At some point, I got disoriented and before I knew it, I was in Skid Row, wandering around in the dark. I was oblivious to the danger in my euphoria, I laughed to myself that if I didn’t get home, I’d sleep on the streets - oblivious to the signs all around me that I should be taking it seriously.

I decided I didn’t want to go home, so I would “simply” stay at the Cecil, which I could see down the street and keep drinking. I called to reserve a room but my words were so slurred, they couldn’t understand me and eventually hung up. I started stumbling that way, irritated at the homeless that were “in my way,” with their tents and tarps (obviously, I was too far gone to get how I would’ve looked.)

I was almost there when I got a text from a friend I rode the train with, the gist of was “dumbass, are you ok?” I texted yes but I missed the last train home. He reminded me I could get the Amtrak late night and my car would probably get towed if I left it overnight.

Begrudgingly, irrationally terrified of this relatively minor consequence to all these other things I almost brought into play, I didn’t stay in the Cecil. I made it home eventually.

For those who don’t know, the Cecil Hotel has been the location of countless murders and suicides. At least two serial killers lived there. I look back and I’m a bit in awe. I knew about these things and I was completely unphased by my plan to keep drinking. I really thought I was invincible and could “take anyone” back then.

I quit my job shortly after, left the city and took my first baby steps, “week or two” of recovery here and there. COVID has disrupted my process but today, I’m comfortable with long stretch of not drinking, I’m in a safe place where people care about me and I’m more or less a functioning adult who would not want to do things like crash at the Cecil casually to drink all night.",46,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5717769}"

I’m dealing with a knee injury so I haven’t been able to walk the latter part of this week.  When I do go for a long walk, I have some pretty debilitating pain which doesn’t let up unless I rest.

It’s been alternately good (rest is nice!) and bad (how do I deal with stress when I can’t walk it off?).  I’ve been upping my strength training and flexibility work a little to compensate, but it’s definitely not the same.

I guess I can add my normal, easy ability to walk 4-5 miles a day to the list of things that I should continue to think about and be grateful for.  I would like to remember not to take my mobility for granted.

I hope you all have had a great week - would love to hear what you’ve been up to!

**Edit to say**: y'all inspired me to try something new, thank you!  Day 1 of the 30 day Breathe yoga video series by Adriene completed.  My knee doesn't feel perfect but it also doesn't feel as bad as if I'd walked 5 miles, so let's see if this is possible.  If not, worst thing is I'm right back on bed rest with a bit more flexibility to boot :)

What I liked about doing the video is that it's something totally different than my usual.  I rarely get enough moxy to break out of my ruts, so this feels great!  It's also hitting the strength and flexibility goals I have, albeit in a different way.

I realize I need to decrease my calorie intake to compensate for the lack of cardio.  I feel more hopeful about being able to do that now that I have successfully decided upon a new plan of action for my exercise goals.  I'm going to go think about what I want to do but I feel empowered, not powerless, which is always key for me surrounding my health and exercise goals.

Back to square one. These are always the hardest. I don't drink as much as I use to, believe, I use to drink 1-2 bottles of wine a night.

What made me slip/sip? Stress and an Injury. Work has been so overwhelming, the way I normally combat that is by working out, hiking, and running. I recently had an injury that brought all of that to a halt. I know, I should have relied on something else. God, even baths were out of the question, I had a skin injury that does not allow it, and its on my ankle. So, no boot, no running shoe, no sweating really, and no soaking my full body in a bath. Ugh.

I was doing so well. My god, even my physique was prime.

&#x200B;

My program is severely understaffed, I was managing a whole department by myself (which I've never done before, was consider for a promotion - yet I turned it down because its all too much), I'm a full time student as well. School just started and I'm just losing all the time in the day. Or just feel pressed for time, like its running out. I am wound up from the day and found it hard to relax, so my roommate, who is an incredibly heavy drinker - plus she is going through a break up - it's just all been so hard.

&#x200B;

**I use to be able to say no so easily**, what motivated me was my abs (lol), I was getting stronger and more cut with my routine. I rock climbed every week. I was meditating every day, oh the clarity! I was able to curb the cravings and was overall more **will** oriented and skillful in how I interacted with my day. Then BOOM! Injury. No stress out let, especially needing some release from the stress experienced from work. Bad habits - such as watching a shit ton of TV started at the end of JAN., which led to late nights falling asleep to Netflix, leading to late mornings and no time for time for myself: meditation and reading.

I miss nature, I know that walking in nature is possible by just wrapping my injury up nice and tight and washing it immediately when I get home. However, my energy and fatigue is making it so much harder, from the late nights, and constant screen time due to work and school.  To even do the smallest of things, it sucks the life out of me.

Then earlier this week, my friends invite me out, AND usually I can control myself by ordering a non alcoholic beer or club soda w/lime. I've come a long way with developing a skill to interact w/ my social anxiety and cope. Yet, with being so stressed out, no self care, and trying to get over a break up - my friends throw out statements like: ""You're being too hard on yourself!"", ""You've been doing great, just take a break, you'll be fine"", ""You drink less than all of us combined!"". DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HARD WORK AND WILL THAT TAKES!!!!????

These past three night have involved taking my Adderall prescription, hashing out a shit ton of work, then ""relaxing"" with my roommate. My drinking has only succumbed to 2 glasses of wine or 3 white claws max. But still...I WANT TO BE ZERO ALCOHOL. SOBER. I lived a great life while being sober. I've even gone over 20mg of my prescribed amount of Adderall to counteract the downer effect of alcohol to maintain my busy life schedule and result effectiveness from my prescription. I've upkept my supplements, still struggle to workout, only worked out 2x this week. Arms and Legs. I know my wound is still open, but I work out from home - so, I can wash it right afterwards.

Overall, I fell off the wagon.

This is a slippery slope folks.

I just....wanted to reach out.....because I know this may be part of the path. Life isn't linear, its cyclical.  I wanted to talk to those that understood....that ""just having a glass to unwind"" doesn't work for me. It means something totally different for me.

I've been talking to my therapist about my journey. But...I feel like I let so many down with this binge. I want my balance back.

I'm scared. Truly. I'm seriously scared. I don't want to go back to my old life style. I've been doing so well.

2021-02-13 23:36:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ljhf1j/climbing_out_from_rock_bottom_10_days_sober/,Climbing out from Rock Bottom [10 Days Sober],"I’m posting this from my alt because friends know my reddit account. I’m fucking sick of being a piece of shit, and I’m posting this for myself as much as anyone else. I’m currently 10 days sober and I haven’t felt this physically or mentally healthy in nearly a year. Here’s my story.

I was never much of a partier until I went to college. I always stayed home and played video games in high school, got high a lot but wasn’t much of a drinker. Enter college. Freshman year starts out like anyone else; partying on weekends, occasionally a Tequila Tuesday or Thirsty Thursday, whatever. Basically continues like this for the year. Then second year I join a frat, and you know the saying, fraternities breed alcoholics. Start drinking more in quantity and frequency. Then junior year I go abroad, my schedule was a joke and for months I was going out 5-6 nights a week. It was a blast, but I was drinking basically every night. 

My trip ends, I come back home, and I think all the booze fucked up my brain chemistry. I developed insanely crippling anxiety which I had never had before. I couldn’t socialize, I would shake, stutter, trip over words. I was scared to leave my house, and the only solution I could find my entire senior year to cope with the fear of the world was alcohol. I’ve always hated public speaking, and now that was amplified times 10. I’d rip 3-4 shots anytime I had to speak to the class that day. It was a rare day if I wasn’t drinking. I went from starting at 7-8pm to 4-5pm. I’m not one that can stop drinking once I start, so whether I start at 8am or 8pm, I’m drinking until I go to bed or pass out from being wasted. 

Drinking didn’t affect my grades though. I graduated with two degrees with honors and moved home to save money where I accepted a job from a previous internship I had. It wasn’t what I wanted to do but who gets their dream job at 22 right? 

Anyway, living at home actually did me a lot of good. I had always been super into fitness, so I was hitting the gym 4-5 times a week after work, and drinking cut back significantly, probably because I knew I couldn’t be drinking heavily around family. I’d go out with friends on the weekends but that was about it. 

I met a girl on one of my “bros night out’s”. The classic “when you least expect it” sort of thing. We fell in love almost immediately. We did everything together. Within a month of each other, we both moved out of our parents’ places and relocated to the city where we both got apartments fairly close to each other. 

I think because I now had this freedom again, I started drinking more. Maybe 4-5 beers more than half the nights of the week. I started getting lazy in the relationship. Making her put in more effort than I was willing to put in. I couldn’t drive there cause I was already drinking after work, but obviously I couldn’t tell her that so I’d make excuses why she had to come over. Maybe partially cause of my headspace and drinking, but due to a lot of other factors our relationship deteriorated. Towards the end she made it known she felt like I wasn’t making an effort for her. I always tried, but I was being selfish looking back. Our sex life suffered. Of course it did, I had whiskey dick half the time and my libido was way down from drinking a lot. There are a few nights I look back and think about with regret (from what I remember of them) about how wasted I was and how I ruined nights, treated her wrong, or drove us to petty arguments that quickly escalated. 

Today is the one year anniversary of our breakup, one day before Valentine’s day. You know how much it hurts to get dumped the day before the most romantic day of the year?

Then comes COVID. Now I’m heartbroken, depressed, and locked in my apartment. Not leaving, seeing the sun, or anyone besides my roommate for weeks on end. I drink to numb myself from the pain. Alcohol quickly becomes a coping mechanism for my racing thoughts, which only fuels my depression further, which leads to more drinking. You see where this is going. It’s a never ending negative loop that only gets worse each go-around. 

Now I’m drinking everyday. What else is there to do? Can’t go out. Can’t see friends, date, visit family. I’m working from home so not like I can’t be a little hungover tomorrow, right? My tolerance of getting to a comfortable level of drunk off a 6-pack now feels like an appetizer to the main course. 6 beers a night goes to 8, then 10, 12, fuck it if I have nothing to do today I’ll start at lunchtime and go for 12 hours. Drinking 1-2 light beers an hour, yeah it wasn’t uncommon for me to polish off anywhere from 15-20 beers in a day. 

My job suffered. I was sleeping in, missing meetings cause I passed out and didn’t set an alarm. I grew apathetic. I hated my job, my life, missed my ex, felt alone. Work put me on notice. I stepped up for a few weeks, then went right back to being unresponsive to calls and emails, not hitting my deadlines, etc. Eventually work suspended me towards the end of 2020. I ultimately met with my manager and said I had been dealing with some pretty serious mental health issues and tried to get on FMLA. I procrastinated, then got bounced around between doctors trying to get the paperwork signed off on, and ultimately missed the deadline to file it. My admin called me and said I was either going to be fired or I should resign with dignity essentially, and avoid an internal investigation that could potentially ruin any references I’d have there. I quit and have been unemployed since. 

I was near rock bottom. I’ve never been much of a crier, maybe once or twice a year. I’ve probably cried 50 times in the last year. 

I got drunk and texted my ex, whom I had not spoken with in nearly half a year. She has no interest in talking to me, and after we broke up she quickly went back to her abusive ex – another knife in the chest – she’d rather have him than me. She’s got some emotional issues too, partially from that trauma the first go-around with him, which is another thing that led to our demise, but that’s irrelevant here. 

I sent her a text saying I was severely depressed and I kind of wanted to kill myself. That despite everything she knows me better on an emotional level more than anyone ever has, and I needed someone like her to talk to. She basically told me she’s sorry to hear that, but it’s not her problem and not to contact her anymore. Naturally, despite my requests not to, she called my mom. 

My parents obviously freaked. They had no idea I was in this kind of shape. I’d hidden it well from everyone, even my roommate. My sister came over that week, days before Christmas to try to help me out and make sure I was okay. We had a good time, until the next morning. I was hungover, so naturally I cracked a beer as I hopped in the shower Christmas Eve morning. She heard it. Then she walked by my room, where I had about 6-7 empty cases of beer laying around. She called me out and said she’s taking me home to my parents because I needed help. We drive back to the suburbs, and I wake up from the nap I took in the car. 

Wait. This isn’t home. What the… why the fuck are we at the hospital? My family ambushed me and forced me to see a social worker in the mental health facility at the hospital to talk about depression and my alcoholism. Over the next few days I stayed with my parents and received countless lectures. My parents generally have some beer or wine around the kitchen, and there was none to be found. They hid it all, I knew it was because they were afraid I would start drinking when their back was turned. I was embarrassed, ashamed, and felt like a child. 

I took maybe a week or so off drinking. Typical withdraw symptoms – night sweats, shaking, you name it. Finally, a few days in I started to feel normal. But months of drinking and not working had completely fucked up my sleep. I went from sleeping a solid 7-9 hours a night to fragmented chunks accumulating to maybe 4-5 hours nightly. Often laying in bed unable to fall asleep for hours. 

I went back to the city beginning of January and resumed drinking, but at a more moderate level. Until I met up with an old coworker and got pretty drunk on a Saturday night. Naturally, waking up hungover I started drinking immediately. For the rest of the day. The next day. And the next day. 

I wake up and it’s Saturday again. Holy shit where the fuck did the week go? It was like waking up out of a coma. I lost a week and remembered almost nothing. I look around my room and there’s maybe 4 cases and a couple bottles of wine, all of which I had gotten delivered and drank in the last 6 days. 

I try to hold off drinking, but I can’t. Another week goes by. I wake up out of my slumber once more, look around my room to probably upwards of 100 beer cans just thrown all over the floor. When I finally cleaned up I filled up 3 large recycling bags worth of beer cans. Enough is enough, I’m not doing this anymore. I was blowing off family obligations, friends, hobbies, and other commitments I had made because I couldn’t drive. I made up lies like I got a flat tire, I was snowed in, or I had other bullshit things I needed to do. 

I’m already a skinny guy, and I’ve lost a very noticeable 15 pounds this year from not eating. At least 5 people lately have commented on how skinny I look. More than a couple times in the last few months I’ve gone anywhere from 3-7 days without a single ounce of food. Water and booze was what I lived on. 

Hitting rock bottom like that was the ultimate slap in the face, and I knew I needed to make a change. That was 10 days ago. I stopped cold turkey and haven’t drank since. The first few days were tough, but since then I’ve had a ravenous appetite for the first time since I can remember; eating a shitload and getting back into working out. I started reading again. Applying to jobs. Taking care of chores and obligations I had been putting off. Cooking healthy meals and actually having fun while doing it. My mental health is so much better and I haven’t felt this confident or optimistic in over a year. Feels good man. 

I know while probably not the smartest decision, I will start drinking again at some point, probably by the end of the month. My goal is to find ways to do it in a healthy manner, though. Don’t drink alone, during the week, never to pull myself out of a hangover, whatever it takes to live a normal life. Drinking for me went from something fun that I wanted to do to something that I had to do for survival. I refuse to let myself get back to that place again. I want to have fun socially with friends or enjoy a nice glass of wine when I’m out to eat. For the first time in awhile, I believe in myself, and I know I’m going to make it.",13,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.74213296}"

My mom died 22 years ago today. I have officially lived longer without her, than with her in my life. She drank herself to death. She had diabetes and celiac disease, but continued to drink and suffered organ failure. I always just drank if I was out with friends. Until just over 3 years ago when my brother, who was also my absolute best friend, was killed in a workplace accident. Then his wife of only 4 months tried to sue my family for everything, including an attempt at taking my father's home, and a life insurance policy that my brother had named him beneficiary of. Then, 4 months later, my father died. Throughout this my drinking went up and down. Never really a lot. 2 or 3 a night, maybe 5 nights a week. Some weeks were worse, some better. I even stopped for 2 weeks. Then recently my husband was diagnosed with brain cancer. And I think from that point it felt like it was needed. I honest felt numb all over anyway. I've lost 3 of the most important people in my life, and another just got put on the clock. I don't want to feel anything for anyone anymore. I have 3 kids but I know I'm pushing them away, as well as my husband, because the pain of losing another loved one is too much to bear. So....I drank a bit more. Everyday. I felt like hell, I couldn't sleep, short tempered, foggy. But I want that to stop now. I want to be better. Tonight is hard because tomorrow is Valentine's day and tbh, my husband has been an asshole all day. He made it clear that he didn't have time to get me even a cheap box of gas station chocolates, when he's been running everywhere doing things for his friends. And I've just done so god damn much for everyone for so long, that I would just like a small token of appreciation, of love. It makes it so much easier to have that drink when you feel so worthless. Today was a day that it felt like it just wouldn't matter. But, I didn't. Sorry for the rant, and thank you to whoever made it this far.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.86064595}"

I'm 47 yo (m) and have been a steady drinker for more than two decades.  My longest period of sobriety was 3 months while I was in grad school, as I knew I couldn't drink and concentrate on my schoolwork at the same time.  In the last year I think I made it 6 days without drinking.  

I'm married with a couple of kids and as my wife would say, my drinking isn't harmful to the family but not helpful either.  So I guess you could say I'm high functioning but I look upon the past with many regrets.  Booze has always been my go-to for relaxing, socializing, and venting during stressful times.  With Covid, the drinking has spiked:  I drink two bottles of wine every other night and a six pack to deal with the hangovers on in between days.  I know that might not seem like a lot to some of us here but it's a lot to me.

I'm starting to feel some of the effects physically.  I'm a pretty ok runner when I feel like it and that always helped me stay in ok shape (I can run 5 miles when I get out there)  but I'm starting to feel phantom chest and abdomen pain.  I'm beginning to think I won't make it to 50 and need change.

I've read Alan Carr's book and it has some valid points but still can't get off the Devil's Toboggan.  I have no real plan to quit but wanted to at least write some words down as I know I can't continue like this.

Why do I keep going back to it.,"First ever Reddit post, but I've been reading through this page all day and it seems like a really supportive group. I'm 32 years old and I can't seem to get my act together, it's only gotten worse over the past 5 years. Alcohol is destroying my life and for whatever reason I keep drinking. I'm a fairly quiet more introverted person when I am sober but when I drink I am the life of the party. It was fun for a few years until my late 20s when everyone started to slow down with drinking but I would continue to be the drunk of the group and get black out drunk every social gathering.

A little less than a year ago I ended up arrested and in the hospital as I nearly killed myself. By some miracle my fiance stuck by my side and supported me. After this incident I quit drinking for 2 months but then the weather got nice and I decided why not enjoy a beautiful day with some drinks. The thought of never drinking again has always been terrifying to me. And I always find some way to justify drinking.

I thought I had it under control but over the past 6 months I've been drinking behind my fiance's back and lying about it. I've been caught numerous times and keep promising it won't happen again, I'll do better, I'll be honest. I am so ashamed and have so much guilt about it I can't help but lie and say I haven't been drinking when I really have and of course she knows.

This past year has been very emotional with lots of family trauma and I feel like that is usually why I drink, to not feel these emotions. I'm so sick of messing up and walking around with my tail between my legs. Yesterday I was home alone for the day and of course I took that alone time to drink, as soon as she spoke to me she knew immediately and of course I denied until I couldn't anymore. This is destroying her, not only the drinking but more importantly my lying. I feel like I lie because I don't even want to admit it to myself. How am I continuing on this path after almost killing myself and having to call her to pick me up from the hospital, after all the heartache I've made her go through. I've been lying to myself saying I don't have a problem but clearly I do. I don't plan to drink and know that I shouldn't but then something just takes over and I buy booze and hide it.

I’m at my second highest day count of sobriety and this time has been so much easier. The day after thanksgiving, I started taking Wellbutrin and stopped drinking. The last time I stopped drinking, it was for exactly 90 days, and for the same reason. Then I got complacent and started drinking while taking it, which ended up in countless blackouts after just one or two drinks. Then it made my depression worse - I wanted to die but knew I’d never go through with it. But for some reason I decided to keep drinking and stop taking my meds. 

Fast forward 4 years and a few times saying “I’ll take a week off.” This time I decided my mental health was more important (who knew?), but I work in a restaurant so the temptation was still there. Thanks to covid, our last call for alcohol here in Denver went to 10pm, then 8pm for a while. My place closes at 9 so I’ve never had the chance to go out and take shots with my coworkers or go see my bartender friends, even though it’s back to 10pm. 

At this point, I don’t (currently) have any temptation. Will it change when it warms up? Who knows. Hopefully not. But for now, for some reason, two horrible things resulted in me making a positive change in my life, and I’m okay with that silver lining.

I walked my dog this morning and it was so nice. I was building the snowman and I was thinking about how I never really got to when it snowed before, before I moved, because I was too depressed and I probably was drinking in my bedroom and just staying in that depression nest I built as a sad, anxious teen, upon bottles and trash and remnants of who I might’ve been. Even though I’m only 21, it feels too old to be doing stuff like building a snowman or really enjoying the snow like a kid would. But if i dont now, I might never get to.

Sometimes, after hours of trying to reason with her or say the right things, I still end up lashing out. Between the ages of 18-23, I chalked up my drinking to being young and in a party phase. Then, I settled down and began to have my own family, seriously focus on my career, school, life, etc. I couldn’t ever really seem to shake the grasp of my mother or her never-ending problems though. She wasn’t a horrible mom, and did love me, but she definitely did neglect me in many aspects and then try to control me in others. She did manipulate me a lot. My husband believes she still tries to. Regardless, I would reach out to alcohol after a long day of work and/or lean on alcohol to help me get through the mess I’m currently working through regarding my mother’s impending death. I noticed I was having one glass of wine at night (sometimes 2 or 3) almost every night. I noticed I began drinking liquor heavily on weekends. I would feel like absolute crap the next day and just waste my weekend away being hungover and lying around. I still took care of basic needs for myself and my family, but I wanted to be able to get up, get things done around the house, go to the gym, and get out of the house to spend time with my family. Drinking also made me feel the need to eat unhealthy food, and that just made my body feel even worse. I felt like I was becoming her. I vocalized my fears to my husband, and he told me he wasn’t worried because it wasn’t an every night thing. I didn’t *need* it to function. I came here, did my own research and came to the realization that I craved wine to relax. That’s not healthy. I promised myself I will never drink hard liquor again, but I also wanted to limit how much wine I consumed. I haven’t had any alcohol in a few days, and I’d say I still feel fairly normal and unchanged. However, I wanted to test myself and sort of give myself some sort of power back - because I truly believed I was in the beginning phases of alcohol having power over me. So, I bought a bottle of wine. I’ll open the fridge and see it. I’ll stare at it, and I don’t feel any cravings for it. I have had thoughts about having a glass or two. However, for some odd reason, when I open the fridge and see the bottle there, unopened, I feel so much power that I can sneer at it, walk away, and pretend like it’s someone I absolutely detest. That power seems to give me more gratification than actually drinking it. Call me crazy...because yes, me having some deranged form of a staring contest with an inanimate object is indeed a little nuts. But I’m looking at it as symbolically. As in saying, “you’ve been responsible for so many addictions, deaths, etc. and you won’t have a hold on me. Ever.” 

I choose when I drink. Setting boundaries is healthy - with my mom, alcohol and myself. Drinking to get drunk is not healthy. Using alcohol as a crutch when I’m going through hell is not healthy. Rather, feeling everything and processing it with help is how I choose to heal.

In these thirty days of sobriety, I've also done the following things daily, instead of my night job of the last many years of emptying cans and bottles into my gullet and letting them and trash pile up on any surface in my house with gravity:

+ Brushed and flossed 2X
+ Provided more direct attention and better care to my pets
+ Exercised for at least 30mins
+ Walked over 5k steps
+ Crushed at least 50 cans
+ Took vitamins
+ Properly hydrated
+ Made (nearly) every meal myself instead of fast-food (cheated last night with a celebratory cheeseburger)
+ Washed the dishes used
+ Cleaned or did house work for an hour+
+ Spent at least hour on a hobby or positive leisure activity
+ Wrote a daily recap in a journal
+ Spent time organizing, planning and adjusting this new life schedule
+ Talked to more people instead of trying to hide from everyone
+ Completely filled the trash and recycling cans and taken them to the curb on pickup days
+ Stepping on the scale and taking weekly progress pictures
+ Tried to be more positive and kind with inner dialogue to myself
+ Kept track of all these things with a checklist
+ And finally, tried to feel proud of even the smallest goal or step forward. [Greatly inspired by this comic](https://twitter.com/stormygailart/status/1298105110153900033?s=09) by /u/stormygailart

I AM FREE! I can just leave the house whenever I want. I can jump in the car and head to the city to pick something up I need or just for the hell of it. I can go outside for a walk without extreme anxiety. It's difficult to remember that I can do that now, after nearly a decade of basically being trapped after work. I can go help my family if they need something immediately. Don't have to ask them to tell me a day ahead so I could be sober to go help. I don't have to plan out my days around when the liquor store closed.

It's really paying off in many ways. Feeling happy and driven, which is weird. All the money that would have been spent on booze has gone to home/self improvement/doctor bills. All the time that was spent being drunk, hungover, or in paralyzed anxiety is now spent working on myself and this hoarding depression nest I've built and on reconnecting to my hobbies and family. I'm losing weight and my constantly red cheeks are starting to look better. Feeling less ashamed of my disappearing beer belly and moobies. Had to buy a belt and already have to start punching holes in it. Definitely not buying clothes until I meet my weight goal.

Eventually (and this day will come!) I will break past even and go into the green for those items in the above as I practice and adjust for efficiency and balance without burning myself out. It's going to take awhile but I'll have more time and money than I'll be used to... and it won't be spent going backwards! The life long dreams I gave up on a few years ago now have possibility.

I haven't drank in about 24 days and I also gave up caffeine. I've been feeling great, sleeping much better, more calm, better physical and mental health. 

But one thing I'm struggling with is that I used to use nicotine very occasionally (like maybe once a week but often many weeks with none), usually in combination when drinking. I use nicotine snus- anyone from the Nordic countries will be familiar. Now I notice this slow creep where I've been using it more and more as it gives me a little kick that I miss, especially in circumstances where I'm socialising and would normally drink.

I really don't want to replace one bad habit with another unhealthy one, I keep trying to quit using snus but haven't managed so far. I excuse myself that I've been doing so well not drinking and that a few snus is ok but it's becoming more and more. I don't want to be addicted to anything.

I have been a fly on the wall in this group for about a year.  I have been alcohol free since last Friday. So 8 days.  I have had to start over a few times but this time feels different. I feel much more prepared and ready.  

My drinking career started with beer, escalated to vodka which eventually put me in the hospital with pancreatitis.  I sobered up, got pregnant, and  had my sweet little boy.
this didn't stop my drinking but merely slowed it down for a bit.  I went back to drinking beer despite warnings from doctors. I was in no way prepared for the stresses of motherhood.  Slowly the beer changed to whiskey., My new vodka without being vodka. I actually tried to justify it to myself.  That became a huge problem for my SO so I started drinking those truly beers and hiding the whiskey from him.  He knew.  I know he did.  Got pregnant again and had my little girl.  Went right back to whiskey.  It was ruining me, my relationship with my spouse, and my children. 

It has taken me a year and a lot of failures.  I tried to moderate, only drink beer, etc.  I did stop the hard liquor but those fun travel wines were the perfect strength and size.  I would buy 3 at a time. I'm so tired of the benders.  I never chose to have a bender, it always just seemed to happen at the most inconvenient times possible.  I realized it was clearly bigger than me and   I had to drop it all.  If it wasn't for this group, I would have felt so alone in my endeavors.  

I feel great as if I am coming out of a fog of sorts.  I have actually managed to pin point my triggers and learn a more healthy way to deal with them.  My life seemed so hard before, and now I realize I'm actually pretty good at taking care of my kids and running a household. And without the alcohol constantly needing my attention, I'm actually a pretty good lover and I enjoy sex again.

Let it grow https://imgur.com/gallery/g56zT9x

The above link is a picture of me and my houseplants.  I have been a gardener/houseplant enthusiast for 3 years now, and spring can not get here fast enough. Now that I'm sober and have more energy the possibilities seem endless.  I thought I deserved a picture to show all my hard work and love I put into these plants.   It's my anti drug in so many ways and has helped me significantly with my recovery. Whenever I care for them a sense of calm comes over me.
Thought I would share with you guys today.   What healthy habits have you obtained during sobriety?

This is the longest I’ve been able to abstain from alcohol in years. My last relapse was due to me feeling rejected and abandoned by a friend (a different person than the one that featured in this post).

I’ve always had a crippling need for validation and love. It deeply, deeply hurts me when I feel abandoned or rejected in anyway. I was adopted so I’m sure a lot of this goes back to early childhood trauma. 

Anyway, I digress. I had this friend I used to talk to almost every day. I considered he/she one of my dearest and closest friends. They are in recovery and tbh, looking back, most of our conversations were centered on them and how they are doing and what’s going on with them. The conversation would generally be over by the time it would get around to how I was doing. 

After a while they completely quit reaching out to me at all, and I realized I was always the one initiating. I quit, and what do you know, we quit talking at all. I’d still reach out occasionally but the conversation wouldn’t go anywhere. I was hurt and confused but didn’t want to be dramatic or needy so I just let it be. 

Well I reached out yesterday because I thought I would share my sobriety count and see if the conversation went anywhere. No, it turned into “That’s cool, can I call you about a relationship situation?” So, that made it clear that my friend got into some kind of relationship and left me in the dust. 

I tried talking to them about it later but it was just, “oh I don’t feel like talking about it anymore.” There was no thanks for asking, no how are you, what’s new with you, nothing. I just said “well sorry we couldn’t talk about it earlier. Actually we don’t talk at all anymore. I’ve thought for months I must have pissed you off because we used to talk practically every day.”

All I got was “I(‘ve) been busy with the next chapter looking at new places to live and started a new job.” Well, congrats good for you I wish you every happiness. And that was it. No, I’m sorry I made you feel that way, nothing at all. Zip. Nada. Zilch. It’s just “me me me me me” with that person and they don’t care about me at all. It’s like trying to have a relationship with a brick wall.

I would never treat someone that way. I deserve way better than that, I’m a really good friend, I am always there for everyone. I’m the one you can ALWAYS count on when the chips are down. So why the hell was I up crying last night feeling like there is something deeply wrong and unlovable about me? Because it still hurts me so, so deeply. I know it’s not true but it still breaks my heart. 

I wanted to drink SO bad yesterday. I was literally shaking, I wanted that release so much. Alcohol has often filled that black hole of a void inside me when I feel lonely and abandoned. But I realized it wouldn’t hurt that person if *I* drank, it would only further hurt me and sow chaos in my life. Alcohol is like a magnifying glass for whatever you are thinking and feeling and I didn’t need to magnify *that*. 

So even though I stayed up until about 2-3am unable to sleep, crying, feeling very worthless, I didn’t drink away my feelings. I let myself FEEL the feels, I figuratively walked through that dark place, and I came out the other side. I feel stronger and more resolved in my sobriety today, and I feel more at peace with that situation with that (non)friend. The well is dry. I’m not going to go back there and expect water anymore.

This is all very big for me. I am worth sobriety and anyone that makes me want to drink doesn’t deserve a place in my life. Thank you for reading, and IWNDWYT.",15,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5756164}"

I felt so worthless. Nothing I said landed with her (you know what it’s like to have a conversation with some who’s drunk I’m sure) and soon she had a complete break down and was sobbing about various things.

  My parents said they would take care of putting everything away and thanked me for getting them them what they needed and we said some quick goodbyes so I could head to the train station to get back to my place before 8pm curfew.

I got a 6 pack of king cans on the way to the apartment and I started drinking them as soon as I got my things of and put away.  I think I lucked out big time though, I finished the beer after the stores were closed and I know I would have restocked if the curfew wasn't in effect.

Been a lurker for a while and have been so encouraged to read many of your posts.  I've got one day sober.  Yesterday, I drank most of the morning with the kids home.  Sitter came to take over around lunch time... I got in my car, didn't go anywhere, wondering what on earth I was thinking.  The sitter came running out asking if I was ok... when it was clear I wasn't, she asked me to get out, called my wife, and called 911.  Paramedics came, checked me out, and left.  My oldest was beside himself, which cut me to the core.  Sitter took the kids for the afternoon, and my wife spent the afternoon contacting several people to let them know and get advice.

2021-02-13 10:00:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lj20w7/its_not_a_good_life/,“It’s not a good life.”,"My husband said this to me as he was leaving to get groceries last night. He was talking about not drinking. 

He said he has nothing to look forward to at the end of the day anymore. 

He has not worked since May, and has had no bites on his resume. 

My husband is not neurotypical and is medicated. He’s always done well on his meds—except when he’s stopped drinking. It’s like the alcohol successfully addresses something no med ever has. And (thanks to an especially harmful doctor many years ago) he has been on everything under the sun. I’ve been with him for 10 years and I can honestly say his mental health is better when he is drinking moderately. (Please resist the urge to downvote me here, this is not ideal but it is unfortunately accurate)

This is not a story I’m telling myself to excuse my own drinking—I do not want to start again. 

“You seem really happy, which is why I haven’t started again.” As he was walking out the door
 
This tore my heart into pieces. I have no doubt he will not start again unless I do. Like I said, I really don’t want to. When my daily cravings start up I ride them out. It’s not easy, but it gets less difficult every day. 

But in this relationship, I have (willingly and voluntarily) sacrificed things to keep my husband safe and healthy. I am not saying this is healthy for me. But if there is something I can do to help him stay healthy that’s not a big deal for me, I’ve always done it. 

In keeping with this, before he was even out of our building, I’d decided to drink a beer while he was at the store, and then text him to tell him I was drinking and now he could too. If I tried to drink while he was home, he would stop me. This way he couldn’t stop me. 

I didn’t drink. The idea of having a beer and starting this whole bullshit ball rolling again made me feel physically ill, and made me profoundly sad and angry. I sat at the table, browsed reddit, and cried. I cried because I don’t know how to help him. Because I let myself feel even worse when he said “you seem happy”—like I am preventing him from feeling happy by not drinking. Because I’m never going to be able to “pair wine” with dinner again because I can’t consume alcohol responsibly. 

I cried most of all because I feel guilty that I feel good, and because it made me angry that he can’t be happy for me that I’m doing well—telling me “it’s not a good life” while I feel well for the first time in probably 15-20 years was a fucking gut punch. I heard “being married to you, who is doing so well without alcohol, is not a good life.” And then immediately cried more because WHAT a selfish thought that is on my part. 

Has anyone been in this situation? Has anyone quit successfully while their partner is still active/doesn’t want to quit but has/will pick up again? I honestly feel like our (otherwise very strong) marriage may not survive this. I feel pressure to drink so that he can drink. He is not actively pressuring me, I believe I am pressuring myself. 

Jesus, if my body could do the kind of gymnastics my mind is doing I’d be in Cirque de Soleil.  

I know I need therapy (I WANT it). I can’t afford it, my insurance does not cover it. We live in an 800 sq ft apt, so zoom AA/any other recovery meetings are not an option; there is no privacy. And COVID is once again raging here (NYC) so I’m not comfortable being anywhere but my house.

It's been one week since I had a drink. I'm trying to cultivate some curiosity when I have a craving or feel pressure to drink, rather than just caving into it. For example, last night, Friday night, a night I would normally throw back a few, I felt the urge. Instead of seeking out booze, I studied that --- why do I feel this way? I knew it was because I wanted to relax after a long week, so I found other ways. I watched a good show, drank some tea and ate some chocolate, and the cravings passed. And how wonderful it is to wake up early, ready to do things that are going to make me feel even better -- cooking a healthy breakfast, getting a workout, instead of laying in bed feeling sick and anxious and then getting some kind of greasy food to soak up the hangover.

Tonight might be a challenge. My sister and brother-in-law moved to my town due to the pandemic and became our 'pod' and for some reason, it's been heavy drinking with them since they arrived. Again, leaning into the curiosity about this. I think it still feels novel that they are here, like they are visiting, so we should party. I also think that my sister and I are both super introverted, so alcohol is a social and relationship lubricant. We're going to their house for dinner and games tonight and I'm already planning how to abstain.

I’ve struggled a lot this past year with boredom. The only thing I’ve had to look forward to is 6pm on a Friday, where I can get wasted for two days straight. I used to be an avid hiker and gym goer, and let 3 lockdowns get me lazy and fat. I’m sick of feeling like shit everyday, and thinking “hey it’s Wednesday, been a hard week working from home so I deserve a bottle of wine”.

It’s my birthday in a few weeks time, and not being able to go out and celebrate is a bummer. So I figure why not stop drinking until I can go to a fancy restaurant again.

Most people who know me would claim otherwise. I don't make dramatic scenes, blackout, or get sick. I am a productive member of society, I keep up with my active son, and generally have my shit together. 


But I had a habit of red wine every night, two heavy poured glasses, often followed by a final ""splash"" before bed. I was consistent with it for years. I finished kid bedtime and as I poured my wine from that silly boxed-wine spigot, relief poured over me. 


I deserve this, I would think. I deserved it for being a kick-ass mom. I earned it for role modeling positivity to my son through a Pandemic. It was a reward for enduring brutal allergy shots with my 7 year old. It was a consolation prize for all the fun times we were missing during quarantine. It was how I relaxed at the end of a long day.   


It is symbolic, I loved to rationalize. This wine marks the end of being ""mom"" and starting the evening as this autonomous grown-ass woman.


I think once you start imbuing alcohol with these transcendent qualities, you're shifting from a healthy relationship to an unhealthy one.  


When you start perceiving alcohol as a positive tool in your self care, not having it feels like deprivation. I was physically fine if I didn't drink, but I did feel left out and grumpy. I felt less happy and mentally noted when I could remedy the problem of not drinking.


That was the red flag for me. Thankfully I didn't need to hit a rock bottom, I just needed a to start Dry January only to realize ""Hey, Dry January sucks, this is HARD."" And to start reflecting what that meant for me and how I felt about it. 


If the idea of not drinking negatively impacted my life, what does that mean about the role alcohol is playing in it?


I went fast and hard down the Quit Lit path and much to my delight there were resources out there that resonated with me perfectly. It wasn't about being powerless and depending on a power greater than myself (not a dis to AA - it just didn't fit my personal relationship with alcohol). I discovered books and podcasts that approached alcohol with brain science! Do you really know what is happening biologically when you consume alcohol? They were about cognitive dissonance! If I WANT to drink less, why then is it so hard? They were about culture, society, and marketing! What message is the world bombarding you about the role of alcohol and what subconscious effect does that have on us? 


It was a fascinating journey into the science of habits, addiction, and mindfulness. 


And this is where it loops into parenting. Because while not drinking has certainly saved me money, calories, and made me a grossly cheery morning person, it has also made me a fundamentally more mindful person. And mindfulness when parenting is a serious net gain.


The other day my kid was losing his mind at the hospital during his allergy shot appointment. It was a scene, to say the least. It dawned on me that I would have once thought to myself ""Man, that glass of wine tonight will be MUCH deserved!"" and then try to tolerate the experience and eagerly await 8PM. 


Seems relatively harmless, I know, but then I look at how I approach the situation now. 

Instead of basking in my misery and awaiting my ""reward,"" I spent that 30 minute wait after his shots reflecting.


I felt frustrated this is still so difficult for my kid.


I felt embarrassed because no one enjoys making a public spectacle.


I felt sad because my kid was so upset.


I felt guilty for, well, a whole host of reasons parents feel guilty.


I felt worn down.


And I felt those feelings, which sounds absurdly simple, but how often do we just feel stressed or overwhelmed without actually breaking that shit down? The magic happens when you give those feelings the attention they deserve and you start getting good at realizing which thoughts are productive and which thoughts are best to let go. You can validate and normalize certain feelings, which does wonders for not getting absorbed in them and giving yourself permission to move on. Being mindful in that moment meant that by the time we left the hospital, I put in some work on those feelings and felt ready to move along with my day. I wasn't counting down until evening wine, I didn't feel emotionally dependent on a magic elixir to bring me comfort. We had a shitty time at the hospital and it was done now. 


I realize now it wasn't the wine that brought me comfort, it was the idea and the ritual of the wine.


The best part of drinking was getting my glass, filling it up, and taking that dramatic big sigh on the couch as I enjoyed my first sip. 


That's not really about the wine then, is it? I didn't feel relieved or content in that moment because of the alcohol, it literally hadn't even reached my stomach yet. It's that I had conditioned myself for years to think I needed it to relax and destress. Our thoughts are very powerful in creating our reality. If you associate drinking with the way you best unwind, shocker shocker, you reach the point you feel like you can't unwind without it.


I feel the happiest I've ever felt in my adulthood, and I attribute much of that to spending more time reflecting on feelings and finding habits that truly benefit my physical and emotional health. 


So I now do things I would have once scoffed at, like go to bed early. For a long time I felt like staying up late was vital because it was my precious ""me time."" I now realize that browsing Reddit on the couch is far less bucket filling than finally tackling this 8 years of sleep debt (thanks, kid).


I sip tea and work on puzzles. Yes, it may not be the hip cool way to spend my night (according to every commercial marketing firm out there) but that's something that actually relaxes me after a stressful day of Pandemic parenting. I am not buzzed or numbed in my senses, I'm meditative and calm. At peace.


I've stopped equating consumption with happiness. Food and drinks can taste good, and it is perfectly wonderful and acceptable to enjoy them! But they are not gateways to happiness. Feelings do not have to hinge on them. They don't fix things. And the more you associate these concepts with them, the unhealthier the relationship you foster with them.  


And best of all, I am a much more present parent. Being mindful about this one thing has made flexing that muscle come more naturally. When I'm stressed or anxious, I spend less time wallowing in those feelings and wishing the time to pass so it can be over. 


The other day featured a rough parenting afternoon and I found myself counting down until my kid's bedtime. I realized I didn't want to spend my time simply waiting for the next thing to happen and I reflected on what was really going on. I had reached my emotional capacity of dramatic play with a seven year old, I was hungry, I was yearning for some adult interaction. 

So I kindly expressed I had reached my limit of pretending to be a baby bird to my son. I dug out some science magazines he hadn't seen yet to occupy him. I cut apples and cheese slices. I reached out to my friend group via text and vented and was then beautifully enriched by their amazing insight and hilarity. I wasn't waiting for his bedtime anymore and when I was finally ""off the hook"" of parenting, I no longer needed something to make it better. It was a far cry from ""Grrrr... is it wine o'clock yet?""


Wine wasn't the answer to the things I was looking for. I've learned that feeling good about being a kickass mom is the reward. What I earn for role modeling positivity during the Pandemic is a better mindset for me and my family. The reward for surviving allergy shots is that my kid won't go into flippin' anaphylactic shock the next time he's stung by a wasp! I can grieve the lost fun times during a Pandemic because it is disappointing and sad, and a consolation prize doesn't somehow negate those very real feelings. I unwind by being cozy on the couch with my husband, writing rambling emails to friends I miss, and getting a really good night's sleep.


So I am no longer a card-carrying member of the Mom Wine Club. It didn't make me a better mom in the ways I once thought it did. I'm learning to put in the work in the moment instead. And I am much happier and healthier for it. ",2067,"{'pandemic': 4, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.40438205}"

Since lockdown started, the amount my wife and I have been drinking has steadily increased to anti-heroic levels. Never to the point that it interferes with our lives, but frankly we struggled to find anything else to punctuate the end of the day in the ground-hog-day-hell that is being in lockdown. 

I’ve always had migraines, and hangovers worst than most, the former often being part of the latter. So I’ve often treated these with migraine meds. Which essentially has become an enabler for me being able to drink more and more without such inevitably extreme circumstances. 

Yesterday morning I woke up about 5:30am with a splitting headache, which gradually began to grow in intensity over the next 5-10 minutes. I didn’t have any migraine meds and I didn’t want to wake my wife prematurely for the cocodamol she has for her back. After writhing in pain for a few minutes longer, the pain reached fever pitch. This was without doubt the worst pain I had ever felt. I woke my wife, through gritted teeth asked for the codeine.

It was horrible. She was terrified. I was bucking and moaning as the pain throbbed. It felt like someone was driving a stake through my temples. 

After a bit of this (thankfully) my wife decided this was clearly not normal and called an ambulance. After being assessed, with BP sky-high, and having puked pretty much the moment they sat me down; they decided it was better to get me to the hospital for treatment/testing. 

So, at the crack of dawn, I shuffle out to the ambulance leaving my wife and 20 month old daughter; genuinely wondering what was going to happen next. Was this just a bad migraine? The C-word? Had I had a haemorrhage?

So after being checked in, assessed, poked and prodded (thankfully the pain as a result of the enough-codeine-to-kill-a-horse had dialled back to a 5/10) we decided first to try a shot of migraine meds to see if they sorted things out. 

Shot in the arm, shuffled off to be monitored, and after a while things started to return to normal. 

But here’s the thing - I **never** want to put my family or myself through that sort of ordeal again. Even if it’s a one in a hundred occurrence. I’m done. I’m not rolling the dice any more for a boozy evening. 

I don’t believe I’m going to go tee-total - I certainly am for a short while to hit the reset button - but from here on in it’s a couple of drinks and done. No more. I’d rather be here for my family, not terrified, healthier and no doubt happier too. 

TLDR; Had a boozy evening, woke up with a headache that made me want to pass out. Lovely trip in an ambulance thinking I might have a tumour or something. I don’t - it was just a severe migraine; but I’m not rolling those dice again.

I nearly named this post ""34th Street"", but it just sounded too corny, and I'm not sure if I *actually* believe in miracles.

I haven't had a drink in over 2 years, and today I came closer to spoiling that streak than I ever have during this stretch, possibly the narrowest escape in my entire life as an alcoholic. 

The waves of temptation rolled in on superbowl sunday (a familiar relapse event in the past). I managed to side-step, juke, and stiff-arm the barrage of voices that day, but they kept creeping throughout the week. 

My relapses have usually come in the winter. This season has been an especially dark one. Like a lot of folks these days, I've been isolating to a remarkable degree. I have been ""in-between"" jobs since September. I have probably done more philosophizing, ruminating, and reflecting lately than I ever have, and it hasn't exactly left me with much conclusive wisdom. Lots of angst, doubt, restlessness. Doom and gloom, existential dread, psychic shit. The works.

Anyway, what I've more or less accepted lately is that while my life sober feels much more meaningful, it is also incredibly painful. I'm sure it's different for everyone, but this seems to be my experience. Now to be fair, I have not been sober during the entire past two years. I did smoke some pot last summer. I never considered taking a drink, however. At some point I just convinced myself that ""I'm a person who doesn't drink"", and that was enough (it took me 15 years to get here).

I quit the pot back in the fall. This is admittedly when the sad bastard vibes took hold. My doc convinced me to try a low dose of gabapentin, as I'd also become chronically sleep deprived. Tbh, I actually felt a significant mood lift at first, and was even inspired to resume writing a few different projects which I'd abandoned. I also got back into street photography, an old flame. Eventually I had to taper off the medication though, as some nasty side effects emerged. 

January came along, and boiled shit was on the menu. Several job leads fell through, my car died, ants invaded my apartment. Then last week, just as I was rediscovering my love of photography, and trekking all over the city for hours at a time, I was attacked by a deranged person downtown. They saw my camera simply pointed in their direction and accused me of being a cop, then tried jumping me with their friend. I refused to cough up my camera, slipped on the wet pavement while trying to get away, and suffered a severe ankle injury. They rushed in to kick me but a few bystanders pulled them away. I'm in a brace and on crutches now.

I can't tell you how thrilling it was to be out there taking photos that whole week before the mishap. Street photography is grueling, and I was just getting back into the groove of it. I accept that there's an element of danger that comes with the adventure, but I am also just really angry at this person and finding it hard to conjure any empathy for them. I was also finally offered a job that very morning! My start date was supposed to be the 19th, but I won't be walking normally for a while. So it goes.

I've been increasingly depressed in the fall out of all this, back to sitting around in my apartment, stuck. Sitting, and thinking, and sitting...I don't think most people are cut out for a solitary life. Your mind winds up in the past too often, and the past is a real dickhead. We all know this. It takes a certain sort of grace to not look back, lately I've felt like the past has got my number.

Today I finally said fuck it, lets get drunk. Lets get a large bottle and drink myself into oblivion. I'm stuck here for a couple of weeks anyway. I opened up instacart, scrolled through their liquor selections. A fifth of bourbon and a fifth of vodka, ""*that should tide me over for now""*, said Boozy McBooze Brain. I actually felt a pang of regret after checkout for not selecting the liter-sized bottles. See, this isn't my first rodeo. I have tried, and failed, to ""drink responsibly"", countless times. So many times. I can't even pull that trick on myself anymore. If I relapse, I KNOW it's pedal to the metal. I plan to be wasted, blacked out, and sick. I make sure to purchase some Tums as well, and coconut water to help rehydrate. Aleve. I know that this is going to be chaotic, I'm prepared to feed the monkey, the hungry shadow, and the holy ghost. It'll be a depraved and volatile reunion of sorts. I'm excited...excitement isn't always a good thing, but it's *something*. I start making trays of ice, dust off an old shot glass...

At this point I'm watching the instacart order, as it updates what the shopper is doing. He's found the bok choy and the ginger, and now the orange juice, cranberry juice, club soda. Jesus almighty, you hack, get the booze already! He's found the turkey, good, i'll want a sandwich tomorrow when i'm hungover...there's only three items left...this is a bad idea...two items left, sweet mother of a mandolin maker, hurry up man! Just the bourbon and the vodka left...WTF am I doing? All of my failures flash before me, all the jobs I lost, the friends who abandoned me, the girls who left me, that time I was in a fire, pissing myself, shitting myself, coughing up blood at 4 in the morning, cold sweats, lies, stinging shame and humiliation, concussions, DUI's, black eyes, abandoned dreams devolved to base pleasures and mediocre interests. I remind myself that there's NEVER been one single instance when relapsing, where I was able to just ""hop back on the wagon"" after. That NEVER FUCKING WORKS. This will be a long ride through hell and the brakes will be cut. I know this and yet still sit on the fence for another few minutes. I'm sweating at this point. Finally, I send the guy a message asking him to cancel the liquor items. ""Sure, no problem!""...sure, no problem. You have no idea, Landing (yes, his name was *Landing*). 

I have never been able to abort mission once the booze brain switches over to auto-pilot. Like many of you, I've practically sleep walked my way to the liquor store before during relapses. I don't know how I evaded disaster here. I honestly didn't feel like it was me cancelling that order. It's pretty confounding even to myself and I don't quite know how to explain it. 

I don't recommend that anyone lets things get nearly to the point that I did today. I should've called a friend, or attended a zoom meeting, or tried to meditate, or whatever. But it shows that you truly do NOT HAVE TO USE. They say that a relapse starts when you begin giving in to the obsessions and cravings. I think this ideology is a bit double-edged...the lizard brain almost used it against me, ""well I'm obsessing about using so I guess my goose is cooked"". You can be visited by these thoughts, pernicious as they are, and still rise above them.

No. Alcohol misrepresents the best qualities of that person.,"I've struggled with alcohol for over 10 years, having gone through a few periods of sobrierety and relapse. One of the issues for me was that my cousin, who was my closest friend, was also my best drinking partner. We'd often go on weekend benders together, and had done since we were 15 or 16. It was hard to give that up.

But close to 5 years ago I lost him to suicide. For a while, I kept the last two empty beer bottles that we had shared together, just days before his death. I have often found myself drinking alone, re-imagining the days I would have a few beers with my him on a weekend. It feels like drinking is a means through which I try to reconnect with him. The problem is, it does not.

What I realise I miss is his company. Not the alcohol. Those weekends we spent together were wonderful because we were in each other's company. We'd spent most of our lives as children as best friends, and shared wonderful moments and memories without alcohol being involved at all. We loved playing football and tennis, and would play for hours. There were so many wonderful moments that did not involve alcohol. 

I've been resorting to alcohol over the past 5 years as if somehow it would allow me to hold on to his memory. As if the feeling of inebriation will provide me with a sense of being with him again. But I realise now how delusional this has been. I want to remember him for all of who he was, for which over 90% of the time did not involve alcohol.

I've thrown away those last beer bottles we shared together. In its place, I have a picture of me and him participating in an athletics event. The most honoured thing I could do in his memory is to promote all the amazing memories, inspiration and qualities he has left me. Sports, education, love, laughs and company. All these qualities were there before we began drinking. And I need to make sure they're the ones I promote now that our drinking days are over. Now that my drinking days are over.

I’ve been able to switch out my alcoholic drinks with tea - which wasn’t very easy at first, but now a hot cup of tea is what I finally look forward too. Hangover/guilt/anxiety free. I needed to keep myself in a routine in order to keep to my sobriety, and I’m happy to say it’s worked extremely well for me.

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Oh. My. Goodness!  I just hosted my first DCI!  To say this has been an honor and a privilege is an understatement!  You folks have completely changed my life.  The amount of support, understanding, patience, comradery, friendship, and just flat out love that is within this group is awe-inspiring!  I knew from my Day One that this place was special.  So many people welcomed me with open arms.  I remember feeling a sense of security because, for the first time in my life, I knew I was not alone in dealing with my alcohol addiction.  Since my Day One, I have made friends here who mean so much to me.  

This has been an awesome week of fun, celebration (I am NOT congratulating you again, u/ReplacementsStink. Enough, already!! Hahaha!) and most importantly, reflection.  You folks answered the prompts with honesty, compassion, and truthfulness.  I thank you for everything you shared with me, and with everyone else. 

I’d like to thank u/SaintHomer and all the mods for helping to make this sub run like a well-oiled machine.  I have NO idea how you do it, but you make this a safe place for us to roam.

So I leave you with one more song.  I specifically remember where I was when I heard this song for the first time because it immediately grabbed me and would not let go.  It was over 10 years ago and I knew I was struggling with alcohol but I was still the “party girl” and there was no way I was quitting the booze at that point.  But, the words in this song immediately hit me like a ton of bricks.  The song isn’t about alcohol addiction, but I think it could be.  If you listen to the words, you may feel the same.  The best part?  It’s called “[I and Love and You](https://youtu.be/qqBJbdPDigc)”.  It’s by The Avett Brothers.  For the past week, I’ve been ending my posts with *“Know that IWNDWYT.  Love to you all!”* so I kinda think it’s fitting to end with this song.

For my final post, I ask you, my fine friends, besides support (because I think everyone would say that as their answer) what is ONE thing you get out of coming here every day??  

Know that IWNDWYT.  Love to you all!  See you on the other side tomorrow!!  And **THANK YOU!!!!!**

I've Been Writing Emails to Myself,"I've done a lot of things over the years to deal with this alcohol business. Therapy, AA, quit lit, podcasts. Currently I'm loosely doing Tempest, founded by Holly Whitaker. For the most part, I really loved her book Quit Like a Woman, and I appreciate her approach, broadly speaking. There are things about it that irk the shit out of me (the obsession with hot fucking lemon water being one of them), but one of the things I do like is her focus on setting intentions and communicating with your future self via letter.

However, the idea of writing letters to my future self scares the hell out of me. I was having a weepy bath the other day (so many emotions in sobriety) and I realized why -- it's because I don't trust myself to do right by my future self. I can't stand the idea of sending a triumphant affirmation of a letter to Me 30 Days From Now because what if I fuck up between now and then?

I realized what I needed was a shorter timeline. So, using Gmail's ""schedule send"" feature, I wrote myself an email that I would receive in 24 hours. It was a triumphant affirmation, and I felt confident doing it because I was pretty sure I could make it 24 hours without fucking up. And you know what? I did.

I started sending myself more emails throughout the day, little pep talks that show up during my most difficult times. First thing in the morning when I struggle to drag myself out of bed, toward the end of the work day when a glass of wine or a beer sounds almost impossible to resist. Just little words of encouragement, reminders to myself to play the tape forward, quotes from journal entries where I've spelled out why I'm over drinking. Reminders to myself that I want off the ride, and that the way to stay off the ride is to STAY OFF THE FUCKING RIDE.

So far, so good. I really enjoy the exercise because it gives me an opportunity to both reflect and to look forward -- to think about where I want to be 24 hours from now and how I can help myself get there. What I need to hear from myself in order to get there. It's a real manifestation of caring for myself on a timeline I can handle. It's the ""one day at a time"" of talking to future me.

I went home, under medical supervision. Detoxed. The next week I went for a walk with my business partner/best friend. He's 77. He had covid in December pretty bad, he's trying to recover.

Suddenly on our walk he got sick. Really sick. I ran for my life to get the car. All his vitals seemed fine - BP, o2, pulse. But he wasn't fucking fine.

I finally convinced him to go to the hospital, he kept telling me he wanted to take a nap. He crashed on the table, 100% blockage of his main artery. If I hadn't been there... I can't even go there in my head.

I've been in recovery since the beginning of September. I went to an inpatient rehab center for 45 days, opted out of half way services and continued my recovery in IOP groups. Shortly after reaching 4 months I relapsed. Oopsie! Back on track. The slip back into my old thinking pattern was quicker this time. (Who needs AA?? Why shouldn't I be able to have a drink at the end of the day if I so choose? If I'm stressed I should be able to have some wine!) Last Friday night I relapse again, with 4 white claws and 3 glasses of wine (see! I can control myself!!) 

And I woke up on Saturday morning. Starting drinking around 10:30. Long story short, I ended up blacked out at the bar, hurting myself and woke up in my rehab's detox on Sunday morning.

I'm now living in their sober-living home and utilizing the half way services offered by them. I'm extremely thankful the staff and counselors have noticed the progress that I have made and see the effort I have been putting in. They let me transfer from outpatient into half way without going back to residential first, and I'm able to have my daughter live here with me. I want sobriety SO badly and I just don't know what's wrong with me and why I give up all of the good things I have in my life for fucking alcohol.

I used to drink every day and I’m trying to cut back to once a month. I’m down to once a week/every other week. My suggestions to anyone looking to make a change: switch to weed (I know some will say you’re just replacing a crutch and disagree with this, but I think they’re wrong and don’t understand weed, you can live a much more normal life if this is your vice). I also shoot basketball 5 days a week....I am not serious about it whatsoever and just try to perfect 3 pointers.

Any advice/tips?,"Hi everyone. I'm relatively new here, so I apologize in advance if this topic doesn't belong here or has been brought up before. 

 I (26F) have been sober for about 4 months now and it's going pretty well. I don't get too many alcohol cravings, and I'm able to bask in all the benefits of sobriety -- improved sleep, improved relationships, no hangovers, and all that good stuff. I've been drinking since I was 17 and this has been my longest stretch of sobriety since then, and it feels good. 

Anyway, my problem lately seems to be more about eating rather than drinking. I've always had a kind of tricky relationship with food, and I feel like it's intensified since I quit drinking. I've always had a sweet tooth and a tendency to stress-eat, and I worry my eating habits have been getting even worse since I've become sober. But even though I'm aware of it, there are some days I feel powerless to improve it. 

I would really like to lose weight both for my health and my self-esteem, but it feels like an uphill battle. I don't weigh myself that often (since I find it triggers me to feel worse about myself), but I think I've probably gained a few pounds since quitting alcohol, which I find pretty depressing/disheartening since I've heard so many people lose weight when they quit drinking. 

To clarify, I know how to eat relatively healthy and I pretty much have the resources to do so; my main problem is that I find it so difficult to resist sweets. I'll eat chicken, fish, vegetables and such at meals -- but then I eat sugary/fatty snacks too much and too often, between or after meals. 

I fear that I've really only swapped one vice for another. It's like my brain needs that quick hit of dopamine, and since I'm not getting it from wine anymore then I'm getting it from sugar instead. Like, sometimes after a long day at work I'll buy a pint of ice cream on my way home and then eat the whole thing in one sitting, whereas I used to down a bottle of wine in its place (which I'll sometimes try to justify to myself that ice cream isn't as harmful to me as alcohol was -- but like, it's not as if it's much better either!) I feel a good deal of guilt and shame about all this, and I want to do something about it to fix it, but I feel like I don't know where to start.

I'm speaking for myself when I say this but when I drink for long periods of time (benders) my room starts to reflect that. It becomes unorganized, sloppy and quite frankly it starts to reek of death. Its incredibly embarrassing and dehumanizing. So now, the point of this post...I decided to deep clean my room. I mean everything. I even prepared myself to find empty bottles wherever I would hide them, in backpacks, behind furniture, that sort of thing.

What I wasnt prepared for was finding a bottle of vodka. Unopened. 

I had been cleaning for hours and had great momentum going but I stopped dead in my tracks for 5 minutes with it in my hand. Just staring at it. The other day my friend yelled at me because ""you know better you just don't do better"". I know i wanted it and I started racking my brain when I could start drinking and get away with it.

But I snapped out of it and just ""hid"" it inside my guitar amp and got back to cleaning. I got back into the groove and kept throwing a bunch of trash away. When I was done I looked inside the bag to make sure I didn't throw away anything important. Thats when I saw the bottle in the bag. I didnt even think about it and tied the bag and threw the whole bag away.

I didnt drink today. I didnt fucking do it.
I wanted to so bad and my hands were almost shaking. That was about an hour ago and I still need to clean a lot but the garbage has already been taken and there's no way I can go digging for it now.

A few people who drank did sound lairy and even said a few silly things, spoke a bit too frankly, and just started to sound slurred. A bit of a nightmare to see and cringe at what they’re going to say next! I wondered if I used to sound slurred or loud and more aggressive after a beer.
- I got through a Friday work call where again at one point everyone was talking about beer, home brew, some were drinking, asking if others were drinking etc.... it was called “beers and social”. But I just had water, as did most of the people on the call I realised. The people pushing the drinking just don’t seem overly healthy from this side now. I wondered if I looked like that before.
- I got through an extremely tempting Friday without gaming and beer, instead having genuinely beautiful Early Grey tea 🫖 and some chocolates and fudge. Watched a movie. Had time and laughter with my partner. Didn’t argue. Didn’t stress each other out. Made yummy dinner and just had soda then water. 

I’m home and sober in bed and won’t feel awful tomorrow or need a greasy breakfast to recover and then sleep the rest of the day. I can have a fresh start and do whatever I like with no fear, no anxiety, no horrible hangover. 

I’m not going to pretend the last few days were easy, they were very stressful for me at work but I didn’t drink. I just want to get rid of the urge to drink beer at all. I just love the taste and the instant hit I get off it.

My partner doesn’t seem to crave or even notice that he’s not drinking. I envy that. To just not even struggle or care that he doesn’t have a beer. How does he do it? I really want that.

But I guess the next thing I need to do is reconnect my online gaming pathways and work out how to enjoy playing with my mates who are drunk or drinking without feeling off kilter.

I would not say I had a serious problem with alcohol before then, but I would say I routinely had 10 drinks a week and a typical Friday or Saturday would have 4-6 as soon as I had one.  Occasionally significantly more than that for a big event etc.

This is the longest period of abstinence in my adult life (i’ve had a few weeks or a month off in the past) and while I’ve always returned to moderate drinking, I’m feeling pretty different about it this time.  Here are the things I have noticed:

1) I’m in my thirties now and any more than two beers results in some noticeable sluggishness in the morning. 

2) I no longer have random aches or joint pains or awful sleeps in some unusual position.

3) I’ve lost weight despite not really controlling my diet other than not having beer/wine/cocktails 2-3 nights a week.

4) The feeling I used to have every single Friday of “I can’t wait to have a bunch of beer tonight” is more or less gone.  This despite our house still being full of booze.  And I think this is because of number 5):

5) I think alcohol has plain and simply stolen a huge amount of my most precious resource - time.  I’ve noticed that I can actually still do all the other pleasurable things I like to do (video games, play guitar, browse internet, movies, hang with friends, trying to learn investing) without simultaneously drinking, and weirdly enough when I go to bed sober at midnight or 1am I can still get up the next day at 8AM and do another full day of those things on the weekend.  And it has also changed my perception of time.  It’s been a very very long time since I have had an actual blackout from drinking, but it’s also true that the regular Friday and Saturday drinking instils a sort of fog that disrupts the continuity of what I was doing and feeling up to that point.  It can throw a loss of forward progress into something I was really enjoying or accomplishing until the beer hit.  And lastly, not drinking has also made me stop feeling as guilty about “wasting” time playing games or “not being productive”.  It’s hard to describe, but number 5) is the biggest factor that’s really making me reconsider getting back on the liquor.

In the future, especially if pandemic restrictions loosen, I imagine it will be a challenge to decline all alcohol and I’m not sure that’s exactly what I want.  I can see myself giving in for significant events, and I’d like to think I could succeed in keeping it down to 3-4 drinks a week. For now though, I’d rather keep this new feeling going, and I will not drink with you all today.",14,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5201473}"

2. I now pay my own rent.  Before, I was living in a condo my mom owned, and was not allowed much ownership over the place.  I now have my own office and a garage.
3. I have been in a long term relationship for almost a year with someone I cannot imagine not having in my life.  She is moving in today and we have a new home that we can make our own together.
4. I have a career.  Before I quit drinking, I worked in a lot of coffee shops, and landscaping jobs that I was not happy in.  Since I sobered up, I have become an accredited Elementary School Teacher.  I have recent been hired in a position that has given me something that I didn't know I was missing.
5. Since I quit drinking, I finally feel like I am living my life again.  I actually find more happy moments than sad ones.  I now face obstacles in my life with tenacity and vigilance, rather than despair and self -loathing.

I never went to a single meeting, it's just not my thing. I just lurked here and read posts every day, especially at the beginning.

I'm 36, I have been drinking heavily since I was 16. It started getting really bad the past couple of years and was drinking a lot by myself -- something I never really did in my 20s. But like many of you, I have no off button. Once I start, I drink until I'm hammered or until it's all gone.

I got tired of waking up hungover every day after a night with myself. I got tired of seeing the texts I sent while hammered and being completely embarrassed -- only to do it again the next day. I never lost my job for drinking, or got a DUI (although I should have hundreds) but I did ruin a lot of relationships.

This has been an amazing and challenging journey. I freaking love sleeping through night without sweating or waking up to pee, waking up in the morning refreshed, and most of all, not feeling shame every day for something stupid I did that came from some part of me that only comes out while intoxicated.

Almost all the negative events in my life all had to do with drinking. It took me longer than I'd hoped to realize this but I'm glad I gave it up when I did. Because now I have one year under my belt and there's no looking back.

Not once this year have I said to myself, man I wish I drank at that party/event. Not once did I regret not drinking. And listen, all my friends drink -- a lot. I've watched them embarrass themselves, fight with their spouses while hammered, puke violently in the morning, you name it. So I have been around it all year -- but now, it doesn't affect me. In fact, it reminds me why I decided to make a change.

My friends all get beers and I stick with water. No one says anything.  This was my first lesson.  No one was upset that I wasn't drinking. It was just me in an internal struggle with myself. 

2/3 of my friends only sipped on one beer for about 1 hour. The last Friend drank like I would. Drink one as fast as possible before food comes. Hope to get some of the second one down before the food comes as well. This was my second lesson.  I thought everyone was drinking like me. They weren't. I was the one getting drunk out with friends while everyone else just had one. 

I ordered an AF beer because I was curious and wanted to try it. It was decent. I had a great time. Laughing, talking,  and I actually remember our conversations. I woke up this morning and felt great.  This moment was a big one for me. Last night was a game changer for me.

2021-02-12 13:30:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lihccr/dealing_with_people_after_changing_mindset/,Dealing with People After Changing Mindset,"Hi all, first time poster here. I actually just celebrated 1 year sober January 30th! I'm so happy about it, but I've had to change a lot. If you've ever been to an AA meeting, you always hear, ""all you have to change is everything"". Well, I did. I changed cities, jobs (I used to be a stripper, 80% of the reason I came to work was because I could get drunk while working), and pretty much my whole friend group and support system outside of my family of origin, which of course you can't change. I've been having some issues with my sister. She and I used to be drinking buddies, and I am generally pretty close with her, but since I'm completely sober (no alcohol, or any type of drug) she's not super receptive to that. 

She actually suggested we go to a dispensary in Michigan when she was up here. I have nothing against what people do in their spare time, but I have no interest in going to a dispensary. Nor would I have before I got sober. Alcohol was always my drug of choice. Particularly what I called the ""Jessica Jones Breakfast"" because I worked night shift, which consisted of a bottle of bourbon. But I digress. 

In the past, she has tried to tell me I wasn't an alcoholic, that I was just going through a hard time. Blah. Blah. Blah. Yeah. She didn't see all the empty bottles and cans I had stashed in a trashbag in my closet, or the hidden bottles above my washer, or the ones hidden in the bottom of my makeup drawer. Or all the glass bottles I'd go through in a week. Or me going down to the little river by my house and falling asleep on the bank because I was too fucked up to get up. Or the fact that my blood alcohol level has been so high that it puts most people in a coma, but I was upright (staggery, but upright). Yeah, not alcoholic behavior at all. 

Anyway, recently she was home for thanksgiving and had a giant bottle of vodka between her and her husband, which I didn't actually mind, but it did bother me when she said, ""I didn't think we'd get along anymore if you were sober"". So clearly, she associates being close with me to getting fucked up. Which is a mess. And it makes me kind of sad. 

Then today I see my young nephew posted a kind of dramatic post about losing his girlfriend (ahh young love) and my sister commented saying ""have your aunt and grandpa take you to a strip club and get back out there"". This is problematic for a couple of reasons. 1. How fucking weird is it to go to a strip club with your nephew and dad. 2. my nephew isn't old enough to get into bars. 3. I have no interest in going to a club when I have no reason to be in one. 

I just feel like she just thinks me being sober is a phase because she didn't see the nasty shit I had to glue back together as a result of my drinking. I love my sister, I really do, but I can't help but think that maybe 80% of our relationship was bonding over drinking and that maybe there was nothing substantial at the end of the day. Anyone else ever go through that?",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44159585}"

My last drinks resulted in a friend asking me about things I had said/asked the previous day, and my brain having no recollection whatsoever of, well, almost anything we had discussed as I was downing one drink after another. This was the last, very clear, sign that it was truly time to either stop, or I'd eventually drink myself to death.

So, my tracker right now is really tracking the last time I blacked out. I was regularly drinking about a minimum 3+ glasses of wine a night and on those evenings where I wanted to ""particularly"" let loose, I was downing about 1.5-2 bottles of wine.

I won't bore you with my backstory, but it all started with a bad breakup in the Winter of 2019, then COVID, plus I'm a single mom of a kindergartener, I have depression and anxiety, etc etc ad nauseum. I was lost and bored and comforted myself with drinking. I convinced myself that I was having fun and letting loose - reveling in the mommy wine culture and grumpy millenial attitude - when in reality it was just me getting drunk with my cats in my home every night and waking up every morning feeling like absolute shit. Sad.

A week ago after a particularly rough day-long hangover, I had just finally had enough. I was sick (literally) and tired of feeling like shit all the time. My weight had ballooned 20 pounds over my absolute baseline of comfort (from the past year alone) and I was disgusted with how I looked and felt. I knew I needed to change and now.

So far in the past week, I've had 3 beers - all on different nights - and didn't even finish each. But I've found most days, while I still temporarily get the urge for a glass of wine (usually around early afternoon when I'd typically start for the day), it goes right back out of my mind pretty quickly when I think about how much a hangover would suck. And how much time out of my day I'd be wasting with empty calories and barely registering what I'm doing by 5 pm, with still so many hours of the evening to go. The play it forward tactic is amazing!

My weight has lowered slowly (now settling 5 pounds lighter than it normally would day to day), but the biggest difference is the loss of bloating. I can feel the fingers in my bones again when I interlace them and my jawline is slowly but surely making a comeback. That in and of itself has been enough of a motivator to keep this going.

But a funny thing I stumbled across, and specifically wanted to share here, was the difference apparently in my sleep quality. I wear a fitbit, so it tracks my sleep, and I've included two links to snapshots in differing points in the recent past: one from the last summer when I was drinking heavily and the other from this past week. For reference: light blue is restlessness, dark blue is sleep, and pink is awake. The difference in sleep quality to me was startling! And yet another reason to keep this up.

All in all - I've greatly appreciated this community and reading everyone's stories and all the support everyone here has to give alongside kind words and encouragement. I'm feeling the change in me slowly growing and hope that I can keep it up!

I’m 32 and I’ve known I’m an alcoholic since I was 20. That young age is the first and only time I’ve quit drinking for any period of time. I’ve had fun drinking with my “friends” over the years, but now I’m starting to notice my physical and mental health deteriorating.

My plan is to attend a local AA meeting tomorrow. I’m not sure how up-to-date the meeting listings are online, especially during COVID-19, but just getting out of the house will be helpful mentally. Beyond that, I’m currently in weekly one-on-one therapy where I tried to work with my therapist to control my drinking without quitting outright. That plan has predictably failed repeatedly. Given that, this past week she asked that I don’t worry about limiting my drinking, but to self-reflect and think about what I really want.

Just need to figure out how to keep it going...,"Spent the last few months lurking on this sub, and decided to finally create an account to officially join. 

I’d been struggling with my relationship with alcohol for almost a year now, and am only starting to do something about it. At the start of covid, I was hyper aware of how it exacerbated my anxiety and destroyed my overall mental health and productivity. 

At (pre-covid) social events with my family and friends, alcohol is a guarantee. For years, I bought into the trope that it was normal and fun and fine. Everyone in my extended family drinks regularly but still maintains good jobs and home lives. For years, I was blissfully unaware of the downsides - I looked at brutal hangovers as just part of life, and I never realized that my constant anxious state was NOT normal.

While a lot of my friends took the excuse to increase their drinking because of covid/stay home orders, I started challenging myself to NOT drink during the week. That worked out fine and I felt great, but the weekends would come around and I’d say “fuck it” and open a bottle of wine... that I’d promptly finish. It felt like this endless cycle of finishing a bottle of wine on both Friday and Saturday, feeling groggy and shitty on Sunday, then starting the week feeling weirdly ashamed of myself.  

The holidays were tough - I spent weeks at home with my parents, and essentially drank every single night. I felt tired and bloated and gross, so I decided to give dry January a try. 

Dry January felt like taking off blinders - the first week I felt pretty shitty, but by the end, I felt phenomenal. I was working out every day and productive at work and my mental health was better than it’s ever been. I feel like now that I’ve had the taste of that amazing feeling, AND knowing that I have the power to make myself feel that way permanently, is pretty “intoxicating” in itself.

But as soon as dry Jan ended, I went on a weekend trip to the mountains with a super small group of friends (after getting tested) and promptly binge drank again. Felt like crap on Sunday, and ended up drinking every night the week after, and the following weekend. I’m noticing that I have a super hard time limiting myself to just one or two glasses - which is never a “problem” I was aware of, because I wasn’t trying to fix it, if that makes sense.

I miss the feeling of 31 days sober. I initially thought it was a temporary “reset” for me, but I’m finding myself wanting to stop drinking even more. 

Also I’m realizing I just word-vomited a super long post - I’m new here so I am so sorry if this isn’t kosher. I can’t talk to my friends or family about it (I’ve tried)- they don’t really get how I’m feeling, and I’m afraid they’re going to think I’m boring and “uppity” if I stop. Right now it’s easier for me to challenge myself to NOT drink since all I do is sit at home because of covid, but once the word opens back up, I’m scared I’ll fall right back into my old social habits. 

I want to bottle up the feeling of being one month sober. It was something I never knew I wanted or needed in all my 10 years of drinking regularly/heavily.

I had some trauma (I was both a victim and a witness) and I picked up some really bad habits which lead to some fairly mild addictions to some really bad substances. 

None of this has been easy, but I learned some things from some Buddhist friends about first being as moral as possible, and secondly seeing that I have to first heal and then all else will drop off. My view is that once you are whole the addictions can drop off and freedom will come more easily. I think this has worked pretty well for me and I am lucky that I mostly came out unscathed physically...well, I did give myself a chronic disease,  but it's totally under control.

There has been a lot of shame which I am still learning to overcome and I continue my battle over my monkey brain, but I feel like the hardest parts are behind me and i'm feeling safe enough to voice this here...in an anonymous setting where none of you really know who I am. Maybe further sharing will come later, but I lived away during those years of addiction, so perhaps the people where I live now never need to know? I would love to hear thoughts on that.

I sometimes have a gasp of panic when I think about no longer getting drunk, just like I did when I stopped the other hard stuff. But it passes when I just think about how wide open the door is to everything else under the sun. 

I also quit smoking about a decade ago, and my next target is to quite nicotine replacement therapy after all those years. A friend told me I could go to an NA meeting over that one too, but that seems crazy. Maybe having a big ""why"" has helped me too.

&#x200B;

**Awaken**. It’s still dark in my room. I rub sleep from my tired eyes. I immediately know it’s the middle of the night (or morning) and like the houseguest from Hell that she is, addiction, is knocking at my door. She never announces herself. Like a predator in the night, she creeps into my conscience. She is precise, she is quiet, she moves with stealth. Each step of hers is delicate, ensuring I don’t notice her presence until she’s hovering at the foot of my bed. My eyes dart from my bed to my phone, it’s late. Why am I awake? Why do I want to drink? **What is she doing here?** I went to bed covered in blankets and peace. Pure intentions for my tomorrow.

But here I am currently, in the dark. Thoughts racing. My heartbeat works earnestly to match its pace. They work as a team and they call themselves anxiety. They have an undefeated record. I become paralyzed in their presence. I’ve grown though right? Here’s my recovery: casually showing up. Always late to the party. You want to be mad at its timing, but deep down you’re just glad that it arrived. Better late than never, right? Wrong. That's not how addiction works. Timing is everything. My mind is racing again. Like the gas pedal in a vehicle, I can feel everything inside of me accelerating. Slow. Steady. But moving faster nonetheless.

I breathe. I’ve grown. I know what this is. I know who this intruder in my home is. 

***It’s addiction.*** Back in all her overrated glory, romanticizing a life that I’ve long left behind.  


What do you want? Why do you haunt me? I’m anxious. Racing thoughts. Elevated heartbeat. I feel myself biting my lips. Rubbing my thighs. My stomach is in knots. I need to move. I stand & lean confidently into the darkness, relying on familiarity & habit to guide me instead of my eyes. I can’t decide if this is just literal, or both figurative and literal. Bittersweet irony. 

My uncertainty emboldens me. I move swiftly. I fumble around & feel for the light in my kitchen. Upon finding it, I feel all my fear depart with the arrival of the light. I look around. The dishes are done. My counters are eerily clean. It feels like home. It smells like yesterday’s dinner. My heart warms at the sight of hot wheels & dinosaurs scattered beneath my table. It feels safe. It feels familiar. Comfort settles into my skin. I can feel that it’s fleeting, but I take it & hold onto it for dear life. *What the fuck is going on with me?* My eyes dart to the fridge. Maybe I need some water? Food? My body is crying out for something. 

Who am I kidding? I know it's alcohol, but I quickly silence that voice.

Desperate to fill the growing void inside of me I open the door- a fully stocked fridge stares back at me. Water. Fruit. Leftovers. Marinated meat. It looks like someone with a life owns this fridge. Maybe even someone who cares about themselves? Indecision wins, I close the door- empty-handed. As it closes, I glance up and see the door of my fridge. It is littered with paper. Pictures. Notes. Cheap magnets. A calendar. 

It portrays a life: **my life.** I have artwork from my kid on it. I have self-affirmations. I have certificates. I have goals. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say this fridge belongs to someone who loves themselves. Someone who loves their life. Someone who participates in it.

I pause. A long breath escapes my lungs. A reminder of who I am settles in my brain. I feel a warmth run through my veins. *Is that you, pride?* Is that you, love?

For one brief moment, I feel safe. I feel validated, maybe? I stand in my kitchen and ponder my next move. Seconds go by, just enough time for anxiety and self-debt to creep back into my heart. Sure, I see all this change. This growth. This healthy person I see on my fridge—***she is me***.

Or is she? Who am I, *really*?

I feel doubt crawling up my throat. I quickly swallow, putting her back in my belly where she belongs. I’ll deal with you later. I look around the kitchen, absorbing all that is the quiet comfort of my home. I built this. I fought for this. I did this. I feel unsettled. Lost in the familiarity of my tiny kitchen. I can’t help but feel like an imposter in this space. Unwelcome.

**What is happening?**

Seduction shows up to the emotional orgy that is happening in my kitchen. Just in motherfucking time. My brain is trying to comfort me. She trades all that anxiety and overthinking for pleasure. A reoccurring theme in my 30 years. My body responds to the thought. The word. I feel warm. I feel… loose. My face is flushed. My joints aren’t as tight. My mouth salivates. I can feel a grin creep across my face. That’s what she does: **addiction.** 

She shows up in your favorite dress, that hits her curves just right. She is wearing your favorite perfume. That one you loved so much. You feel hesitant, you feel fear, you feel cautious… but she embraces you. You take a whiff of her hair, there she is. You feel her touch. You hear her voice. Your vulnerabilities and fears cast themselves like stones into the sea. She is a traveler of your body, your mind, and your soul. **She knows all parts of you.** Her passport is stained with stamps, fingerprints, and signatures. Each crevice. Each once hidden valley. She has explored every layer of all that is who you are. She has kissed all your scars. She has undressed you. Once upon a time, you were tangled in her vines. For a long time, she was your comfort. I feel violently conflicted. My heart is racing. I feel the shame creeping in like fog. Thick. All enveloping. Making it hard to see what’s right in front of my face. Dizzy, I wander into the thick chaos. I breathe it in.

**Why am I struggling like this?**

Suddenly hyper-aware of my surroundings, I am also painfully aware of the sad fact I am an adult, in my kitchen, struggling to make the choice to go back to my warm bed or…

Or get in my car and drive to the nearest poorly-lit convenience store. Something about the lights, the way they glow. The quietness of the parking lot after midnight. It’s welcoming. Like a moth to the flame…More like a mosquito. Wandering both by accident & instinct nearer to that poorly-lit convenience store. Ravenously thirsty, I pierce the skin of my target and drink greedily.I used to live only for that moment, the act of devouring- willfully ignorant to the predictable death that drew nearer with every gulp.

I try to ignore the wetness growing between my thighs.

Didn’t I move past this? This shouldn’t be so hard, *right?* My mind reaches desperately for validation. Grasping at kitchen appliances and still furniture like straws. I need to hear I am right. I need someone to acknowledge I have changed. I listen intently. ***Silence.*** I don’t believe in signs unless they are negative, so this outcome is just the push I needed to start co-signing my own bullshit.

My hands shake as I pull out the pen.

Is this my ego speaking? My addiction? My present self? **Who am I right now?**

I feel like a car on the highway. Middle of the night. The radio is too loud. It’s fuzzy, it’s coming in and out. The road before and behind me is endless. I am moving, fast. Direction and destination are unknown. I can’t see the driver. Who is in control? Am I the driver or am I the unwilling passenger?

That’s addiction. It’s being in a car that’s on the run, not sure who is driving, running as fast as you can into the unknown. Anything to get away from wherever you are. From who you are.

***I don’t miss that******.*** I say it hesitantly, the crack in my voice reduces the sentence to a near whisper. The words stumble clumsily out of my mouth, eager to return to the back of my throat- sensing their own inauthenticity.

**I’m full of shit.** I’m entirely full of shit.

Back to driving: I like driving. I have grown to love the feeling of my hands on the wheel. The sticky warmth of the sun on my skin. Destination unknown? ***Sure.*** But I’m ok with that. I’m driving now. I am in control.

**But am I?** I am immediately aware once again, that I’m a grown adult, almost a year into my sobriety, pacing my kitchen like a forgotten circus animal. Terror in my eyes. A hunger growing in my stomach. Not sure if I should run or attack. I don’t like this. This feeling. The loss of control. ***It used to excite me, now it terrifies me.***

Maybe I’ve grown soft. Maybe all this peace, this growth, this healing… it’s a hoax. It was never real. **I am who I am**. Aren’t I? Except I have evolved into someone else. If I doubt her existence, all I have to do is look around the place I call home. Her fingerprints are everywhere. There are photos on the walls. There is a calendar. My home is clean. My fridge is stocked. There are tiny shoes and bouncy balls and yoga mats by my door. Insignificant upon first glance. However, for a person who spent a decade not loving themselves, these are symbols. Of my growth. Of my self-love. Of my realization that I am someone worth investing in.Moving on.Next stop: anxiety. I can feel my skin, it’s tight and it’s clammy. My heart is doing the dance of indecision, swiftly moving from black to white. Unable to feel settled in the grey. The irony? ***That’s where the peace lies.*** That’s where the answer is.I feel my mind sprint: where are my keys?

***There she is. Addiction.*** Right on time, unlike sobriety. Addiction uses the undeniable truth that is time-keeping to her advantage, weaponizing each second. She’s a resourceful little bitch, addiction. A true McGyver.

I glance at her. Flirting with gravity. Twirling her hair. Licking her lips. Welcoming me back into her arms. She smells like home. She looks like home. I hesitate. I feel my mind separate from my body. I feel fear. Am I in control? Who is driving? I grasp for my seatbelt with unsteady hands, oblivious to the fact my feet are planted firmly on cheap tile.

I know she is bad news. I know she is a ghost, here to rattle her chains and haunt me as she does so well. I know she is the past and I have been living in the present for quite some time. I made a home here in healing. I forwarded my mail I have moved on. But not enough I realize, to be immune to her pull. Her familiarity.. fuck it feels like home. I meet her eyes. Yes, I’ve grown. I’m in a good place. I’m sober. I can say no. But… don’t I deserve a yes? She hears my inner conflict. She nods her head. I step towards her. Doing all I can to silence my mind, as I knowingly take a step towards all that is her chaos. She is home. I haven’t visited in a while.

Not a moment too soon, I hear a voice. My name. Who is calling for me? It’s coming from the abyss that is my hallway. It’s dark. I don’t know who it is? Should I go? I look back to addiction. She’s waiting, licking her lips, begging me to embrace her. I can feel her pull just like gravity. It’s overwhelming and undeniable. But I am curious. I promise addiction, I’ll be back. Let’s talk about this. We can figure this shit out.That’s addictions ugly sister: justifying. Co-signing my bullshit. Validating my toxicity. I know this. I am aware, but I proceed anyways with my promises, although they are halfhearted and full of doubt. I guide myself down my hallway in the dark. I keep hearing my name. Someone is calling for me.I make my way hesitantly back to my bed. It’s recovery. She is enslaved in blankets. Her face is both concerned and full of love. She opens her arms. I open my mouth to apologize. Her presence is overwhelming. Her light is heavy. It’s blinding at first. Uncomfortable. But after some time, it’s warm. It begins to feel… like home. I collapse into her arms. Apology flows out of me like a river. I can’t stop. I am so sorry. I am so ashamed.  She looks at me & smiles, wipes tears from my eyes. 

“It’s ok” she says. “I understand why you went to her. I'm not angry. You are loved. You are not judged. You are safe here. I know it’s uncomfortable, but give me a chance.”

My ego dissipates. My body relaxes. I breathe. Her forgiveness, her honesty, her understanding: it makes me uncomfortable. I don’t deserve this. I open my mouth to object but she quiets me. She wraps her arms around me. “You made the right choice” she says. “This is where you belong.” I close my eyes. I may not believe her. But I decide to accept her words as truth anyways.

My mind wanders to my long-lost love down the hall. Will she miss me, I wonder. I feel my heart start to pound… I didn’t get to say goodbye. I have to say goodbye. *Am I ready to say goodbye?* Do I even want to? I feel a fire spark in the depths of my guts, one that burns for her. Sometimes it rages, sometimes it is just a quiet glow, kept alive by glowing embers. No matter which version, it continues to burn. It warms me. She warms me. Has she burned me? Well, yes. Have her flames destroyed things I’ve built? Maybe once or twice. But fuck… her warmth. Like your favorite blanket from childhood.

I meet the eyes of recovery. With just a look, she assures me I am exactly where I belong. How did I end up in this bed? How I arrived here is irrelevant. ***I have arrived.*** I am safe. I am sober. I am ok. She can read my mind. *Maybe she is me?* Maybe that person down the hall is a stranger. I have no definitive answers.

But I am sober…. and for now that’s all I need. I fall back to sleep, ready to do it all again tomorrow.

I’m wasting my life away just repeating this cycle of enjoying wine and the taste, but then ruining my next day and my mental/physical health in the long run. I’ve gone back and forth on wether I have a problem or not, because I don’t get blackout or even drunk most times I drink. But the fact is that wine makes me sick and yet I can’t stop drinking it to feel anything. So today is day 1, not a single drop for a month.

She said I didn't have to stop drinking for this to work.  Also, I started naltrexone which I've read does better if you keep drinking, because it teaches pharmacological extinction through not giving the body/brain the same opiatic response.  I drank too much yesterday even with it.  Like 2 bottles of wine, 2 strong 22 oz ipa's and a couple shots.  I mean, I successfully drank like 7 shots, twice in the last month, while trying the naltrexone, but I dont like that it's not a 100% fix.  No loss of job, leaving the burner on, or crashing my car/bike this time, but still.  (I did visit a homeless camp and gave away $60, food, and beer/weed to them.  Shouldn't be getting trashed like that around people I dont know while I'm clearly well off enough to be giving stuff away.  Could have been dangerous, even if I'm a big guy)  Sleeping half a day away, toxic, and the anxiety mixed with not getting anything done today is enough.

I'm just going to go for 1 month. That's the plan.  I'm told that working out helps replace the chemicals that my body will crave.  Maybe that healthier lifestyle will be habituated by that point.  I'm going to post every, fucking, day.  Thanks for having this supportive space here.  IWNDWYT.

I started drinking at 17-18 (I'm 22-years-old now) and instantly knew I'd get addicted to the feeling alcohol gave me. I even vividly remember the first time I got drunk; a bottle of vodka.

Prior to intoxication, I was arguing with my mates that both the alcohol content (40%) as well as the amount (750ml) of alcohol wasn't enough to get the 3 of us all drunk. Boy, how wrong I was. I proceeded to vomit everywhere once I was inebriated. Fast-forward 4/5 years later and I'm still filled with regret, guilt, and shame from the chaos that ensued. (My sister, however, told me not be a captive of the past, and learn from it instead, everyone makes mistakes, such is the essence of human nature).

I'm currently 1 month and 2 weeks sober, hopefully I don't go back down the treacherous path of self-medication because my decision-making in regards to booze made absolutely zero sense when I reflect on them in hindsight. It's like I was under a spell, being controlled by some form of a 'demon.'  Yet in actual fact, it was my own judgment that was just impaired.

Relatively speaking, I'm glad to still be of sound mind all things considered. That said, I simply can't fathom the prospect of me not coming to this profound realisation early on. It's saved me a lot of financial, emotional, mental and physical time/energy in the long-run. At least, this gives me a sense of solace. It ain't all good, but it's all good.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy day my sober friends!!  We made it to Friday!!  Yay!!  Y’all only have to put up with me for one more day after this!!  Haha!  

I have learned so much from all of you this week – namely – you love your pets, kids and music!  Well, I don’t have kids but I do like music and I do have pets so we’re going to do something different today.

First off, here is a song I think is appropriate as I wind down my hosting duties. The first time I heard this song was in the movie *Napoleon Dynamite*, which (don't judge) is like one of my all-time favorite movies.  I can pretty much recite the whole thing.  The song is called [“We’re Going To Be Friends”](https://youtu.be/uuXwMd5HGqs) by The White Stripes.  I wanted to share this because, well, I like to think that we all have become friends!  I know I appreciate each and every last one of you.  I’m going to leave it at that for now…more sappiness to come tomorrow.

Next up, we’re going to play a game.  In addition to your pledge to not drink today, I want you to describe your pet’s name (past, present, fictional, whatever) without saying their name.  Then we can all try to guess your pet’s name in the comments!!  

**Come on – it’ll be fun!!  Here, I’ll go first…**

My dog (who you met yesterday) is Piglet’s BFF.  

My previous dog was the crab in Disney’s “The Little Mermaid”.  

My other previous dog was an American made motorcycle brand.  

Any guesses??  Leave your comments in your pledge post and give us clues to your animal’s names…

And with that, I wish everyone a great Friday and know that IWNDWYT.  Love to you all and see you tomorrow for one last hurrah… of me hosting… ‘cause I ain’t going anywhere, otherwise!!

What will women think on a first date when they order a drink and I'm sipping on a Topo Chico?

This is my 68th day sober and I’ve finally realized how beautiful it is to be a young addict. I used to feel so much shame when comparing myself to my peers. 
What kind of low-life scum becomes an alcoholic in their early 20s? What extreme trauma could I have possibly faced to become so broken?

Now that I’m sober, I am so fucking proud of myself for recognizing I had a problem this early. I could have played it off as “youthful carelessness” or sided with the stereotype that all people experiment with drugs and alcohol at this age. But I didn’t. 

I was able to look at the destruction, lies, and loss that that this horrible addiction has caused me. I swallowed my pride and confided with family and friends. I displayed my flawed humanity for the whole world to see and in return, was accepted with open arms. The initial embarrassment will never compare to the absolute FREEDOM I experience now.

I basically had the worst hospital experience of my life and was sent on my way with no new information and an Atarax prescription that has basically no effect on me.

Every day since then I've been anticipating it happening again, and it has a few times to lesser degrees. I cut out drinking besides a couple of shots here and there because I would typically drink an absurd amount on the regular and I didn't want to have a stroke. I'm stuck in a ball of random anxiety and anticipation of panic attacks.

I'm a bartender and I work in a fast paced environment where my co workers and friends could usually depend on me as a sort of leader. I was always the one who kept it together and I would hate to let them down. I can handle being around alcohol but the anxiety is hurting my performance.

But I’m only recently starting to see that isn’t taking over my life.

I assumed it would have hit my professional life first — but no.  I’ve kept that intact, luckily.  Buy my personal life is slowly starting to crumble.  I can’t meet new people the way I used to because I’d have to show them that I’m drinking nearly every night.  I can’t go out with friends the way I used to because I need to be home by 7pm to be able to salvage a night of drinking.  I’m starting to have to dodge questions from the family.

I’ve not hit anywhere close to a bottom.  I could probably do this for years.  But I’ve wanted to stop for a long time.  I’m incapable.  It’s really defeating to wake up every morning for six months or a year saying you’re not going to drink that night...and to fail 95% of the time.  I used to have things that could keep my attention.  But they either no longer keep my attention or my addiction just overwhelms me and convinces me it would be better while tipsy/drunk.

I feel like I just need a better option — something I can convince myself is better than the numb.

I’m 26 years old and the last few years for me have been very rough. Dealt with some pretty traumatic events, break ups, a brief stint of unemployment, family crises, you name it. 

I was raised by two alcoholics who to this day continue to abuse alcohol and other substances. Alcohol was always around me and available. I’ve seen firsthand the ugly power of alcohol, how it makes people bitter and angry and destructive. 

Despite my better judgment, it all got to be too much and one day I just started drinking and never looked back. I remained pretty functional but realized I had a problem when I began sneaking vodka before work. 

I’ve gotten better at managing it the last year, but ultimately I know I’m hurting my self and sabotaging any chance I have of really healing mentally, physically, and emotionally. 

I found this sub a few days ago and have been so inspired and motivated by the stories I read. You all are amazingly strong people and so welcoming. I don’t know what the future holds for me, but I know that I will not drink today.

But then, the shoulder devil got to me.  Just a little thought at first - ""you've done 10 days of being sober, eating well, exercising daily - you deserve a night off, getting food and wine delivered"".  And that thought didn't go away, and just getting bigger, until it was time to start dinner and all I could do was procrastinate and find excuses.  I basically shut down and was incapable of doing anything until I gave in.

I did it, and was disappointed my alcohol tolerance hadn't decreases - after a full bottle I still only felt a little buzz.  So at 11pm I found an open bar, and had a few more glasses, and felt great.

Of course, the next morning I didn't feel too hot, and allowed myself to go to a restuarant for lunch.  And a few more glasses.  I actually managed to get fairly drunk there, so went home for a nap, and by the time it was dinner, I ordered out again.

This morning, physically I feel fine, but mentally I'm just over the fight.  I know I've put on all the weight I lost over the 10 days, so I feel shitty about that, and I just want to drink again tonight.  The big issue is I put myself on the banned drinkers register, so the only want I can get alcohol at home is to find a restaurant that allows delivery alcohol with food, and that is expensive and makes it hard for me when I want that second bottle.

I am going to fight it tonight, but more our of embarrassment, having ordered from the same place two nights in a row).  I don't want to fight anymore, I just want to give in, even though I know what it will do to my body.  Am I going to have this struggle the rest of my life?

I explained that when I think about drinking I remember how sincerely deeply sad I felt and how hopeless I felt then, and how I can’t go back to that. She started excitedly clapping and told me she was so proud.
Tbh, I’m really proud too. Fingers crossed this new medication works because I need to start living again.

We did what we always did, our place was the party house. The booze was flowing and we got some gear in etc. Standard Wednesday.

It got to like 6am, needless to say I was trashed. Most people had left, just a girl from the bar and my housemate. I was coming down the stairs (the stairs were really steep in that house) and fell at the top step all the way down to the bottom then through (yes through) the fucking wall straight into the bathroom head first. 

I was out cold for a minute or two and my housemate who was also drink just looked at me and was like ""it's probably time for bed I reckon"".

Next day I fully forgot what had happened. I thought it was just the worst hangover of my life. I was so so sick. Obviously I had a fucking concussion. Went to the hospital and spent the next 2 weeks being sick and not being able to stand without feeling dizzy.

On top of this, the following day the landlord had people over at the house for a viewing as we were leaving a few weeks later. He wasn't stoked.

I promptly paid for all the damages. It didn't stop me drinking.

Im 21 years old, a senior in college. Everyone says these years are supposed to be the best years of your life, but I really hope that isn't the case. I spent way too many of my weekends the last few years blacked out. And I was by no means a functioning black out. I'm not positive but based on the few stories that my friends still talk about, Im pretty sure I was always a menace. To be honest, I wonder why the few friends I have have still stick around. 

Recently I've been thinking a lot about what's was wrong with me and why I behaved how I did for so long. I'm thinking it had to do with my anxiety. I was never diagnosed nor was I able to put the name ""anxious"" next to how I always felt as I thought it was normal. Very recently, I realized I was always drinking to quiet that anxious voice in my head. When I blacked out, that. voice wasn't constantly reminding about my sweaty armpits or telling me I don't fit in. I was a slave to that voice and drinking was my way of erasing that voice. 

Now I know I need to address my anxiety, and I am going to find ways to work on that over the next few years. But now I also have to deal with all the issues my drinking has caused. I made a lot of mistakes that I have to live with now. I didn't do anything to land me in jail or anything but I have hurt people who didn't deserve it. I don't think I hurt anyone in ways that would require an apology 2 years later, but I have to reconcile the fact that I was such a mess.

As many I started drinking heavily in college and it only progressed with time. 10 years later I found myself sick, chubby, tired and addicted. After missing work, laying in bed hungover for days, spending way too much money on booze I hit my low and checked myself into rehab. It was honestly one of the best experiences of my life. The place I went to was honestly more of a resort than a facility, however the tools I learned and counseling I received were invaluable.

I'm sharing because I was the guy that drank 7 days a week from the moment I got off work, until early in the morning. If anyone of my friends was asked who they knew that could drink the most whiskey without blacking out, it was me. I was the life of the party, always down for a drink, pushing shots, drinking past all my friends limits, in other words, ""hopeless"". I'd never maintained sobriety, not because I couldn't, but because I didn't want to. Therein lies the key to sobriety. You HAVE to WANT to stop drinking.

I sincerely believe that anyone can stop drinking, but its not easy. I certainly don't meant to be on a soapbox or high horse as I still have a long journey ahead of me, however I hope I can provide some solid advice and hope to those seeking sobriety. The first step is figuring out your why? Do you want to lose weight, have you had trouble maintaining a job, wife want you to quit? The dirty truth is that if you feel forced to quit, or don't truly want to, you wont. Or at least you may maintain sobriety, but every day will be excruciating as you crave and think about alcohol nonstop. If you really want to make the change you can take the baby steps and maintain sobriety without ever really missing it. My recommendations that worked for me?

&#x200B;

\-Find new hobbies that take up time: (no, not netflix), start reading books, join a club, volunteer, I play Magic the Gathering, Volunteer with Big Brothers program and do bonsai for fun. One thing people don't realize is how much of their time is dedicated to drinking. Cut that out and you have a lot of free time.... A Lot. So fill that time with good alternate activities to keep your mind off it.

\-Stay Active: you don't have to become a gym rat, but practice yoga, go for walks, hikes, workout with a buddy. Don't go crazy and go all in at once or you'll burn out, but find a joy for the little things and slowly implement it into your schedule.

\-Find a Deeper Meaning: I'm not an overly religious person, but for many this is a huge factor in sobriety, if you have religion, reconnect with it. If not try meditation or even just practice gratitudes on a daily basis. At the end of each day take time to be intentional and think about all the things you're grateful for in your life. Doesn't even have to be huge things. Be grateful for your pets, for having a roof over your head, a job, laughing today, etc. Just be intentional.

\-Have a community: I personally haven't become involved in AA, SMART or other recovery programs, but for most people this is huge. If that's not your thing just have supportive friends you can talk to about your successes and struggles and who will keep you accountable. If you don't feel like you have anyone like that there are other tools like this sub, SMART online meetings, maybe even a church group or any recovery group. I stay in touch with my friends from rehab, my wife quit drinking with me and my family and friends are my support and they have been immensely helpful.

\-If you can afford it go to counseling: Counseling is expensive and sometimes isn't covered by insurance, but was instrumental in my recovery. Oftentimes we drink due to some deeper seeded issue. It may be something incredibly traumatic from our past, but it doesn't have to be. Counseling can help you work through those issues and get to the deeper problem. Counseling is Absolutely nothing to be ashamed about. I honestly believe every person, no matter how outwardly successful and independent, could benefit from counseling. If this is cost prohibitive I would recommend trying a recovery group.

\-My final recommendation is to gather good resources and become educated on addiction, alcohol and psychology. There are numerous free resources online, but I've also included a reading list that benefited me below;

This Naked Mind by Annie Grace (the most comprehensive and life changing book I've read on Alcohol)

When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron (not directly recovery rated, but so many good pieces of wisdom. If you're remotely interested in buddhism this is a great start)

How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie (hokey title and not recovery related, but if you're like me and worry you can't make friends or be social when sober, this book provides numerous nuggets that will inevitably help with your social interactions, networking and making friends)

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*k by Mark Manson (a refreshing book in the cumbersome self help category, this book helps with letting go and living a better life)

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey (a great book on developing healthy habits to achieve your goals)

Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach PHD (a book on principles from buddhism that are helpful for anyone from any walk of life. Even if Buddhism isn't for you, this is a great read and mixes psychology with spiritualism)

Finally what has changed for me in the last 107 days? I lost 20 lbs and can eat pretty much whatever I want without gaining much weight, all of my old clothes fit again! My relationships with my wife and family are much better, I communicate more effectively and anger doesn't get the best of me. I'm saving a shit ton of money, like almost $2,500 so far. I'm more effective at work. My mind is clear, I think better, my memory has improved and I'm more rational. I've regained a love for old hobbies. My depression and anxiety have improved 1,000 fold. My medications work and aside from minor mood dips, I am overall much happier and way less anxious.

I did this for many reasons. My health was the main concern as I had been made aware by my doctor of having a ""fatty liver."" I was also feeling sad and stuck and like I was missing out on all the wonderful things in my life such as my lovely wife and our young child, my job, my friends, my hobbies. All of them once took the backseat to my addiction to alcohol. 

The journey was not easy, especially in the beginning. I cried all the time. I hungered for alcohol as if it were food and I was starving! I urinated constantly. I couldn't sleep without pain and sweating profusely. I was hungry for sugar all the time. I latched onto exercise as a means of coping with this since exercise was the only time I got free from thinking about how miserable I felt and how sad I was. 

But that time and those feelings eventually gave way to a realization of the benefits to my health, my relationships, my work, and pretty much everything else in my life. That was when I came to know that it had all been worth it. 

I must now keep in mind that every day, addiction follows me and will leap at any opportunity to seduce me back into its strangling grip, clever boa constrictor that it is. I must remain vigilant and strong at all times and never fool myself into believing that I have beaten this my addiction, for my addiction will never die until I die!

Like many of you, I have had a lot of brain fog and general cognition issues while I climb out of my latest hole.
  
I was recommended by a medical friend to take vitamin D since the weather here has been so dreary and my work from home job really reduces my ability to get healthy doses of sunlight. It has definitely helped with my energy levels and increasing my stamina throughout the end of the day.

For clearing out the cognitive cobwebs, I started taking B1 supplements 1x per day and have seen almost *immediate* results in how fresh and alert I feel. 
  
There is a [direct link](https://adf.org.au/insights/alcohol-related-thiamine-deficiency/) to Thiamine (B1) deficiency from reduced vitamin absorption from alcohol-induced inflammation of the stomach and digestive tract. This can lead to cognitive decline and opens up the risk of alcohol induced brain damage.
  
Anyways, I figured I would share this with you all as I continue to explore better ways to heal. This really has helped me for the past 10 days or so, and since the effect has been sustained I felt ready to share with the community.

I've managed to get through nights 1 and 2, with little sleep and a hard case of phantom itches last night (never knew that was a withdrawal symptom!). Mostly, I felt bored waiting for bed, and wanted to relax with some drinks.

Then this morning I'm shoveling my and my neighbor's sidewalk, because I know the wife is in the hospital. Her daughter comes out, thanks me, and begins clearing her dad's car. When she's finished, she tells me her mom had a massive cardiac arrest - and that she was an alcoholic for many years. She said their relationship was rocky; there were many things left unsaid.

The family is honoring her wish to be an organ donor, so she'll remain on life support until Saturday.

This woman was in her 50's, maybe 10 years older than me, and her addiction killed her. If I keep drinking, this will be me. Dead way too early, with daughters who resent my choices in life and my lack of willpower. Similar to my uncle, the town drunk, who died on the streets.

An old coworker's invited some people out to happy hour on President's Day, since we're all off work. I told him today I really shouldn't, I'm too new to sobriety. He replied, ""but you're so much fun when you drink!"" He knows I'm struggling, because he does too. But what kind of support is that?!

Don’t give up if you were sober for a month, a year or even longer and later in you broke that streak, next time might be the one that never stops, the one that breaks you free from your cage. 

I just thought I’d share my thoughts, lately I’ve been feeling down, the Pandemic and Lockdowns were really hard on my plans and mental Health, but it should be fine still.

In the past, I would have probably turned to alcohol or something else to not face my problems even if I had been sober for a while. 

But now I think Sobriety is most useful when you are feeling down, when you are having a hard time, because facing these periods sober means you might just end up understanding yourself better and changing for the better. Ignoring them and shutting them up with Alcohol won’t make them go away.

I realized that I have been saying (to myself, and on here) that it’s my longest stint since 2011, but that isn’t the case. My husband stopped for 6 months in 2011 and I stopped to support him. Or so I said. I even believed that. 

Last night we were talking and he reminded me that I didn’t stop. I just didn’t drink in front of him. I work in the wine industry, I have forever, and back then I was also (yes, I know I need to switch industries, I’m working on it I promise, not easy in a pandemic). I never had a full drink during those six months, but pretty much every day during those months I had to taste wine (anywhere from 5-30 different wines per day). A couple times a week, I would choose one and drink the sample (an ounce, sometimes 2 oz). Before he quit, I still chose one or two to swallow but had always spit everything else. Before he quit, i also always had a glass of wine before leaving work, and then beer/wine/cocktails when I got home (with him). In those six months he stopped, I just omitted all of the standard-sized drinks, but I was still consuming probably 6 oz of wine per week. 

I’m not here to beat myself up about it; I just think it’s funny/scary that I told myself I “didn’t drink for six months”. Not true. I had six months of consuming very little. Big difference. 

Seemingly unrelated but maybe not, I almost drank last night. I had a bottle of wine open from the workday. I normally drop open bottles off at restaurants for them to cook with or offer to guests or for the staff to drink, but I forgot to yesterday in the heat of a stupid work emergency before our office closed for the day. There is non stop stress in our household at the moment, my husband is an extremely anxious person and is home alone all day (furloughed from work), so when I get home I get 100% of the brunt of the anxiety. I didn’t even have my coat off and I was barraged with our tax problems, his joblessness and no bites on his resume, his dentistry needs (very serious, but he won’t go because of COVID), our savings running on fumes, the whole gamut. I was sitting in my chair with my fists balled up so tight that I have fingernail indentations in my palms today—and I barely have fingernails. All I could think about was drinking. I didn’t though. I just had some cold water and fantasized about the day I can afford therapy. And a massage.

I‘m not thinking about my parents divorce or my dad’s suicide “attempt”. I‘m not thinking about my breakup with my 5-year boyfriend last year, or that he date-raped me in order to get me to agree to a threesome with the girl from his work. I’m not thinking about that terrible fucking fire that destroyed the community center that housed me this summer while I was traveling which I blame myself for. 

So I’ve had some trauma in my life, but I’m not thinking about my trauma when I decide to drink. Everyone always says “drinking away the pain” but I don’t think that’s what drives me to drink, because I already don’t let myself think about that stuff. Everyone who knows that I have an alcohol addiction is very sweet and gentle with me and says “oh, well, you’ve been through so much lately.” But I’m not “drinking to forget,” at least I don’t think so. I avoid my trauma, with or without alcohol. 

Everyone always says to figure out the **reason** you’re drinking, and solve that problem. But I don’t even know why I drink (small amounts all throughout the day, every day, equaling to a pretty large total amount at the end of the day). Best I can figure is social anxiety. I want to always be fun and bubbly, and entertaining everyone, someone who people enjoy being around. And when I don’t drink, I’m very quiet and reserved. Plus, now, I’ve been drinking all-day-every-day for so long that I feel horrible going without for a few hours. Really bad anxiety (bodily-focused: my heart’s beating too fast, I’m killing myself drinking so much, I’m having respiratory depression, what if I die in my sleep, etc) so I’ll drink more to alleviate my “symptoms.”

I’m not asking for medical advice or anything. I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest and see if anyone could relate. I don’t know.

Idk why this is the hangover that’s finally hopefully snapped me out of thinking that I can continue to live like this. Working from home has caused my drinking to become self-destructive. Over the summer of last year I’d have maybe 1 day a month that I’d drink during the day. Sadly, that number of days has increased. In the fall my grandmother passed away. I went home to visit and spent basically the entire time at my mothers house drinking bourbon. That’s pretty much just continued since then.

I’ve gone a couple of weeks here and there without drinking. Really never a conscious decision, but I just do it. However, this past weekend we had some friends over and I got pretty drunk on Saturday, rolled that into Super Bowl Sunday, got so drunk on Monday that I fell asleep during the day instead of working, Tuesday a colleague asked me on a call if I was drunk, and yesterday I drank in the morning but stopped so that I was ok for some late afternoon meetings.

I saved just enough to make sure that I’d be able to sleep last night. I’ve noticed from some recent binges that if I don’t have any that I just feel anxious and can’t sleep for a day or so. But I’ve been up since 3:30 this morning. Actually been kind of productive around the house too.

Anyway, enough of my rambling. If I don’t stop and I continue this spiral I’ll lose my job, maybe my wife and kids, maybe my life. No one has a clue about how much I drink. I keep it hidden pretty well and usually don’t start drinking until everyone’s in bed, but my wife’s noticed a few times how fast I’ll kill a bottle of liquor. I picked up a 750ml bottle of bourbon on Monday and it’s gone already.

TLDR at end.)","I am the oldest of three, and all of us started early with drugs and alcohol. My sister and I share a passion for uppers and liquor, my brother and father more just for liquor. Well, my brother did it first, about five years ago. He got his 2nd DUI, got tired of his shit, and made drastic changes for drastic results. I had a little more fucking off left in me after he left and started his career, so when that happened me and my sister broke wide open and fucked right off, and my father hadn’t even realized he had a problem yet. We all thought perpetual inebriation was the norm, except my younger brother. Then, two years and two weeks ago, my daughter was born. Three days before her birth was my last drink, my last hit off the pipe, my last concentrated effort to make life harder. I went to jail for a year, got out, and moved across the country. Found a job quickly(thank god), got back in my daughters life, and generally just keep trying to build a normal life from the ashes of addiction. Then, 56 days ago, my dad got out after doing two weeks for his 2nd DUI, and gave up and agreed to do 90/90 with me, if I would do it too. Well, meetings are already a pretty big part of my life, so I committed to that pretty fast lol. Next thing I know, holy shit, I have my dad back! We have each other! I can call and he will answer with thoughtful answers to whatever topic is at hand at any given time. I know my brother is glad as well. My brother and I have careers, and now my dad’s small business is finally doing ok. But my little sister is still out there somewhere on the East side, living in squalor, selling weed out of a dive apartment, and has no apparent no desire for a better life. When I ask her what her plans are, she tells me I’m coming across as condescending and to mind my own business, and no she doesn’t want my help, she is a grown woman and is free to live how she sees fit, and just because brother and dad and I are “doing the sober thing” doesn’t mean she has to. She tells me she doesn’t get drunk anymore, just a twelve pack a day. Which, to be fair, is an improvement (I guess?). I mean, at least she hasn’t been arrested lately, and from what I can tell the drugs are mostly out of the picture, and I really don’t want to seem judgey, I honestly just want my sis to get to experience the good life that I know she is capable of. I offered to pay off her DMV fees and buy her a car, and fix her tooth. What I want in return is her to use her license to get a job, hopefully one with insurance so she can take care of her own tooth next time one needs worked on, and so she can be there for her child. She told me just because she’s poor doesn’t make me better than her, and to take my money and my car and stop trying to raise her kid. I hated that I made her think I feel that I am “better” than her. I truly don’t feel that way, I just want to help and I can afford to do so. I didn’t mean to be condescending, but I was admittedly intentionally firm, like sister, hello, selling weed in the projects is not the pinnacle of life, there are so many things to experience, exotic foods to eat, site to see, life to live! Last we spoke, I told her my door is open and she know my number, she told me she’s happy where she’s at and doesn’t intend to do anything differently. What have you guys done, who have been through same or similar? I find it so easy to talk about to others, and I (seem?) to successfully communicate pretty well in the meetings, so why is it so hard with my own flesh and blood?

No one every really talked about it but lately due to drama in the family my dad opened up about the amount of drug abuse and alcoholism that has always been on both sides of the family. I used to be a smoker but around 14yo I had a therapist who refused to treat me if I would continue smoking weed, so I stopped. After that I replaced it with alcohol, I drink almost every day and always used to say I was not addicted because I could also quit smoking right?... I’ve been with a new therapist for a year now and yesterday we talked about my alcohol use. I use it to either feel something (I get numb from PTSS) or to numb my intense feelings (i’m HSP). She told me it would be a good idea to start an addiction therapy. I was shocked she said that but it has been downing on me I really have a problem, it has been making my depression and anxiety worse on the long term. I feel like such a failure because I’m doing the same thing my mom does (I always hated her alcohol abuse). And I’m only 21... Don’t really know what to do now, everyone in this sub always inspires me but I am so scared to stop because when I stop for a few days I always get so anxious, non stop panic attacks, hating life even more.

Was away with friends the actual day of it. This is what I did on the day:

- Woke up at 5am and snuck out of the house where we were staying to do a webinar- did a Live Tony Robbins event- called New Year/New You, but as I live in Australia it was on super early

- Saw a gorgeous sunrise

- Did a 5km Park Run and got close to my best time ever

- Spent the rest of the day at the beach with family and friends 

I am sure that I could do most of the above if I was still drinking- but highly likely it would have just been the beach and none of the other things- which were all awesome!!! 

And the best part is that I was truely present for myself, my family and friends.

I have also just started doing the Morning Miracle which is great and also signed up for a UPW event with Tony Robbins- which I am super excited about!!!

Been going through a super hard time at work lately and as a result life has been super tricky as of late- but I have not drunk and will not drink, as I know that it will get much, much worse.

I am so grateful that I found this sub as it has really helped me during my journey and I will keep coming back here as I know this journey is not over and will never be- but I am OK with that.

Just doesn´t make sense, I´m hungover all Saturday normally have a few beers on Saturday too but not too bad, Sunday I´m OK and that´s the weekend over, what a waste. But it´s just really tough, Fridays around 6pm! Just crave a few cold ones!

Any advice?,"Stopped drinking last thanksgiving because of flare ups of allergies or something. In my late 30s now. Over the past 15 years or so I would occasionally have red flush, or labored breathing, lots of congestion, or joint pains when drinking, so I’d take ibuprofens, inhaler, Benedryl, or combinations of all three. The past couple years these flare ups were still minor annoyances but got to be pretty regular, like every time I’d have a few drinks, so I’d be sure to have these meds on hand whenever going out. But then the intensity got higher too, maybe because I might have had COVID early in 2020, but the breathing issues were getting so uncomfortable that I wanted them to stop forever. It was very surprising to me how effective this allergy (or whatever it is), has been for me to totally stop drinking. 

I mean ive always loved hard drinking even though logically, Ive accepted that my life would be better and easier when I keep that in check. But I’ve never been good at curbing cravings - no matter how bad a recent bender, blackout, puke, missed meetings or meetups, etc., - until now. so these flare ups definitely have a silver lining for my health, stability, and well being!

But Now that I’m sober I find myself with a very short fuse, particularly with my wife and kids. I’m realizing that alcohol, at this stage in my life, was definitely a crutch to help me get by and deaden some of my volatility cause I guess I’ve had this short fuse all along. I mean during COVID before thanksgiving, if my kids were a handful on any given morning, or at whenever time during the day or evening, I would sometimes have a couple shots to take my mind off the trouble and ease my tension. Make the next hour easier. Now without the alcohol, I just need a little help to keep my head, where a drink would’ve helped (in the short term). I’m truly happy to no longer feel dependent on alcohol to get by and the cravings for alcohol are under control - but I’m still struggling with the root of those alcohol issues: to find peace of mind and the strength to handle demanding situations without losing control of myself.

Many, many, many years ago I happened upon a quote that I have never forgotten.  Some of you may remember Bazooka Joe bubble gum (not sure if they still make it and I am likely showing my age right now) but this bubble gum was a rock hard, nasty piece of sugar but it was wrapped in a Bazooka Joe comic and at the bottom of the comic was a “fortune”.  One time my “fortune” said **“There’s a humorous side to every situation; the challenge is to find it.”**  Side note: come to find out, I “think” George Carlin actually said this quote but I didn’t know that until I Googled it fairly recently so in my mind, Bazooka Joe said it.

Anyway, now I know many, if not all of you, are like, what the hell Aly…how can you find humor in something like alcoholism??  What’s so funny about ruining your mental and physical health with poison??  How can you laugh at being so sick some days with a hangover that you can’t even get out of bed??  Well, those are all valid points but hear me out…  What this quote means to *ME* is even in the most dire of times, when things seem to be spiraling out of control, if you can find one little thing - once a day - that makes you smile or laugh, perhaps you can string together a few days of things that make you smile or laugh and start down a trajectory of feeling just a little bit better than you did the day before.

So, I ask you, my fine friends, what is something small (even teeny-tiny) that makes you smile or laugh?  For me, [it’s my dog](https://imgur.com/a/YMi9A0u).  I swear she was a human in a previous life, and she has a personality like no other! I mean, look at how stinkin’ cute she is!! This is her just chillin' on the couch, hahahaha!  I love her to death, and she constantly makes me smile.

Who was I fooling? lol I was drinking five 1.5L bottles a week. I finally decided to try quitting or maybe drastically reduce how much I drink because I was so sick of feeling like shit and then I started having difficulty breathing. First I thought it was bc maybe I developed GERD from drinking so much, then I thought it was high blood pressure. But I'm ultimately doing this for my health- mental and physical. I am able to go a few days without drinking but after a few days I think I can reward myself so going so long and then I go on a week long bender.

The meds are making the detox manageable but I want to cry at all times and all I want to do is have a drink.

I was the best man in his wedding and we have been through a lot together but things have changed.  

Tonight I mentioned I was watching lord of the rings and he started giving me shit about liking Star Wars more. I’m not really a huge star wars fan but regardless I just let it go. Then he says “I changed your name to hobbit since your not drinking anymore I can’t call you Lahey.” 

For those of you who don’t know Jim Lahey is the alcoholic trailer park supervisor on trailer park boys. It really kinda upset me that someone would program that name in their phone but let alone keep it. 

It just kinda rubbed me the wrong way. I also have been with friends who find out I quit drinking and make jokes about me not having balls or that rehab is for quitters. I have said all these things when I am talking to someone who is hungover and doing the “oh I’m never drinking again” moments but I just get sick of it. 

The worst part is the people who really push for it in the beginning act like after you have x amount of days sober you can have y amount of drinks. It doesn’t work like that. At all. 

My aunt who knows I have a problem constantly invites my wife and I out to bars with the excuse “oh they have food and you can drive!” I know she means well and doesn’t want to leave us out when they invite my other siblings but I would rather her just not invite us. Last weekend I fought urges almost every day from this because my alcoholic brain still only remembers the happy times. It remembers the times I threw a 180 in darts or won those games of pool. It doesn’t remember the nights where I came home got in a fight and was so sick I laid in bed for the whole day only to have to drink jack Daniels to feel normal and get ready for the next night. 

I have distanced myself from most of the people who I associated with and were enablers but it makes it so much harder when you have to tell close family like “hey enough Is enough you can’t treat me the same as when i had the problem. I work every day to not have that problem.” 

On the flip side of the coin though this week I was told by my mother in law father in law and my boss that there has been a noticeable change in my attitude and outlook in the last few months. So I’ll chalk that up as a win. This was more of a vent but I feel like our culture has mad it acceptable to make fun of people for quitting drinking because it’s always in tv as the punch line. Like Jim lahey.  I’m snowed in right now and today while I was cleaning out my fridge because it was full and a bunch of food that needed to be pitched found 8 mini bottles of wine and a 12 pack of beer. It was all random kinds some ipas some stouts and other beers without even thinking I just tossed them all in the garbage. I wanted the space in the fridge.

Its the beginning of a four day weekend for me, so I could get absolutely destroyed and still recover 100% by Monday if I wanted to. And boy has work been terrible lately. I went out to grab dinner and started circling liquor stores in my car like a shark that smelled blood in the water. Just driving around in circles with a war going on inside my heart and mind.

All of my desires were to get absolutely pissed, and all of my rational thought knew what a bad idea that was.  Eventually, my desire won the first battle, and I did go in and buy a bottle of wine from the little liquor store down the street from my house.  


I came home and just put that bottle on the table and stared at it. I wanted to drink it so fucking bad, but knew that it was the worst decision I could possibly make. My girlfriend came downstairs and saw the state of affairs, and asked how she could help. I just said that I didn't know and that I wanted to drink that whole bottle right now but at the same time I didn't want to. I told her I didn't know what I was going to do. She asked me if I wanted her to take it away from me, and I said that I didn't know.  


I went so far as to pour myself a glass, and gave it a long sniff. It smelled great. It smelled like forgetting about all my stress and problems for a few hours. I also was aware of the fact that it would introduce a whole new set of problems the likes of which paled in comparison with my work stresses. 


I stopped to consider why I would want to do something so self destructive. The same answer came back as always, ""fuck it."" But for some reason this whole time I was much more introspective than I ever have been before on the brink of a relapse. Honestly, I think because I wanted to learn something that I could share with you guys if I was about to make a really bad decision. At the very least I wanted to help someone else with my terrible choices.


So I questioned myself, ""Fuck what?"" 


""Fuck this life,"" came the answer. ""Fuck having to consciously suffer through another day of it."" 


I think I realized for the first time that my drinking wasn't just escapism and hedonism. That much was clear from the start. But it also represented a slow and cowardly unconscious suicide attempt. Because, being real with myself, every time I open a bottle there is a chance that it will send me down a well traveled downward spiral that ends with me perishing. It's a game of Russian roulette. 


The thing is that I don't want to kill myself, and the realization that I was about to make an attempt snapped me out of it. 


**So I poured the whole bottle down the drain**


The entire evening was an almost out of body experience. Something about this commitment to be of service to you guys allowed me to be more of a battlefield observer than a soldier in the fight. It let me sit up high enough that I could see what was happening. All because I felt a responsibility to learn something that was worth sharing here. I think if I didn't catch that extra perspective, if I didn't push myself to really explain why I was doing what I was doing, I would be at the bottom of a bottle right now. Instead I'm writing this post sober, and eating a bowl of ice cream. So thankful.

Feeling grateful is a skill we can develop. This is an opportunity for us to practice*.

\--This week’s post comes from one of SD’s very own, a dear friend, a confidante, my crying shoulder. I’m grateful for them. I would also like to share a quote from the film Ad Astra that really resonates with me. The movie uses space exploration as a metaphor for examining themes of trauma, loss, grief and ultimately acceptance, forgiveness, and a kind of gratitude. 

“He could only see what was not there, and missed what was right in front of him.”

Take care and be well. And enjoy this lovely share.-- 

The Dinosaurs

The first time one of them spoke to me, I was raging. Furious about some nit-picking criticism from a work collaborator and searching for any excuse to buy a bottle. I’d made a ranting post on the sub and they responded. 

They raised the options of either changing or accepting my situation, which was not really what I, in my indignant self-righteousness, wanted to hear. But I was also quite taken aback. Genuinely surprised that someone who knew what they were doing, and had clearly been doing it so determinedly, for so long, would take a little time to gently push me to thoughtful consideration and show me some concern.

The second and third ones I met in the SD chat room; one who I thought came across a bit too ‘god-bothery’ for me at first, and the other swathed in dry humor and self-deprecation. And yet they shared the same essential qualities – they were quietly supportive and non-judgmental. I started to listen now and then to what they said about their own experiences, to pay attention to their attitudes, their clarity in putting their sobriety front and center every day, and appreciating that. I don’t agree with lots that they said, but I benefited massively from their experience and picked up a few nuggets and kept them for myself.

And then I started to deliberately look for more. I took note of their habits, the way they pushed themselves towards seeking a grateful attitude, the tiny glimmers of positivity in their lives even when things were shit, they were sick, had big problems, financial worries. I saw some daily at the DCI, some in the chat room, others regularly popping up on newbie posts, and now and then congratulating each other on immense milestones. I attended a face-to-face secular sobriety group when the pandemic rules allowed, and joined the odd Dharma Recovery online meeting when I needed some calming support. I saw them everywhere and that all of them gave back as often as they could, always inspiring just by their presence, quietly demonstrating a little daily practice of gratitude in reality.

Who am I talking about? The Dinosaurs. Those who have been working their sobriety for years, for decades.

And the more I observed, the more I started to change how I thought about them, for myself. As I began stacking my little sobriety wall, hour by hour, day by day, then week by week, and fuck me! month by month, I understood more clearly that their longevity that had so amazed and impressed me initially, was still a work in progress exactly like my own. Which led me to wondering how many of us at the start of our sobriety escapades, just automatically assume that The Dinosaurs must have it all sewn up and no longer need the encouragement and support to keep going. That we think because they’ve been doing it for a sustained length of time, they can handle it and it’s ‘in the bag’. 

The longer I stay sober, the more confident I am that for myself and anyone with alcohol abuse problems, it is never ‘ in the bag’. It will never be totally resolved, a 100% sure thing. My determination can stay as strong as The Dinosaurs; I’ll continue to collect my sober tools, my emergency measures in depression, my acts of self-care against the debilitating inner critic, my small attempts at service, and the more I gain, the better armed I am for this war. But the evolution of my sober self can never stop. Stagnation opens the door to complacency, every time. 

I’m grateful for The Dinosaurs showing this latecomer to the sober party, that it’s possible. And how to really work gratitude, for the long term. Thank you.",51,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.48386407}"

My reason for posting this here is because for the first time in a long time, I found myself very strongly wanting to just numb myself to not feel. I recognized this urge for what it was immediately and never entertained the thought of actually drinking, but I sure felt it.

I’m nearly 3 years sober and I never really think of drinking anymore. I know that alcohol will take everything from me if I ever start again. Yet here I am...having this subconscious reaction where this primal part of my brain STILL thinks it wants alcohol to cope with pain.

Drinking would complicate this so much. It would make me less in control of my emotions. It would make me less capable of doing the things I need to do. It would make me less capable of truly appreciating the remaining time I have. It would numb me, which ironically is exactly what this lizard part of my brain thinks it wants.

Life is often painful. However, through that pain we have the ability to truly appreciate the good moments in life. We have the ability to appreciate the gifts that are bestowed upon us. We have the ability to appreciate this very limited time we and those we love, have on this earth.

Alcohol will take away my pain temporarily, but it will subsequently take my joy as well. In the end, I would only be left with a hole much more vast than it was ever going to be otherwise.

If you read all this, thank you. If you’re struggling, please don’t drink to numb your pain. I know from experience that it does not take it away permanently.

I am grateful for my ability to experience this difficult time sober. I know that I will ultimately come out on the other side stronger.

Ever since I went to University I've let my drinking get a bit out of control. It's not that I drank often, it's just that when I did (once or twice a month), I would totally overdo it. I'd become a different person and basically blackout, only to be told the next day the stupid/cringeworthy, and sometimes downright rude things I'd done.

With the current pandemic I've been isolating with family, and I've never really felt comfortable drinking around family (I wonder why...see above), and as such I haven't drunk in nearly a year.

I'm hoping that I have the strength not to drink when things turn back to normal. I just don't want to create more moments that I think back on and hate myself for. I still feel awkward telling people I don't drink now when they invite me for virtual parties etc.

I am at 19 days and just finished reading *This Naked Mind*, which I heard about on this sub. One of the last parts of the book asks the reader to share their story. I’ve been reading here since I've stopped, and it feels like the right place to put this. Other times that I've wondered if I should quit, I felt like I didn't see myself in the stories I heard of other people who decided to quit drinking. Reading here has helped some with and I hope this may contribute to that for someone else. 

I never drank before college. I’d moved to a smaller state school a few hours from home and immediately hit it off with the guys that lived on the same floor; primarily because we were all looking for the college “party lifestyle”. One member of the group was older than us and was dating an older girl at our school. We took full advantage of the fact that she was of age to buy us beer. Flush with financial aid money and a source, we had supplies to get drunk as often as we wanted. Even now, I look back on those days really fondly, but I realize now this was the start of my dependence on alcohol. 

I was eager to prove myself to this new group of friends and to shake feelings of inferiority I was carrying. The reality of high school for me was really good grades, a loving family, plenty of friends, a girlfriend, being a class officer, and getting into my first choice college. But, in my head, I was insecure about being a scrawny virgin with braces.

Now at college, braces free, I started exercising and partying hard trying to fix the other two “problems”. I met someone right away but blew it when I forgot to call her for two weeks while drinking and getting high. I then proceeded into a streak of hookups with girls I wasn’t attracted to, driven by desperation and alcohol-lowered inhibitions, still too anxious to go all-the-way. Now the heel of “beer goggles” jokes and still a virgin, my insecurities remain and have been joined by a substance abuse issue. Though my confidence bounced back and plenty of fun was had, I spent the next 2 years in a similar place with alcohol. 

Junior year, I was lucky enough to meet my now wife. I was absolutely wasted at a friend’s house party (of course). By sheer chance, I didn’t make a fool out of myself with her, though I certainly did to other people that night. We fell for each other quickly and spent a ton of time together. Mostly at my place or out at our favorite bars, my favorite places to drink. If you were wondering...I lost my virginity to her (which she’s still very proud of). I was drunk at the time (which I'm not proud of).

Over the next few years, I grew up a lot. We graduated, moved places and jobs, got married, then settled down close to home. I built a solid career, despite showing up to work hungover now and then, and our daughter was born summer 2019. I was drinking less but the pattern held the same. Drink a few almost every night, occasionally have too many, and then regularly binge on weekends or “special occasions”. 

Sometimes I knew I was drinking too much and would commit to cutting back. It often worked, and I’d stop drinking on weeknights or take a few weeks off. But I'd always come back to the same pattern; slowly and unknowingly increasing until it led to a binge. I’d feel disgusting and stupid, weak-willed and undisciplined. I’d promise to myself I’d do better at moderating, then the cycle would start over. 

Honestly, the last binge 19 days ago wasn’t different from the others. It was a night away with my brother watching sports. I’d built the whole thing up in my head and was looking forward to getting drunk.  I don’t know how much I drank but by the time we had dinner ready I couldn’t eat. Passed out. Missed the end of the fight. Woke up the next day and drove home nauseous. Got back to my family who missed me and was barely able to get through the night, just wanting to go to bed. 

The realization hit that I’d wasted one of the only social opportunities I’d had in months, with my brother who I missed terribly, because of alcohol. I was excited to get home, but couldn’t be present because of alcohol. Whatever that shift was, it allowed me to see the many times that pattern had played out. I can remember alcohol ruining a holiday with family, a trip into the city to see a friend, visiting my grandparents, a professional networking event, a baseball game, or camping. Those are all just in the last couple of years and certainly not a complete list. 

I’m done letting it happen. I’m done drinking. Before, part of me was hesitant to read a book or join a group or even try to stop drinking. I thought those things were only for “alcoholics” or people who hit “rock bottom” and I didn’t believe that was me. *This Naked Mind* and this sub have helped me realize the label isn't important and shouldn’t wait for my problems to get worse before deciding to fix them. I hope maybe this story resonates with someone and will help you to make the right decision for yourself too.

I started this because I knew I was drinking too much, that it was impacting my mental health, and I really wanted to prove to myself that I didn't need alcohol. My initial goal was to not drink any alcohol for the month of February, but I feel like I can go further than that if I can set the right habits and thinking in place. 

At first I worried about things like Valentines day and the Superbowl...and now it's crazy to think that my mindset was that I couldn't possibly let a holiday or big event go by without binge drinking. The Superbowl came and went and I definitely did not miss the beer, in fact, I feel like I enjoyed it more without drinking.  I painfully reflected on the time where I got too drunk at a Superbowl party and completely embarrassed myself in front of friends. 

Ive found that when I really crave alcohol is at night when I'm bored, anxious, and/or stressed. And having a nonalcoholic beer is a good solution for me. They don't taste like shite (which is what I was always led to believe). I feel like I liked the ritual of drinking something - it's comforting. It's nice to have something that tastes like a beer, and that I can have as a 'treat', but isn't going to make me wakeup already angry/disappointed in myself. 

What I'm most worried about moving forward is sharing my choice and my progress with my family/friends. Drinking was a big part of my social life, and I don't want to feel judged or be viewed as 'lame' for giving up alcohol. I just have a feeling that my friends aren't going to react in the best way. I don't want other people to ever feel like I'm judging them or come off as pretentious. I'm also worried that February will end and I'll start justifying my terrible drinking habits again, and end up right back where I started.

I knew I wasn't going to drink (or even feel pressured to drink) going in, so that wasn't a big deal at all. My date didn't bring up the fact that I ordered a pomegranate tea while she had a couple of beers. It got cold (outside seating) so we decided to move near a fire pit where there were a couple of ladies sitting and chatting. We all got engaged in conversation and one of them asked about my not drinking. Told her I quit in July '20 because I didn't like the role alcohol had taken in my life, that I was using it as an unhealthy coping mechanism, and that I've literally never felt better. It opened up a whole conversation about sobriety, sober-curious culture, dabbling in other substances, etc. I guess I was very pleased with how much of a non issue it was. Nobody cared - in fact, they were all super supportive and one of them said I looked great and had a ""really positive energy about me and clarity in my eyes.""

It made me less afraid of failing. It made me forget how emotionally exhausted I am and made me forget how exhausted I am with myself. I forgot how to face a day without alcohol. I don't WANT to face a day without alcohol. I want to sleep until I'm able to drink again. But I can't, and I won't. I just don't know how to make a life for myself. This feels like pulling teeth.

I really didn’t expect it from one of my oldest friends, who knows how important this is to me. But when I think about it, we were always drinking buddies. She would always call me drunk at night, and I (also drunk) would answer. We would make each other feel better for all the terrible decisions we made due to alcohol. 

I was disappointed when she seemed to write off my hard work and dedication to a “not drinking thing,” but I have to remember that’s she’s battling her own demons, maybe without realizing it yet She just seemed pretty bored while we were hanging out, booze-free. I’m pretty sad to think that perhaps our friendship will never be the same, as I plan to stick with this “thing” for the rest of my life. I’m not angry with her, and I don’t get preachy about it. I just didn’t want to face that this might be part of my journey - people not taking me seriously, and friendships based on booze fading away - friendships that I thought would last a lifetime. I wanted her to be excited for me, for absolutely transforming my life and feeling stronger and more confident then I have in YEARS. But she changed the subject to her Super Bowl drinking game and how hungover she was, and we moved on. 

Overall I feel selfish for thinking this way. It’s not all about me and I don’t expect the people who know to be throwing me parties every day.

I grew up with a chronic alcoholic father. He was off and on in rehab my whole life and just relapsed this past summer. He'll be 68 this summer...not sure how many he has left in the tank. Due to that I've dealt with my own struggles. Binge drinking, black outs etc. pretty much from a young teen till now in my 30's. I'm back with a therapist to help sort the anxiety, mild depression, and childhood trauma from growing up with one. Heavy alcohol puts these through the roof for me mentally and it's just not worth it. This board has also helped a lot as just a reminder to know a lot of people are working on themselves for a better and clearer life.  


I've really started to notice that my close friends (2 friends I've known since grade school & my college roommate) really remind me of my father at times. We all are great friends, brothers in a sense at least that's how I feel about them. We of course all over did it when we were younger and had great times. But now being older, married, a job, wanting kids, my father struggled with his own demons, and I know where it can end up if you don't stop. But I don't know if I'm just thinking more clearly or what but they really are starting to remind me of him. I don't know if it's being sober around them or what. It's the mannerisms, the bloodshot eyes when sober, the body language, mood changes, uneasiness and fidgety when sober, their speech when they start getting intoxicated, a sense of not stopping until the lights are out, activities always have to involve drinking, and there's either you don't drink or drink till you're blacked out. I'm seeing similarities in my close friends that I saw in my father. Granted if I saw myself hammered or video or something it probably would remind me of him too. I just notice when I'm with them or even a phone call of huh that sounds like something Dad would say. I just seem to be noticing it more? 

They get uneasy when I say I'm cutting back or don't want to go all night etc and it's always a big issue or fuss which is expected I get it. I just don't know why I'm noticing it so much this time around. Anyone else encounter this or have similar experiences? Therapist suggests cutting ties and seeing which were true friends. Life always revolved around drinking with them so I understand. Even when I was younger I kind of knew and predetermined that the friendships would eventually dissolve if it continued cause I lived with one...

Over the past year I’ve been telling myself little lies about alcohol... 

“I work hard, I deserve to unwind a bit”
“I can stop at any time”
“I have complete control over myself”
“I’m not like other people... they have a problem... I don’t”
“Just one more day... I’ll stop tomorrow”
“I’m going through a rough patch and need it”

Days turned to weeks and weeks turned to months... It was a rapid downward spiral

Even though i put myself in danger numerous times while drinking I still couldn’t admit that I had a problem... but I do... and I want to change it.

So, I told my son (13) yesterday morning that I had a problem with alcohol and it’s funny how this one little step and saying the phrase “I will not drink with you today” over and over again In my head kept me from drinking the whole day. I even took a trip to the grocery store and didn’t buy a bottle of wine to secretly drink in my room (or maybe even on my way home). 

I know I have a long way to go taking it one moment, minute, hour and day at a time. I know I will have days that are harder than others. I know it will effect my current friendships and relationships. I also know that it is going to be good for me and my family in the long run and it will be worth it. I know that I am worth it!

I am going to keep trying this routine and continue to drink one less beer every 3 days until I'm down to zero. It feels good being up early today and I feel like I'm ready to have a productive day!

I have some childhood trauma stuff that surfaced as a young adult, and to be honest it kind of ripped away my sense of self. I have been a heavy drinker from the start, before this all happened. But this was something different. Anyway, it dawned on me in the more recent past that I feel connected to myself again. I can traverse back and connect the dots. That is a good thing. But it also has made me hyper aware of how much time and life I wasted with it all.

So how do I handle this? I could say ""why try at this point?"" and just keep on drinking to the very end. But that one makes me sad as all can be, it would be like completely giving up. Or I can work on acceptance and various forms of forgiveness, both towards others and myself, and start rebuilding certain things from today. That one feels a heck of a lot better.

I know I have my work cut out for me, and there is a lot of sadness when I think about some of this. But this life is very real, and I don't want to keep living it in a wasted cycle of binging and withdrawing, slowly killing myself, and honestly being pretty miserable. I have been drunk (well, wasted really) once these last couple of months. Even with sober requiring me to face myself, this is much better. I know I need to make the right choices to keep at it, and things are better this way. That said, addiction is tricky, but I am aware of that and know I need to stay aware of that.

And it's so weird looking at my habits and rituals - almost all of which include booze.  I stopped drinking for a week on Jan. 30th.  And since then I have had 2 ""drinking sessions"".  Both of which I approached as experiments.  Asking myself - why do I like this?  What do I feel when I'm doing this?  And then the next day - How do I feel?  Was it worth the side effects?  10 sober days out of 12 is an 83% success rate.  I would have normally had some booze 10 out of those 12 days.

Hi, so back in the summer 2018, I turned 18 years old (legal age in the UK) and the World Cup was taking place up until around October of 2018, it was a pretty boozy time alongside Freshers at university. I'm sure that I just managed to get out of the boozy months naturally, with university work, being out and in the open every day and just the general hustle and bustle of commuting and having a part time job

In comes 2020, the UK is in lockdown and after my assignments had finished in May and being downsized from my part time job, I didn't have a lot to do and drinking was/is one of the few things a lot of people could do, and with sheer boredom, those months became boozy. However, with online school and no part time job anymore, I had to mentally get out of this boozy stage. During 2018, I had developed a system if you will to pace myself when I was drinking so I could limit myself and if I know that I'm going to have a little bit too much that I could be enjoyably merry and not full on sloppy

If this helps at least one person then I'm happy

**For if you're in the house and you want a drink without wolfing it down:** Find a task you like doing/something you like to do and time your sips alongside to what you're doing. If you're watching tv, have a sip when an advert break or if you're watching Netflix then have a little bit of it before/after an episode. If you're doing this, having a pretend ""arrive in the pub"" time and ""leaving the pub time"" also helps me, like 10:30pm arrive and 12am closing

**For if you think/know you're going to have a little bit too much:** You ever played a game where if you run out of energy you have to wait for the bar to refill over a certain period of time, and to 100%, emulate that. From the first sip of a drink, put a ""refill time"" on your next drink, I'd usually do 30 to 45 minutes, this means whether or not you down the drink or pace yourself, you'll still have to wait for the ""refill bar"" to fill up, and have a glass of water and pretend it's a task you have to do to get the refill bar from 99% to 100%

This is what I do when I had to mentally cut out a very boozy stage

That ALWAYS involved hanging out in the parking lot, drinking a beer while we get ready, have a shooter on the lift, beer at the restaurant halfway down the mountain and repeat. 

Needless to say, I was always falling and coming home with way more bruises than I needed to and would swear off the sport for another month claiming faulty equipment or bad weather. 

Yesterday I went snowboarding by myself and did not consume one drop of alcohol! I had a great time, was able to marvel at the beauty on the lift instead of focusing how many shots from the flask I could get. I was able to actually be conscious of how different parts of my body move my board differently. I did not even fall one time! I am sore and tired today but NOT hungover and bruised, we got 5 inches of powder overnight and I think I might just go out again today!!

The booze aged me. It was making me sick. Coupled with quarantine I've gained weight rapidly and have been suffering with poor digestive health. I could feel my organs swelling. 

Last Tuesday night I tucked my girlfriend into bed and settled in for a night of gaming. I drank the remaining few beers in the fridge and the better part of a bottle of wine. Of course that wasn't enough so  I opened up a nice bottle of red my GF had bought for us to share with a nice meal. I drank it all. She asked me the next morning if I'd drank it. I sheepishly admitted to it and decided I'd had enough.

I've been anxious for as long as I can remember but it ramped up to full blown regular panic attacks in college and drinking seemed to be the answer. I wasn't much of a drinker prior but when I started to notice how much drinking would calm me down, I loved it (spoiler alert, it's not a real solution). College is an easy time to have questionable drinking habits without anyone particularly noticing or caring. I always drank socially and was almost never the messy friend but I definitely a ton and often. After college I cut back. I got a corporate job and only drank a glass or two of wine with dinner maybe once or twice a month. That era was relatively calm and as life calmed down, so did the drinking. Then I ended up in a horrible relationship and started drinking a ton to cope with it. Once that was over, the drinking subsided again for the most part. To make a long story short, my alcohol use has followed that same pattern for years and I think it's time to just quit altogether. Fortunately, I know I'm not chemically dependent on alcohol at all but it has been a mental crutch for me so that's the habit I'm going to have to break while I form healthier coping skills.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4379127}"

I can and will sit here and feel these things, let myself feel them, and then move on. I'm not going to relapse to prove her worst fears right. I'm not going to drink to put these feelings of shame and disgust and self-loathing on mute, to then have to deal with them tenfold tomorrow. 

I have been struggling the last couple of weeks, not with a desire to drink per se, but just general lockdown/winter/depression blues. I have been tempted to drink to forget just how incredibly shit life is at the moment. My mum's been struggling too, she suffers from a lot of anxiety, which my past behaviours and current world circumstances have only exacerbated. I understand exactly why she feels that I'm ""due"" to relapse, and I understand that I can't do any more to prove that I'm not going to. That trust will only come with time and repeated improvements. It's shit to be reminded of the hurt that I have caused, but I absolutely needed this reminder of why I have been trying to get sober for the past 4 years. And this is by far my most stable sober streak. Today I feel wretched, tomorrow I may feel differently, but I'm going to feel it all sober. 

Mantras aren't usually my thing, but I saw this one yesterday and it resonates: I am whole even when I feel broken.

After a couple of months of being sober n not posting.
I caved again last night n drank 2 beers (quartz 750mLx2).  I can't lie to my wife so she finds out after i told her i don't drink anymore.
I really don't plan on going back to drinking, i didn't when i drank those 2 also, as stupid as it sounds.  In my mind, i just wanted to drink mt last beer since we recently came from a alcohol ban of 3 months.  

I'm having difficulty controling my cravings after a couple of months.  I've bought two books on alcohol but i haven't read them bcos i felt that i'm alright now and that's where the thoughts of moderation starts to creep in.  This has been my downfall for the last few times and this is what i need to work on now.  Also reaching out to others who has conquered this hurdle of recovery.

I've tried AA but somehow it just makes me wanna drink right after the meeting.  I've parted ways with all friends and family who didn't respect my recovery.  

Not looking for anything specific just wanted to share my journey I've been on now for about 6 years.  I can say that in the last few years I've drank maybe 60% less than what i did in the past.  It's progress but I've had enough n wanna be completely sober.  

Things I've realise causes major triggers for me to drink:
- watching football or any other sport.  The alcohol commercials during the matches and during break is just too much.  Literally 95% of those commercials are alcohol related 
- music, certain kinds of music makes me wanna drink.  I know it when i hear it n I'm confronted with the decision to change.  I've moved to l2 talk radio, podcasts and learning a new language through cds whilst driving.  
- old friends and some family members who has nothing to talk about but drinking n partying.
- boredom

Today i am frustrated n again feeling disappointed but i stand up yet again.  Ready to fight with new learned knowledge and acknowledging my short comings.

You can!,"I hope this post will encourage some people out there that think they can never stop drinking. I'm  34M. Drinking since mid teens. Heavy drinking for around 10 years. Very heavy drinking for the last 2 years (well over 100 units a week). 

Got to a stage where I stopped drinking with friends, it was pointless, I would make an idiot out of myself, wouldnt remember anything and i would wake up on my brothers sofa covered in piss. You would think this would stop me? Well it did after a long time. I then decided to just drink alone. I would go to some social events (i never wanted to but felt obligated). I would take the car. I was fine not drinking because i knew that on the way home i would go to the shop and buy a bottle of vodka sit in front of the tv and drink the lot. 

Many time I tried to stop all together. I would have 1 night off and could not bare to have the second one sober. In 10 years i cannot remember having more than one episode with more than 2 nights off.

I have suffered since i was a teen with ulcerative colitis. Recently it has been worse than ever. Shitting blood and mucus 15 times a day. Dehydrated  and feeling dreadful. I was living either on the toilet or in bed.

Silver lining with this. I was so bad I could not drink alcohol because it exacerbates the colitis. It did not stop the cravings though. 

What I found was after 3 days without alcohol, the urge (was still there) had exponentially plummeted.  

I have been sober for 9 days and every day is getting easier. For me it took an illness to get me through the first 3 days.

All I am saying is, however impossible this will feel for you,  get past the first few days. These will be the hardest of the whole journey. I am on day 9 and I now see how people can do such long milestones. 

Colitis is still affecting me but i wake up in the mornings feeling so glad that I didn't drink.

My senior year of high school we each got a page in the yearbook to post pictures, quotes and memories of the past four years.  One of the quotes I included on my page was **“What seems to be the end may only be a new beginning.”**  At that time, of course I was referring to the end of high school and the beginning of a whole new world in college (cue start-up of binge drinking, by the way).  But today I think of that quote differently.  What seems to be the end \[of my drinking\] was only a new beginning \[a life of happiness\].  Who knew that #1, I’d remember that quote from so many years ago and #2, how true it would ring in my life today!!  

Right before I quit, I could not fathom getting through ONE DAY without wine.  I was literally praying for the strength to just get through one stinking day without alcohol…ONE, that’s it!!  I felt like I was on a carousel and was too afraid to jump off, so I just kept going around and around and around…  Finally, and I don’t what it was (perhaps the prayers), but something inside me clicked and gave me the courage and strength I needed to jump off the ride and make it through that ONE day.  *That one day would be my end…and the next day would be my new beginning…*  The beginning of a life where sleep is restful, thoughts are clear, eyes have color, skin has a glow, and anxiety, while still there, is much more manageable.  And who knows what other new beginnings lie around the corner... I can't wait to find out!!  

So, I ask you, my fine friends, what did YOUR new sober BEGINNING bring to your life??

I quit smoking poppers back in 2016 and that's when the drinking really picked up. For the last 12 months, I quit smoking weed altogether and that has resulted in me completely depending on alcohol to fall asleep. I don't crave it during the days, my withdrawal symptoms are mild, and even in the evening I don't get physical urges. i pick up the bottle knowing that without it, i can't sleep.

So I thought it was a bright idea to shut my brain up for awhile and drink, so i can finally un-tense my shoulders and not grind my teeth in my sleep. Did it help? Absolutely not. Today I was throwing up all day, had to not go to classes, have a horrible headache, and I would have been 1 month on Valentine’s Day. I am writing this so next time I can read this and hopefully never ever pick up a drink again.

The thing is, these memes are harmful because they perpetuate the narrative that mommy needs alcohol to get through motherhood.

For that struggling mom who has been drinking more than normal due to the stress of motherhood, she uses those memes and her friends/society as justification that there's nothing wrong with her drinking behavior.  The thought of, ""If everyone else is doing it, then I must be fine.""

Yes, alcohol gives you the quick fix you're looking for, but that's all it is. Temporary relief until that buzz goes away. Then your back to being in the same situation you were in or sometimes worse. 

Nothing ever gets better from drinking. Nothing. Our problems are still there. The overwhelm is still there. The kids are still there. And who knows, you may have added MORE issues to the mix by saying or doing things that you regret. And the anxiety the next day can be so crippling that you reach for the bottle again to get relief from that. And that is how you start the cycle of addiction. 

I was there. Using alcohol as my relief from the overwhelm, stress, and racing thoughts.  It gave me comfort until it didn't anymore. I wish someone told me that alcohol wasn't the solution. The solution wasn't at the bottle of the bottle. 

The solution was to use healthy coping mechanisms like calling a friend, going to therapy, having a cup of hot tea, taking a nap, hiring a sitter to watch my son while I could do something just for me, and reassurance that this mom thing is hard. No matter what you see. No mom has it all together all the time.

-	Dark chocolate! I used to love wine. If I ever get a hankering, I break off a square of dark chocolate and enjoy it. I now have an arsenal of chocolate bars.
-	Kombucha - energizing, bitter, invigorating. Great substitute for alcohol, especially when you have a craving or you’re looking for a drink to have while others may be drinking around you
-	Mocktails - I really like making tonic-based drinks with lots of lime and maybe a mint leaf. Feels special, and sophisticated. Gives me a similar sensation and flavor profile as a cocktail but I feel in control. Also great for subbing in social environments

**Activity**

-	Exercise - cardio, floor exercises, etc. I run almost every day, and do a 10 minute ab/back routine. It is crazy how much results start to accelerate when you cut out booze. This is my go to for stress relief after a hard day.
-	Binge watching TV - tons of great TV/movies to stream out there to take your mind off things. I’m simultaneously watching Expanse and re-watching 30 Rock right now (both on Prime). Use the app JustWatch to compile all your show options based on your subscriptions
-	Video game - Personally, diving into an immersive game...whether that’s sports or an open world RPG, is super enticing and a great way to fight boredom or depression from sobriety
-	Meditation - simple breathing exercises, such as 5 second inhale, 5 second hold, 5 second exhale...can be like medicine. Immediately quiets your mind and makes you listen to yourself. Check the app Insight Timer for tons of guided meditation tracks...it’s awesome

**Mind Games**

-	Write a list of all the pros of your sobriety (health, finances, relationships). Be specific. Reference this list when you are at a low point. You will immediately feel better.
-	Write a letter to yourself, telling yourself how proud you are for making this decision and the things you hope to achieve through sobriety. Keep it in a secure and accessible location. When you have temptations, re-read this letter. You will not want to let yourself down. It can be incredibly touching to revisit written materials like this further along your journey

I’m guessing over a decade of almost daily drinking takes longer to fully detox than I had anticipated. Has anyone else had this experience?",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.65570956}"

I started on here, maybe 7 years ago lurking.  I tried to cut back and moderate my drinking.  I tried only drinking on Weekends.  I tried to only have ""x"" number of drinks per day, stop drinking at ""x""o'clock.  I tired everything, like lot of you on here.  This is not my first throwaway username...

But it is (hopefully my last).  I tried so many times and was demoralized more times than I could count.  And then it stuck.

I quit on 2/9/16.  I started by only committing through Lent (Ash Wed through Easter - I'm not religious but hey).  It was hard, but once Easter came I decided to push it out until Memorial Day, and then 4th of July and so on and so on. 

I guess the reason I want to have a word with you is to let you know to never give up.  Quitting wasn't easy for me.  A lot of the Anxieties I had self medicated for decades came storming into the forefront of my life when I got sober.  I gained weight and was basically scared, ashamed and ripping with insecurities.  I got a lot of help from this sub and went to therapy for the first time in my life.  Things got so bad that I had to take Leave from my job/career.  I was lost.

But things eventually (slowly) got better.  I started meditating.  I was making breakthroughs in therapy, confronting things from early childhood that I had never talked about.  I persevered.

So I guess what I'm saying is that, despite a lot of people on here who quit and they immediately lost weight and their lives suddenly became EASY, a lot of us experienced a very different path to sobriety.  A hard path filled with regret, doubts, guilt and shame.  Please stay the course.  Stay on here.  Go to AA, therapy or whatever real life group you need to stay on track.  Alcohol is less a physical problem than it is a Psychological problem, treat it that way.

And never give up.  Each failure is a speedbump on the highway and you never know when you are going to hit open road.

Stay on target, we can do this.

I think its time that I join the conversation because I am quickly realizing that drinking is ruining my life. 

I am 34, and have an absolutely amazing fiancé. We love each other unconditionally. We both have great jobs. We are set to buy our second condo. Our dog is an angel. We love to cook, to workout, to try new things, to watch movies. We have so, so, so much going for us. I say this with no intentions to brag, but rater to illustrate that we basically have no real reason to drink like we do. Neither had the ideal childhood but we have caring families and dont fit the prototype of what many may think an alcoholic is. Yet, we are both clearly alcoholics.

We have both been blackout drunks since our teen years. Yet, somehow, someway, have managed to maintain employment stability and generally avoid the big issues that can bring someone to sobriety (Car accidents, cheating, arrests, etc). This has made it easier to rationalize the drinking. We dont overdrink when its just us, at least its very rare. But we have been 'party people' since High School (Chose this over a potential college basketball career at a young age, ugh). All our relationships outside our own are based on drinking. We have always been so proud that, once the weekend hits we have 3-4 groups of friends all waiting to get hammered with us. It was that release after a week of being 'normal', a word that we have both been horribly terrified of for a long time. 

Well, as always is the case the slope kept increasing downward and for the past year we have been completely out of control when drinking. I am talking 'black out at 2AM and come to at 1PM drinking vodka straight and shoveling cocaine into your nose' out of control. I am talking 'leave your dog home alone for 20 hours as you both pass out on a friends couch' out of control. It has been hell, but somehow we keep doing it. 

Recently we took 28 days off drinking and it was tremendously easy. We truly began to enjoy the little things. Walks to get coffee, yoga and the gym in the same day!, watching movies together, TONS of cooking. It was all going so well. Then we went to Vegas, we had tickets prior to taking a break from drinking. And, surprisingly, it went well. We drank, but maintained control and really were proud of ourselves. 

Then the past weekend came around and we got back to 'party drinking' with our friends on Saturday. Total disaster. Didnt sleep, dont remember anything on Sunday. Passed out and missed the freaking Super Bowl. We are now so, so depressed. Anxious. Self hating. Its amazing how a week ago can seem so far away, that baseline that we had of happiness and clear headed appreciation of the activities we can fill our lives in when sober. 

I believe that we allow outside influences to really affect us, illustrated in how we can drink in moderation when its just the two of us but once were around the party we just lose all control. Like a dream state that kicks in after only a few drinks. I have no idea how this works, why or if I am just rationalizing and am abusive with alcohol in any situation. But I know to fully cut this poisonous 'party drinking' out of my life, I need to cut out the substance all together. Its so hard to accept not drinking when there are situations that I trust myself in, but the potential consequences of slipping up and going back to 'the scene' are just too high. I dont drink due to stress, I dont drink due to unhappiness, I dont drink due to anxiety. I just love to get absolutely hammered. My brain is not wired like a normal drinker, and I know this but keep circling back. I cant even remember the last time I had fun going out to party. Its like a horrible, destructive job / habit at this point. 

Sorry for the ramblings. I just feel so guilty. I have so much going for me. I am so happy when sober. I made it nearly a month without any real urges. But I get scared to be missing out, to lose these friends that I share nothing but a drinking connection with. Well, I am ready to lose them. And I hope they can come around sometime soon because the more I think about it, its clear the 'scene' is just a bunch of unhappy people disassociating together using drugs and alcahol. 

I know the potential I have to be happy, I see it every time I take time off drinking. I see it when I get to spend quality time with the woman I love. And I know that if we dont make sobriety work, at some point the house of cards will fully fall down.

I can't even begin to explain how much I believe that YOU can do it too! I was a daily drinker, I drank to avoid my anxiety and panic. All that mattered was knowing that I could get home and drink. Nobody really knew what was going on, and where I'm from (college town in Wisconsin) it's pretty much impossible to avoid. It became exhausting, waking up EVERY day so ashamed of myself because I knew I shouldn't be doing this. I couldn't stop. I would read posts on here about people getting sober and I just didn't believe I had the strength in me to do it.  

I decided to go in to see a doctor about my problems. They started me on some SSRI's and really told me that I should stop drinking. They all believed in me. Even during the doctor appointment I was biting my tongue because I knew I would still go home and drink soon. But I didn't. And I'm so glad I haven't. 

Back then, not drinking for one night was almost impossible. If I was visiting family or something, I would make sure to throw a 6 pack in my backpack so I could fall asleep with a buzz. I truly saw no way out of this cycle I put myself in. 

3 months later, not everything is perfect. I still have cravings, I still have panic and anxiety, etc. But I've finally stopped going to alcohol to self medicate. 

Seriously, you can do it. One step at a time. One day at a time. Don't beat yourself up. You might mess up, and that's okay. Remember your goal, remember what you want to get sober for. I believe in you. And I want you to believe in yourself.

It was the first time we “hung out” (over Zoom) since I quit drinking on New Years. We’re both recently single women in our 30s. We were talking about getting back into the dating scene, and I said I wasn’t going to date anyone in 2021, as I want to focus on myself. She made the comment in my subject line. “It’s gonna be really hard for you to find someone, between not drinking and not wanting kids,” as she chugged her giant glass of wine. What was the point of saying that? All it did was make me feel bad about myself. I responded by saying I’ve already been married, and am content to be single for the next ten years if need be. There’s gotta be a guy out there that doesn’t drink, doesn’t want kids, and likes cats...right?

She’s made other comments that make me feel crappy, and I kind of want to drop her as a friend (my therapist seems to think I should). For example, I told her I was thinking about getting braces on my bottom teeth, but was worried about how it might look. She said “I’d rather have braces than jacked up teeth!” I was instantly embarrassed and self conscious. But maybe I’m just over sensitive?

She also has a problematic relationship with alcohol, and drinks almost as much as I did (a bottle of wine several nights a week, getting blackout drunk when going out on weekends). She even told me recently that she likes drinking in the morning before a workout. I’ve tried to get her to do the Alcohol Experiment with me and she was somewhat interested in This Naked Mind, but ultimately she always has a reason why she can’t abstain from alcohol for 30 days (friends are visiting, it’s someone’s birthday, etc). 

She’s one of my only friends. I’ve realized the few friends I do have are heavy drinkers. None have been supportive of my new lifestyle, or have even asked me how it’s going. They’ve all had the same general response when I told them I was quitting. Something like, “I would never want to be sober lolol”

I’m currently around halfway through the first month of my sobriety, but I’m coming to a sad realization that I hope is just my own issues. 

Maybe I’ve just hit a weird part of the sobriety process, but I find myself feeling alienated and at odds with a specific loved one.

Has this happened to anyone? I want to take blame, but without the excuse of my drinking, I’m having a hard time doing so. Have I been just excusing them because of my own addiction?

It’s not something I want to do forever but it’s great to use these when my brain is healing and recalibrating from my alcohol abuse. It’s literally only been 2 days but it’s helping already. I want to stay the course and get to maybe a year a sobriety and then get off these meds. Thankfully she put on ones that aren’t addictive (no benzos) and she said pretty much everyone will guilt these cold turkey and not have an symptoms.

I’ve been a social drinker for ever. Many times it was just at my house with girlfriends chatting and consuming multiple bottles of wine. An excessive amount...yes, but it felt harmless. And then I opened a restaurant and the drinking went to a whole new level. Tequila. Martinis. Manhattans. Upwards of 7-10 a night. Plus shots. I really let it consume me...I was drinking because it was fun and I was enjoying myself and my customers… I was also drinking because financially my business is struggling and I was avoiding dealing with it. Come March 2020 Covid shut me down and I financially did not have the means to re-open. Everybody in my life and my employees and my family blamed the loss of my restaurant on me being an alcoholic. I sobered up for 30 days and then when I did start drinking again I felt it was under control. There were a lot of poor choices made, driving when I shouldn’t have, drunk texting which is entirely demeaning to myself and just lots of blackouts... nothing of which I’m proud of. But I always felt I could reel it back in. I was just a social drinker I did not wake and start drinking in the morning.  It was really just with friends but some days would be like 10:30 AM and my instinct was to meet my friends for lunch and start drinking. It was fun. I was fun. Until Sunday night when I got my second DUI in less than 10 years. Over the past nine months I have been unable to find a job. I had a very good professional background.  I need to make a certain amount of money to support myself and my kids not to mention the crippling debt from the restaurant. My husband filed for divorce almost 2 years ago and now here I am about to lose my license for an extended amount of time, probably spend a week in jail still have no job and no means to support my family. I just made my life a whole lot more challenging. As I look back over the years I realize than any time I’ve really had made poor choices or struggled with some thing like you know I’m not going to my first choice college or dropping out of college or my first DUI my relationship with my husband and my motivation to lose weight and be healthy… They’ve all been related to alcohol. At 42 years old it’s really hard for me to comprehend what I can do to turn my life around and get back on track but I know I can do it. I’m committing to a year of sobriety at least and I hope that within that time I can manifest a reality they’ve always expected and felt worthy of. I don’t really have anybody to talk to you about it with.  My friends all drink even though they absolutely support me, but I don’t have somebody to be on this journey with so I guess that’s why I’m here. I feel like I need to document it somehow...not just for me to continuously remind me of why I made this  choice and see how far I can go...but to motivate and encourage others as well...  I have faith that I can do the work and achieve everything that I want but I also know I’m going to have low moments where I’ll be in the 3D and have a hard time seeing past the obstacles. I’m meant for more than this and I’m hoping to find a tribe that has been there done that!",4,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43213}"

2021-02-09 09:01:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lg3wvi/can_i_go_to_aa/,Can I go to AA?,"Hi folks! It's a bit of a long one so please bear with me...  


I gave up drinking over 2.5 years ago (1000 days next week!) I was living in another country when I decided to stop drinking as it was in this place I felt my drinking really got out of hand. It was hard deciding to quit there as I was deep into the expat lifestyle of drink, drink, drink, but I had been questioning my relationship with alcohol for some years and so I made the decision to quit. 

The first two years of my new found sober life were enjoyable and flew by but I had the wildest cravings last spring/summer and really began to question my decisions and choices.  I understood, for the first time, that this battle is going to take a bit more work and that I couldn't put my feet up and sail off into the sober sunset just yet. It was a real wake up call. The place where I lived had no AA or support groups as such so it was really hard to find a community of like minded individuals. Every friend I had ever made was only interested in drinking so it was very lonely at times. 

Anyways, I recently moved back to my home country to be closer to my family. Before I left here the first time, partying, drinking and drug taking had been a huge part of my life. Although I have no desire whatsoever to live that lifestyle again, I can't say some slight cravings aren't creeping in. I'm thinking about the future and possible moderation and I'm forgetting why I started this whole journey in the first place. I'm telling myself I over-reacted in my decision to quit drinking, I can drink normally now...etc, etc. All the usual bollocks we tell ourselves. 

This time however, I really want to address these feelings and cravings and not just push them down and convince myself I'll be OK because I'm almost three years sober. I don't want to be ruled by my cravings and desires and just white knuckle it through the whole of the summer (the weather is a massive trigger for me). It's like once these thoughts start up it's all I can think about and I don't think I should be in this position after almost three years. It feels like I'm regressing almost.  


On the bright side, being back in the UK gives me many more opportunities to do a lot more work on myself in terms of addressing the reasons I drank and how to develop some better strategies for coping with cravings. It also gives me many more opportunities to meet sober people and find new friends with similar interests to mine. I'm excited and ready to jump in to my life back here.

My question is would AA be suitable for somebody in my position? I have been sober for a decent stretch of time already. I know I would benefit greatly from a sober community but is AA the place to find that? I don't feel like an 'alcoholic' in the classic sense of the word, meaning I only really had a problem with binge drinking and weekend long benders ( I know this could still be classed as alcoholism). I'm just not sure if AA would be suitable and I don't want to come across as flippant and risk offending people there.  Also I read about closed and open meetings . Which one should I attend if I do decide to go? I found a local meeting on Thursdays and it's still operating face to face. I think I want to try it this week but I'm hesitant, nervous and scared.  


Sorry for the essay. Any help or suggestions you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated  


Thank you for reading. I hope you are all keeping healthy and safe in these crazy times!

A milestone in which the past 6 years of my life, was not even remotely possible. I've been dealing with a state of ""blah"" as I like to call it. There's probably a medical term for it (anhedonia?). It's a weird cycle. All in the matter of one second, I go from ""I'm depressed and bored, nothing is fun, let's have a drink to have fun."" to ""If you drink, tomorrow you'll feel like shit."" then ""Oh yeah, true. Then I guess I won't drink."" ... And then I end up sitting in my chair indecisive on what to do with my time. 

I don't think I'll ever drink again, that's the good part. The bad part is, I need to relearn how to have fun doing things I've enjoyed my whole life. Also maybe finding new things to get into while we are still in a global pandemic. 

I feel so plan and annoyed. It's not miserable, it's just not fun. (first world issue, I know.) No one really spoke about this in the stuff I looked at. The books I read, the youtube vids I watched. It's a bland, stale existence that just is...I don't know what else to day about it. I know it's temporary...but HOW temporary. lol.

I just can't drink anymore. Alcohol just ain't it, ya'll, it don't hit the same anymore. It's a bummer, but I'm good to go on that shit. I can't bother to waste my time or energy, and above all it will kill me. I'd gain the weight back, I'd go back to being tired all the time and having life shattering panic attacks. I just can't. 

After a while, you know that drinking just ain't it. So...now you just have to deal, relearn, and establish a new life. One day at a time, but I really need to get into something that will add some fire to my life again. This stale ass experience isn't cute.

I am new to r/stopdrinking but I am in need of a community to help me. I never had too many friends, none that were worth a damn anyway. Just people who drank with me, and provoked me into drinking more, and more, and more. I am 21 years old, but my health has been declining fast, and I believe alcohol may be the culprit. I can drink 17-20 drinks and most people, meeting me for the first time would think I am sober. I never throw up from drinking, no matter how much I indulge. However, when I am drunk my decision making is terrible. I also believe that it could be why my health is so bad. I can go a couple days without drinking, but eventually the cycle repeats itself and I am back to poisoning my body. I have dense, terrible brain fog every day and I have been living with gut problems for two years. There is always a tightness in my abdomen, below my ribs on both my left and right side. I am lethargic, insecure and self loathing and feel like I’m 35-40 instead of 21. I am at the point to where I don’t even bother trying to meet women because I consider myself too unhealthy to get into a relationship or even care about hooking up. However, as soon as I am drunk, everything changes. All of a sudden, I am a super confident guy without a care in the world, my gut problems go away and I can talk to girls and not give a damn what I say. I always seem to text girls so flawlessly and confidently and they are very receptive to my advances. I will even go out of my way and call a girl that I haven’t talked to for months and get into a long conversation with her and I can totally tell she’s digging me. The problem? I could never have the confidence or the peace of mind to do any of that sober. I would stumble over my words, and I would feel awkward and not know what to say. For example, the other night I talked to this girl on my Snapchat for 40 minutes who I was not close with, but when I asked her to “hang out tomorrow at my place” over the phone, she instantly said yes and even gave me more days during the week she was free. I talked her up and sealed the deal with my artificial confidence and carefree demeanor while drunk. The next day, I woke up dreading her coming over and realizing I am not the man I was the previous night while drunk. I had anxiety the whole day, pondering in my head how awkward I would be that night when I pick her up at her house. I was hungover, felt like shit and my brain fog and gut problems were at an all time high. A few hours before I was supposed to pick her up, I caved and decided to get back into my confident headspace. I drove to the store, picked up some alcohol and started sending seltzers down the hatch. Now, she ended up canceling for whatever reason so I just continued to drink 7-10 more seltzer’s alone in my room that night, where I swiped on tinder for a long time - an app I never use when I’m sober. I feel like I need alcohol to impress girls, and I need alcohol to be myself and be happy. Literally the only time I will actively talk to girls is when I am drunk. Another example is my previous ex who fell in love with the drunk me. I was drunk every time I was with her in order to be confident and be the best version of myself. I spent most of my time with her while intoxicated. Once she moved in with me, she started to realize that I was not the man she thought I was. She said I changed. She started to realize I had a problem, that I wasn’t taking care of my health and that I was a very depressed guy. She wasn’t having any of that. She eventually left me. I was impressed that I could put up a facade of who I really was by pretending to be somebody I’m not through alcohol for the entire span of our relationship, about 3 months. 
I know I am killing myself. I feel it every day. I try to tell myself that maybe I have a gluten or dairy intolerance which is causing my gut problems and brain fog to justify my drinking, but I know that if I’m not doing absolutely everything in my power to heal, I never will. I don’t know if alcohol started my gut problems, but it probably did. My mind is deteriorating, my vision is getting worse and I really do need to quit, for an extended period of time at least until I have regained my health. I am hoping that if I do, my body and mind will heal and the best case scenario is my gut problems will heal, my brain fog will dissipate and I will once again have my confidence back without needing alcohol to feel it. Honestly, I don’t remember what it was like to have a healthy gut and feel energetic and happy. I am beginning to realize that alcohol is most likely the cause of most of my problems. I am in dire need of a support system. I am around alcohol all the time. My family drinks every night, and so do my friends. I feel like a slave. Is alcohol really the culprit for all of my insomnia, gut problems, brain fog, and energy issues? For the longest time, and even sometimes now I get intense anxiety like I might have cancer or some other terrible illness. For my sake, I really do hope it’s just alcohol causing these problems and not something more sinister. If any of you can share any experiences you have had or, if you have a similar experience with my symptoms it would be reassuring to know that I’m not dying of a terminal illness, at least. I think I can finally admit to myself that alcohol is ruining my life, but it doesn’t feel like that when there’s an unopened bottle sitting in front of me. Alcohol completed destroyed my brother. He is as fucked up from alcohol abuse as they come - he even drove my mom’s Cadillac off of a pier into the ocean when he was drunk in the dead of winter. Almost died but by miracle made it out of the car as it was sinking. Water was up to his neck, had hypothermia. I don’t know where else to turn, so here I am on Reddit.

I think I had some sort of unrealistic expectation at first that all facets of my life would instantly start improving. That wasn’t the case for me. My anxiety got worse. I struggled financially (I was furloughed for a few months last year). My sleep was all over the place. There are so many more examples that I won’t even get into. All that being said, I’m starting to see improvements in the ways in which I’m taking care of myself. In the past eight months, I’ve resumed therapy, found a new med doc (my old one was throwing Ativan at all of my problems), diagnosed and started treating my sleep apnea, started cooking for myself and started exercising. I still have good days and bad days but the good days are really good (and I can remember them) and the bad days are much more manageable.

Happy Tuesday my sober peeps!  I’d like to interrupt our regularly scheduled program for a special announcement.  Someone who is a friend to many here on SD and a bright light in a sometimes-dreary place is celebrating a great milestone today.  I personally feel compelled to call out this person as he has been a HUGE influence on my sobriety so far, and I am not exaggerating when I say I don’t know if I would have made it this long without this person.  I don’t even have the words to express how thankful I am to him.  He was one of the first people to reach out to me when I was a day or two sober and I immediately felt his warmth, compassion, positivity, and guidance.  He suggested I put my name on the list to host.  He would message me just to see how I was doing/feeling. But best of all, he quickly became a friend.

u/ReplacementsStink is celebrating a year of sobriety today!!  What a huge accomplishment and a great inspiration!  Please join me in congratulating Stink on this momentous milestone!  I love you, buddy, and my PIC!!

Okay, enough sappiness!!  Let’s talk about milestones, shall we??  

My pal Confucius, the Chinese philosopher said **""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.""** That sounds a lot to me like ""One day at a time"". As we work on becoming sober or maintaining our sobriety, breaking down this long, and often difficult journey into manageable baby steps is key.  You don't start training for a marathon by running 20 miles the first day.  No, you start by putting on your damn running shoes!  You don't start a new craft of knitting by throwing together a whole blanket on day one.  No, you start with one hook, or pearl, or whatever it's called (I'm not a knitter, clearly). You don't realistically start a life of sobriety by saying ""I'm never drinking again!"" No, you start by saying ""I am not drinking today!"" That one milestone of ""today"" really starts to eventually add up. 

So, I ask you, my fine friends, what are some milestones you have in your sights as you continue along your sober journey?  It doesn’t have to be days/weeks/months/YEAR(S) sober.  Maybe you are training for something big like a race, maybe you are learning a new craft, maybe you’re like me and trying to shed a few (okay, many) pounds now that calories from a bottle(s) aren’t settling in your gut. Hell, maybe you’re just trying to get out of bed and shower on a daily basis!  Whatever it might be, I wish you nothing but continued success in reaching all your milestones.

I drank pretty much every day since the age of 16 (56 now) and never really thought about quitting with any seriousness until I discovered a 30 day on line challenge. Annie Grace's The Naked Truth---her query was ""Why not just try quitting for 30 days and see what it feels like"". My thought---sure why not and if I DON'T feel any better then I just start drinking again really what have I got to lose? Well here I am...still not drinking and life is better? yes...easier? sometimes but not always because life is hard and not having booze to numb the shitty parts sometimes really sucks but it DOES GET EASIER and the pay off is truly great. For me the pay offs include 1. SLEEPING I swear AA should have billboards that say give up drinking and you will have orgasmic sleep 2. Losing weight without changing anything but booze consumption. When I visited my chiropractor 3 months in she told me my entire body shape had changed 3. Color. Booze drained the color from my life--it made everything sort of washed out and grey and I didn't even notice until my life started to have color again---really bright neon colours. 4.Less Anger. I asked my husband if he could name one thing that was different about me since I quit drinking and he said you aren't angry anymore---well praise Jesus. He's right about that. I'm not angry. I""m grateful. (btw he still drinks  less these days but he has not quit---I had to decide it was MY JOURNEY not his)  5. Curiosity.

I come from a culture where beer is treated like water. When I tried going to AA meetings a few years ago I mentioned it to my mom, and she said ""I don't really think you need to be around those people."" 

When I had my first 24oz beer to myself in my hotel room in Paris at age 18, I fell in love with drinking alone, and it made me pass out and spill it on the bed. When I first got properly drunk with people in college, I felt amazing, and took a second beer to hold near me even though I hadn't finished my first, in case they ran out, and my friend commented on it and laughed at me. I kept 24oz beers under my bed when I lived with my parents and learned to open them quietly, and throw them out secretly. There was always beer in my parents' fridge, and they always let me get one, and I would drink it with them as we watched a movie, then go to bed and drink more. I would buy beer and chug it in the library bathroom stall at college because of social anxiety.

Now I'm 28 and I've been drinking 2-4 drinks nearly every single night basically since I turned 21. My blood pressure is high. I'm angry all the time and gaining weight. I'm not making the art I want to make. 

This week, my partner got covid and we're in separate bedrooms. I've been alone, drinking and playing video games and watching porn until 2 AM instead of making dinner for him.

I'm writing this because I myself STILL don't think my drinking is that bad. Deep down, I still think I'm just unwinding after work, and it's okay since I'm not drinking fifths of vodka. I guess I'm white knuckling it, but I don't believe in a higher power. I just don't want to look back at my life a year from now and be in this same place, even though it's ""not that bad.""

Before I quit I was always afraid that booze was what made the world fun. A beer after a long run, wine with dinner, cocktails after work, binging for days in Vegas...

Turns out I was wrong. Ditching booze meant I didn't have to deal with all the shit which comes with drinking - monitoring my behavior and consumption when I need to pretend (and fail) to be lucid, wake up the next morning trying to piece together the night before, and of course hangovers. God I don't miss hangovers.

And I've still had great experiences! I've done great restaurants, traveled, a bachelor party in Vegas, finished marathons. All enhanced by being sober and present, actually living the experiences, and waking up without a hangover. (Sure COVID put a stop to a lot of that, but the 700 days leading up to it - 12/10 would do again). 

And no hangovers. Did I mention hating hangovers? Cuz God I hate hangovers. That status check you do in the morning? Don't miss that. Waking up without a hangover never gets old.

First bad craving,"So far I haven’t felt an intense urge to drink. But today, I forgot my sweatshirt at home before leaving for work, got to work and a co worker said something weird. One of those things that you don’t know how to process or respond to in the moment, and as the day goes on you keep thinking about it. It just kept bothering me and I kept kicking myself for not saying this or that back to her. I couldn’t get over it. Then someone called out and it was just me and the other guy taking care of all the closing cleaning stuff. On top of that it was just a long busy shift.

I wanted to drink so bad. The thing my co worker said, plus this sudden intense, gnawing urge to get a drink caused me to take even more time to finish up at work. I just kept talking myself down, arguing back against that voice telling me that it’s been two weeks, you don’t have to get wasted, just one drink. Come on. We deserve it. It’s no big deal. I fought back. I finally told myself , not today. Maybe tomorrow. We’re not drinking today.

I finally eased up on my drive home. I felt an almost wave of relief come over me. I don’t know what it was. Maybe just being able to say no to the urge and feel good in that decision. 

I got home and had a nice chat with my mom and we laughed and vented about our days. I feel a lot better.

I bit the bullet and went to the hospital

I posted recently that I was heading into treatment, but it was just to the point where, not only could I not do it alone, but I was advised that it would be dangerous to try. I had to go the ER. I had to. 

I had to wake up early to drink something just so I could make it. At 10am I walked in with tears in my eyes. 

I saw the doctors and nurses, and they were even taken aback buy what I’ve been drinking (a liter of vodka a day for over a year.)

This hurt and yesterday was one of the toughest of my life, and even know I’m still detoxing, but what I really learned yesterday is how many people will be there. If you ask for it.

(Mid February 2018.) 

Before treatment, I had accepted defeat. I was feeling truly hopeless. I had given up. It had lead to unemployment, drinking 3-5 shots within my first half hour awake each day, then getting wasted/passing out—- rinse and repeat. No real sense of time, morning evening it didn’t matter. Just wake up, get drunk, pass out and do it all again. This went on for about 9 months (before that I was employed, but drunk every night for 7ish years.)

I believe the quote above has helped me get through every day since. I know it to be true, and I bet I said that quote to myself about 300-500 times a day in treatment. Often times laying in bed trying to sleep, but my mind racing about how I will adapt and make this all work. But I’d do my best to ignore the mind racing, and just continue to tell myself “if you relapse, you will die.” We would be in the middle of a group session and the topic wasn’t grabbing me so instead I focused on how if I relapse ever, I will die.

It allowed me to look towards all the goals I would never ever get to reach if I died.
Never get married.
Never have kids.
Never have my own piece of land to run a hobby farm.
All dreams I’ve had since I was in my teens. Being a dad is by far goal number one. I POUNDED that quote into my head in treatment. And it made things very real.

Since 2018, i have met the love of my life(so grateful for this beautiful and warm woman ). I have since been employed, I have been promoted 3 friggin times already, On a salaried position with benefits, and I love my job, and am now contributing to a savings. Never did I ever think in early 2018 I would ever reach this point. I owe this ALL to not drinking. If I can do this, so can you. I have faith in every single one of you. 

Sure I will get occasional thoughts of drinking or I will find myself romanticizing drinking sometimes, but I still will remind myself “if I relapse, I will die-(truly an objective fact to me at this point)” and I got far too much life left for that. It will always be one day at a time, for the rest of my days. 

I hope this can help someone in here someway. (I know its a lot and kinda jumbled, but I wanted to let these thoughts out)

Today sucked. And I knew it would. When I bought that bottle of vodka yesterday, I told myself not to.  I knew that if I bought it I wouldn’t have a stop. I told myself you could have three drinks but of course by the end of the night I had drank half the bottle. Which may be for some people isn’t that bad but for me it’s bad.  I felt like absolute shit today at work. I am a nurse and when I went to start an IV my hands were shaking.  

I haven’t been drinking heavily for that long. Maybe for the past five years that especially heavy in the last three. Every night I would have 2 to 3 drinks. I lost my 16-year-old son to suicide in 2018. That’s when I stopped caring about whether I lived or died. So I drink so that I would feel nothing. Since the death of my son I have divorced my husband (he was not my sons father) I saw a real ugly side of him when I was having to deal with this grief.

I’m tired of feeling like shit. I’m tired of hiding the drinking. I just started dating a wonderful man who is so sweet but who does not drink. It’s actually quite nice not to have to deal with an alcoholic which my ex was. But I am so scared he’s going to discover my secret and I’m gonna lose him.

For me it was kind of a weekly cycle, often the binging centered around an extended weekend, and the withdrawals happening the start of the week.  And then repeating over and over again.

I went through a period of some years in the early 2000s where the evening after the last day of drinking, when trying to fall asleep (exhausted of course, but my nervous system totally out of whack) I would hallucinate. It would often start with a red light glowing on one of my bedroom walls. Then demonic like creatures would shoot out of my walls at me, often yelling my name. Seriously scary stuff!

Often times this was accompanied by sleep paralysis, and in researching this I came to realize I was have hypnagogic hallucinations, something not totally uncommon. They basically happen at the in-between stage between being awake and falling asleep. I have also had a couple times where I woke up with screaming in my head to the point where my ears hurt. The first time no own said anything, and the second I asked my roommate if I was being loud, and he said no. Weird stuff. The last hallucination was different than the others, and helped me decide to not ""back to back"" drink anymore, though that eventually returned, though the hallucinations did not. One theory I have is that I had some trauma issues that I think may have been more resolved at that later time.

Anyway, I think these may not be the same as DTs, but maybe they are somewhat related. I have been curious about it, though I suppose it doesn't really matter one way of the other. On a positive note, this is something I never need to experience again if I stay sober. So much more is possible sober, nor sure why I wouldn't want it.

On a side note, my dreams used to be super intense from the withdrawals. In fact, my dream world almost seemed more real and deep than real life. I think my trauma stuff was related to that. It was fascinating, but I am happy to let that all go (I can still have intense dreams, but not to that depth) in exchange for more genuine and deep real life interaction. Wow, alcohol is one heck of a beast, glad to feel like I can change in regards to it. Still plenty of work to do.

To think of how much I wasted waiting for life to change while stuck in this darn cycle. But to be honest, I didn't have the tools at the time to deal with my personal problems, and I wasn't being ""heard"" how I probably should have been when I tried to deal. So it was what it was, and today I can choose sober. And in relation to another post I just did, I can choose to change going forward.

I've never been a heavy drinker, and I'm not prone to binging, but I went from being a 1-2 nights a week social drinker a couple of years ago to 3-4 days a week, at home after work & on the weekend, and then shot up to 1 every night and 2 (or 3) on the weekend when the pandemic started - and I kept that up for 10 months. I started to think about that evening drink hours ahead of time - and even when I planned to take a night off, I usually found myself having one (or more) anyway. I'm shocked how quickly things shifted from casual social drinking to something that felt very different. And as the child of an alcoholic, that's a pretty scary feeling.

Hope it’s okay to use this space as a journal of sorts. Posting about my thoughts and hearing from others seems to be really helpful.

I’ve been thinking about the advice that people often give when others are feeling down: this too shall pass. Essentially, to weather the storm because your emotional state will always transform over time. I think that’s true.

Which led me to think about how that is also still true when you’re feeling great, but nobody reminds you of it then. I guess it sounds like you’re being a party pooper if someone is feeling on top of the world and you say “hey just remember that you’re not going to feel this great for long!”

But, I think it is really important to keep it in mind. I see myself (as well as many others) setting myself up for a big fall when I do not acknowledge that I will continue to struggle, be messy, and have bad times. Having a set back is probably the rule, not the exception.

I also see my obsession with feeling good all the time as a key component of my addiction. It is unrealistic to feel good all the time, that’s why the only way you can even get close is by chemically inducing it. And it doesn’t even work then :)",11,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45726192}"

I noticed I hit two weeks today. This was after a longer streak. I really didn't think about this much at all, at least not paying attention to the days. Sober is getting easier, assuming of course I keep with it. But it does seem to be getting easier and sober is for sure what I want.

But I am seeing more and more that sobriety is more than just not drinking. I used drinking to numb and escape. I need to deal with that stuff. On a positive note, over the past couple of years I started to get more clarity about things, I have been able to critically think better and come to my own conclusions about what I see going on around me, and within me as well. I also feel connected to myself again, cannot say that was really the case for years and years.

Part of the connecting has also included very clear realizations about how I was living and how I wasted good chunks of my life. Not looking to get into a downer here, just want to acknowledge what is true for me. I can look backwards on my own time, and partially it helps me better understand things, but I also need to make sure I don't get stuck in ""that place."" So I get that.

In regards to the present, even if I am not totally happy with my life, I have to deal with my life as it exists today, within the reality of what I have to work with. If I want to change things, I cannot do so living within the ""fantasy of how things could have been"", I need to do so within the ""reality of how things are.""

One big personal habit that coexisted with the drinking was procrastination. I was and am good at putting things off. ""I'll get to it tomorrow"" has been a common mantra. I cannot keep doing that. Things are starting to shift, but I need to pick it up a bit. I cannot keep procrastinating on dealing with my procrastination ;)

Other habits? Well, I think since I have said enough here I will just stick with the procrastination. I think that one alone covers a lot of other little ones.

I thought drinking made me better at things (like video games and talking to people) but in reality it was making me let down the people around me and making myself miserable.

For a few weeks in January I tried to cut back drinking. I thought I could just be a better drinker. I was wrong. One glass of wine after a stressful day at work turned into two bottles. I just kept having another glass, trying to reach ""happy."" I'm now on day 10 of sobriety and trying to learn to make real happiness. I've looked up online therapy and psychiatry and I'm working up the nerve to try them out. I know I have a long way to go, but I'm thankful for a community like this.

Like many folks in 2020, my relationship with alcohol changed.  I went from a casual beer drinker to 2-3 bourbons a night, with more on weekends.  Of course, I was bored.  I took up creating cocktails as a new hobby.  The bars haven't been open, but the liquor stores have been.  Sometimes I go just to pass the time and be around other people who share an interest, as potentially destructive as it may be.  

If you look at my post history, you'll see it's slightly obsessed with bourbon.  Collecting bourbon--the ""hunt""--has become a passion.  Drinking it has also become a passion.  Enter: the problem.  

After the typical holiday 'overindulgence', I started to feel like I lost a step mentally.  I seemed to be in haze.  Always tired, always flat.  Dull.  The prospect of losing my intellect really scared me, and I have a major certification exam at the end of the month, so I decided to take 30 days off starting Feb 1, and I haven't slipped.  

But the cravings have been intense.  The anxiety has been harsh, and a week into this I'm still feeling fatigued, although sleeping better.  This was the first weekend without alcohol in a long time--first in quarantine overall--and I was so very bored, but I've kept at it.  I'm filling my days with workouts, studying, and work.  I unsubscribed to all my alcohol related subreddits, and started reading this one.   
 I feel like on paper, I'm doing all the right things.  

But at this point, in my mind, after my exam on the 26th, I want to celebrate with a bourbon.  I logically understand the benefits of not drinking, and I want to be healthy, but I read about people on this subreddit where it clicked and they don't want to drink again.  Their life is better without alcohol.  I almost feel like my life is more enjoyable with it.  I've read the EasyWay, and it seems to hinge on the conviction that alcohol is poison and tastes bad.  I can't disagree that it's poison, but I like it.  I haven't found a replacement for it, and I unfortunately  I feel like I'm going thru the  healthy checklist but not having any fun.  Does that sound awful?   


So, I'm coming to this group for some insight.  I feel like I'm at an inflection point where I don't want to become dull and lifeless due to excess use, but I'm not ready to let it go completely and stay sober forever.  Anyone else struggled with this?   Thanks in advance.",45,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43119404}"

Morning internet strangers. Doing my morning routine of having a coffee and reading in here... wanted to share this one. 

I haven’t been able to remember dreams well for years (I wonder why!!? 😆) but I remember this one vividly.

I was on a beach with family friends on a holiday, and someone spiked my drink (it was my sister but that clusterfuck of a relationship is too much to unpack in here!) and next thing I knew I was drunk and drinking, and all of a sudden I realised. My first reaction in my dream was utter disappointment in myself, and the feeling was real and it was strong! 
Later in said dream we all went to go have a shower at the shower block (which randomly appeared) my sister cousin and I walked over and I did the ole ‘bags first shower’, despite there being 30 odd showers, my sister got angry, my cousin told her to chill out there were plenty of showers, then I slipped on a towel my sister put down and that my friends is when I woke up! 

The relief I had when I woke up realising it was just a dream was huge, I’ll journal about it later today and analyse it all.

Did anyone else have dreams like this at the beginning of their sober journey? I’m sure I’ll have more, and I’m looking forward to being able to remember my dreams moving forward!

I've done every drug under the sun, crystal was my fave, happily tho I quit that nonsense in 2018.

Like many of you, the endless free time from the covid situation has really allowed for my drinking to spiral out of control. I'll have a bender, be okay for a few days, then the following will happen:

1. A usual trigger (alcohol adverts are literally everywhere in Houston, you cannot travel across the city without being bombarded by these), boredom, etc This is stuff I can control more easily by staying busy and keeping the blinders up.

2. Musicians coming over to record or practice almost always bring and offer beer or whiskey. I find it exceptionally hard to refuse a free drink esp when everyone else I'm supposed to be playing and being in sync with is on that drunk level and I'm not. Mostly they're cool about it, but then some weird behavior occurs in order to accommodate me, like they'll sneak off to the car to take shots out of my presence, I appreciate what they're doing but I know what's going on and the behavior seems very cocaine-y to me (sneaking off to bathrooms etc) so it can sometimes drive me to ask for a drink from them. Which they always oblige, after the obligatory ""Are you sure?"" fake concern statement.

3. Playing shows. These are all at alcohol selling establishments. Some give you drink tickets (free drinks again...) Which sometimes I can exchange for food if the place has food. I will drink Topo Chicos (mex sparkling water to the uninitiated) all night and generally the vibe is respectful of my wishes to not drink. But some guys get wild, i.e. pouring liquor down my throat with a bat spout bottle while I'm concentrated on playing a certain part. Its a part of the act unfortunately it's why people come out to shows in the 1st place, crowd buying you shots (again, free) but stuff like that happens.

Another, non-music related trigger for me is cooking meals. Due to the fact that we need to eat everyday this one affects me the most. I cook all the meals for my house and I love to drink while doing it. Lately I have had some luck by dividing up the prep process and taking my time instead of blasting thru recipes. No wine-reduction sauces so I don't ""need to finish the rest of the bottle when all I needed was 1/4 cup"". And by selecting less intensive recipes to cook. I'd usually drink a pint of vodka starting from when I start chopping the onions until it's gone, usually not before he end of the night. Sometimes I'll stumble to the corner and get more beer after that.

If anyone has any similar experience or advice I'd greatly appreciate tips on how to stay sober despite all these triggers, in my line of work, aren't ever going away.

Playing shows has of course dramatically reduced but they are going on in my state. In response I have been booking many more clients so the studio drinking is definitely a thing, sometimes getting even more out of control due to no one ever being cut off. Recently a client got plastered and even pulled a firearm on someone, so in response I no longer allow liquor in the studio. Most everyone actually agrees as it's supposed to be a place of work first, but it's known that there's a party atmosphere to every aspect of music-making.

I think I'm done. If you made it this far, thanks for staying tuned. Better days lay ahead.",4,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48246455}"

Turns out all that time I was drinking i was shoving down bad feelings about how people treated me. Always got the shit end of the deal and just took it because I was hoping that would make people like me. 

When I quit drinking and couldn't drown my sorrows, they came back. Nothing drowned, those sorrows had gills. 

Now I'm seeing that yes I do care that I always got the worst sleeping arrangements on vacations. I care that im never consulted when making plans. I care that I've been treated as the afterthough or that what ever it is ill be fine with it so why ask.

All that shit never went away, I just got drunk and didn't care what happened to me.

That resentment came bubbling up eventually. I started getting defensive when people would treat me like that. 

This got worse when people started shitting on me for trying to improve my life. When those who I thought were my friends are against all of the positive improvements I've been making.

I was so proud of myself for completing the entirety of dry january; it was the longest I'd gone without drinking in a long time. I've tried dry january the past few years without making it more than a week or two and it always helped me ""re-set"" my drinking where I was way more cognizant about it. After January was over, I started having a single beer and then switching to NA drinks. On Friday we had a work celebration thing and I did not stop after one beer. I had a wonderful time of course but then got a ride home to my wife who was shocked that I was drunk by 6pm. She was so disappointed in me and we'd had plans for a date night that became me just going to bed at 8:30 and her spending the evening alone. 

I'm trying to compromise with myself before I call myself an actual alcoholic. I want to see if I can just enjoy ""max of one drink a day"" because I love playing with cocktails or drinking craft beer. The idea of ""I can only have one so I'm going to really savor it or get very creative with what it is"" is motivating and I think it would be sustainable. However, if I'm thinking about it this much where I need to set rules for myself, am I just fooling myself? Normal people don't have to set rules for themselves. And when I'm around my dad who is an alcoholic and I see how he is when he's blackout drunk and how he is towards my mom, I get terrified that I'm going to do the same thing to my wife someday. 

Am I kidding myself to try out the deal I've made with myself, one drink a day max, no exceptions? In talking with my wife on Saturday morning, I was so ashamed. I told her I wanted to try this but that it's a 0 strikes thing where if I fuck up and have more than 1 in a day then I don't get to drink ever again. I got through Dry January to prove to myself I could cope with stress and celebrate without alcohol and I know I can do it, I'm just wondering if I'm fooling myself right now.",9,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42482784}"

Stumbled on this site 6 days ago. That morning was my last drink. 20 year struggle that started with beer, then more beer, then whiskey, then a handle a week, then two handles. Then it became embarrassing to be seen buying that much, and my wife and kids took notice too. So I started hiding it. You know, going to different liquor stores, buying the plastic 1/5ths to hide in coat pockets, secretly throwing it out when empty and no one watching. Then finishing it down with a few more beers (the ones where you shamefully scan in store for the highest ABV b/c that's all you give a shit about and a six pack of 9.5% looks ""normal"").  Didn’t  fool anyone close to me.  Missed a bunch of milestones with my kids, was always drunk each nite with little memory the next day. Hit a hard part of job a few years back that left me feeling so drained/burnt that I gave up giving a fuck and just hit the bottle as hard as I could. I mean, never felt suicidal, but really didn’t care if I went and just angrily drank as if I was punching myself.  Somehow managed to stay afloat at work and got past that toxicity, but lately just getting lost and deeply behind since working from home and drinking all day. Been downing a 1/5th each day with beers for several months now. I wanted to quit sooo bad but never made it past a couple days over past 4 years. When I first saw the IWNDWYT slogan, I though it was cool but was placing the emphasis on the word “YOU”, as if I was gonna tell a buddy “nope, not drinking with ya” — But I was drinking alone, and evermore lonely b/c of it. Then it struck me after reading more posts that the emphasis was on the word “WITH”, not ""YOU"", as if this is a community of folks that are all struggling same as me, and everyone here is not drinking WITH me today. I don’t know why but it was a game changer having that solidarity and purpose. Today is my 6th day of not drinking. It’s been hard as shit, but I’ve come on this site numerous times each day. I know it’s only day 6 of a long journey, but I’m ready, and I’ve got a community of folks who won’t drink WITH me today, nor I WITH them. Let’s do this.

I do HIIT training weekdays and stretch etc. All the good stuff. 

I played football in my teens/20s and 30s so have really good leg muscle mass. I noticed the past 5-10 years that heavy leg work I.e. jumping or pulsing would build up lactic acid really quickly to the point I’d have to stop and wait for it to pass before resuming (I’m talking like 1 minute worth of each which isn’t a lot), I drink at least 2 litres of water a day, take magnesium and zinc plus vit d supplements so I don’t think I’ve an imbalance. 

Since stopping drinking I’ve noticed a very slight improvement but it’s still not great and I’m wondering if this is a “wait it out” for 6 months or so before I start a consultation with a doctor? I’m thinking the excess load on my liver is likely the cause and it’ll take a while to return to “normal”.

The thought that I could ever pick up again terrifies me.  And honestly, I think that's a good thing.  I wish I could give you all the secret or magic steps you need to do in order to log some sober time. But I know from experience, I can't do it for you, no one can. You can try all the things, follow all the steps, do all the rehabs, and if it's not in you yet, it just won't be your time to quit.  That being said, here are some things that I did, that might be helpful to you.    


* What I can tell you is to never give up trying.  I went to some form or rehab or treatment, detoxed, quit, a ton of times. I never gave up hope it would finally ""take"" and one time it did.  You cannot quit trying.  You are in the fight of your life. This cannot be overstated. 
* Don't lie in bed at night beating yourself up about all the stupid and hurtful shit you did while you were drinking.  Learn to redirect your thoughts. I often had to interrupt my thoughts and override them with other thoughts.  I'd tell myself things like, ""Let it go"", ""you never have to be in that situation again"", ""the choice is yours"", ""You are a good person"", etc. Why does this matter? Buying into the narrative that you are a shitty person will just keep you sick.  You wil be driven to drinking again to get temporary relief from your thoughts, only to pile onto all the shitty things you'll tell yourself when you are sober. It's a sick cycle. 
* Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Lots of people have shitty things that happen to them. If everybody used their crappy lives as an excuse to drink too much, the world would come to a grinding halt. That's not to minimize your trauma in any way, but to emphasize the fact that healthier coping mechanisms exist.  You have to find what works for you. Some traumas may never heal, but you can find ways to observe their impact on who you are without letting them keep you sick.
* Take an inventory of the relationships in your life and cut the ones out that are poison. You know the ones. Maybe you can reconnect some day in the future but not while you are fighting for your life.
* Give your brain the time it needs to heal before you try to drink again.  It will take years for your brain to be able to process things normally again.  You will get there but you have to give it the time it needs to heal.  You are not thinking clearly after 9 months of sobriety, believe me. You may think you are, you may think you can drink and ""control"" it, but I'm telling you, your brain is not ready.  
* Lastly, don't worry about what you will be doing or where you will be 4 years from now. Focus on not drinking today and then do it again tomorrow.  I could not have imagined fours years of sobriety, it didn't even seem possible to me.  But I knew I could handle not drinking for one day.",427,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5948693}"

I’m 37 and this is probably the longest I’ve been without a drink since I was 20. 

Never really thought of it as a problem, even in college years most nights were just a couple beers, and as I grew older and got into craft beer those became more of a “treat” than anything else. 

I’ve had periods of “only on the weekend” which was always hard to maintain, Friday/Saturday/Sunday would quickly become “we’ll work was rough and it’s Thursday” or “but this beer will go great with this meal” etc etc. it always expanded into most/all weekdays and wasn’t always obvious to my spouse (lots of times I’d have my drinks while making dinner “it’s nice to have a beer or two while cooking” but also was probably trying to low key hide it) 

Since Covid-19, it became a 100% every day thing, and the one or two beers became 2-3 always high ABV big cans. At first it was (I told myself) the stress, we found out we were adding twins to our family at basically the same time the world shut down, and I spent most of the summer working and taking care of a pregnant sick wife and our toddler daughter, the beers at the end of the day felt “well deserved”. But I found myself seriously stressing about where my next drink would be coming from when we weren’t going into any stores and curbside /delivery wasn’t always an option(and was pretty conspicuous that I was going through cans quicker than typical). Once the twins again the drinks felt “earned” or to help me unwind at the end of a day etc. 

A couple week ago i finally admitted to myself it’s a problem. While I wasn’t getting “drunk” really ever, the stress around “what if I don’t have drinks tonight?” and finding myself buying larger volumes of beer I didn’t even like just to make sure I had some on hand and wouldn’t run out, it became clear to me this was a dependency regardless of “getting drunk”. My wife “caught” me having a second or third beer (most night she just simply didn’t notice) and I admitted to her it was a normal thing and how I’d been feeling more and more dependent lately.

It was then I decide to call it quits and the next day tossed my supply(when I gave up smoking pot a handful of years ago it was the same, I know that if it’s in the house I’ll use it, not “wait for the weekend or some special occasion “) and now it’s been 11 days. 

I can’t say I’m “struggling” but at the end of the day I definitely miss the “ahhh time for a couple beers” while cooking /relaxing, and seeing beer social media/commercials definitely triggers a bit of “awwww” from me now. 

Anyways, I wanted to check in and say hello, thanks to COVID I haven’t really been able to share any of this with anyone besides my wife (who’s obviously pretty close to the situation), so here I am. Thanks for listening.",8,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48161888}"

He Struggled with tons of trauma and medicated with alcohol. Finally drank himself to death after being sober for 5 years. I’m crushed. Hope my story can help others.,"I feel I lost half of myself after losing my dad (best friend)5 days ago. I’ve never lets this stuff out. Always have kept it in. 

At the age of 33 I’ve had to endure more trauma than the majority of people at this stage of their life. It all began 6 years ago when I lost my uncle from cancer. He was 64. Shortly after that my parents were in a bad rollover crash which left my mom with two bones broken in her neck and traumatic brain injury. Lucky she survived. Car rolled 8 times. Thankfully my dad had just a few cracked ribs, and being a Marine that was nothing for him. He was still able to cut the battery and rescue my mom from the crushed metal mess. 

My moms mental troubles started rolling in fast about a month after the crash. Totally changed her. She seemed out of it. Zero emotion. She’d cry and cry over a bad hair cut before the accident. 

My sister wasn’t taking it well at all. Got into some scary drug use and alcohol to try and cope. She had also recently lost a close friend and could not deal with the pain any longer. 

My parents got back from grocery shopping that cold November afternoon. It was actually Black Friday. My dad came across a note my sister had written and panically started yelling and searching for my sister. That’s when he found my sister hanging from a tree in the yard. Cut her down a quick as he could and tried and tried cpr but knew she was gone. I was working and got the call no one ever wants to get. Rushed over there to help my parents get through the nightmare. I was a mess after hearing about. My nose began bleeding bad as I rushed in tears and agony. 

My dad didn’t hand it well at all. Who would? He stuggled with alcohol his entire life. It was the only thing that could black all the trauma out. Wont begin to describe all the trauma my dad had growing up. 

I’ve always had my dad in traumatic devastating events in my life. And he knew he had me. We were a team trying to get through the struggles with my moms health. I knew any time I was in dire stress or upset my dad could snap me out of it. I could do the same for him. We were just so alike. I either saw or spoke to him everyday. He and my mom were just living with me a couple months ago. Things started looking up a little. We got them their own place in a great location. But my dad started struggling bad with all of the frustrations with my mom and the image of cutting my sister from the tree was haunting him. He hadn’t touched alcohol after he lost it and hit the bottle hard after my sister left us. It had been 5 years. 

Then about 3 months ago my nana was on her death bed. Made it to 94. Had bad dementia. My uncle and her only son had been her “care taker” they were really close. Lived together last 20 years. I was very close to them both. 2 days before my nana passed my uncle knew he couldn’t handle life without his mother. My aunt found him hanging in the garage. 

Still had my dad there to help me get through it. Anyway I knew he wasn’t doing well mentally or physically at all recently. I did all I could to try and snap him out of it. He decided to hit the bottle hard again. Harder than I had ever witnessed before. Went 6 days straight of chugging vodka until he was passed out completely. I kept saying “it’s like he’s drinking himself to death”. Never got to have a real conversation with him during this drunken binge. I was waiting for him to settle down and sober up to have a heart to heart. But never got to do that...my mom was worried sick about him checking on him every hour while passed out on that day 6 of heavy drinking. I figured he definitely needed lots of sleep. Who wouldn’t after 6 days of full binge drinking hard alcohol. She checked on him one last time around 10pm last Tuesday night before she finally fell asleep. Around 1 am she woke to go pee and said she tell by looking at him he wasn’t breathing. EMS got there fast and tried all they could but there was no coming back. I went into full on shock and emotional breakdown. My entire body was soaked with sweat yet I was freezing. My entire world crashed in front of me. 

I’ve been proud of myself of the strength I’ve kept making it through all of these traumatic events in my life at a young age. My problem is I’ve always held it all in. Let it simmer as I tried to push it from my mind. My dad was same way. But losing my dad, my best friend. The one I could always go to when I was feeling this low. Never have I felt so lost, confused, and not myself. I’m crushed. Completely heart broken. Hard to see a life ahead without him. Still can’t process that. 

And worst of all, I’m getting married this august. My dad was so excited and would be so proud of me. Knowing he won’t be there nor will my future children get to meet my old man. I’ve sobbed since getting the call I’ve been dreading my entire life. That my dad stopped breathing and had left us. He always seemed invincible to me. Strongest man I’ve ever known. 

I’ve never sought out professional help to cope with all of the trauma I’ve dealt with. I’m not ashamed to seek help. Losing my dad is as low as I can get at this point. My mind has been stuck in a thick fog since that first night I realized he had hit the bottle again. 

I’ve never been one to dwell on things I cannot control. I’m not asking for anyone’s sorrow or to feel bad for me. I needed to do this venting. Long overdue. 

At this point I realize it’s not “day by day”. It’s moment by moment. I have random crying outbursts. Every little thing is a reminder of my dad. Grew up in this town. We would go on drives late at night because we were bored. Listening to good music and just enjoying each other’s presence....oh man, I didn’t know this kind of pain existed. 

If you made it through my novel of venting, thank you for listening.

Edit: I can’t say thank you enough for all the love and support you all have shown. It’s also comforting to know that there are still people with hearts out there. Didn’t expect much response with this, needed to let a lot out. I’ve never done this before. I’m glad I did because you all have been so supportive and loving and I think that’s all I need right now.

I broke down this morning and told my fiance again that I had had been slipping up a lot the last couple weeks. She was more understanding than I thought she was going to be, but I have become an expert at hiding my drinking and that's the biggest problem.  I'm not proud that I continue to hide it, but giving up the drink, especially in the beginning of this journey has been very difficult for me. So going forward, we are going to have a day where we take a little time and talk about what's going on every week. I am very good at closing myself off and letting issues just fade away over time, so hopefully this will help me keep my focus on the problem at hand. I've strung a couple weeks of sobriety together over the last two months only to find myself back where I started because this is much harder than I anticipated, but I am going to keep trying.

What an absolute game-changer. 20 years of building my social life around booze, letting it couple itself to almost every activity that brings me joy, and letting it wrap itself around my identity… 20 years of that shit. I drank myself to the middle, to dullness, to an unremarkable life. Never bottoming out of course, because all of the superficial markers are in place for my comparison machine of a brain to justify what it wants to justify. Mental gymnastics abound.

The weekend I was around a lot of drinking, and had such a great time. People said the rudest things when I first stopped drinking. *“Aren’t you afraid of being boring?”* *“Yeah, he’s a little more boring.”* I don’t blame them. Projection can be quite the rash. You can lash out a bit, you do you. My healthy skin, brighter eyes, sharper brain and genuine smile speak for themselves. 

Now people are adapting. This weekend they told me they admire me. They ask how long I’m quitting. They love to ask that. They love to throw out leading questions like, “Still no drinking, eh?”… And I love to give one-word answers. The silence that ensues is wonderful. They wait, and I give them nothing. I don’t need to explain myself, and we all know it. Just like it wasn’t my job to lead the pace at the bar, to be the “fun” guy. I know my value, and I don't have to punish my body to make anyone else feel more comfortable. My personality exists *despite* alcohol, not because of it. 

I’m so much happier to be stopping alcohol at the gates, reminding myself of how useless it is, rather than wrestling with the schizophrenia when part of my brain is still convinced there's a real value to drinking, that I'm missing out on something.

I tried 1,000 times just to get through just a few days. So happy to be at 4 months. The momentum is fun. 'Alcohol Lied to Me' seems to have resonated with a lot of people. I read 'Easy Way' by Alan Carr. Then I read it again. Then I didn't have to try to quit anymore. My growing distaste for my alcoholic lifestyle galvanized around the truths Carr writes in his book, and I could suddenly see clearly the tricks my brain was playing on me.

Alcoholism runs in my family (my mother and my twin brother are alcoholics), and I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. I have anxiety and depression, and alcohol is like gas to the fire, causing it to be much more severe, and even to progress to suicidal thinking. It is clear to me that my suicidal thoughts are very much connected to the recency and frequency of my alcohol use.

Every other week I'm saying 'I'm going to quit drinking, I hate alcohol, I wish alcohol didn't even exist.' But I can never seem to stop. Once I get started, I drink until I am drunk, even though I know I should stop. Then, I wake up in the middle of the night once it wears off, and lay there for hours feeling intense anxiety. The next day and for days following, I'm severely anxious and depressed. It takes 3-4 days to feel optimal again, but by then I've already had another night of drinking, so it's an endless cycle. Each time I drink, it's so clear to me the negative impact alcohol is having on my mental and physical health, and I vow to stop, but don't. I ask myself why I drink, and why I can't seem to not drink, and I can't answer that question---because it is the only way I can 'relax?' Because I feel uncomfortable in social situations so I binge? Because I'm an addict? I don't know.

I'm otherwise very 'high-functioning,' which is why even my husband won't agree that I have a drinking problem. 'A problem moderating' he will agree with. Alcohol hasn't interfered with my job/success in that job, I don't drink and drive or do anything otherwise dangerous, I occasionally will say unfortunate things to my husband while drunk, but it hasn't ruined any of my relationships. I otherwise take good care of myself, eating fairly healthfully and working out almost daily. But it's starting to feel like any use of alcohol on my part cancels all of this out. It's increasingly clear to me that there is no 'cutting back' or 'drinking moderately' for me. I seem to either be not doing it at all, or doing it too much. But I really struggle to stop.

I came here because I'm feeling pretty alone and frustrated about this, and I don't know where to turn. Seeing that there is a community like this, and reading through your posts has already helped.

I just wanted to share my last year with you to help anyone struggling with multiple relapses. I've been trying to quit for over a year now. Early on i was kinda just half-assing it with 3-4 days sober and going back in every time. 

Then, drunk me started to put me in really dangerous situation. Sober me started to wake up with bruises and cut with no idea how they happened. It made me anxious and just brought back drunk me for even more damage. Then one night i ''woke up'' ( sobered down ) at the ER for withdrawal. It was quite a serious event in my life so that day i was like ; THATS IT. NO MORE.

I was lying to myself

In the last 5 months, i managed 3 of them sober ( 3 X 30 Days Sober )  but i also went back to the ER twice because after every 30 days i would relapse into worst than before the 30 days. On the second time, i lost my job and my appartment ; at that point i didnt have much left. I tought it was rock bottom. 

It wasnt

The third and last  time, was on my birthday January 15th ( 3 weeks ago ) My entire family tried to contact me for my birthday but i was in my mania-alcool-fueled-world so i never saw and they found me blacked out in my appartment later that day.

You would think it would be enough to stop me. I did too

2 weeks later and i was having wine with my partner but when i woke up the day after, i was craving a little drink so i went to the kitchen for a gin and felt the whole mania rush coming back in. I guess my years of meditation finally paid off because something just snapped and said :

Fuck it. Im done

I am back on the wagon, but this time im not even thinking about ''Being sober''. Im thinking about the love i received from my family and my partner trough these episodes ; i cant even say i would be here today without them and it made me realize that even if my life situation makes me wants to drink, if i cant stop for me, i need to at least stop it for them. But that tought also made me realize that would actually be stopping for me too because we're all in this together. ANYWAY. Im starting to rant and my ADHD is going in so to conclude : Its okay to fail. You might be on your 20th  Day 1. Its Okay. Just keep going. But dont just count them as relapses. Extract something out of them. Your body and your mind paid a price so get something out of it

Who knows, maybe i am still lying to myself. But what i know is that for now ;

My idea of the perfect Sunday is having all the groceries I need to spend the day in the kitchen prepping for the week ahead and capping off the weekend with a nice dinner. 

Up until a month ago, kitchen time also meant drinking time. Flitting around the kitchen all day wasn’t possible without a cocktail on the counter. That’s what made it fun! Get boozed up, cook delicious things. Never mind the fact that I’d be drunk enough by dinner time to just pick at my food, maybe binging on some junk before bed instead. And never mind the Monday morning hangover. It didn’t even feel like a hangover anymore though, that’s just how I felt in the morning. I’d felt like shit for so many mornings in a row that it was my normal. 

Due to a lot of random life events, I haven’t had the opportunity to spend Sunday in the kitchen since I quit drinking. Today was the day. I grocery shopped yesterday so when I woke up this morning I could get started right away. 

But I didn’t. Because I wanted a mimosa to go with making breakfast. And then I realized I’d want a Bloody Mary, too, before switching to something else for the afternoon and evening. 

And the thought of doing what I wanted to do without that was crippling. I curled up on the couch and avoided it all day. It’s the first time I haven’t been able to face it head on...that craving hit me so fucking hard it sent me into hiding.

* taking my medicines regularly and on time
* bank balance (& not being scared to look what I spent on a bender)
* being present with friends/family
* memory getting better

It is only the beginning of my sobriety, and while I have my struggle moments, overall I am feeling really happy about my decision and feeling better for it.

I am getting blood works done (annual check up), and for once I am actually not dreading it. I know they won't be great, but I am excited to do them in 6 months to see how much they have improved. I have avoided it for 18 months because my liver function was not good the last time I did them.

I entered rehab Mid August because after years of destroying relationships, my health, opportunities I could have had, etc. I decided it was time to make a change. I got a lot out of it and came out feeling on top of the world. Fast forward 3 days later I was a fifth deep.. Right back where I started. From September-The last day of January I had been in that dark place yet again; that place that feels so impossible to get out of no matter how hard you fight. I was right back to destroying the relationship between me and my extremely supportive girlfriend; along with losing my parents trust in me. My life, for 5 years now, has been a broken record. On and off. Drink for 4 months straight, get maybe 4 days clean and right back to it because I feel I’m ready to drink like normal people. But the truth is I can’t. I never have been able to and I never will be able to. Finally, my girlfriend left. She couldn’t take it anymore. I’d gone through similar experiences before but never enough to really make a big change, I’d always just run to the bottle to make everything better. Well she finally left me and I finally felt the pain that comes when you let a fucking liquid run your life.  For once I was able to self-reflect and see what my life will be like if I continue down this shitty, dark, isolating path. She is now back with me. I am going to be 7 days clean come tomorrow. I’d be lying if I said I feel great because I don’t. There’s still a void. But that void can be filled. The void can always be filled. Health wise I do feel good but there is still those days that I have to take every single cell in my body to fight that evil venom in me who needs the liquor. It’s not easy but it’s worth it.

That's not enough. I'm mad.

It is with regret I must admit the other reason I'm mad. I could get drunk until 4 hours later with the 5 regulars I call my friends so that we can say we came together and get a table.

I  never really drank at home; I drank at one bar. I could compartmentalize that way and say it was fine. Before I quit for 6 months in 2019 I'd been killing a liter of well rum nightly from after the event I hosted there on Wednesday through at least Saturday night. I knew it was $7.95 a liter wholesale. Quality stuff. So did the bartenders. It was understood from top management that that'd run me 20 bucks tops per night with cola. I tipped 100%, for a cool $160+/week. Almost lost my job. Weighed 367 pounds.

Before I quit this time, I abandoned all pretense of moderation to get progressively drunker from day drinking on MLK day through last Friday night's blackout. I cleaned up a stranger's sick from the bathroom sink in a house I'd never been in. It took so long to recover that I couldn't guarantee I didn't still have alcohol in my system on Sunday so I picked Monday as a badge date (and 2/1/21 is a cool number). The manic desire* was to be so burnt out on drinking that when my best friend gets out of rehab next week I won't want to drink or try to get her to.

But it feels so unfair. 4 more hours. I could be there for that.

In truth, it's unfair to them that those 5 friends have 4 more hours a night they will have to keep drinking. That they have to stay out until 3½ hours after what's become my bedtime. That by next weekend my skin won't be red, as I recall, but theirs still will. That they will struggle to accomplish goals like the ones I know I can do sober, from experience.

I remember when I lost 87 pounds sober and started dating for the first time in years. Those boys will still be single. It's so unfair.

I have struggled with anxiety/depression since my late teens/early 20s. I have been on and off SSRIs for 8-9 years now. When I quit drinking I had a pink cloud for about 2 months then everything came crashing down. I had been off medication for a year but all of a sudden I had debilitating panic attacks and developed agoraphobia coupled with intense gastrointestinal issues. 

I got back on a different SSRI and it has been almost 9 months. I can’t even begin to describe how different my life is from when I started back on the SSRI. Even my initial pink cloud doesn’t compare. 

All of this to say, sometimes drinking can mask symptoms of your mental illness that come raging back when you get sober. Medication worked for me. I am hoping to someday not need to be medicated but I also have peace knowing that it’s okay if I am!

It was, of course, a major challenge, especially during a pandemic, but I did it, and I'm still here -- but, around the time of my four month sober mark, I started getting cravings again. The panic attacks I experienced all throughout my early 20s got worse when I got sober because I was no longer submerging my fears in booze every day and night and I actually had to deal with the anxiety I'd had my whole life without running away. I've been mentally ill for years, but for me, I would take depression over anxiety any day; the all-consuming terror that arises seemingly out of nowhere is unbearable. 

But I'm still sober. I've been getting through it by telling myself I can drink again if I want, but not today. And I already know the reality of getting back into drinking is that I start using alcohol to cope with a problem and then alcohol is the problem again and I'm no where closer to healing. It sucks. I was really ready to give up in January and hit the bottle again just to take the edge off, finally, but I didn't -- mainly owing to my partner being so supportive and the reminder that I was truly miserable for so long while I was drinking. 

Last September, right before I stopped drinking for good, I told my partner I would do anything to be sober. I would kill if it meant I didn't have to be a slave to this thing that made me desperate, needy, scared, and sick. I also really thought quitting drinking meant all my other problems would vanish, and they didn't. I keep telling myself that the person I was last September would kill to be where I am now, even with everything that I'm experiencing, and it's not worth it to throw that away.

I keep booze in the house and have beers in the fridge and have zero interest. My wife drinks very seldom but the booze are mostly for guests. I even make drinks for people and still I have no desire to drink myself. I keep booze around me as an exercise of will. Anyway, today there was a little container of candy in the office. The candies were from brazil or some place like that and they looked exactly like lemon drops. A coworker told me to give one a try so I did and bit down and it was a weird candy shell filled with strong alcohol, couldn't have been more than a fraction of an ounce. I didn't realize what was in my mouth until after I swallowed and got the aftertaste and she started laughing at me because of my reaction. I asked her if it had alcohol in it and she said yes and I told her that I don't consume alcohol but that it wasn't a big deal. Anyway to be honest I'm a little sad that I've gone so long without booze and I accidentally consumed some today.

Started getting anxiety that my drinking was helping with my bipolar disorder and if I stop drinking do I have to get back on the medication I didn't like taking.

Someone recommended her other book ""The Alcohol Experiment"" last week and for some reason I'm loving it. 

The mindset of *I am getting to do this to see if it will improve my life* instead of *I HAVE to do this and feel deprived* has made such a huge difference.

I survived.","I have a lot of past trauma when it comes to doctors. It has taken me months to work up the courage to call a psychiatrist seeking treatment for what I'm fairly confident is a form of bipolar, aside from already been previously diagnosed with anxiety & depression. I haven't been treated for anything for years because I just numbed it all with booze.

So today I was brave. And I started calling. Transferred 4 times, on hold for a total of about an hour only for a nurse to tell me my only option was to make a May appt with a primary doctor & ask for a referral for a psychiatrist then. I explained I didn't think I'd make it that long, that I have a lot of anxiety stemming from experiences with the healthcare industry & that I just needed a little assistance finding someone who would see me fairly soon. She suggested I call an old doctor. I explained I needed to see them due to insurance & at this point I started hyperventilating a little, but was still able to articulate my words. She told me I should go to the ER & hung up.

Y'all I spiraled into full blown hyperventilating. I felt so alone. So helpless. I couldn't slow my breathing. And I briefly toyed with the idea of taking just 1 shot to slow my breathing. I mean if ever a time to take the edge off this was it.

But I know 1 shot would be 5 and sure, I probably would (temporarily) forget all about even calling these offices. I would be sick tonight, praying my family didn't notice I once again, drank alone in the middle of the day. I would then start to sober & hate myself. I would wake up tomorrow, still no therapy appointment, feeling worse physically & mentally. Crazy to think this used to be my go-to for panic attacks...

So I bawled for awhile. Tried to call some loved ones for support but no one answered. I reached out in another online community & was instantly loved & supported (they don't know about my drinking, but they do know my mental health struggles).

I just downloaded Calm last night. So I figured what the hell. There was an ""Anxiety SOS"" one. Perfect! Tears were streaming down my face listening to it, but my hyperventilating slowed. I can't even explain the emotions I was feeling in that moment. Still sad, but also strong & hopeful. Like I deserve this. I deserve the peace alcohol never gave me. It muted pain for a minute sure, but it never gave me peace.

The mental healthcare system in the US is a joke & can feel so defeating. I'm not at all suicidal, but imagine if I were? That nurse hanging up on me sent me into a spiral & I may need some time to gain the courage to call again, but I'm not backing down & I'm proud of myself.

I'm not sure I have something valuable to contribute to this community, but then again the most value I've gotten here comes from the variety of experiences you all share and that this doesn't feel like a cult where everyone blends together as a single unit with one personality, so I will share with you what my experience has been like.

Pink cloud and health surprises gone by now, I think I'm starting a path to growing. To not be just the guy that doesn't drink, like that's the only think I'm good at, not drinking (which is a really good thing on its own, I think most of us can agree on that), but start being the person I had lost the hope of becoming. I have huge debt to pay and I want to have more money, I want to look better, do more things for people.

When I started down this path of not drinking, I would watch videos of people telling how they started saving money and even earning more money by quitting alcohol. I didn't get how they would pull that, as I myself worked a decent job with decent pay. But hey, they're kind of right. Of course, I spend less in alcohol and partying in general now, but also I have the energy to wanna do and learn more things.

I accepted a part-time job writing articles for different websites. I earn a little bit more money by learning how to write on a deadline, which is something I have wanted to do for a long time. That's all I got for now on that area, but it's a start.

I'm so far from paying all the debt I'm in (almost 30K in 4 years more of monthly payments), but damn, I have so much more focus than before, that I know that some day I'm gonna be able to accelerate that payment and maybe even start saving. I want to believe that so hard.

I kind of look better now. My skin is better, I'm not bloated anymore. Damn, why do we let ourselves get poisoned like that. Worse yet: why do we poison ourselves like that. Even people that don't have a drinking problem would be so much better if they didn't ever drink.

But that takes me to the last point I want to get across: does it happen to you? That you would maybe tell your story, but never advise someone to quit drinking? It happens to me. I always look back at myself when I was a drinker and I would've hated anyone that recommended me to quit.

So I always tell people how good it has been for me, and I tell them that I will never ever recommend that they do it because it needs to be you who wants to. I will show you my new abs, or the app from my smartwatch showing how I sleep so much better now. I will tell you all kinds of cool stuff that's happenning to me by not drinking, but I will never ever tell someone to quit drinking.

Except to you, guys. Today and I hope many more times from now on, I will tell you that IWNDWYT and I hope that you don't too. And if you happen to be reading this and you're a drinker, oh, believe me that life gets so much better when you do this. Not immediately, maybe not even 100 days since you quit, but some day you will look back and realize this was the start of your best life.

We have used our sober days to try other things like play board games, watch shows, or take a walk, but both of us have such a soft spot for eating delicious food and use it as a relaxation method. We also do takeout but it doesn't have the same experience for us as when we go out and get the food nice and hot and can just sit in a new space. 

I have noticed though that this has gradually become a situation where I have ordered a drink or two, which then turns into a binge fest that goes on the rest of the night or next night.

""The usual?"" ""Where ya been?"" etc.). The clerk does not give a shit. Let me repeat, He/She. Does. Not. Give. A Shit. (Well, kind of. See below!)

What he/she DOES give a shit about:

Assholes, assholes who won't wear masks, thieves, people trying to pass off fake IDs.

What else they ALSO give a shit about:

Customer service. Seeing a regular they haven't seen in awhile and asking how they are. Having someone's beverage of choice ready to go at the counter after seeing them in the parking lot. Making things easier for their customers so they'll come back.

I guarantee those clerks genuinely wonder where you've been. How you've been. Be truthful (""I quit.""). Lie (""I did dry January and thought I'd see if I could do February too""). I bet they would say something like, as I have, ""We all need a break sometime!"" or ""Good for you!""

I saw someone post something along the lines of ""They must feel awful, serving poison everyday to people like you and me."" They don't. If they did, they would run into work everyday like Carrie Nation and destroy every bottle of liquor they saw! For every once a day visitor or few times a week visitor, there are SEVERAL customers who buy once every two weeks. or a couple times a month.

Just remember, if they're not going through what you are, they're probably going through something else. ""Will I be able to pay rent this month?"" ""Is my partner cheating on me?"" ""I hope when I tell this person they need to be wearing a mask they don't physically hurt me."" They're just trying to get through the day, make a living and maybe make some small talk and a friend or two while doing it.

TL;DR: Store clerks aren't judging you. If they are, they're in the wrong business. It's normal to feel embarrassed by the past, but try not to be. (I know, easier said than done!)",58,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.79306203}"

Not a hardcore alchy yet, but have been on a downward spiral especially for the last 12 months I’ve noticed. Basically since the start of COVID and working from home. Never drank as much in my life as I have in the last year. 

I have been drinking at least a 6pk every night or close to every night of the week. Wouldn’t get completely smashed, but definitely buzzing often and always craving beer. Throw some liquor in there too every now and then. And ofc hitting the bars and drinking even more with friends occasionally. In my 10yrs of drinking, I’ve never seen it as a problem until now.

I’ve noticed in the last couple months it’s really started affecting my overall health. My vision was weird, mental health was a little fuzzy, definitely gained about 15lbs because of the beers, attitude, temper, gassy, sleep schedule fked up.....you name it.

I got shit faced last Friday night and upon waking up decided that I would no longer be drinking for the foreseeable future. So here I am 6 days without alcohol (I’ve never went this long without it) and I honestly feel like a new person even after such a short amount of time. Can’t wait to see what 30 days feels like.

Last May I went to rehab after mixing alcohol with ambien and ended up collapsing on my family's front porch, woke up in the hospital lucky to be alive. I stopped breathing and apparently everyone thought I was dead. Luckily I had great insurance and was able to go to an amazing rehab center the day I got out of the hospital. 

I was scared out of my mind, that first night in rehab sleeping next to a stranger in our quarantine trailer. But that experience ended up being one of the most amazing gifts I could ever give to myself. When I got out I was on anti-anxiety meds and naltrexone, and was able to stay sober for a few months. But I ended up being laid off due to covid, lost my insurance and could no longer afford my medication out of pocket. I stopped taking my meds and that's when the relapses began happening. 

I'm a petite, 5'1 woman and I'd drink a full bottle of scotch bourbon by myself in a matter of hours. I started having benders that would last three days. My partner could tell sometimes, other times I'd say I needed to stay in bed due to depression and would drink while he was at work, stopping just long enough before he came home to shower and get some food in me to mask the smell. I was drinking so much my body would feel like it was going into shock at times, with hangovers being the worst I'd ever experienced.

But what scares me is how hardcore my drinking is compared to pre-rehab. It's like, because I have to do it in secret, and I keep telling myself it'll be the last time, I go even harder. The amount I'm consuming is just insane for someone my size. I wish I could go back to rehab but that's not possible right now.  I usually can make it into day 4, when I start feeling better and then think OK, just one more drink before my forever sobriety. Once I start I cannot stop. I will drink anything I can get my hands on. I know it's never just one drink, it's non-stop bingeing until I have to clean myself up in the evening.  It's never a glass of wine or a beer, it's liquor straight from the bottle.

I've had an account for a while but gave up trying to quit several times. I've come to a decision that it really is the best thing for me to quit and it has somehow ***not*** involved yet another drunken episode. 

&#x200B;

I have had a weird relationship with alcohol this past year or so. I am proud to say 2020 was the first year since 2009 (!) that I have had 0 blackouts. I genuinely couldn't tell you whether it was down to lockdown/not being able to go out or just changes in my social life as I get a little older as, unlike my efforts to stop in the past, I wasn't even making a conscious effort to cut down or stop drinking. It wasn't until reading a tiny snippet of This Naked Mind that I actually realised I had just been drinking mindlessly for years, thinking its only negative consequence was to make me black out if I had too much, and believing that its sole purpose was to relax you/make you feel good. Several times during the lockdowns we have had I had one or two drinks and realised I just felt a bit sick/heavy/giddy after just one. I hated the feeling and it made me feel pretty tragic.

&#x200B;

Why do we romanticise alcohol so much? A glass of wine after a stressful day, a nice cold beer, a gin & tonic at the weekend.  If they followed some of the nights I'd had, the Smirnoff adverts would end in somebody lying behind their tv, or even better, on the street because no taxis will pick them up. All it is doing is making me depressed and crave more. I must stress that I have never been a daily drinker, my issue was binge drinking. Even so, I would say that I believe I am an alcoholic because when I have one drink all I want to do is have more, and it's a battle with my inner monologue to try to moderate every single time. My anxious, introverted, slightly dyspraxic brain really ***l******oves*** alcohol, unfortunately.

&#x200B;

Which is why I finally want to give it up. I am having literally a couple of drinks a week just now for no purpose other than boredom. All it is making me do is go to the bathroom a lot more and clog up my sinuses. I am done whether I am able to moderate or not. I am also done with peer pressure 'why are you not drinking?' 'you don't have a drinking problem! just have a couple and that's it!' That is the problem, a lot of the time especially in social situations I do not want to stop, I want to keep going in this wild fantasy of having an absolutely crazy night defying time/space/logic.. when in reality I will just end up a drunken wreck, losing their possessions. I have had more than 10 blackouts in my life and had all sorts of crazy things happen to me - I'm only 28 and I have had enough. Waking up fully dressed with that horrible 'still slightly drunk' feeling is not on my agenda any more.  One blackout back in 2010 should have been enough but my own brain convinced me to keep going, other people around me convinced that it was my fault for not managing my drinking, that I 'couldn't handle my drink'. They would ply me with wine, vodka and gin then complain that I got drunk too quickly. They would moan at me saying no to them until I said yes. Don't worry, I got rid of those people a few years ago. 

&#x200B;

 As Annie Grace touched on, how can we expected to consume something highly addictive then be chastised for not 'handling' our drink?  I will not drink with you today, and i will be telling those who want me to drink in future that their problem is not mine. I love who I am without it, not the boring attention whore who overshares to strangers with it.

For my part, they are strongly linked and potentially a dangerous combo where one typically leads to the other. I've gone cold turkey on both for my most lengthy and successful attempt at not drinking during the pandemic. But my lizard brain is wondering if there's still any place for the occasional special occasion use of weed again. Playing with fire?

EDIT: Thanks for the broad range of thoughts gang! I guess I'm happy to read that some people actually use weed to help themselves stop drinking instead of seeing it as a trigger, like I tend to in certain situations. I really don't want the answer to be ""never use it again"" for me, because I do consider weed a far less harmful substance than alcohol, at least for me anyway. I'm thinking I need to avoid it in situations where alcohol is readily available, like just sitting at home during this pandemic. But maybe when I can enjoy the outdoors away from other triggers and booze I'll think about it again and see how I feel. I definitely know I don't want to wind up drinking again.

Not that there's anything wrong with that, they all play great and were taken care of.  But there's something about something brand new.  Never used before, direct from the manufacturer.  I eventually was able to afford a brand new guitar about ten years ago.

Never had a vehicle with that ""new car smell"".  Haha.

I remember being a kid and walking around the inside edge of the pool repeatedly to get the water to keep spinning.  We called it ""making a whirlpool"".  It took some time and effort to get going, but once you did, it was easy to walk along with the flowing water.  You could even pick up your feet and the water would carry you for a while.

""Go with the flow"" usually has positive connotations but it's not always a good thing.  Sometimes the flow is the things in our lives we've set in motion with our addiction.  Addiction can make our lives worse, and the worse they get, the easier it can be to give in to the flow and the substances and continue the same path.

Quitting is like stopping that water and reversing it.  When you first stop and turn around the water is pushing against you with such force that it takes a tremendous amount of strength and effort to just stay in the same place and not get pushed backwards.  Those first few steps against the current are like the first several days of sobriety.  It's so easy to think, ""I can't change things.  This is too hard.  I'm struggling so much and barely getting anywhere."" It's easy to give up and fall back into the flow.  I've been there.  Lots of us have.  Maybe everyone has at least once.

But if you keep fighting and just keep moving then the water begins to slow down.  You build this new momentum and slowly the water starts to move with you instead of against you.  Eventually the current is reversed and moving as forcefully in the new direction as it was in the old.  But this time the things in your life are going the right way.  If you stop, so does the water, but it's not as hard to keep going as when you first turned around.  You can even pick up your feet for a bit and now the water carries you in this new direction when not too long ago it was crashing against you.

People downplay their first week or month.  ""I only have 7 days.  It's nothing.""  It not nothing.  It's the hardest fucking part!  If you get through that and keep going, you're doing an amazing job.  Be proud of that.  Just keep going...",177,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44956517}"

## Counting recovery time

Counting days is the default thing to do when starting out in recovery. Anniversaries are celebrated, whether that is weeks, 10 days, months, 100 days, years or 1000 days.

Some people see them as a badge of honour, giving positive feedback of effort made.

These are my own thoughts on counting days and whether it makes sense for me to count my time in recovery.

## One day at a time.

A piece of advice that we hear a lot is that we should not think too far ahead. We should make a commitment to stay in recovery just for today. I personally use a modification to this as I believe that the mindset is important here also. In early recovery people may not have tools developed yet to be able to cope with trauma or the things that life may throw at us. They may be “white knuckling” and getting through day to day. This is where we need to use every tool that works for us. For me this is operating at a low level. If we can move beyond this so that we can see the joy in recovery, then that is a better place to be.

## Living in the moment

We also hear advice about being mindful. That the only time that exists is now. All other time (past and future) only exists in our head. Its a construct of our minds. I struggled to reconcile this thought with the idea of counting days. If we have to live in the now, how can we look forward to an anniversary? A bigger and more important question is how do we think about relapse, and the apparent loss of days.

## Does slips / relapse reset the count?

If we are defining this “performance indicator” as days since last substance use, then yes by definition the count is reset. And this is my biggest problem with the count. If we are to come up with some measure of our success then this is a crude, threatening, coercive, measure. It’s more of a stick than a carrot.

If we had a medical intervention, where it improved our quality of life for 99% of the time but 1 in every hundred days we were ill, would we view that in the same way we view slips / relapse?

So for me I started to wonder if there was a better way to think about this, a better metric to judge ourselves, or even if being a Judgey McJudgey is good at all.

## Operating at different levels

I started to think that could take a multi level view of this.

At a high level, where am I with respect to my feelings of self worth, of how solid I think my recovery is, of what risk of slip/relapse I have. Where am I in my journey?

At a medium level, what hurdles do I have to overcome in the medium future. Again what risks are there, and what mitigation I can put in place.

At a low level, can I stay grounded. Do I remind myself that the goal is contentment? Am I being mindful and living in the moment.

## Pros of counting recovery time

I really don’t want to take away from anyone who finds counting time useful. I will always celebrate others achievements.

It is something to feel good about.

It shows progression

It is a motivating factor in not succumbing to temptation because you have built up the score and don’t want to see the score go back to zero.

It is good for goal setting and milestone celebration.

My view is anything positive and helps us recover is good, and anything that is negative and hinders recovery is bad. That sounds obvious, but I have certainly been in situations where I have been caught in negative loops of the mind where I know it is a bad mind loop, but I still do it anyway.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5352256}"

I set and reset my counter in here multiple times before this last one. Eventually I stopped resetting it, because it felt demoralizing having to admit my failures. But it wasn’t a failure, it was preparation. I needed to keep trying until I found what worked for me. I finally reset it when I was a few months in this time, because it felt different, like maybe it was going to stick. 

The last day I drank was Groundhog’s Day, which is fitting because I had no idea at the time that things were going to be any different. I’d been miserable for over a decade, and I woke up every day and, before I even opened my eyes, my first thought was “I hate myself.” Every. Day. For a decade. Do you know how hard it is to just get through the basic functions of being alive when that’s your first and most consistent thought throughout the day? I’m guessing many of you do.

My reddit username reflects how I was feeling at the time—completely hopeless, a shell of a person, floating through life waiting for it to end. I was so broken, guys. 

Yesterday, on my actual anniversary, my first thought before opening my eyes was one of profound joy and gratitude for the fact that I don’t have to live that way anymore. Today it was “do I still have bacon in the fridge?” Both of these are huge improvements! 

Not every day is hugely joyful, ok? That’s just life. But everyday I get to wake up now and make choices that put joy within reach. That wasn’t ever going to be an option for me with alcohol. It just wasn’t. My life is better than I could have ever dreamed now that I’m not drinking it away.

So... We're all sober now. Whether it's 12 hours, 2 days, 1 month or 10 years. We all have accumulated at least some MINUTES sober. What's next? You've read the books, you've spent more time on SD than you have with your youngest child, your bright white knuckles are fading back to the appropriate color for your skin tone. Now what do we do during a fucking quarantine/pandemic? The house is spotless, the junk closets have all been sorted and cleaned, rooms painted, pets groomed, puzzles puzzled, we've all lost 50 pounds because of all the working out from home we're doing. The non-stop time in the same 4 fucking walls was great.

But, I'm bored. It's 20fucking21 right? The magical year that follows 2020 and EVERYTHING got better with the flip of a calendar page. Let's go do something. Concerts and sporting events have alcohol. Backyard BBQs have alcohol. Timmy's 5th birthday party at the neighbors house has booze (because I'm sure Timmy wanted it that way). The church festival has booze. Your favorite restaurant has booze. What now? We're sober, but EVERYWHERE we go has booze. I go to my SOBER buddy's house and there is beer in the fridge for company. IT'S EVERYWHERE.

Now what? Well... we learn how to navigate though it. We can't fucking hide from it forever. Remember? It's 2021 and we're free as a bird. We all need a toolbox full of plans and ideas. YOU have to do what works for YOU. What is is? An escape plan from the party. A sober pal to keep you in check. Writing/journaling. Screaming at the cat. Tidying the house for the 50th time.

Seriously... flip open the lid. What's in your toolbox?

What day is it... Thursday? Yeah, have a great one of those!

I am embarking on my third serious quit attempt. I made 45 days, then 75. Anxiety sabotaged my last go a couple months ago. I figured if I'm sad and anxious all the time, I should just go back to drinking, because at least I wasn't anxious when I drank, right? Wrong! 

I feel good about this one, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it or be over confident. It's going to be a struggle, and there will be times I just want to melt into the bed and make life go away. But it won't go away, with or without the booze. In fact, booze is the way to make life go away in the sense of retreating from life. I can have life, all the good and bad, or I can have booze. It's really quite simple.

I feel a sense of clarity, like an ""aha"" moment, kind of how I felt when I finally kicked nicotine several years ago. I feel like I finally saw cigarettes for what they were, and I didn't want them to have power over me. I quit cold turkey and never had cravings, after years of struggling with and failing at quitting. They masqueraded as a dear friend, but really were destroying me. As is booze.

I want to choose life! I have proven to myself that I can't moderate, that I don't even want to moderate when I drink. And I want life instead! I used to have so many hobbies, passions, drivers. Now drinking is my only pastime. 

The only time I haven't drank daily in nine years, aside from the two stints, in which I learned a lot, was when I was hiking the PCT. In the middle of the woods by yourself, there's no booze. You don't even want it. I felt so alive and wonderful. That wasn't life, though. It was a brief escape. And I'm tired of trying to escape with alcohol. It only traps you.

Called a friend, drove home from the gym whilst questioning why I'm bothering with this venture in the first place. After being home for a few minutes its like this cloud over my mind lifted. What the shit was I thinking??? At best, I'll feel guilty and be tired AF tomorrow. But in that moment, it's like I was in a thick fog of thoughts justifying the hell out of giving in. It would seem I just witnessed my rational brain COMPLETELY ceasing to function then coming back online. I tried to come up with reasons not to and simply couldn't. I certainly wasn't expecting that. Anywho, so glad I decided to see how I felt in a bit and came home. It's a bit unsettling how I just watched my brain freaking lie to me. Wow.

Feeling grateful is a skill we can develop. This is an opportunity for us to practice*.

Mornings have become quite sacred to me. This is rather unexpected given that I have never been described as what one might call a morning person. When most people were waking up I was probably passing out. Crazy times. But now there’s no other time of day that I feel as calm as during those quiet early hours before everyone else begins to stir. This state of bliss will inevitably erode as the day progresses and all its stresses bear down upon me. For this reason, mornings are when I’m most thankful and keenly aware of all the things I have to be grateful for. Those reckonings that the day will bring can wait. For now just let me be still. 

Slow and easy. This is my mantra for mornings. I think I read this somewhere while researching techniques for practicing mindfulness. And, as is my wont, I have taken this advice to its extreme. After waking I stay in bed until my eyes adjust to the darkness, letting my mind wander as I perform what the wellness experts call a body scan—intentionally observing how the body feels while appreciating its form and functionality and, hopefully, the lack of discomfort or pain. I pause to notice its weight pressing against the bed, enveloped by the warmth provided by a heap of blankets and pillows. What’s one thing I need to let go of today? What’s one thing I want to hold on to? I’ll think about this as I stretch out and away from any lingering desire to drift back to sleep. It’ll come to me, there’s no rush. Slow and easy.   

Once I’ve finally returned to consciousness it’s time to come to my senses. This, for me, can only be achieved with coffee. To say that I love coffee is a wild, wild understatement. Coffee doesn’t wake me up, I wake up for coffee. I look forward to the ritual of preparing it perhaps a little more zealously than one should. The process is almost ceremonial. And although laborious, the elaborate procedure is worth it just to take in the rich aroma and that impossibly comforting sound of the machine whirring to life. While that magical elixir slowly accumulates, I begin whipping up my famous scrambled eggs (really the only thing I know how to make). The swirl of delectable scents coursing through the kitchen is enlivening, a truly invigorating sensual experience. As I wait for breakfast to finish cooking while gently rocking in my recliner (my favorite possession and source of infinite gratitude), I’ll listen to the faint hum of the furnace. The sound of security, I think. And I’ll scroll through the Daily Check-In for some inspiration and encouragement. A chronicle of individual triumphs that together form a vast community of support. I feel the pride swell within me. 

Undoubtedly, the tribe will soon be roused from its slumber. Knowing this, I’ll venture outside to have a morning smoke (hey, just as I never promised you a rose garden, I never said I was a saint. But I’m working on it). The lighter will invariably give me hell. A sign from some higher power, perhaps? Wait! It worked! I feel something akin to what I can only imagine the Original Man felt when seeing those first sparks of fire. Cigarette. Coffee. Birdsong. Ten minutes of tranquility. Now staring out at the horizon and only vaguely thinking about what lies ahead, the cold permeates every bit of me. I’m feeling very much alive and maybe a bit more ready to tackle the day. Steeled, I guess you could say. No. Fortified. When I scurry back inside everyone will have gathered in the kitchen. I’ll feel the warmth of gratitude rush through me more fiercely than those icy gusts of wind had. And I’ll remember why I chose not to drink the night before.

It doesn’t matter.
Ours is not a caravan of despair.
Come, even if you have broken your vows
a thousand times
Come, yet again, come, come.

Because my spouse is high risk, we've been very isolated since March. I'm talking ""no seeing any friends other than from a distance outside once or twice in the last year but not much more than that since most of them think we are being overly cautious"" style isolated. Because of this, I feel like this go 'round at sobriety has been a lot easier than in the past, even with plenty of external stress (spouse lost job, isolation, elderly parents' health issues, unexpected home improvement issues, etc). 

I feel like I've got a sobriety bubble and while I'm not worried about breaking it when we are *finally* able to integrate back into society, I still wonder what it's going to be like being the sober one when hanging out with people. Most of our friends are heavy partiers, and we run in a crowd of artists and misfits. My husband also quit with me, and while we drank with friends and went to parties, we did a lot of heavy drinking alone together as well. During quarantine, we've started a vegetable garden, I started seriously running, and have just cleaned up our act in general. 

Has anyone else found sobriety during strict quarantine and if so, what are your thoughts about how your sober life is going to be different once normal life resumes? With the vaccine (hopefully) imminent, I kinda feel like I'm going to be released from prison and will have to start making ""harder"" decisions regarding my sobriety.

It’s such early days but I can see such a difference already.,"I’ve been drinking for over a decade and it’s been worse over the past 8 years when I took on a high pressure job and moved to the city. My life became a whirlwind of nights out with clients, friends, colleagues 4 or 5 nights a week. Liquid lunches, taxis home at 4am and an emergency McDonald’s followed by hangovers from hell, sick for two days and anxiety beyond belief.

I’ve just turned 30 and realised that my life is on a scary destructive path. I’ve left the city and moved closer to family. I made the decision to stop drinking on 30th December 2020 after a particularly awful night - blackouts, puke, the works. I decided that my drinking has become more frequent in lockdown, albeit not to the binge extent I was drinking before. Nevertheless I noticed I would countdown to an acceptable time to pour a glass of wine: 6pm, 5pm, 4pm... and it dawned on me this was becoming a crutch to cope and I needed to stop before it got any worse. I gained weight, I avoided people, I had anxiety, terrible eating habits and I was lethargic all the time.

I’ve been sober 35 days and these posts and this community has been invaluable to me during these past few weeks. Hearing your inspiring stories, endless support and honest reflections has been truly amazing and thank you.

I’ve been focused on a fitness challenge during January that really pushes me with exercise and monitoring my nutrition. It’s given me an outlet and a focus that is something other than booze and it’s been so helpful.

Reddit. It has zero comments or engagement from people but has many several awards already, so I think it shows how advertisers want the product the product appear. It seems like the ad came prepackaged with these awards to spark engagement.

The awards are 1 gold, 4 helpful, 13 wholesome, 6 silver, 3 hugz. 

These remind me of my drinking. At first I thought alcohol was fantastic. Instant fun and excitement, I’d give it a gold medal! It helped me socialize since I grew up in the woods and had zero dating experience. I thought I was creating lifelong, wholesome memories with others. Silver awards to me signal “I’m poor but I would give this gold,” so they remind me of times I had $20 to my name and spent $15 on booze to have another good time with others. I thought alcohol was bringing us closer together.

Years passed. Some issues in my life seemed cyclical but I couldn’t understand why. I thought I just needed to find a way to process loss, and I planned to drink and get stoned until I figured that that out. I clashed with people more but they were probably just drinking the wrong way. I was determined to keep experimenting to find the right way to drink. The goalposts kept moving and I became good at adapting. The more I drank and thought about it, most things in my life didn’t matter that much. I just needed some time and space and a bottle to keep thinking about it because I felt like I almost had a solution to my problems. Work was getting in the way, people were bothering me, I needed some time alone with a few drinks. This time I’d write it all down and when I woke up I’d have a plan to follow as soon as I woke up. I bet I could come up with a good plan right after two drinks...

it seems like there isn’t any reason to stop

edit: im obviously on here for a reason, im drinking everyday and it gets ugly and dark but sober is the same, finding a reason to live / stop drinking is my hard part. quitting isn’t too hard because i don’t have an addictive personality but i just can’t find anything else in life i enjoy deep down i guess",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.77526414}"

One year ago, after a somewhat successful ""dry january"", I tore through a box of wine (4 bottles) over the course of a weekend. Not because I had any particular reason to celebrate, just because I was ""allowed to"" drink again. When Monday morning rolled around, predictably, I felt like shit, I was embarrassed about the things I had said, etc. It was my third or fourth ""dry jan / sober october"" but this time things were different. When I went back to booze this time, I realized that a life of sobriety was a lot less scary than my potential future as a drinker would be. 

I made a deal with myself that it didn't need to be forever, that I was allowed to fuck up, but that my default behavior would be not drinking. About a month later, I started reading This Naked Mind which really solidified my decision and, in addition to inspiration and solidarity from lurking on this sub, helped me stave off a few temptations early on. I also got lucky that the pandemic cancelled all of the normal social engagements (and vacations) that otherwise would've had me reaching for a beer or a margarita.

One year ago, I couldn't have imagined myself as a non-drinker.   
Today, I could not be more grateful for the clarity, time, money, dignity, and improved physical health that I've found in sobriety.

Anyways, I don't have any big revelations to share, so instead I'll leave you with this recipe for ginger ale syrup. I've fallen in love with this homemade ginger ale. The flavor profile is complex and the heat from the ginger is just reminiscent enough of booze to scratch the itch a little bit. Highly recommend if you're looking for something to use as a ""replacement"" drink, or for special occasions!

>2 cups water  
1 cup sugar  
8 oz ginger root, grated  
2 star anise  
6 cardamom pods  
1 nutmeg, crushed into 4-6 pieces  
1 tsp vanilla extract  
1 lemon  
>  
>Put everything but the lemon in a pot over medium heat. Use a paring knife or vegetable grater to remove 4-6 segments of the yellow part of the lemon peel (try to leave the white pith behind). Juice the lemon, add both the peel and the juice to the pot. Bring to a boil then cover and reduce heat to low, simmer for about an hour. Remove from heat and let cool. Strain the liquid from the solids and refrigerate.

I am 30 years old have spent the last few years falling more and more under the spell of alcohol. Funny thing is, I remember at the age of 23 I considered quitting alcohol because I felt I had broken to many barriers at that point. One being drinking alone and another drinking more than three beers without any reason. If that poor young man only knew how many barriers he had left to cross. 

For the last few years I have been drinking a lot by myself. It has been a steady increase until i reached the summit in 2020. Obviously last year was a shitty year for a lot of people. 

For me the list is long: Being forced to work from home, not being able to go to several funerals of family members, losing my uncle to cancer and having an mental breakdown and so on. Honestly when I read some of the stories from this community I feel like I got of easy. I am very inspired by the strength in this community, truly!

In any case, the moment I truly realised I needed to quit was when I drinking straight bourbon during   
work meetings on digital platforms. Not a drink to take the edge of either, but actually drunk at work. Even if I was at home that felt like an insane thing to do. I was never caught luckily but I am really ashamed by it. I also realised I was turning into a mean person when drunk. Not violent, and I do live alone, but more like throwing remarks at others and having some terrible thoughts. It honestly scared me how much I changed. Obviously it had to change. This was in the autumn of last year.  

But I didn't quit until 1st of January. Yes, I know it's a cliché and all that but it felt like the right day. 

I read ""Stop drinking now"" by Allen Carr, a book which I can highly recommend btw. I read it a few days after I quit but it only strengthened my decision to quit. 

So far it has been pretty easy. Obviously I am still working from home and am unable to travel or go out friends and colleagues atm, so I guess the biggest challenges lies ahead.

But I can tell you this: To know that I will never be hungover, never have anxiety from drinking or spend a fortune on alchohol is such a great feeling! Physically and mentally I am better than I have been in over a decade, probably since childhood if I am being honest. I am looking forward to making another post around this time next year for my anniversary. 

I also want to thank this community for being the warmest and including community on reddit. Honestly this community shows how much good there is in us humans :)

We’ve not actually had a chat about drinking boundaries to support me. My fault really. I didn’t see the need but I do now! Husband barely drinks, he’s got that amazing ability to have one or two beers and then leave it for a few days. One of bad habits I realised I had was that we’d get a crate of 16 beers, they’d be gone in three days and husband would’ve drunk max three maybe four.

That went very well. I imagine yesterday he fancied some beer, bought a brand we both drink and didn’t quite finish them. But if today had been a different day I very well would’ve drunk it.

Be incredibly hungover. Sleep it off. Repeat. That was my life for the last 15-ish years. Lost jobs. Lost a relationship. Screwed up friendships. Missed opportunities. Spent a fortune. Suffered injuries. Had a DUI. All the bad stuff, I endured it.
* My last drunk day was Sunday, October 25th, 2020. I’d just started therapy a few days earlier, mainly to address my drinking and the residual anxiety and depression. My therapist basically said, “uh, yeah, you should consider stopping drinking” when I told her about my drinking habits. I think I just needed to hear that from a professional, because it didn’t take much convincing. 
* So I guess I had a “last hurrah” — a days-long bender — and by the time my next therapy session rolled around, I realized that I was done.
* I’m 34 years old. This is the longest sober stretch I’ve had since I was a teenager.
* I haven’t been going to meetings, or anything like that. I went to one Zoom meeting, and while I understand that AA helps so many people, I decided early on that I didn’t want to constantly be talking about alcohol, hearing people’s stories of their drunk times, good or bad, and saying the words “I am an alcoholic” and “I am powerless over alcohol” daily or weekly or whatever. I just don’t feel that that would be helpful for me. I’m \*not\* powerless over alcohol. I chose to stop, I’m reclaiming the power, and I’m not an alcoholic. I’m simply choosing not to drink anymore. YMMV, right? 
* The idea of trying to moderate never made much sense to me, so I never even really gave it a try. One drink is never satisfying. It got to the point that TEN drinks wasn’t enough. It’s honestly just easier for me to not drink at all.
* My social life has been weird anyway because of the pandemic, but I will do occasional Zoom hangouts with friends from childhood, and I just don’t drink. When I was drinking, I didn’t realize it at the time, but I was definitely the drunkest one on there. Pounding beers. Ripping shots. Nowadays, I realize that my friends just casually drink while Zooming, and they aren’t blacking out and ruining their tomorrows. So now, I grab a pack of bubbly water, and/or a kombucha, and just sip while socializing with the guys for a few hours. It was a little odd the first few times, and a few of them have questioned it a little bit, but I just say “I’m not drinking” and that’s pretty much the end of it!
* My relationship is stronger. It’s still a new-ish relationship, but I am more present with her, I want to see her more, even during the day (because I’m not sleeping until 2pm or later every day, recovering from the night before or two nights before), and she’s completely accepting of sober me. She’s had a few drinks around me, and that doesn’t bother or trigger me, but lately she isn’t drinking at all. Fine with me either way!
* I have a bunch of bar friends that I have kept in touch with here and there via a long-standing group chat. They’ll always be sort of family to me. I haven’t seen much of them lately because of the pandemic and cold weather and all that, and I \*think\* I’ll be able to hang out with them again, but more for a special occasion type of thing. And probably not for longer than a few hours at a time. It’s a little sad to think about, but the thought of going back to my old drinking ways would make me sadder. 
* I did have to cut off one toxic “friend.” This person was just bad news all around. It was hard, and I questioned it a lot at first, but it was for the best. Good riddance.
* I also stopped smoking cigarettes. I probably “buried the lede” here, because THIS is what I feel most proud of. I used to smoke all the time, and then it became an “only while drinking” thing. And now, I just don’t even think about it anymore. The idea of cigarettes gross me out. I have a Juul that I tried to transition to while I was still drinking, and I still have it tucked away. Tried it once or twice sober, but I found it just made me feel anxious. I’ll probably just toss it eventually.
* I slept a LOT in the first few weeks. I’d wake up early, and just kind of force myself to go back to sleep. I think that was a bit of depression, and anxiety of having to actually deal with life, instead of drink it away. I didn’t find a huge burst of energy right away. But gradually, I realized I didn’t need as much sleep anymore. I’m really fine after 7-8 hours of sleep. That's a very new thing to me. I’m actually becoming a bit of a morning person. It’s nice to wake up before or with the sun, and quietly start the day.
* I have the time, energy, interest, and attention span to pursue and spend time doing things I’m passionate about. I also have money in the bank. And when I need or want something (that I can reasonably afford), I buy it.
* **I just feel better. Physically. Mentally. Emotionally.** 
* I realize that I will be tested much more when the world opens back up, “post-pandemic” or at least when there’s herd immunity, or whatever. And eventually, I know people are going to hit me with the “why aren’t you drinking” interrogations. And honestly, I think I can easily get away with just saying “I’m taking a break” and that will pretty much end the conversation. As far as close friends and family go, I can definitely go deeper, but really it just boils down to this: I feel better when I don’t drink. I’m happier. That should be enough for anyone who really cares about me and my well-being. If people give me grief about that? F\*\*\* ‘em.
* I don’t post here much, but I have read a lot here, in moments of strength and weakness and everything in between, and when I just need a little bit of inspiration. And I will continue to do so! So, **if you’re reading this, and if you have ever posted anything in this sub, THANK YOU.**

No one in my actual life really knows about my struggles with alcohol. I was pretty damn good (or so I thought) at hiding my drinking alone in my room. When I was out of control it obviously showed, but after a while I definitely became more functional and able to totally keep it a secret that I was drinking entire bottles of liquor alone, multiple times a week. Secretly getting rid of empty bottles and cans once they started piling up. 

So. Because of the discretion, now that I’m a month sober, I’ve told NOBODY. 

I feel so proud of myself, though. I feel great. I just wish I could admit to my family and friends how much I was struggling. It would be nice for someone else to be proud of me too.

On the other hand, I feel like if I tell someone my accomplishment, it’ll ruin my chances at sobriety altogether. What if I slip up and they see that as total failure? Or what if they look at me differently knowing I had this terrible problem in the first place? I don’t know. 

For now, I’m still gonna keep it to myself. It kinda feels like a secret mission in a way. 

I’m so glad this online community exists, it really helped me begin this journey. Never thought a group of total strangers could make me feel understood.

If I still have a tag on here, the days are incorrect. I started drinking again about 6 months ago (after 3 years sobriety) because I thought that I would try to see if I can moderate. And I'm sure most of you know how that ended up lol. 

I would say for the last two months I have been drinking roughly 1/3 to a half a bottle of 750mL, 90 Proof whiskey almost on a nightly basis. Sometimes I would drink less than that, but never more. 

I was going to taper down, but after the first night of trying that, I just wanted to be done with it altogether. So it has been 36 hours since my last drink.

I'm not asking for medical advice and if I start to notice any alarming symptoms, I'm going straight to my doctor. But I am having a lot of anxiety (I'm already prone to anxiety and panic attacks) about having a severe alcohol withdrawal because of my recent consumption rates. In the last 36 hours, the only symptoms I have had are slight nausea, anxiety, and a little bit of insomnia last night. I haven't been shaking, sweating, throwing up, or really having strong cravings of any kind.

This post is mostly to track my progress, but I also want to see if any of your experiences might alleviate my anxiety. After 36 hours with no strong symptoms, do you guys think that I might be overthinking the sever withdrawal stuff? Should I be letting these nervous thoughts be running through my mind? 

Again, not seeking medical advice. Just curious if you guys could weigh in with your experiences. Thanks y'all!

So last April I switched to beer. Which helped a LOT. I think it may have saved me from some really serious problems.

A little about me, which I'm sure you've all seen/read before:

I'm 30, an engineer, and what I'd deem a closet drinker. No one would guess I have a problem, I've never been late to work, never had any health/legal problems (aside from now gaining weight from drinking/eating like s\*\*\*), I'd say the drinking really ramped up with the COVID stuff. I know I'm going to have real problems in the future if I keep it up. I've been having some wicked nightmares lately, the kind where you wake up in the morning like ""HOLY @#$%!"" which doesn't help coupled with drinking, because then I'm thinking ""but what if I did that and just don't remember..."" I don't drink every day and can go weeks/months without it; which I consider a blessing in a pile of shit. AT LEAST I'm not drunk 24/7 and the physical withdrawals are minimal...right now I'm only shaking because of how much coffee I had...lol

&#x200B;

So yeah, not good. I've snapped a picture of how worn down, miserable, and fat I look. I plan on looking completely different for summer, and for the rest of my life. Alcohol has provided me with nothing but a waste of my time and money; which I finally have to admit to myself ""it's not helping, and never did."" 

This feels different, like I've finally realized I can't do this anymore, and nothing good is going to come of it. I feel like it was a necessary experience for me; especially being an engineer in my head it's repeating ""Me + Alcohol = Anxiety and Misery"" so, if I want to change the outcome, I have to permanently change the inputs. 

&#x200B;

So the help I need from the community here, if possible:

How do you guys deal with the past guilt/mistakes and just move forward? I look back at all the time and memories blurred or wasted, and just feel bad...Is there anything I can do to just move on? Start new/fresh? 

&#x200B;

I’ve recently passed 100 days but have not been feeling brilliant for a couple of weeks.

I’m not tempted to drink or anything, but I wondered if what I’m feeling can be attributed to my sobriety or whether it’s just something else. One option is that it is the pink cloud lifting a bit.

I’ve been enjoying sleeping really well since I stopped drinking. It wasn’t bad before to be honest, but it got even better after I quit. However the last couple of weeks I have really struggled to get to sleep every single night for hours - it’s really out of character. Maybe my body is needing less sleep because it’s not recovering from boozy damage. Idk.

I’m also feeling really anxious again. This was one of my main reasons for quitting. But over the last couple of weeks I have felt as anxious as I did before and I can’t seem to shake it.

I’m also using comfort eating too much - to the point where it’s becoming more of a compulsion rather than a reward.

So I’m a 28yo male (high stress job in tech), I can safely say I’ve been an alcoholic for about 7 years, and about 6 years in denial. During this period my reasons for drinking have changed, starting from fitting in with older crowd at work for career(whisky at lunch) to the last few years, providing a means to get out of my own head and have clarity. 

During this time (until now), The longest I’ve gone without drinking was probably a month, and maybe a few weeks off each year but nothing noteworthy and mostly it was because I was somewhere remote in the world and ran out. 

The last few years my drinking really shifted from originally being social(always at a bar) to now at home (favourite being alone) which sadly I get excited for. Wine is my drink of choice and have built up a pretty good tolerance- can easily polish off 2-3 bottles a night. Originally didn’t see any issue with this, but fully comprehend now tolerance is not a good thing.

I know a lot of people here have had “that special” moment that’s triggered them to stop but in all honesty for me it’s just been a slow progressive decision I’ve been subconsciously contemplating for awhile. 

A year ago I decided to get a health checkup (better to know if I’m going to hurt my body early) so got a series of liver function tests done which showed elevated GGT levels, all this did was made me pause drinking for 2 weeks until I could retake test and bring them down.

Since this I’ve booked myself voluntarily in for 6 tests (all purposely missed), just kept making excuses not to go back and cancelling as I know the results won’t be good.

So there is one highlight and leading towards my motivation to quit and that’s in all honesty no really bad things have happened to me because of alcohol - worst was a DUI (which I got off), demonstrating lack of patience in arguments but nothing aggressive, lack of energy which on occasion made me a worse dad. So was hard to use that as motivation which I tried to for awhile.

Reflecting on this, i really owe it to myself to stop while I’m ahead, I’ve read some of the stories posted by others which are truely heart breaking.

That’s a bit of my background, I’ve made the commitment to myself to start with a target of 30 days and then go get my liver function tests done.

Im using the 30 days as an opportunity to try figure out below otherwise I know I will relapse:
1. try figure out how to replace that urge
2. figure out other ways to get a sense of clarity (without pharmaceuticals)
3. ideally notice enough changes to create additional motivation and keep going.

If anyone has any suggestions on getting rid of that urge and replacement of the habit - would love to hear any ideas?",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45002598}"

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

As I get more and more distance between my last drink and where I am right now, I am realizing I have fewer triggers. When I quit drinking, EVERYTHING triggered me. But I feel like they were more physical, if that's the right word. Almost, tangible. Driving past my favorite liquor store(s). A song. A certain smell. Seeing it on TV and in ads. Someone with me that was able to drink like a normal, fucking human being. (What's with those people?)

As time went on, the triggers started to disappear. Or lessen noticeably. I no longer cared if I saw drinking on TV. Ads, with alcohol didn't make me want to drink, they just made me sad for the individuals they are pandering to. The liquor store is just another building I have to drive past. I also don't remember the last time I thought about drinking. I mean, the action of picking up that first drink.

Now my triggers are more mental, almost emotional. A feeling will trigger me. Maybe a sound. Certainly an emotion. Now that the rose color have came off, I'm feeling all the feelings. ALL OF THEM. No longer can I go through the day fairly numb. No... Now I have to feel everything. Having to feel feelings I never needed to before that is triggering me. But, I'm able to deal with those feelings now. That doesn't mean that I don't ever feel like drinking, or stop considering moderating, because ""I'll be better this time."" Moderation is like the abusive boyfriend... it makes you think you can go back, are able to go back, and even WANT to go back. The best thing about that? That is now a trigger. The fleeting thought about going back and seeing if it will work, THIS TIME. And I get to, I choose to, not drink and ignore that trigger.

So, I ask all of you... What are your triggers currently in your sobriety journey? How deep does it go for you... are you able to sit through them, or Do you need to vent or scream them away?

I hope every one of you has a kickass Wednesday!

First time in over 7(?) years. Getting through 2020,, and a death in the family in late 2019 drove me to drink pretty hard. I have a supportive family but I still was using lots of beer and vodka to escape at night and especially on weekends. I was also enabled by working from home.Then by June 2020 the daily anxiety was terrible and the new physical withdrawals (shaky hands, sweats, hot/cold flashes, nausea) started happening earlier and earlier each day. During the fall I needed 2 or 3 beers before noon just to steady the ship, and I felt so cold every morning I would get back in bed at least twice before noon. By December I knew I had a real problem so I tapered down to 12 beers a day and not before 4pm, but the shakes and sweats were still coming on by 3pm. I was reducing a little more but then 2 weeks ago I felt like I sprained my toe but I didn't. 2 days later my right foot hurt so bad I couldn't walk. I had fucking Gout. Yes decades of drinking thousands of beers and eating crappy delivery through 2020 finally hit my joints in my foot and knee. I had never experienced a disease because of drinking and I finally realized after 8 drinks last Tuesday night (1/26) that alcohol is actually killing me. Wednesday sucked but I powered through it and I got meds for my Gout. By Thursday I could walk and the nausea and shakes were minimal. The last 3 nights I slept more than 6 hours a night. No anxiety since Saturday, and my bowels are normal. Totally fucking worth it. IWNDWYT.",14,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.70580816}"

My problem is I have pretty bad anxiety and going to bed and falling asleep is very difficult. This started when I worked at a bar and would get home at 2 and have to be back at work at 11am, I’d have a few drinks to help me fall asleep. That was 2 years and and since then I’ve been using alcohol to calm my anxiety and fall asleep. I can go days without drinking and sleeping is still hard but, I cannot have 1 drink and go to bed. I have to have 3-4 drinks to be able to sleep. It’s either drunk and sleep well or totally sober and sleep okayish. This has also made sleeping in places other than alone in my bed difficult.

The anxiety went away for part of the moring but was back later on in the afternoon so was the uneasy feeling in my stomach. It was at that point that I knew alcohol would be the death of me.

However, I am trying sobriety with February- the shortest month of the year....

I am 25, in my last semester of college, I recently went home with my boyfriend to visit my (repressed, emotionally toxic, passive aggressive WASPy) family. He is the first person I’ve ever dated and first person I’ve introduced to my parents.

I got extremely drunk 2 nights in a row, to deal with my family, who he witnessed be emotionally abusive and toxic. I am the black sheep, the youngest, the “artist”, the identified patient, etc. and they all rag on me constantly. 

My partner is supportive and loves me, but he says he can’t deal with blackout me, who turns into a totally different person. I completely understand, and agree I need to make changes. 

I have been blacking out since I was 16, thanks to an eating disorder that makes it easier to do so. 

I have childhood trauma and some CTPSD I need to address (a covert narcissist parent) and an eating disorder of nearly 10 years that I worry will become inflamed during this period of no drinking. 

I am the ultimate self-saboteur, so with my first relationship, and last semester of college, I am feeling tempted to make some bad decisions.

The uncertainties of real life, jobs, the pandemic, etc. feels so daunting. Nothing feels within my control. 

I want to graduate, move away from my family, and live the life *I* want, without squeezing myself into the box my parents want me in. But I don’t have the confidence that that is a possibility (logistically) or that I am capable of doing it if it is.... But I know I’ll slowly die if I stay here. 

Anyone else have a similar struggle or words of wisdom they can share?

Day 1 after that was much better, didn't feel super bad withdrawal, but still was a little anxious and I felt a little ""unsteady"". Just like the house is shaking slightly but I know it's not.

Today is day 2 with no alcohol. I had a solid trigger tonight....going to be home alone for the evening, with the day off tomorrow. Made it through the worst part of that and now dont feel like ""wasting"" the day by having any booze. Withdrawal symptoms going away. Feel my heart beating kinda hard, but less hard than the last 2 days, and way less hard than many of my drinking days. Pulse is normal. I'll take a melatonin and have a night time tea in a while.

I went to doctor today to get Antabuse today as its the one sure fire way I know I won't drink for 30 days.

The lady behind me ended up paying the difference and told me to pay it forward.

For years I could never really get my weight to where I wanted. I wasn't too overweight to the eyes, but not healthy either.

Through this quitting drinking process, I've discovered some things:

1. Doctor has me watching my salt intake like a hawk (liver issues). I've never done this before and it's a bitch frankly. But the end result, besides less salt, is it has really forced me to pay close attention to what I am putting in my body. Sure, I allow myself cheat days, but I've never paid this much attention to it before, and what a difference it makes.
2. Stopping filling myself up with alcohol, beyond the obvious benefits that we most frequently talk about here, has also had awesome health benefits. Certainly at the end I was consuming obnoxious amounts which creates so many problems. But even back in college when I drank like a ""normal"" college student, simply the amount of extra calories was having effects that I didn't really pay attention to because I was working out and very active.

So, no  wonder I couldn't get to the proper weight!!!! I've now lost 50lbs, and feel great and look so much better. Even my old clothes fit!!

I helped my sister move away from her alcoholic abusive husband today. Bittersweet as she finally took the leap and left her children and home behind (one biological son (13) and two stepdaughters she’s raised since toddlers (now 16 and 22). It was sad to see her pack up all her belongings. We had some major laughs though because her best friend helped us and she’s a hoot and they’re even more a hoot and half together haha. 

My sister is also a major high functioning, beer drinking alcoholic. 

She’s admitted this to me while we were both drinking once but we’ve never brought up hers again. She apologized jokingly in advance for the random empty cans of beer that were hidden in the house. There were a lot. She makes wonderful money as a travel ER nurse, raises wonderful children and keeps a beautiful home. She drank really hard last night, about a 12 pack of beer she said. However I know this is every other night if not nightly. I smelled beer on her breath and she said she drank one because of her nerves. She was shaky, anxious and emotional basically the whole time. Obviously it would have been that way anyways because she was nervous that he would come home whilst we were loading up.

Her mother is also a major alcoholic. So naturally she would not readily admit to her own problem. 

However I know alcohol withdrawal and what it looks like. I’ve been to detox and I’ve experienced it and seen others go through it. 

She looked at me at one point while we were alone as she was slouching across the banister after moving her mattress up two flights of stairs and said “I can’t stop shaking I’m so nervous haha” I said to her “you think you might be withdrawing?” She responded with giving me the oddest look. Not as to say ‘fuck you’ but as to say, ‘you think maybe? Have I gotten myself to that point?😢’ . So here’s to hoping that I may have gotten through to her today and maybe she will spiral up rather than down during her expected messy divorce. 

As for me, I’m depressed and I’m pissed the fuck off. I’m beginning post acute withdrawal. I want a drink. But guess who can’t? Me. Because who’s keeping accountability of themselves? Me. Who’s taking back control of their life? Me. 

Sis had so much beer in her fridge I could have gotten toasted while we were moving but I didn’t. Small victory. 🥳

Like so many, the COVID quarantine has made my drinking problem so much more glaringly obvious to me. It's habitual. I have to drink every day, even after telling myself in the morning that I won't. I have no happy hours or parties or social events to blame it on. It's just me and a bottle of wine...every day. And I derive no joy from it. I'm stuck in a hamster wheel and am just in this constant low simmering bummer. 

Because I am fully quarantined, it's not even like I'm doing anything risky, embarrassing myself, spending too much money, blacking out (though over the course of my 20 year love affair with alcohol I have certainly had all of those problems). I don't have a lot of negative consequences with my drinking...other than just feeling like a joyless, worthless piece of shit lol. 

And frankly, that is enough and should be enough.

I was able to go 18 days from December 20-January 7. On January 7, I followed the Georgia runoff and was overwhelmed and ended up drinking every last drop of alcohol in my house. I had managed to make it 18 days despite 2 cans of beer and some whiskey in the house, so I woke up the next day feeling kind of bummed that I blew my streak, but also happy that the house was booze free and I could keep going.   


I went another 14 days (January 7-January 21). I got into a big fight with my husband. He was being a total dick, and I was so sad and belittled by his unnecessary behavior and hurtful words. I decided that I would get drunk that night (he doesn't even notice my drinking). Knowing myself, and knowing the way I was feeling, I bought 3 bottles and proceeded to drink a bottle every night that weekend.   


I ended up back on my same old bullshit (bottle of wine a night) for 10 days.   


I told myself on January 31 that there is a lot to be positive about:   


* I managed to go on two good streaks in 2 months. 
* I clearly see where my triggers were (getting too worked up on the election night, getting into a fight with my husband).
* I haven't given up.
* Ultimately, every day is DAY 1 for alcoholics. It doesn't matter if I had 18 days and blew it. All that matter is today.

My last post seemed to resonate with people so I thought I'd share my favourite notes from yesterday's session. This last month has been the time for a lot of reflection that I've been avoiding for many years. I think most people trying out sobriety for the first time are likely surfing the same waves as me, uncomfortable and intimidating. Being forced to accept for the first time that your drinking is and has been a problem. That you're not a ""normal"" drinker. That you never will be, even if you knew it all along.

My unhappiest moments over the years have always been surrounded by the same thing, regret. It started in high school - feeling sick to my stomach that I hooked up with a guy and didn't remember it because I was so drunk, blacking out again, and again, and again. This carried on into college - ""I'm only having 4 coolers tonight! It'll be a good night"" the next morning waking up to blank memories. Sometimes I'd get by with little embarrassment, other times I'd make a complete fool out of myself. For someone who's always cared a lot about how I present myself and how others think of me (not my favourite quality) I couldn't comprehend how I could manage to do it time after time. Humiliate myself with \*whoever\* in November, apologize and make amends in December, humiliate myself again even worse in January. It killed me, and still kills me to this day.

Whenever my mind starts to wander in a negative direction, it's never fear of the present or fear of the future that upsets me. It's ALWAYS extreme feelings of regret and anxiety towards my past actions. I think about what people must've thought, what people must still think to this day, how poorly it represented everything that I try so hard to be. It goes so far that I convince myself I completely destroyed my college experience with my binge drinking, that EVERYONE thought and thinks I'm the most screwed up person they know. The truth is, 80% of it was great, but that's not how I remember it now.

\*Cue my therapist\*

1. Everything is relative. What might go down as one of the worst nights of your life wasn't necessarily the worst for someone else. Remember all of the times you've been around for something that a person is SO upset about the next day, do you hold it against them for the rest of time? No.
2. The good can outweigh the bad. Even if you've put the same person(s) through many drunk instances, what you are to them majority of the time and moving forward can gain back what's been lost from the alcohol abuse (in my case, at least). Show them maturity, accountability, gratitude, kindness, and most importantly - effort being made towards positive change.
3. DON'T HATE YOURSELF! This one is so damn important. At the end of the day, you are the only person who has to live with you for the rest of your life. Make your brain a safe place to be. Educate yourself on forgiveness, mindfulness, and what it means to let go of the past in order to take on a better future.
4. Adulting is a process. Enough said.
5. Nobody cares about it as much as you do (I'm not married and I don't have kids, this one might not work for everyone). If it wasn't life-alteringly important, they're not thinking about it. People have their own lives and own issues to worry about, stop assuming that everyone is obsessing over yours.
6. SHIT HAPPENS. Life can be a bitch, people know that from their own experiences. Not everyone thinks that you're weak and impulsive, it's just not the case. The stigma surrounding mental health continues to diminish more and more each year. The judgement is minimal, 99% of the time people are concerned and want to help. They want to see you doing better.

3 nights ago, I thought I had more liquor left, and I was out. All stores were closed, and I franticly searched the house for anything to no avail. I came to the realization that this was going to be my first sober night in years. 

I recently had a job offer that is very good pay, better than the respectable one I have now, but wouldn't be as loose as this one I have is. 

So I went to bed around midnight, and stared at the ceiling for 8 hours with complete insomnia, nowhere close to sleep. All I could think about was how can I take this job and still keep drinking as heavy as I am now? I considered it for a solid two hours and then it hit me. What the hell am I even doing with my life? Why is this even a question, a great job or continue to destroy myself?

That night was the first day of my journey, I haven't gone to the liquor store, I haven't drank a drop, and the withdraw is becoming really hard. The thing that is scaring me the most is not only are my hands shaking hard, but my legs are weak and trembling also. My liver is in pain and i'm pissing orange. 

I went on a high water intake along with a liver cleanse hoping something will give, if I don't notice one in a week i'm going to the doctor. These shakes though, besides a prescription, is there anything out there to at least calm it down a bit? I'm having trouble taking a shower because my legs are geting wobbly, on top of my slight dizziness. This has been going on for the last 48 hours and it's scaring me because I don't know if it's possible this may be a permanent thing. 

I've also slept at best 5 hours total in the last 90 or so hours, the insomnia is torturous, melatonin and benadryl are doing nothing at all.

I will start off by saying that I appreciate these support groups, no matter where one is on their journey…

The truth is I am not even a whole 24 hours sober. But the other truth is that I know I feel better sober. I am the best version of myself when sober. Due to a traumatic domestic violence event that involved alcohol, I was sober for over 100 days in 2018, and then some on and off for the remainder of the year. Yes, it was not originally by choice but in the end I am grateful for that life changing experience, for it has made me a stronger woman.

I have read Quit Lit. “This Naked Mind” by Annie Grace and “Alcohol Explained” by William porter all have been great aides. But why do I still get the fuck it’s and choose to get a bottle of wine and then some even though I work early tomorrow and it’s Monday?

Like some kind of addicted Masochist.

Growing up I watched my mom have a craft beer or two almost everyday. For my now estranged father, it was tequila and beer, but he would drink to get drunk. On many occasions I have witnessed my father drunk. I don't like it. Last time we spoke he called me while he was drinking to say he was voting for Trump.....

Sorry if this seems ranty by now….

I may not be sober for very long, and I don't want to feel shame for starting over. But I’m not complete hopeless. And having this outlet is at least some help and more steps in the direction I want to go with my life.

Yesterday would have been 3 years sober for me, if only. If only what? If only I didn't take that first drink. What happened happened, and in nearly 1095 days sober (realistically just over 1000 days sober when the start of my relapse occurred) the shame that I took that first drink isn't going to weigh down on me like it would have 3-4 years ago. Relapses don't have to happen, but for this drunk it did, but it will not distract me from the fact that I CANNOT DRINK LIKE OTHER PEOPLE. I'm proud of my 5 day flair (which was just reset from a flair that said 2875 from alllll those years ago when I first started lurking on this sub).


I heard an interesting anecdote the other day about the difference between a problem drinker and a true alcoholic:

A problem drinker and a true alcoholic are both sitting in the drunk tank after a DUI arrest. The problem drinker thinks to himself ""man, why did I have that 5th drink!? I can't believe I did that!""
The true alcoholic thinks ""man, I should have had that 12th drink! It sucks in here and I could have used it""

I am that true alcoholic. I'm not a stranger to the drunk tank, or hospitals, or recovery centers, or Intensive Outpatient Programs, or AA meetings. January 31, 2018 I was arrested for what I swore was my last DUI, and I did a lot of things rights afterwards. I found a job in a very sober friendly environment, I went to close to 1000 AA meetings in my first 2 years, I got a sponsor, I worked the steps, I was S O B E R !

And things were great. All the AA promises came true for me. I kept getting raises at work, I got a promotion, I got my first car payment, I repaid a ton of debt, I made amends to everyone I had harmed through the years, I found a wonderful girlfriend (who was never a drinker anyways, win win win) and I bought a fucking house!

Things were so GOOD. What happened? What the fuck happened? With all this hard work I had been doing and all the progress I was making (and I knew very well that in the bottom of every beer glass, wine bottle, and 5th of liquor there was a rock) I still allowed that first drink into my body. My ego's desire to ""moderate"" my uncontrollable liquor consumption was unaligned with my relationship to Myself, Others, and God. I got carried away with what I *thought* I *deserved*. I forgot that my life was so good BECAUSE of my sobriety, that I was once and always an alcoholic and that I am mentally and physically different from other people when it comes to alcohol.

It started small- one alcoholic kombucha. I had never had one before, and hell, I love kombucha and I have control over alcohol now, so why not live a little? But for me, to drink is to die.

Luckily my amazing girlfriend was there for me. She found some of the empty kombucha cans I was shittily hiding in my drawers and she asked me about them; I made up an excuse and secretly continued to drink them on my way home from work or the grocery store and when I was outside in our yard away from her. Well, those little kombuchas didn't satisfy me for long and I bought a pint of 99 proof liqueur and drank it all in about an hour while I was outside shoveling snow. She confronted me that next day and it was the best hard conversation I have ever had. That was last Thursday, January 28th- my shiney new sobriety birthday.

This is the longest post I've ever shared, and it's mainly about me which makes me feel kind of weird. Not as weird as having a head full of AA and a belly full of booze though. Some are able to moderate, some are able to not crave alcohol at all, and some are like me, and every drink they take is a backward slide into lunacy and uncomfort until they're dead by the bottle.

Today is a good day though. I have a strong loving relationship with my wonderful girlfriend, a house that I own, and a peaceful mind. I woke up without a hangover or any sort of shame or regret this morning, and I pledge IWNDWYT!

I can’t believe I put myself through this again over something so preventable. I have disappointed my family and am bringing them down with me. Achieving my career of being a social worker will be much harder. And I’ll live with this over my head forever. I’m an alcoholic. I drink most days. When I drink it’s usually to get drunk. I tell myself a lot of days that I’m not gonna drink - usually end up doing it. I have no choice but to quit. I went through this with my first DUI - admitted I was an alcoholic but regressed once the legal aspect was over. I already know my life is gonna be hell because of this DUI. The state I live in does not go easy on DUIs, let alone repeat offenders. I’ve been looking up local AA chapters today. I feel miserable. Ashamed. Depressed. Terrified. Right now, the thought of sobriety is my only shred of hope.

I drink hard and heavy at night, cracking my first beer or slamming my first mini bottle as soon as I park my car in my driveway. I managed to take December off but New Years was too much to handle and I have been drunk as a skunk since. 

I have been what you would consider an alcoholic for the last 4 years of my life but it has recently gotten out of control. I’m 30 years old and I am concerned that if I don’t get this under control I won’t live to 40. I have a physical scheduled for the middle of April and I want to be sober, healthy, and not to be told that I’m dying from alcoholism.  

I hide it extremely well. No one really knows to the extent of which I drink. I don’t drink in the mornings or at work or drink and drive. But when I get home I drink myself into oblivion, 13 out of every 14 nights a week for the last several years. I’ll take a month off here and there. I embarrass myself at weddings and drinking related events. 

I have a successful career and no one at work knows about my problem. Not even close. I guess I just hate myself so much that the cycle continues to perpetuate. Sorry for the rant. I’m here now at the advice of a friend. Today was so hard. I cried in therapy for an hour about how much I hate myself and my life is being ruined.

Emotions. They’re hard for me. I’m a very logical person, I overthink most things. In arguments or when my wife shares her feelings I see the black and white and try to find an action or way to fix it. 

I feel joy, love, lust, excitement but I don’t show it physically. I guess I assume everyone knows? I don’t know. 
I have a very hard time discussing things (good, bad and sexual) in person and often prefer to do it over text; I’m also much better as expressing myself with written word than vocally. 

I often cry when I’m confronted with a difficult situation. If someone else is sad, mad, or frustrated I resort to crying and I’m sure why? Maybe the emotions I’m trying to feel are just so overwhelming and I don’t know how to express them and/or I want to physically do something to fix the problem but I can’t or in some cases I don’t even think of the right thing to do. (Example, hug a crying person).

I want to be more for the people around me but don’t even know where to start.

The last ""drinking night"" was especially bad, blackout, bad choices and shame/embarrassment/regret at the neighbours place (socially distant outdoor firepit night). I haven't brought myself to talk to the neighbours since (except apology texts). My wife was so embarrassed, but that led us to the choice to take a pause for awhile, no timeline if we will drink again or when.

I wanted to post about an eye opening experience I had a few months ago that cemented to me I have a drinking problem. To preface, I’m a 20 year old college student (M), I go to a small school where rampant drinking is common place and it’s even more normalized at my college than most other universities. 

I’d always been aware that I drank a little too much, especially for my age. However, I never thought I had a “problem” that needed to be addressed. Then the semester started.  I’m a psychology student and had an assignment in which I gave a mock alcohol abuse disorder interview to another student. 

As I was reading the questions, I was shocked at how much they resonated with me. I had never paid attention to the criteria for alcohol abuse disorder, mainly because it’s something I had never thought about or been exposed to. However, once I read over this manual, I realized that I meet more than sufficient criteria for alcohol abuse disorder. 

My initial reaction was embarrassment and shock, I became ashamed and isolated myself and have told very few people the extent of my drinking. After I got over the embarrassment, I became extremely angry with myself. I started drinking more and using alcohol as even more of a crutch and escape. 

I decided to post this because I binged hard this weekend. I was very very drunk each night Thursday-Sunday. Monday morning I woke up with not a hangover, but full blown withdrawals. I did not sleep at all last night due to dreams and cold sweats, and have not been able to eat. 

My girlfriend and a couple close friends are the only ones aware, all who have been very supportive. Just wanted to hop on here and write this out to see what this community has for advice/ guidance. My life isn’t in shambles, I have good family relationships, good friends, solid grades, and a great girlfriend.

I have posted on here numerous times about starting over, getting back up and staying consistent for a few days or week, then falling off again. 

Leading up to Christmas, I was able to string together my longest run which was 23 days, to which I then decided to get some beer and ended up right back where I started, cleaning up empty high point cans from the night before that I had stashed away because to everyone else in my life I was still ""sober"".

I thought that dry January would be my turning point, new year new you mentality, but I fell off the last week of 2020 and several days in to January, I let myself go again and have been on a roller coaster ride the last few weeks trying to fight the urge to head out and snag a couple high point beers and call it a day, and that has been the hardest thing for me hands down. 

I am tired of this rinse and repeat cycle, I am tired of saying I am going to commit to this and not following through after only a handful of days. I am tired of constantly working my ass off in the gym to lose weight and get healthier only to squander my efforts by kicking a few back. When am I finally going to say enough is enough? I hope that today is that day. 

I will be turning 34 at the beginning of March and I don't want to look bloated and red faced when I take a picture with my fiance.

She hides vodka in water bottles around the house and invariably my FIL will find them every 6 months or so and they’ll have a huge fight about it. FIL feels like she should give up drinking for him (like my husband did for me) and MIL feels like she’s earned the right to get her buzz on when she feels like it, as she’s been the primary earner of the house for decades. My husband gets thrust into the middle of these fights and needs to lean on me. I want to be supportive, it just really triggers me to see his mom like this. 

I think, that could have been me. I think about all her resentment and remember how I felt when I was binging. I remember how much I hated myself and I just feel so sad and panicked about reliving those feelings. It’s been over 4 years! When can I finally leave those awful feelings behind? 

And finally, I wish I could be a better support to my MIL (if she would even let me). I’m working with my therapist on all this, but no one understands like all you lovely people here.

All the while it's swiping your most valuable possessions from your drawers, surfaces and pockets while you're preoccupied. 

You idly mention to your friend that you've misplaced your healthy communication, and they insist that it'll turn up. Don't worry about it. You trust them.

You wonder out loud where your drive to exercise has gone. ""Pshh,"" they tell you, ""I don't remember you ever having one of those."" Huh. Must have misremembered. 

You ask them if they've seen your productive habits, ""Nope, can't say I have"" they respond with their hands suspiciously tucked behind their back. You shrug and move on.

It can take a long time to look up and realise that you're living in a half empty home, with most of the possessions you do have, poor forgeries of the real thing. You have a suspect in mind, but it might take time to admit to yourself that your best friend in tbe wold could do such a thing to you.

But once you know, you *know*. Kicking that toxic friend out on the curb, you can call the police. You can reclaim some of what was stolen from you. Some things you'll have to put real effort into tracking down, for some things you have to suck it up and make from scratch again, but slowly, surely, your house can feel like a home again. You can even acquire wonderful things you didn't even know you needed and have never had before. 

You'll meet new friends that make you wonder why you ever hung out with your old one, or reconnect with friends who you'd fallen out of contact with. 

You'll rebuild. You'll thrive. You might even forgive that old friend, for your own sake, but you should never, ever forget.

I didn't choose that date on purpose but it's kinda cool to look at lol. I had been a daily drinker for about 5 years, usually a few 8-10 percent malt wine cans a night, with occasional handles of vodka and whiskey during daily binges that would last a week. I had tried to quit before in the past, never getting farther than 3 months. What made me finally stop entirely was a health scare combined with a panic attack. I took a few sips and my heart would start pounding, and my body felt in pain like it was rejecting the alcohol after all these years. I was reading about what could be causing it and found out I was probably in the early stages of kindling due to heavy drinking and stopping cold turkey many times. I would never get hangovers or withdrawals so this came as a surprise. The first week I felt the most intense anxiety I had ever dealt with, worrying that I would have a seizure or heart attack. This sub helped so much in those early days, and continues to today. I got through it then dealt with all the feelings and emotions that I had been covering up with alcohol. Even after my health scare I was worried I might relapse again but the following month Covid shut down everything, so going to bars wasn't an option. I eventually got over the cravings and occasional nightmares where I had been drinking (which cause the worst feelings of guilt until you wake up)  and even gave up smoking weed a few months later in June. My resting heart rate came down from being in the 90s to low 60s. And just a few months ago I started feeling more confident in myself when out in public, something I never thought would happen due to my social anxiety, (maybe wearing masks everywhere helped lol).

I was on Day 13, and the weekends are extremely tough for me, but once I get to Sunday evening I’m usually okay. My BF and I had spent the day separately but both got home around 5pm. He had met up with a friend and had a few beers (I have no issue with him drinking while I’m not, and to his credit he has cut back quite a bit, especially while at home with me). We had a couple neighbors coming by around 6pm for a quick visit since we hadn’t seen them in several weeks (the idea was that they’d stop by for “a drink” and then head to a dinner reservation, which they invited us to, but I’m also dieting so I declined that). I told them I wasn’t drinking so it wouldn’t be a surprise. They showed up with their own drinks and a couple beers for my BF, and I had a LaCroix and I was mostly fine...I would’ve liked to have a drink, but it wasn’t really taxing my willpower quite yet. But then THEY STAYED until like EIGHT THIRTY, and they must have had about 4-5 beers each! My BF also got out this bottle of a handmade cocktail that we had gotten at Christmas to share with them, and they were really pressuring me to have some...”just a sip!” Argh... At this point I was just annoyed and wanted them to leave so I could eat dinner (I normally eat dinner at like 6:30, which is when I thought they were leaving!). Don’t get me wrong, it was awesome to see them, especially in Covid times when socialization is limited, but I was really not expecting/prepared to need this level of willpower on a Sunday evening. 

Anyway, I’m just venting...I am proud of myself for not slipping up, even with the peer pressure and the negative feelings that started to sneak in as they cracked their 3rd or 4th beer and I’m still sipping a LaCroix. I’m happy to say that I’m on Day 15 now, looking forward to the 21 day milestone (new habit!).

When I drank, I didn’t care if I was good enough for him. I didn’t compare myself to him, I didn’t feel inadequate or ugly anymore. I just simply didn’t care about this one thing that when I was sober, was constantly eating me alive. That’s why I drank. 

I got out of the shower and just broke down to my SO and explained all of this to him. But the most important part, is that I didn’t drink this time to cope with this feeling. And guess what?

Long time lurker, occasional commenter, alcoholic.

I'm Jezza, I've spent the past 19 years in the military. The military pride themselves in the work hard/play hard mentality and so for around 15 years, I specialised in the play hard section of their unofficial motto. Prior to stopping, I would have been easily able to count on one hand, the number of days I didn't have a drink in my entire career. Looking back today, its frightening and embarrassing.

I wasn't always a drunk but I was always a drinker.

I drank out of loneliness, boredom, social convention and ultimately, addiction.

There are two things that I recognised within myself that helped me realise that I had a problem and that I needed to make some massive changes, I want to share them with you in the hope that if your here and wondering, they make a connection with you.

1 - Buying stronger and stronger drinks. This was a very slow process, I started off with Carling and Fosters, moved onto Heineken and Stella, got bored of the volume and switched to craft beers, Brewdog being my weapon of choice. Punk IPA soon became Elvis Juice, which then became Mr President and ever more stronger beers. What did it for me though was when I was In the shop and instead of buying a four pack of beer, I thought to myself ""perhaps it would be better to get 8 cans instead"" - this for me, looking back was a massive turning point.

2 - Ditching family, friends and loved ones for alcohol. I can categorically state that I blew one long term relationship due to putting alcohol before everything. I came incredibly close to blowing my current relationship too. I recognised that on a Sunday night, I was dropping my girlfriend off home earlier and earlier so that I could stop by the off licence on the way back to pick up 4 cans for the evening, saying to myself that I would only drink 1 or 2, but drink all four anyway.

Alcoholism has a way of creeping up on you, it ingrains itself in your life and in many ways, becomes your life, it took me until I was in my mid 30's to realise this - I had my final drink the day before my birthday and started my counter the very next day - putting the money I was going to spend in a mason jar.

Exactly 365 days after I started putting money in that jar, I walked into the Omega Watches shop on Bond Street in London and purchased a Seamaster with the cash in the jar, change left over. I wear that watch every day as a reminder of how far I have come, each day sober compounding the last and re-enforcing to me that I made the right decision.

I have to say honestly, that this subreddit was a big motivation for me in my early days

I sincerely hope this post helps someone today.

**Deaths caused by alcohol hit a new high during the first nine months of 2020, provisional figures for England and Wales show.**

Between January and September, 5,460 of these deaths causes were registered - up 16% on the same months in 2019.

It is the biggest toll recorded since the records began in 2001.

The high rates spanned the period during and after first Covid lockdown, the Office for National Statistics figures show.

It reached a peak of 12.8 deaths per 100,000 people in the first three months of 2020 and remained at this level through to September - higher than in any other time on record.

As in past years, rates of male alcohol-specific deaths were twice those seen for women.

Experts say the coronavirus pandemic will have had little effect on how the data was gathered and recorded.

It is not clear how much it may have contributed to the deaths, however.

ONS spokesman Ben Humberstone said: ""Today's data shows that in the first three quarters of 2020, alcohol-specific deaths in England and Wales reached the highest level since the beginning of our data series, with April to September, during and after the first lockdown, seeing higher rates compared to the same period in previous years.""

""The reasons for this are complex and it will take time before the impact the pandemic has had on alcohol-specific deaths is fully understood.""

My adult baby bro is 10 years younger than me and has been struggling with addiction for a couple of years now. Last year he was admitted to the hospital after a binging night, in which he passed out, hit his head, and would have died if some girls hadn't found him in the lying in the street when they did. This wasn't the first incident but definitely the most extreme and it has shaken our little family to the core.

I have my own issues with alcohol but I was never in an extremely risk situation (if you don't count the one night stands who could have murdered me). But lots of embarrassment, money spent, friendships and potential romances ruined, and decline in physical and mental health. 

I'm ready to leave this all behind, and I'm doing quite well.  But whenever my brother has a relapse, I want to relapse too. I'm using all my energy to be strong and a good role model to him, but it's just so painful. I wish I could take his pain away, or find a path for him. He's at the stage where he has anxiety, trouble sleeping and strong cravings, the whole thing. The other day I woke up at 3am to his suicidal thoughts messages (I got lucky I checked my phone!). I don't know whether to suggest rehab. On top of this, my family is very religious, so there's the added pressures of god-can-fix-this-lets-go-to-church, which isn't helpful as we both outgrew our religious backgrounds (he's an Atheist now). On top of the top (!), I live in a different country so I can't give that personal moral support.

Alcohol and other unhealthy coping puts up some kind of shield I guess, dulls the pain, dulls the intensity of everything and brings it down to a bearable level.

2021-02-02 01:14:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lap60b/here_goes/,Here goes.,"Hi all. I’ll start with this—I’ve drank nearly every day of this pandemic, but my problem certainly didn’t start then. It has certainly exacerbated things, but before that it was mostly every other day, and before that, it was every weekend, and—you get the point. At some point I got to the point where I realized I couldn’t go a day without. I recognized that I had a problem but every day I would tell myself I’d stop, nighttime would roll around and the urge became too much. I began hiding bottles in my room, empties and fills, and taking out my trash in a separate trash bag in the middle of the night so my roommate wouldn’t see because I was so ashamed. I’d try to hold out and then end up walking to Whole Foods at 11 pm in the rain to get a box of wine because the liquor stores closed at 10. 

When I would go to visit my parents on a weekend and we would have a couple of glasses of wine while watching a movie, I would wait until my mom would fall asleep on the couch so I could sneak a little bit of alcohol from each different bottle in the kitchen (it didn’t matter what kind) so that it wouldn’t be obvious that I’d taken anything, because two glasses wasn’t enough anymore.

I could go on and maybe someday I will, I’m sure many of you have similar stories. I know I’ve read and resonated with a lot of them. I thought for me, this might be a good place to start. I know it sounds silly but today is the third day in a row I haven’t drank in... honestly I couldn’t tell you how many days or months. Logically I knew I must have been doing serious harm to my body but I didn’t want to confront that reality yet. 

Right before this weekend, I had gone one day without drinking because I was too nauseous from the day before and couldn’t really keep anything down. I was woken up the next morning by what felt like a seizure. I’m not positive if it was or wasn’t, but I know it was terrifying. It was humiliating. It was incredibly sobering (pun intended?). 

I’ve known for a while that I need to stop, that I need help, but now I’ve really been forced to come face to face with what could happen if I don’t. I’m only 25, I can’t keep using my body as a punching bag to avoid thinking/coping with well, everything else. It doesn’t even make me happy. It doesn’t make me feel good. I’m just addicted.

Now that I’ve gotten past that initial first couple days and my world hasn’t fallen apart I really, really want to keep trying. I know it’s not that easy but a week ago I couldn’t even imagine going a day without it, so at least I know now I can take that first step. I don’t have any alcohol left in my apartment right now (it took everything in my not to order whatever was still open and would get to my apartment quickest when I ran out on Saturday), but I’m going to make every effort to stop buying it. If I have it in, I know I’ll drink it, and I’m at a place where I know if I start drinking I can’t stop until I’m numb. I’m not the kind of person who can just enjoy a glass wine or two or a nice cocktail over dinner and call it a night anymore.

I’m going to tell certain family and friends so that they can help me hold myself accountable, because part of the problem is that no one knows. I’m still “functional” enough to hide it well, so they don’t think twice when I reach for a third glass of wine or pour a little more vodka in my coke on a weekend night. 

Anyway, I just wanted to put it out there. I want to hold myself accountable. I’m not even 30 and I can already feel the toll this has been taking on my life, my body, and my wallet. I want to be healthy, and I want to get better. Wish me luck.",7,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5267043}"

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Today, and EACH DAY for the last 358 days, I've come to this vary spot to commit to not drinking TODAY ONLY. I'll stop by Reddit>Stop Drinking>Daily Check In, every morning to type the letters ""I"", ""W"", ""N"", ""D"", ""W"", ""Y"", ""T"". It's an acronym like every other, so, why give a damn about these letters?

I've thought about this (don't judge me, I have a job where I can let my mind wonder). For me, I think it's the control I have doing it. I get to make the decision, I get to see it though to completion. I get to CHOOSE not to drink today. That's power. Nobody is going to make me drink, just like nobody is going to make me NOT drink.

Who cares about typing those exact letters, in that precise order to this group of people. Think about that for a second... why does it matter what 277,000 complete strangers think? Why do I use these letters to feel like I've been given the key to ""OZ"", if only for one day? It's because if I tell someone that I am going to do something, even a misfit bunch of internet strangers, I'm going to keep my word, apparently.

Once I was lucky enough for whoever it was, whoever decided that it was their time to help a newbie that morning, to be taught the meaning of the letters... I was in. I had signed up at the door, taken the blood oath, given the secret handshake, I was ready for the key to the clubhouse. Time to get a little rowdy in here, turn up the music, shake the walls and scare the neighbors. (Fuck you anyway r/silverpolishingforbeginners and r/supermansundercrackers , I don't think they pay their rent).

I'm not asking what this group means to you, because I think each one of has answered, ""this community means the world to me,"" one hundred times to one hundred people. I'm asking you... what does it mean to you to be here in this group every day, week, month; however often you come by to pledge? What do the letters IWNDWYT mean to you? What do you get from the DCI? (These are not separate questions. This is all encompassing.)

I hope you all have a badass Tuesday, and enjoy every second of it you are able.

Later folks!

2021-02-02 00:46:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/laoqfd/made_it_through_dry_january_however/,Made It Through Dry January! However...,"...I'm proud of myself for sticking with sobriety through January, and I've been enjoying a lot of the benefits that come with it (better sleep, sense of accomplishment, saved a lot of money, feeling and looking healthier, etc), but now that it's February, I'm stuck at a crappy crossroads: try drinking in moderation, or stay sober moving forward.

The last few stints of sobriety I've had (4-7 months at a time), I'd be totally fine and happy in the beginning, but after a few months in, I'd reach this point where I felt like I was about to literally die from stress, anger, resentment, and sleep issues, all stemming from completely exhausting myself by trying to push myself to stay constantly busy to keep my mind off of drinking. 

I already have a shitload on my plate as is; I work from home full-time, I'm a full-time single parent to a 5-year old boy who hasn't gone to in-person school full-time since last March and has only spent maybe 3-4 days total with his Dad since the pandemic hit (not the ex's fault, he adores our boy and does video calls with him every weekday, but he lives over 1000 miles away from us, plus, you know, Rona lol), and I'm working on completing my bachelor's online, ALSO FULL-TIME. On top of all this, I work out regularly, take care of our dog, keep our house clean and organized, and I have quite a few hobbies (art, singing, drumming, etc). 

Having a drink after a full day of all this completely on my own, after my boy went to bed and all my responsibilities were met always felt like the only actual break I got, but those 1-2 beers or glasses of wine every now and then would always wind up multiplying like rabbits until I was slamming down 4-6 glasses of wine every night, getting shit sleep, and getting heart palpitations and the shakes by lunch. It was fucking insane and stupid, and made me feel like hot garbage. 

But I also felt like hot garbage when I stayed sober for months on end, since I'm busy with everything from the second I wake up in the morning until the second my head hit the pillow at night. Stuff like meditation doesn't chill me out (and I loathe yoga with a passion), and asking family or friends or even my kid's Dad/my ex to take the boy for a night or two to get a break isn't an option because everyone lives between 300-1000 miles away from us PLUS the pandemic. I don't mind doing all that I do, and I love my boy, my job, my college classes, and our dog and all of my hobbies, and I don't want to give up any of what I do or who/what I'm responsible for, but holy *dammit*, is it ever fucking exhausting handling all of this completely solo, even more so while trying to grapple with low-grade alcoholism fucking with my mind. 

What's worse is that on the rare occasion where I have nothing to do for my classes or job, the house is clean, the kid's asleep and the dog is chill, and it's a rest day for my exercise routine, being inactive and trying to relax for even just a couple hours feels like torture. So I wind up filling the time with hobbies, browsing online, watching TV, or playing a video game, which is all good, but then I go to bed feeling pissed off for feeling unproductive, like no matter how much I accomplish or achieve, sober or otherwise, it's never enough. Booze cancelled that feeling, and felt like it was okay to simply relax and exist without having to be doing something. I know it's part of alcohol's bullshit, but as of yet, I haven't found another way to let myself feel like it's okay to take time to truly relax.

So my biggest fear is that because I have so much on my plate and no options to delegate anything to even temporarily to let myself slow down and alcohol was the only thing I found that let me feel like it was okay to relax whenever I get the opportunity to do so, I'll go through that same awful cycle over and over again until my kid either leaves for college or I eventually keel over dead from either alcohol-related illness or a massive stress-induced stroke. 


Basically: WHAT DO I DO. I don't want to wind up drinking again, I feel much happier and sharper and healthier without it for the most part, but I also don't want to feel constantly pressured by myself to be busy if I'm sober either. It's like I need to learn how to trigger my mind into feeling like it's all right to relax while sober, but I don't know how to do this because for so many years, alcohol time = relax time, and I never learned how to do this without booze.

Weed isn't an option as an alternative due to my job, and again, stuff like meditation and yoga just makes me angry and tense (I've tried throughout my life to force myself to get into it, but it does nothing but irritate and infuriate me for some reason lol), and I absolutely cannot and will not reduce my time I dedicate to my job, school, my kid, or my dog, so any advice for me? 

Is there any special tricks for staying sober as a die-hard workaholic? Or anyone else here who can relate? I feel like I'm damned if I do drink and damned if I don't drink, and that's not a good mindset to have.

Thanks in advance, and sorry for the long post, just a lot to get out. This community is amazing and has helped me more times than I can count, not just in sobriety.

PS: Before anyone even suggests it, yes I've been through therapy, and it's helped me work through other, much deeper issues in the past, but with this particular issue of being a workaholic and using booze as a form of escape/relaxation, they've always either recommended meds to basically conk me out (which FUCK no), meditation/yoga/fancy breathing exercises (ditto to the fuck no), or making and achieving new goals, exercising, or finding new hobbies, which is the route I took and how I wound up with a zillion hobbies I like and a bunch of goals I'm totally crushing and loving, but left with no time or any way to actually relax and no tools to learn how to relax sober, aka my current shitshow 🤣",4,"{'pandemic': 2, 'rona': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49633047}"

I started by having a White Claw at a camping trip over the summer. A couple of months later, a mimosa with my sister in law. Good so far, no alcohol in my house, just a social drink now and then. 

After a couple more similar occurrences, I decided to buy a hard cider one weekend while my daughter was away and drink it at home whilst doing projects. That went ok, and I did that a couple more times.

Then, a few weeks ago, I had a frustrating call at the end of the work day and while at Costco that evening, I bought a bottle of wine. I knew this was dangerous because wine used to be my thing, and having a whole bottle in the house as opposed to a single serving of hard cider was a big risk. To hell with it, did it anyway.

I ""only"" drank half the bottle that night (by the way, amazing how quickly my tolerance was nearly back to its 2015 level).

More bottles over the next few weeks, including about a bottle and a half a couple of Saturdays ago which I also spent listening to sad music and crying over my good friend who committed suicide over the summer. He had developed a big drinking problem. Tried to get me to drink with him many times. I wouldn't.

Yesterday, I busted into the wine mid-afternoon. This morning I couldn't remember most of the evening, including whether or not I fed my dog dinner.

That isn't going to fly. I decided part of my issue was I was lacking in accountability, since I'd never reset my badge on my last account here. Unfortunately when I went to do that today, I locked myself out and so here I am, with a new account and brand new freaking badge that I'm proud of, even though it reads one day instead of about 1800.

Hey! 1 month and 2 days sober today. I’m so proud of myself and have been feeling really good. This weekend I’m going to my family holiday home with my partner and some friends and they’ll likely be drinking at the house, which is fine (I can drink my non-alcoholic Rosè, lol). But on one of the days the plan is to go to a Winery/Distillery, and I’m scared. I’m scared I’ll want one.. or ten. Are there any tips that anybody can give me to avoid the craving, because I would like to go and have fun just without drinking! Or should I just accept the fact I should maybe avoid it altogether and stay home that day or go surfing while they all go?

Keep in mind, this group of friends are incredibly supportive and would never convince me to drink and my partner probably won’t be drinking either, so I would be with a safe group of people.

I never would have imagined I’d make it this far. Also, looking back, I’ve had many bad nights drinking and been ashamed of my actions. I thought for sure if I ever stopped drinking, it would be because I had the worst drinking night of my life. 

However, my last time drinking was having a few glasses of whiskey on Christmas Eve and going to bed early. I felt really bad that I had been too tired to hang out with my family that night and just decided on Christmas Day to tell my wife about my decision and she’s been very supportive ever since. It feels kinda weird to have quit without a super embarrassing story, but in retrospect, I’m glad I did and stopped before I got to that point.

After the exam results came in I noticed that my vision has actually slightly improved since my last visit. ""How strange"" I thought. Eyesight generally doesn't improve with age.

On the way home it dawned on me that my last eye exam was a few months before I decided to stop drinking -basically when I was at my worst.

I can't prove any causality here -but I'm pretty sure by not guzzling a handle of Evan Williams everyday my eyes were able to regain some of their mojo. It's cool to see a tangible advancement. It makes me wonder what other improvements sobriety has added to my life which have gone unnoticed.

I finished *Of Human Bondage* late Friday night and had just had a notice that a Kindle hold was now available for me to checkout from my library. I do not remember who or where I got this reccomendation for this one from. I've had it on hold for about 2 months so obviously I put it on hold at some point and then forgot all about it.

It's called *Leave the World Behind* by Rumaan Alam and I clicked it open as I was sitting down to lunch Saturday afternoon to read at something while I ate. I ended up clicking it closed at about 8:00 p.m. Saturday night after having finished it in one sitting! I haven't done that in a while. It pulled me in by having me thinking it was one of those literary fiction novels about an affluent liberal couple in a big city dealing with the usual things like too much screen time for the kids, maybe one or both of them would be having an affair or thinking about it in a midlife crisis sort of way, there might be a Proust reference, that sort of thing ya know-- which I thought would be refreshing after the heaviness of *Of Human Bondage*. Well, it sort of was that kind of thing but there was a whole lot more going on with it than that and I won't spoil it for anyone except to say that, in its way, it was every bit as heavy or heavier than *Of Human Bondage*.

So there's a lot of drinking in *Leave the World Behind* and it definitely could be triggering for some of you guys. I didn't feel that from it, but me at 6 months sober might have found it challenging. So with that said, if you're feeling trigger-proof, I'd encourage you to read it. It has nothing useful to say about sobriety really, so I apologize for a lack of sub relevance. But it's a fine read and I'm interested in reading more from this author now. If you're going to talk about this book in the comments (and I really really hope you will! I'm dying to discuss with someone else who's read it!), please [use the spoiler tag](https://www.reddit.com/r/puzzles/comments/8vs7c3/please_use_reddits_official_spoiler_tag_format/). This book is very new and very spoil-able so I think it's warranted here.

I ensure you it’s a huge relief to admit you can’t do it alone. 
My whole life my mother has suffered from horrible depression and anxiety and so have I. My brother has too but unfortunately I seem to have inherited the alcoholism that plagued my grandparents. 
My family has apparently “known” I’ve had this issue for 3 years but it took me admitting it to lift some of the weight off of my shoulders.
It still hurts. After years of trying to deal with it alone I suffered a horrible broken heart and threw away a handful of job opportunities and was self medicating with alcohol to deal with it all. Every time I drank I was a “happy drunk” and finally didn’t have the inner turmoil and racing bad thoughts. Reoccurring bad memories and constant replaying of hurtful things people have said or done to me. But sometimes being a happy drunk doesn’t mean it’s OK. It just postpones reality. 
On Saturday night, blackout drunk, I FaceTimed my parents and told them I need to hit pause on everything, come home and stay with them while I go to therapy.
I’m currently in bed drinking a Diet Coke and eating Oreos feeling like a sad sack but atleast I’m trying something new.... saying no to Denial! 
I’m two days sober and if I keep this up I will share a sober birthday with my dad’s actual birthday. Which is kind of nice because he is my favorite person on earth. 
Please pray for me. I’m supposed to return to NYC and get back to work at my dream job (after telling the employer I need five weeks to get myself together).... My plan A was drinking through the pain and probably repeating past mistakes forever until rock bottom.
Wish me luck. Best of luck and lots of love to all of you as well.

I decided to share some of the bigger milestone and mindset pieces here in their entirety. I'll put a link at the bottom for those who want the Non-Reddit format and photos.

**The Article**

*I’ve been binge drinking since I was 13…*

I’m currently 33 and as of now I'm over 6 months sober. That’s right, after two decades of all in drinking, I found a way to finally stop.

I don’t share binging as some “party boy” humble brag; it’s embarrassing and if I could go back in time I’d slap the shit out of myself, but it’s who I was and I want that to be understood before you go any further.

My earliest memory with booze was having people sneak me drinks at family parties, sneaking drinks at cookouts, stealing liquor with my friends from their parent’s stash, and getting suspended in 7th grade for drinking at school.

From the beginning I knew I had an issue; my friends could drink and be cool; I went hard, puked, blacked out, and was just an ugly sloppy person.

I share this as someone who **never** thought I would be able to say I was 6 months sober. 

I legit accepted I was a broken toy and that all I needed to do was avoid getting a DUI or drunk in front of the kids.

Then for some reason a combination of personal introspection along with my friends [Ed Latimore](https://edlatimore.com/) and [Phil Foster](https://philfosterfitness.com/) offering guidance that parted the clouds for me and I saw the light…

To say it was unexpected would be the understatement of the year.

To say I have any regrets would be an insult because I have not looked back once.

I do not miss alcohol and have to fight the urge to demonize it and preach the good word of sobriety because honestly, I hate the time and money I wasted on that liquid poison…

But let’s not focus on the past, let’s talk about 6 lessons I’ve learned these past 6 months being alcohol free.

**1. Success Begets Success**

Choosing to do one thing right leads to you doing the next thing right.

“*I’m going to stop drinking*” led to:

I’m going to get more consistent with my lifts now that I’m waking up without a hangover or being tired from staying up late.

*Which led to:*

I’m going to start eating much cleaner because you can’t out-exercise a bad diet.

*Which led to:*

I’m going to get my hormone levels check

*Which led to:*

I’m looking better, now I want to make my mind stronger, I’m going to really dive into my writing and podcasting...

You get the point; I could honestly list 10+ more things like being a better husband, father, less anxious, better memory, no worries about driving, and not a single morning wondering how my night ended…

**2. Alcohol Steals Time and Money**

Drinking had me spending hundreds of dollars each month.

Looking back, it’s truly fucking pathetic how much control I’d given over to the liquid poison. I’d literally tell my wife I wish we had more money to put into Crypto, then I’d go out and buy wine and liquor.

It’s stupid how much money I put into something which made me fat, sick, and nearly dead.

How many nights did I black out? How many holidays, reunions, and life moments did I miss or tarnish by acting like an idiot due to “celebrating” with alcohol?

How lucky am I that there was never a fire or emergency on one of the nights where I drank myself to oblivion, what if something happened? My wife and children would never forget that “*Dad wasn’t there*“. 

It never happened but knowing that it could have makes me sick to my stomach.

**3. Alcohol Kicks The Can To The Grave**

You want to “*deal with it later?*“

You can easily kick the can of facing your toxic relationship with alcohol to the grave; ultimately ending up with you going to your deathbed clinging to your sweet sweet booze.

I could have justified my intake for the rest of my remaining 60-70 years and honestly, **nobody would have questioned it.**

When I quit, everyone told me it was 2020 so I should wait a year and then others told me that I just needed to moderate. Nobody understood that I needed to do this for me and because of how normal it is to drink in our society, *not drinking* makes you the odd ball.

It’s easy to drink alcohol, everyone does it and nobody will fault you for doing so as well; not drinking though? It’s funny but not doing something is a harder thing to face than fitting in.

**4. Alcohol Does Not Make Anything Better**

I romanticized the hell out of alcohol (*so many do*) and I’d envision myself to be like Hemingway, an author who needed the sauce to both release the voice in my head as well as silence the suffering artist within me.

Alcohol doesn’t relax you; **it takes the batteries out of the smoke detector**, the fire is still burning in your life but when you’re drinking you don’t hear it. The problem of course is that you wake up the next day and everything is far worse.

Alcohol doesn’t make you funnier or more entertaining; you get repetitive, sloppy, slurry, excessively animated, and annoying.

I really noticed this when dealing with others and can only imagine how shitty of a drunk I must have been.

Alcohol doesn’t make you more creative; my best content has been written when sober. I’ve read things I wrote drunk, fucking garbage.

Alcohol doesn’t make you a better person, parent, spouse, or friend; no matter how bad you want to think it does, what movies and shows portray is not reality.

**5. Alcohol Does Not Make You A Better Person**

People think that you need to be able to “handle your booze” and that you have to go out for drinks with co-workers, friends, family, business partners after closing a big deal, etc.

We’re told that we need alcohol to have fun, that we need it to connect and let loose with others, we’re told that we need to drink because:

* Holiday
* Funeral
* Breakup
* Birthday
* Reunion
* Wedding
* Promotion
* Graduation
* Deployment
* Anniversary

I’ve learned in these past 6 months that I enjoy every single thing above so much *more* now that I’m sober.

I get to truly connect and celebrate with people, I get to enjoy the company and the occasion where before they all seemed like they were justified reasons to drink to excess

The happy life of friendship and joy was found when I wasn’t getting the marketed assistance of alcohol. 

I say marketed because alcohol tastes like shit, it doesn’t create a positive atmosphere, and it has caused more deaths than damn near any other legal drug.

There’s a reason billions (with a b) of dollars are spent to make this drug such a staple in society, they have to or we would see it for what it really is.

**6. Alcohol Numbs Emotions You Need to Feel**

Drinking to calm the nerves, drinking to relax, drinking to talk to guys/girls, drinking to get out of your house, drinking to deal with family, drinking to deal with stress…

All this consumption of alcohol is robbing you from ever developing the mental muscles needed to do these things on your own.

Learning how to deal with everything above is a part of living; it’s literally a part of the experience. 

How can you ever overcome the insecurity or develop the skillset if you never have to face the emotion or face the uncomfortable situation?

Maybe you need to face the pain of your past or deal with a situation in your life that you’ve been avoiding.

Don’t numb the emotion so you can “get away“, face it so you can stop running and for once in your life genuinely chill and finally, after however long you’ve been chasing peace at the bottom of the bottle, if you can do it without the booze you’ll finally find that relaxation and Zen you’ve been looking for.

Alcohol gets you chasing dragons;

you always think, “*The next sip, can, glass, shot, or bottle will make me happier than I am now*” and that happiness never comes and that’s because just like dragons, that moment doesn’t exist.

It’s been over six months and I want to say thank you to everyone in this subreddit who has supported me and continues to share their journey because knowing you, I, we aren't alone makes this even more possible.

Take care and as always, if you are struggling and want to talk it out, my email and DMs are open.

-Zac

It isn’t easy but I had candy and weed to help me out in the beginning. Then January came and my partner randomly said he wasn’t going to eat sugar for the month, I joined him abstaining and had weed to enjoy. This month, I am giving up weed, but nervous to be sober. It’s not like I’m high 24/7 (maybe on the weekends), and I never miss work because I wana smoke all day, but I do smoke a bowl a day (at night after all my shit is done). Now, I chug sparkling water as a distraction to avoid drinking and eating candy. Weed would be my go to wind down and coping mechanism and feel I need a distraction from this.

When you first got completely sober, what did you do to avoid impulses or ritualistic behavior?  Does anyone have something to suggest that would distract from smoking, like sparking water does for drinking?? 

I know we’re not supposed to swap out one thing for another, but I would like to have something at the end of the day that I enjoy as much as drinking and smoking (and eating candy) that doesn’t have so many negative health or societal correlations.

Please help (21 US mals),"I don't know where to put this and my brother uses Reddit so I don't want him finding this... this is the worst thing I've done in my life

I'm a Xanax and Kratom addict, and to some extent, an Oxycodone addict. My mom died in front of me when I was 16 of a Xanax and Oxycodone overdose and yet here I am, being a fucking idiot.

Basically my brother is a Xanax/Oxycodone addict and has a safe full of drugs. On NYE I was alone and desperate and I looked up how to break into his safe, and I did it, and from then until yesterday (last day doing it) I hit up his safe around 8 times. He had 7 bottles of 180 count Oxycodone and I took a lot of that. The high is incredible. He also has a bottle of 120 1 mg Xanax. I took that when I was overusing.

Now, I'm getting clean. I went to my doctor and lowered my Xanax down to 2 mg a day. I'm worried that I'll get kicked out/killed by my brother or cut off from the family if he finds out because he rationalizes his addiction and rationalized my mom but thinks I'm a piece of shit and won understand. There's so much Oxy that I know he won't out. I'm buying safe Xanax from a guy I know (I have a test kit) in bar form and putting back a lot of my 1 mg tabs into his Xanax bottle and then after that I'm throwing away what I'm using to open it.

I feel like a piece of shit. I understand that I'm an addict and a sick depressed anxious person with a fucked up brain and life who is completely loveless but this IS HORRIBLE. I am a liar and a thief and a piece of shit person for this and although I will take this to the grave and be self-assured when I dump enough of my prescription in his bottle and get clean - I don't know how to forgive myself. 

Please, someone help. My brother is much bigger than me and used to beat the shit out of me and my parents never did anything and I have PTSD which is the root of my self-medicating and addiction.

2021-02-01 19:55:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lajcrn/anecdotal_but_possibly_helpful/,Anecdotal but Possibly Helpful,"I want to share an experience that I am finding extremely interesting as it could be helpful to others. I want to preface this with saying this is MY experience. I am not a doctor, naturopath, herbalist, or Ayurvedic practitioner and this is not medical advice.

I have been a lifelong consumer of far too much alcohol since my mid 20’s. Pretty much every day but never to the point of losing jobs or anything like that. My go-to was two or three martinis a night or 2/3 a bottle of wine. (I could never finish a whole bottle!)

As you might surmise this steady alcohol consumption has taken its toll in the form of high blood pressure, sleeplessness, fogginess, forgetfulness, a bad fall once, and twinges of pain in my liver area. I knew I needed to stop ... but I couldn’t. I tried to cut down but that never lasted. ONCE I did quit for a whole year but went back to my old ways.

Anyhow, my BP was off the charts. I could hear my heart pounding in my ears (while not being able to sleep because of the alcohol!) My doctor prescribed BP meds that made me feel awful so I tossed them. I prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach. I started researching....

I discovered that both Hawthorne (leaves and root) and Sarpagandha caused your blood pressure to drop and it’s a very old remedy for hypertension. They can also be taken together. So I bought both and started taking them. By day three my BP had dropped considerably and I noticed something else .... for three days I had little desire to drink (maybe a small glass of wine but it was more like meh take it or leave it). After day three I had no desire for alcohol. Passing thought because it was a nightly habit but NO desire.

So I started researching this more, specifically Sarpagandha...used in India medicinally for centuries. It also goes by the name Rauwolfia. It was a synthesized BP med back in the 50’s. It was discovered one of its alkaloids, respertine, caused hypotension so was made into pill form and widely prescribed and very effective and cheap. Then some questionable studies came along that made it go out of favor for a different pharmaceutical. 

One of the side effects of this plant other than lowering BP is that it relieve’s anxiety. I think I’ve always been anxious and OCD on the inside but I come across way laid back on the outside. Lightbulb moment! I was trying my drink my closet anxiety under the table. The Sarpagandha took the whole edge off. I feel pleasantly relaxed yet sharp of mind, I sleep, and my BP is dropping nicely. I also discovered that reserpine is a dopamine antagonist so this is why during those first three days I’d pour a glass of wine at my usual time but it wasn’t all that appealing. It didn’t do much. It didn’t even taste great. 

As I stated, this is purely anecdotal as pertaining to me yet ever so interesting. I didn’t have to TRY to quit alcohol, I just don’t really care about it any longer. 

Might be worth discussing with your practitioner. It might react with other meds or other health issues. I don’t take any meds except the two herbs I mentioned and I’m otherwise healthy (knock on wood).

It took care of the hunger and the anxiety at once, and then of course, 20 minutes later, I needed another one. I’ve been sober a bit now, and I’m hungry right now, I haven’t eaten all day, and I’m unable to get myself to eat. I wanted to share how I’m processing my hunger right now.

I was hoping that when I got sober, I would finally be freed of thinking about whether to drink every day. The schizophrenia. 

The thing is, that in early sobriety, I’m probably going to have to deal with whether to drink every day. Every single day, maybe for a very long time.

So if that decision is going to be there every day whether I drink or not, here’s how I see my options. 

1. If I don’t drink today: When I have to deal with the decision again tomorrow of whether to drink, even if it’s difficult, it’ll seem a bit doable. And that little part of me that feels good about myself about what I’m doing will be there even when it’s difficult. The rest of today with this hunger might suck, but that little voice that is loving what I’m doing is still there.

2. If I do drink today: it’ll probably be kinda fun and relieving for the first hour or so... and then... I know what happens. But tomorrow... when I have to deal with the decision again tomorrow of whether to drink. That’s going to be hell. How I have to wake up tomorrow full of dread about the day, and how the eff I’m going to deal with the drinking decision later. How much more sad and depressed I’ll feel in the afternoon and evening because of the depressant in my body. How that little positive voice will be gone, and replaced by one of how bad I feel about myself because I keep remembering the day before. How I’m mad that I lied to myself yesterday that, I had a drink, it’d still be easy to resist today. And how I’m going to try to escape all of that all day.

Yes I’m hungry right now. And I’m getting positive associations with tequila. And I’m not going to put a depressant in my body just because of hunger. I’ll drink my coffee even if it means I sleep less. I’ll eat the most unhealthy thing I can think of if it sounds tasty. I’ll lay there and be hungry and do nothing if it feels right. But I’m not putting a depressant in my fucking body. I’m not creating hell tomorrow to avoid this pain right now.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.43822074}"

While doing this I was also not happy about my weight.  I have a physical job and lift weights but I would just kill progress with beer.  And of course when I have a buzz on pizza and chips just are amazing, right?!?

Anyway I decided to take a month off to make sure I could do it.  I honestly wasn't sure because it was such a bad habit I was in.  Well my first time was a breeze. I went all 31 days (October of 2017).  The next few years I did no booze Novembers.  Last year I decided I needed to push it up and didn't have a drop in September.

In college and for a few years afterwards I was a bartender so it probably comes as no surprise that I went from zero home bar to a fully stocked one within the first few weeks of lockdown. That was over 10 months ago. With little to no discipline drinking at home, the ability to turn video off on work calls, and endless time, I steadily and easily slipped into moderate to heavy drinking 4-6 days a week. Now at the end of my 20s the hangovers have compounded in severity and duration. The easiest choice was to keep the train running otherwise, as Archer said, “the collective hangover might kill me.”

I’ve been plagued by this time of year my whole life. The cold and dark winters often drove me into bars with friends. But seeing people and going to work held me accountable; if not just barely. This time around it’s been much more difficult. It finally got to the point where I was sneaking pulls when my partner and family were in a different room. To the point where I was always tired because I was staying up later than everyone else to drink more by myself. “In peace.” Then things started getting scary. 

Out of nowhere I started having trouble remembering anything when I started drinking, not just when it had been too much. I lost track of memories, conversations, and time. My anxiety skyrocketed almost every morning trying to piece together what I had said to whom and when. Scarier yet, it went on for a couple of months before I snapped out of it. 

That was 7 days ago.

A lot of hard thoughts, tough realizations, and much needed motivation has come from this sub. No matter where you are in your process, I’m proud of you. Keep going and remember: IWNDWYT!

i relapsed a week or two before reaching 1 year sober. i wish i wouldn't have but it happened. over the last 2 months i've drank a ton. there was a stretch where i was sober for 21 days straight but then i gave in. this past friday and saturday i drank myself into the ground. 20+ beers each night, drinking for like 12 hours straight each time. yesterday i was very ill and even today. the withdrawals were killing me. alcohol has done nothing for me again just like in the past. the only thing it has done is make me extremely depressed and very  very suicidal.

i saw that i contacted a ton of people friday and saturday night, specifically went out of my way to contact someone i shouldn't have. i don't know how i even function to do it. it's very scary to know that i'm so functional while being extremely blacked out.  i think that's what scared me even more today when i found out. what's to say i don't really harm myself one of these nights? i go to sleep without even knowing.

it's time to give it up again. to try and find some type of purpose. last time i was actually semi-happy with life. we'll see if i can get there again. it's going to be another journey. if i slip up or need support, i'll come here right away this time. i've felt ashamed and didn't want to for whatever reason.

Friendship, gossip & my sobriety so far.","I have been a heavy drinker for 22 years. I’ve tried many times to quit but peer pressure undoes it every time. I quietly quit in December because I want to be healthy when I’m old. 

Went for dinner at my good friends house on Christmas and didn’t drink. I just said jokingly I’m taking a break and drinking tea and reading books for now. I know this bothered him. He is a big drinker.  We have drank together for 15 years. Our wives are best friends, our kids are best friends.

They stopped in when dropping their kids for a sleepover. Stayed for hours and I made him a few drinks how he likes them but I didn’t drink. 

Went to his house for New Years Eve. My friend was upset I wasn’t drinking. He offered me drinks all night long and called me a pussy for not drinking(we are in our 40’s, grow up). I understand this. I’m the one who changed and he was drunk. he drinks espresso and smokes Parliaments all day and drinks vodka and red bull all night topped off with cbd gummies. Daily!

Our families ski together every week. I’ve been out there skiing and having fun because I’m finally not hungover or preoccupied with drinking. He doesn’t come or bails early. Of course when he did show, he offers some Fireball whisky while we are out there. Then he points out “oh, but your not drinking.” Enough back story. 

Today his wife texted my wife asking if I have a drinking problem.

I Have A Problem ???!!!! Take a look at your recycle bin. 

I’m confused. Maybe this is kindness. Maybe if I label myself with a problem they will stop trying to get me to drink?  Can I just not drink without having a “problem”?  Do I have to prove I don’t have a problem by starting to drink again?  Because that’s a problem. Here is that peer pressure creeping in. 

I’m super proud of my 57 day sobriety and would be happy to never drink again. I don’t think I should label myself with a problem. Being a non-smoker is healthy but being a non-drinker is a problem???? They are close friends, do I owe them an explanation?

Sorry that was a long post but I had to get this off my chest.  Other than that, being sober has been great. I consider it my hidden super power. ;)

I have a good engineering job which my performance hasn't been great with recently. I have got so many interesting projects at home that I have put on hold because soon as I get home from work, I just want to be numb. 2 nights in a row doesn't seem like much, but I cannot remember the last time I had that off.
Im at the stage now where I am always feeling ill, drink really affects my colitis which make me lose a lot of blood, dehydrates and an intensifies the hangover. I am having a colonoscopy at the end of the month to see how things are going in there.
I long for having energy, being productive and manage depression.
I am not looking forward to the many sleepless nights, palpations and sweats I have to come.

Wish me luck!


Morning of day 5. Barely slept. No sweating though. Up for work.
A bit groggy but super happy i have lasted this long. It has been many many years since I have had this time off.
Starting to feel more hydrated. Peeing more often and lighter in colour. One thing I forgot to mention, when I was chronically dehydrated, some of my joint injuries from years ago would aggravate me (right shoulder and both knees). Now these pains are almost completely gone.
My skin is still blotchy with minor acne, but im sure that will come in time.
The urdge to drink in the evening is still there but now I have a bit more focus, i can keep myself busy. I have a bottle of wine in the kitchen which has been there for days and a voice in my head says 'just neck that one bottle tonight, it is nothing compared to what you usually drink, you will be fine'.

It is way easier for me to keep motivated on the positive sense.  Like I do not want to do it anymore because I really do not enjoy it so much and that life is better without it.  Which is totally true, but right now at this moment it just feels like failure because I did drink too much and that I have to stay away from it or else.  That is something wears away at me.

I drank that much more out of habit and the desire to not really feel how off and weird and crummy the alcohol was making me feel at the time.  I do not like the sensation of sobering up.  A little to drink and then very shortly after the initial dopamine hit and sense of elevation the feeling of grossness hits.  Tired.  Slugish.  Bloated.  Dehydrated.  So my normal would be to keep going after that initial sensation and of course the inhibitions go down at that point so having more seems okay.  Then yesterday woke up wit ha hangover.  Talked about how I really preferred not drinking to drinking and then had a big beer to easy the transition, thinking that would be it, but I ended up drinking a bunch of wine after that too.  I had this weird idea that because I took a month off that would somehow reset me to be a normal drinker.

Didn’t drink for a whole week!,"I’ve been lurking for a while in this sub as I have been curious and wondering if I should stop drinking, but I haven’t posted yet. Ever since I started drinking at 18-19 (very suddenly as I grew up very sheltered and didn’t really get into anything like that before college, and didn’t really get an adequate warning), I’ve never been able to control myself. I’ve done shitty things to people I love, I’ve been assaulted multiple times when I was blacked out, I’ve convinced myself that I’m good to drive 🙄. Basically, I make bad decisions when I’m drinking and even though I’ve cut back since college, ever since quarantine hit, I’ve been living by myself (hallelujah) BUT it’s so hard to not drink when I am so bored and alone most of the time (where no one can see how much I’m drinking). I’ve found myself sneaking drinks when my partner is there, since he doesn’t drink much and I’m realizing how much of a problem that is. 

Last week I drank so much wine that I fell asleep after work at 7pm and my boyfriend AND mom both were worried that I wasn’t responding and almost came to my house to make sure I was alive. It made me feel so guilty. I forgot to eat and spent the next morning barfing and just wondering why I’ve let myself spiral out of control like this. I’ve had rock bottoms much worse from drinking, this time was just when I told myself, you’re 26 years old, it’s time to get yourself together.

I’m tired of waking up with the worry that I did something stupid or picked a fight with my boyfriend or left the oven on. I also feel that in so many fun moments of my life, I haven’t really been PRESENT because I was just drunk. I’ve gained so much weight and feel that I’m so unproductive because I’m always thinking about drinking. I’ve been power drinking martinellis out of my wine glasses which is definitely helping, or drinking la croix (just not as delicious). 
It was so easy to cut back before the pandemic because I just told myself that I could drink if I went out to a show or was with friends but NO drinking by myself at home. And now being by myself at home is all that I do besides work! 
The point is I’m drinking because I’m bored and depressed. But I made it through this whole week without drinking! The first couple days were so hard and I did LOTS of crying. I even rewarded myself at the week’s end with a tiny can of wine, and you know what? It didn’t even do much for me. I keep trying to think: “is this actually enhancing my experience like I think it is??” And the answer is often NO. Also, I’ve been neglecting so many delicious non alcoholic drinks just cause they didn’t have alcohol! Y’all been enjoying any non alcoholic drinks in particular that you wouldn’t have gone for before?

Anyway, thank you all. Lurking in this sub has made me do lots of self reflection and I hope things continue to improve for me.

""It sounds like you are going through alcohol withdrawal. I would not classify these symptoms as full-blown DTs and you are 5 days through it so probably over the hump. We do not prescribe tranquilizers to help you with sleep at night as this will perpetuate your addiction to alcohol if there is 1.

We were eager to see some weight fall off, save some money and well...""start the year off on the right foot"". I've dabbled in no drinking now & again through the years, but I've never gone completely sober. If I wasn't drinking I was smoking weed and if I wasn't smoking, I was drinking heavily. For what seems like the first time in probably 16 years, I went an entire month without any substances.

It's been a completely eye opening experience. I truly feel like I'm seeing the world through a completely new lens. All my adult life, every movie I watched, every album I listened to, every meal I ate, every time I had sex, went on a hike or went out with friends, I had substances in me. All my experiences have been seen through the lens of a smoked filled bottle. But after about 2 weeks of sobriety, I started to notice things much differently. Concentration levels increased, I started to have dreams (fucking DREAMS!), I made eye contact with more people, I didn't get as agitated, I enjoyed reading more, I was able to pick up on other senses while out for walks...the smells, the sounds, the feeling of...well...being alive.

I woke up today, the end of my ""dry January"" with zero desire to have a beer, pour a cocktail or smoke a joint...for I've experienced a high unlike any other in the last couple of weeks, something a drink or a spliff could never give me. As cheesy as it sounds, a natural high. 

The greatest epiphany I had is when I came to realize that I've gotten everything out of booze that a person could possibly get. I've had my crazy nights out. I've sat in vineyards & on bar stools and taken tours of breweries. I've blacked out. I've had chill nights with a glass of Pinot. I've had shower beers & mimosas for brunch. Lunch beers with co-workers & have shared bottles with strangers in foreign countries. I've enjoyed a road sud, cocktails on airplanes, kegs on pontoon boats & have snuck in 12 packs so I can be stocked in my golf cart. I've done it all. And as of today, I've realized there is nothing more I can do with it. There is no other experience I can have with alcohol or a feeling I know it can provide for me that I haven't already experienced

I'd by lying if I said that I regret my time with it - in fact, for the most part, it was kinda fun drinking every day...or at least it seemed to be fun. I have lived a pretty solid and manageable life with booze fully incorporated in every activity. I feel like most people I know who drink, can also say this. And while I know drinking has hurt my relationships, distanced me from my family, prevented me from progressing in my career, and certainly wasted a lot of my time & time...it oddly seemed worth it in the moment. But the way I think about it now is: If I've been able to live my life this far with booze as the thing I pivot around, what will life hold without it? What will my relationships, my career, my experiences, my bank account look like if booze is taken out of the equation? I know I'm incredibly curious & excited to see what that life is like.

If you've relapsed recently know that you are NOT starting over. You have simply taken a few steps back. Most likely you felt bad about your relapse. THIS IS SO MUCH PROGRESS. I would go for months not giving a single fuck about me using drugs. Relapse is NOT starting over. Yes it may be true that you have to start your days over but you are STILL recovering.

I have heard this group has done people some good so I'm curious to see if I can get some help or suggestion here.  


My wife and I talked about my drinking in the past, I promised I'll dial it down and keep drinking to limited social drinking only. But then I simply changed to drinking behind her back. Stocking up beers in the trunk of my car, have a drink when I go out and run an errand, or maybe have a drink in the morning if she isn't up yet. On a bad day, I would have 3 or 4 drinks over the day, and on average I think I'm having about maybe 2 drinks a day these days.  


The reasons for my drinking is multi-faceted (which I suspect is true for most people). I like the taste of the drinks, I like the fuzzy feeling when I drink. Maybe part of it has to do with reaching middle age and felt stuck in a career doldrum. I seldom get stone drunk, but I feel it is not conducive to my goals in life - being more productive at work, being a better athlete (I love running), setting a good example for my kids.  


The lure of it is too great. Sometimes, I would be able to turn the car around after arriving at the supermarket parking lot and avoid buying couples of six-packs. But most of the time I'd go in and buy them and hide them in my trunk...

I've had weeks long stretches of sobriety, mixed with occasional relapse. Unfortunately I used the holidays as an excuse to really start drinking again and have since lost sight of my goals. I convinced myself that I could moderate. At least I am drinking less, right? Which is true. I am not getting wasted everyday. Still, when I do drink I get shitfaced. It feels like a regression back into a lifestyle I am no longer interested in. I start making the same stupid decisions, same stupid mistakes I've made for the last ten years. When I'm hungover I end up losing a whole day. My mind cannot function like that. I've already lost enough days, I don't want to lose anymore. I know if I want to grow and better my future I have to stop drinking altogether.

So here's where I'm lost. I started seeing someone a few weeks ago.  I was pretty certain it was just going to be a physical thing. That's really all I was interested in. For a little context, the love of my life broke my heart about 2 years ago and I haven't been able to develop feelings for anyone else in that time. Hence just keeping it physical. He's new in my city so I've been taking him out, we've been getting drunk together and having a blast.  Sorry if this is too much, but it's some of the best sex I've had in a very long time. Including the relationship with my ex. We have a physical and emotional chemistry that is blowing me away. I actually drunkenly, and stupidly brought someone else home the other night and made them leave because I couldn't get this guy out of my head. 

I haven't talked to him about my struggle to quit drinking. I never thought I would need to. I never thought I'd want to pursue any kind of relationship with this guy. Yet here I am, falling in love under the cloud of alcohol. Unsure how to tell him I can't be the person I've presented myself as. Terrified that I'll lose the only person I've even considered being with over the past two years. I just feel so lost. Alcohol has brought out all my insecurities. Maybe y'all can relate, I sometimes feel like the only way people will like me is if I'm drinking. Well that beast of a feeling is rearing it's ugly head and I'm terrified it's the truth. I'm also questioning if my feelings are true and honest, or if alcohol has affected my judgement. It's not as though I'm only feeling these things when we're drunk, but I am questioning myself.

I don't know what else to say. Sorry this is a bit of a rant. I guess I know what I have to do. I have to be firm in my resolve to quit drinking and let him know what's going on. I'm just so scared.

This is what I have learned and lived with my whole life. This is the prevailing dogma that fuels every decision I make about life. I learned early on in life the extra work people had to go to when I was not okay was too much or that no one knew what to do when I was not okay. I can see this play out from my birth, but the first time this became overwhelmingly evident was when everyone found out that I attempted suicide. I have an image of walking into the principal’s office and seeing both of my parents there. I remember all the work my mom had to do to get me to counseling. How my dad had to do something special to get me into counseling through his work. That I needed to say the right things to end this whole ordeal as soon as possible. That I needed to suck it up and stay at the same school instead of making more work for my family to go to a different school. Going to a different high school was so much. Anything extra I needed was too much. When I was raped as an 18 year old, I didn’t tell anyone in my family for four days because I was afraid it was going to be too much. And, no one really knew what to do then. My mom shared she had been raped at college and I had no idea what to do with that. When I had a priest,a  person of trust, assault me, I handled that on my own instead of dealing with my parents’ ineptitude. When I got divorced, I certainly heard about all the extra people had to do to support me then. And man, I better be okay and not upset about being divorced. I better adjust quickly. And the second time around, I made my bed and better deal with it. And when I didn’t do that well, it was my mess to clean up and clean up quickly. So, when anything in the last 10 years happened or was hard, I had to make it all appear tidy to my family as soon as possible because they didn’t know what to do when I was not okay. It was my duty as a daughter for everything to be okay. 

When alcohol became a problem I couldn’t ignore, it never occurred to me to get help. I had to figure it out and there was no way I could let anyone know I was not okay, especially my parents.  Two people knew. One as a statement that I would never drink again and watch me. One who was truly supportive of me. Then I let my kids know. Not that mom had a problem because moms aren’t supposed to have problems. Just that I was going to be a better mom and not drink. I let a coworker know in the sense that I was making a health choice, not that I had a problem. When people knew that quitting was a problem, I quickly minimized the impact it was having on my life and that I had it all together. When I got Covid, suddenly, it was okay for me not to be okay because the world had given its permission that Covid sucked and people really were struggling with this. For the first time ever in my life, I stayed home from work and did not power through and come back sooner than expected. EVER! 

On February 1, 2021, I realized that I am surviving things I never should have because I erroneously thought it was not okay to not be okay. And I find myself very frustrated telling people that I am not going to be okay on February 25. I am not going to be okay for 6 weeks. I am going to need help,  people are not hearing me. I am learning people do not know what to do when I am not okay. I am learning how miraculous it is that I did not go to rehab. My survival spirit that helped me live as an infant and overcome trauma as a child and as a young woman helped me reclaim my life as mine and it no longer belonged to my trauma or to my assailants or to alcohol. I have also learned that no one should ever go through what I went through. Please get help if you are trying to quit on your own. Alcohol sucks and the addiction is insidious. There are people who can help. Groups that can support you. Please reach out. I can share all that I have learned. And I guess the world is going to learn on February 25 and maybe on Thursday what will happen when I am not okay. I am going to need help learning to be okay with not being okay.",6,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5526351}"

So, I searched through my bank/credit accounts to find all of the liquor store transactions. 

I was buying two handles of vodka/whiskey just about every 10 days, plus the random pints that I would hide all around the garage and in my car to drink when I walked my dog, plus the random tall boys and canned cocktails that I drank on the way home from work (holy shit that was stupid), and bottles of champagne that my girlfriend liked. 

The fact that it was only $8/day actually surprises me when I type this out and speak it out loud like this, but $248/month is just unacceptable to me. Hearing it out loud, visualizing twelve $20 bills, and confronting it really helps to motivate, but it’s tough not to beat myself up over it. $248 is more than my cable/internet bill. $248 is more than my car payment. $248 is more than I spent on Christmas presents for certain people who absolutely deserve more from me. $248 is a great date night. $248 is a couple of new video games that I want. After a couple of months, $248 becomes scheduled maintenance on my car and my house. 

If it becomes $248 after one month, imagine how fast it will continue to stack up if I stick with my commitment. 

That kind of money represents a better chance at financial freedom for me. I’m going to continue investing in myself and my future, instead of chasing a slow, pitiful death.

I got to the bar around 630p and drank tonic water with lime and ordered a red bull, had an amazing conversation with my friends and did not feel once pressured (from outside sources or myself) to have a drink. I went home around 10, got a great night's sleep and watched TV and ate some microwaved egg rolls. The next morning I felt amazing, didn't have any regrets or worried I said something embarrassing and made it to work the next day on time with plenty of energy!

It was something I was nervous to do and by no means do I plan on making a habit out of bar life again, and I think it was important to remind myself it's possible to laugh and have deep conversations without any booze whatsoever. All in all, I had fun and I am very proud of myself.

To someone who doesn’t understand growth, it would look like complete destruction.” -Cynthia Occelli","I read this quote in Holly Whitaker’s “Quit like a Woman” and it’s one I keep in my little notes journal full of inspirational sobriety quotes.

My journey to get sober is like so many of yours. It took me 5 years trying to quit on and off. Trying to moderate. Doing sober January and sober October. It was exhausting. I could not moderate. I couldn’t think of anything besides alcohol. I read so many books - a girl walks out of a bar, this naked mind, the unexpected joy of being sober, how to control alcohol. Nothing seemed to stick. I thought I was broken. 

I did sober January last year and read Holly’s book. She spoke about “creating a life you no longer need to escape from.” That is what I wanted so desperately. I wanted peace and I realized the only way to find peace and to actually change was to stop drinking for good. To change all of my insides. To let that little seed inside me grow. I cling to my new life with everything I have because it is so much better than when I was drinking. For anyone starting day one, you can do it. It may take a while, like it took me a while, but you’ve got this. If you want to change, you can and you will. 

It’s been a wild year. I’m so grateful I quit drinking before the pandemic hit because otherwise I’m sure I’d be dead. I know I wouldn’t have changed my entire life if I was still drinking.

Sneaking shots at work, at family events, during my commute, made me feel accomplished. Having this activity i enjoyed all by myself, it was like having a secret identity, being a super hero except my power was puking and wasting money. I've noticed I don't really miss drunkenness anymore, but do miss being alone in the woods enjoying something I couldn't do with other people around, or hurriedly munching gum and coffee to get the brandy smell off my breath. I really think if I find something else to fill that void, my cravings will cease entirely.

This time I did not drink on the first and last week was a bit of an exhausting one.  I thought: okay by the time I get to Saturday night it will be 30 days and I will have met my goal.  I thought a lot about continuing on through February but I balanced it in my head that I had completed my goal so it was okay.  I was feeling really good most of the month and I really liked the peace of mind that I got from not drinking and the confidence.  I just had a stressful week and it lined-up with thinking I would enjoy it as a break.    Well, to be open...it was nowhere near what I was looking for.  The alcohol felt like it was drying all the moisture out of my mouth immediately.  The intoxicating sensation just felt like being dizzy.  As I felt more swimmy-headed I got more anxious like I was forgetting to do something or that I was not paying attention to something important.  As I watched the level of alcohol go down I got more anxious because I was still not getting the sensations that I was hoping for: the relaxation, the confidence, the decompressing feeling.  None of it really.  I am bummed that I ended my streak but I am glad that I got a little reinforcement of the fact that letting go of alcohol is not just because of the bad elements of it, but because it does not give me what I want (the idea is always better than the reality with it) and I really do actually enjoy being clear-headed more than I like being intoxicated.  When I drink all I want to do is keep chasing that initial sensation and then if I am hungover all I want is a drink to soothe everything.  There is no way to win with it.  It does not give me what I want and it makes me feel crummy.  So, onward.  Only drinking two days out of the past month is still not too bad especially given COVID and Christmas time before that.  I am looking forward to a no alcohol February and beyond.  Thank You.",15,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42217436}"

Actually tried to open a bottle of beer and the opener slipped. Saw that as a sign, put away the beer, and reached for a bag of radishes instead - cold, hot, and crunchy did the trick. This is the closest I've come to messing it all up this time. Alcoholic me was whispering to myself, ""you can just lie and keep your 28-day count"", ""you can moderate"", ""you won't get crazy"". All lies I've told myself in the past. With me, drinking never ends well...I'm a blackout drinker who's been arrested, destroyed relationships, and made a jackass of myself more times than I can remember.

So why do I have beer in the house? We own a small hotel with a bar attached and this is where we live. There's enough alcohol here to kill me ten times over. The bar has been closed due to covid but we are opening back up in a couple of weeks and I know I need a plan. I've never been much for AA but have been to a handful of meetings - always to get my 24-hour chip. SMH. Anyway, there is a meeting tomorrow night and I will ask for their help - and get a 30-day chip.

I also would have been anxious about how the drinking contributed to the argument, and worried that my boyfriend is going to get sick of my shit. (The man is a saint, you guys. He's walked with me through a lot of my ups and downs with alcohol. I feel very grateful.)

2021-02-01 09:33:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/la4ckr/completely_surrounded_by_drinking_culture/,Completely surrounded by drinking culture yesterday.,"This weekend I went to a pretty big outdoor event (socially distanced with masks) with my brother, his gf, and my SO. My brother recently started drinking and my SO drinks on occasion. Drinking culture is literally engrained in an event like this. It’s tradition.

I started out very excited and high energy but as soon as my SO said “I’m going to get a drink”, I deflated. I’ve already told him that I do not want him to stop drinking just because I do. But seeing him holding that beer, I just retreated into myself. I started getting mad internally, thinking “this is a drinking event and I would have more fun drinking and just letting loose. This isn’t fair.” I was sitting there sober and wallowing. 

Eventually, I decided to look around at what I was doing. I’m at this super fun event, I’m with my brother, and wallowing is just making me distant from my SO and ruining the day for both of us. I decided to just enjoy it. Instead of thinking that living sober is dreary and not as fun, I decided to find the fun and be energetic and enjoy what I was experiencing. I perked up, I had fun, and most importantly, I didn’t drink. Not one sip. I would look at my SO’s drinks and just think back to that night that I almost lost everything. Think about how quickly I spiraled. And eventually, I didn’t even want it. I was just turned off from it. 

I just wanted to post in here to you all because I’m just so proud of myself that I was able to be in that environment and still have fun and stay sober. I made the choice not to wallow and I had an incredible day, even with beer cans, advertisements, and signs all around me. I never in a million years thought I’d be able to do that. It felt good to get to a mindset of “I’ll never get back to how I was that night because I don’t even have the urge to put myself in the position where I can’t stop.” If I never start, I don’t have to worry about not being able to stop. I’ve been so scared to go through life sober, but now that I’m doing it and I can see that I’m still able to have fun, I feel unstoppable.

A little context:
We have stopped drinking for a month or more without outside assistance, but always relapsed. We have both been problem drinkers since probably high school. I believe that I can stop drinking without outside help, though I humbly admit that is not necessarily true. She has had a history of trauma in her life while I have not. Our decision for her to go to rehab was sparked by a recent incident of particularly intense alcohol abuse by her.

I've gone through cycles of heavy drinking to light drinking, but was never fully able to stop for more than 2 weeks. And here I am, 31 days strong on day 32!! 

Now I think I'm going to live my life a little bit more. I'm going to stop listening to sober media for a bit unless I feel like I need it. I'm going to trust myself a little bit more that I can do this. I'm also going to take a break from self improvement media in general, I feel like you can get a little too much of that ""do better"" lecture stuff; it's useless unless I take action anyway. So I shall act now.

Overall, I feel like my sleep is much better. I wake up fully ready to go, I can't imagine it getting better than this but if it does, that's great. The next thing is, even though I have anxiety, it's not added to with minor withdrawal or hangover symptoms that make it worse. No more waking up with that nasty heart burn taste in my mouth and no more morning headaches. 

Stress is about the same as life is life but I feel like I'm able to face it instead of push it away. I'm more ambitious to handle my issues rather than put them on hold. 

My face is glowing! I'm a mixed individual of black and white people, so I have a slight caramel appearance. And oh boy, is it caramel! I no longer look like a Red Hot. Watch out Denzel.

My joint pain has gone away. My knees don't hurt walking up stairs anymore. 

And I've lost a little weight. 

I'd say 10/10. My cravings are for the most part nonexistent. It seems my alcohol cravings have turned into sugar cravings. So if I want to drink I just go grab some blueberries (or...a candy bar...). I feel very good going forward and not drinking. My brain now associates drinking with negativity instead of reward so I feel pretty strong!

So as the title says, I'm on day 16. My mood is beginning to level out and I'm vibin' and feeling pretty good. I'm been hitting the gym, getting the shit I need to get done and while alcohol has been at the way back of my mind, it's hasn't been nagging or intrusive. Probably largely due to the fact that I've been forcing myself to stay busy which has led me to realize a lot of my drinking has been due to boredom. It only really comes up when someone has offered me alcohol which I've continually managed to dodge which brings me to my next thing and my biggest victory of last week.

I've gained my wife as an ""active"" ally.

What I mean by this is she's always been supportive and she understands how alcohol makes me sick mentally, physically, and spiritually and she sees the chaos it causes. But she's always been kind of a passive ally in the sense that while she supported me, she never really went out of her way to help me. I know that sounds kind of shitty, but I think it's largely due to the fact that she comes from a family with no addicts or drunks. She's never had to deal with or understand it. It's always been, ""Why can you have one or two like a normal person?"" or ""Why don't you just not drink?"".

But this past weekend, we had plans to go to an event yesterday where we both were aware that there would be drinking. I was nervous until she outright said, ""I've already spoke to (the people we were going with) and let them know you're not drinking, they were fine with it. Also, What would you like me to buy you to drink? (Non alcoholic)"". To be honest I was floored. We then went on to have a casual conversation about how I was holding up and that she could see me getting better and that she was proud of me. The conversation ended with something along the lines of ""I know you can't moderate because that's never worked before, when you try it works at first but you always end back up in the same place a few weeks later. If you could moderate, we wouldn't be here right now.""

My demon has nearly cost me, but every time I've managed to get work, life and health back by the skin of my teeth.

I'm now in a new city, and with the new home comes a block in my habitual drinking which I have used these past 3 days to help me.

I have, for the past 4 years, lived in properties that enable me to sneak out the bedroom without waking my partner, and out the house silently, to buy a few bottles and drink the night away in the garage or shed to crawl back in the early hours with my SO none the wiser.

Now, we live in an apartment, the front door is loud, and right next to the bedroom. The outside hallway creaks and the building door rattles the foundations.

This has meant that I have no secret den, no stealth exit, and I'm loving it. Having my last cigarette while she's at work, and determined not to buy a bottle to get a daytime buzz on.

It's been 81 hours, and so far so good. I'd forgotten what a non-hangover morning felt like, and 8hrs sleep...what's that all about?! 🤣

Feeling healthy, feeling clear, the home gym will be completed over the next few weeks so I'm hoping the 1000+ extra calories of wine and whiskey per day that I'm avoiding (not to mention the takeaways and late night eating to soak up the booze) will help me get back down to a healthy weight.

To all my sober family, I hope you're all feeling strong and staying away from the demon.

I'll admit tho I'm very afraid of what the sobriety journey is going to bring me. I've never had a crazy rock bottom, I have a decent job and I have friends and family who love me .

But I'm scared. I'm really worried about what soberity is going to turn me into. I know I'm going to have cravings and I know I'm going to have withdrawls. I've heard stories of people trying to get sober and have had massive seizures that are sometimes fatal. Ive seen how other people fighting withdrawls can behave. I'm worried because I've never really had a challenge as big as fighting an addiction before and I really don't know what's ahead of me. 

All I know that as big of worries these are I just need to stop drinking. I need to do it for my health and mostly just to prove to myself that I can and I wont let this thing control me. I'm absolutely terrified of what's to come but here we go...

Quitting has been great, not the earth shattering awesomeness that I often read but just a slow and steady improvement of daily things and a slow unraveling of the huge ball of fuzz that is my brain.
During this awakening I've started thinking more about what makes me tick, who I am etc and started thinking I could be ADD.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

***

In my early days of sobriety I had a very ambivalent relationship with the AoK. I either felt guilty for not having good deeds to display, or I felt guilty for displaying them, cashing out on my saintliness. After a while I realized that the AoK wasn´t about showing off to the world what a kindhearted fellow I was, but striving to be aware of all the good things that actually happen - not just by chance or the laws of nature, but as a result of human interaction. The AoK helped me believe in people - and in myself. So here we are!

***

As usual, my AoK isn’t necessarily pure bred selfless. But it’s heartfelt!

We woke up to a couple of inches of snow this morning. Our morning routine is that I make breakfast and lunchpacks for the rascals while SaintMarge is in the shower. Snowy days are busy though - I shovel the driveway and heat up the car if it’s her turn to take the kids. I *could* stand by the window with my coffee and watch her do it - but where´s the fun in that?

Came home at midday and I had to lie down in a dark room for a few hours. I knew what this was, but read up about it anyway....

I managed to shift it a wee bit in the afternoon when I went for a swim in the sea (live in Scotland so definitely refreshing!) but I'm a bit shocked that this is what I'm dealing with... Alcohol withdrawal, wow I really have a problem.

Keeping at it, day 3 with again hardly any sleep and still a sore head, but I know it gets better.

Four years ago today I had what we can call a major health scare. I'm still here and kicking, so it didn't spook me enough to take off. BUT... it got me thinking today. Why didn't I quit then? Why, if I was lucky enough to get a second (or, 13th) chance, why didn't I see the light then, and start making the adequate changes to kick my life off right?

&#x200B;

There is no arguing we are a group not known for taking subtle hints that it's time to start making changes. I'm no different than any one of you... I have a list of drinking stories a mile (1.6k, of course) long. I'm not going to talk about rock bottoms here. Or play make-believe or woulda/coulda/shoulda with why each one of us waited until THE MOMENT we decided... enough. Was the alcohol that good? I'm going to argue that it wasn't. Maybe four years ago I would have told you it was. But, even then I knew, I KNEW, that it wasn't. The beer didn't taste as good, the booze burned a little more, the wine got old. But, I kept drinking. I got out of the hospital after a five day stay and drank FIFTEEN MINUTES after I walked in the door. I didn't even miss it... I was just used to it.

&#x200B;

I kept drinking through it all. We all did. Highs, lows, happiness, sadness, parties, self-loathing. And health scares. I'm willing to bet most of us did. ""My liver hurts"", ""should my kidney feel like that"", ""fuck, I fell again... does this wound look bad enough to go to the emergency room?"" But we ignored it all. For what... Lighter fluid?

&#x200B;

I'm not going to pretend that I'm ANY smarter than I was nearly one year ago, when I said... enough. I'm not any smarter than I was when I ignored my body literally telling me that this may be your last shot. Because, I'm not. I just said... enough. And meant it this time.

&#x200B;

What was your ""enough""?

Thinking about it now, it seems so clear ""don't drink, you don't want to drink anymore"", but for about 2 hours I had to FIGHT with myself to no pop next door, grab a few bottles and come home. 

""You deserve a reward, you went into the office, you set up your colleagues ready with masks, laptops delivered on your Sunday. You earnt a drink.

Want this so bad I don’t get it when I give in. Have been trying to quit for almost ten years now. Once I quit for over two years and I loved it. 

It’s 1:30am (didn’t even make it to 3am this time) and I’m in bed with the anxiety. You all know how it is. Work problems showed up, family situation as well and all of a sudden I’m having one. 

Today this that I just wrote makes me realize two of my triggers and my management of those situations is not OK. 

My goal is now to do February. Here we go.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7065786}"

I've saved almost $400, just typing that out sounds crazy. It's hard to believe I was spending that much, especially considering I wasn't drinking good booze, not bottom shelf by any means, but not the best. If I put that money towards my mortgage principal each month I could pay my house off 11 years earlier and save almost $60k in interest. Doing the math is the first time I truly felt shame from my drinking. I was quite literally sacrificing my family's future.

I've not drank almost 500 shots of liquor over the past 4 weeks; that's over 5 gallons of booze. That's almost 45,000 calories in alcohol. If what they say is true and one pound of fat equals 3,500 calories, that's over 12 pounds, which makes sense I guess because I've lost about 10.

I also managed to do something I haven't done in I can't remember how many years. I stayed up very late last night, which recently has been difficult since I've gotten my ability to actually sleep and find myself getting naturally tired at night, but despite staying up very late, I woke up in the morning, not the mid or even late afternoon. Not dehydrated to the point of a sore throat, not puking in the bathroom, up, dressed, showered, and relaxing with my family on a Sunday watching it snow.

My nine year old has noticed me not drinking, which I must say is probably another source of retrospective shame. I used to think he didn't notice, Dad just being Dad, but kids are very perceptive. I could tell he's happy for me and that makes me want to keep going.

Anyways, here's to 4 more weeks I suppose, I hope everyone had a lovely weekend.",48,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3868509}"

I felt like I wanted a fresh start. IDK). I always read posts from other people and mentally cheered them on, but I never had the courage to post for myself or really discuss the issues I was having. I'd like to get some stuff off my chest if that's alright.

I'm not at a terrible rock bottom. I'm lucky enough to not have gotten pulled over for driving intoxicated. My family and husband love me. I have housing, a solid job, adorable dogs, and friends. But drinking has seriously put all of those things in jeopardy in the past. I've ruined relationships, hit my car on a cement pole, passed out and forgotten to do something for my pets, spent the last money in my checkings on booze to get through the day, gained weight from indulging in alcohol and abandoning my love of exercise, had days with withdrawal symptoms so bad I couldn't keep anything in my stomach, etc.

Last night, we had two margaritas with dinner. My husband was fine with not drinking any more for the rest of the night, but all I could think about was when was he going to fall asleep so I could sneak out of our bedroom and finish the bottle of wine in the fridge. This morning, I looked in the mirror and I realized I was SO SICK of what I saw. I'm just disappointed in myself and I want to do better. I asked my husband if we could talk. I told him that I'm tired of my life revolving around alcohol. I'm tired of feeling like crap 90% of the time. I'm tired of disappointing him and myself. I asked him for help because I know I can't do this alone. I don't expect him to keep the bottle out of my hands, but I know I needed to tell someone so I can be held accountable. And that's why I'm telling all of you guys.",86,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6973161}"
