I guess sobriety milestones have always troubled me. They are artificial and random and when you get there you are left wondering what’s next or worse; the booze mind convinces you that you made the goal, so you have it conquered and you can go back to “moderate drinking” (like i ever did that).

Also: If you don’t make the milestone, you feel that you have failed, placing you under undue pressure.

I posted a couple of weeks ago about [my friend dying.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i4bkbe/my_friend_died_yesterday_today_is_not_an_easy_day/) It was hard on me, but I did not drink, and I was surprised that I was not really tempted to do so. 

What I wanted to share was that on August 11, 2010, I attempted to kill myself. I do not want to say why I did it (I suppose I will say that I was going through a divorce), but I was in a bad place and was very afraid. I was so afraid that I did it quickly and impulsively. This resulted in me not doing a very good job of it. So I ended up in the ER, and then spent a week in an institution.

It has been a long road. I became the worst version of myself, and buried everything under a bottle. I was a bad friend, son, brother, colleague, and lover. I spent years drinking excessively, at home, by myself, where no one would see me. Whatever hope I had was replaced with bile and cobwebs.

I went through a lot of therapy. I got tattoos to cover up the horrific scars on my wrists. I slowly started to put the pieces back together. Had one relationship with an incredibly sweet and caring woman, but she was not really the best match for me. I ended up dating another woman, who I am still with today.

Even after I came out of severe depression, it was now my habit, and I did it because I liked it. I never denied I was an alcoholic -- I was just able to keep everyone from understanding how bad it was. 

I got remarried in 2017, and we had a son in November of 2019. I finally quit about a month after he was born. I did end up drinking again on a weekend trip with friends back in February, but since then I have not had a drop. I now have people that depend on me, so I cannot do it anymore.

2020-08-30 22:36:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ijpwhy/100_days/,100 Days,"100 mornings ago, I sat hungover in the shower after staying up until 4 in the morning trying to calm down my boyfriend after he’d found out I’d cheated on him. I sat there nearly numb, noticing how the only thing I could feel was the water hitting my body. That’s probably the feeling I miss most about drinking—just having one thought or feeling at a time, just those fleeting bouts of simplicity where I could drown out all the clutter and pretend to be momentarily in control.

This time, though, I thought “this is it, this has to be it. This has to be the end of my drinking.” My next thought was “well fuck! My last drink was vodka and peach cranberry juice. That was fucking disgusting! I should have my last drink be something good, like one of my favorite unfiltered wheat beers that I really love.” My next thought might have been the most important because I finally realized the insanity of those two thoughts together. Here’s something that has caused me so much harm and destruction over the years, yet I wanted the last memory of it to be good. That’s when I realized how sick I really was. 

I’d taken so many breaks over the years, but usually they were with the intention of losing weight, or at least that’s what I told myself and everyone else. In reality I knew I had no control, but I’d been telling myself and everyone around me how much control I’d had that I really believed it. After all, I’ve read so much on addiction! I teach a psychology course that specializes in it! I’ve even mentored others regarding addiction issues! And it’s definitely true that I had a lot of control, much more so than many others. I’d made rules for myself, like no day drinking, and religiously followed them. I had almost no
issues at work that were noticeable, and if anything the more I drank the better I appeared to be. All the while I knew I was crumbling and it was only a matter of time before I came crashing down. 

In the end, I’d been using other people as a way to continue my shitty, self destructive behavior. Growing up the son of a recovering alcoholic, I’d always believed that “if I’m not as bad as him, then I’m fine” which couldn’t be further from the truth. I continued to use the most extreme cases around me to justify my continual use. In the end, it doesn’t matter if I wasn’t “as bad” as someone else—I was too bad for me. 

100 days in, I’m so glad the cycles are over. I no longer have to worry if I have my drinking under control because I’m not drinking. I no longer have to pretend to everyone around me that “even though other people are losing the battle against addiction, I’ve got it all figured out.” Nope. I’m an addict, and I had no control. I also now realize that being and addict doesn’t need to define me. Something I feared for so long was that if I truly admitted I was an alcoholic, that would mean that I’d have to make my identity around AA or being sober or whatever five word mantra worked for my dad. 

Something that stuck with me a few years ago was something that John Mulaney said in one of his specials. “I don’t drink. I used to drink, and then I drank too much, and I had to stop.” Obviously this was a set, written with brevity in mind for the comedic effect, but the simplicity of it had never occurred to me, that someone could have a life without alcohol that wasn’t defined by the absence of alcohol. I was convinced that if I stopped then I’d need rehab, 12 steps, a sponsor, and the whole world for the rest of my life would need to know that I’m sober first before anything else. That worked for my dad and a great deal of others, but that also frightened me. I’m now realizing that each person’s strategies for self improvement can be up to them, and that just because something worked for someone else doesn’t mean it’s the only way. Sure, methodology and experience have their merits, but so too do they have their liabilities. Sometimes we need to be creative to solve problems.

2020-08-30 20:36:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ijo3jw/coming_up_to_7_months/,Coming up to 7 months,"At around July 2018, I finally quit drinking after numerous failed attempts throughout my university years. What started off as a sociable confidence booster ended up being the exact opposite and given that I was battling some tough shit in the process, it became a tool for escapism but I just fell further down a dark spiral. It took a panic attack in front of my parents to eventually have my wake up call to abstain from alcohol.

Life improved massively after I quit. I still had some mental health issues but I had more control to tackle them head on and I felt way more present and overall, alive. I lasted 11 months.

I met someone while I was on my travels and we ended up developing a relationship. I had spoken about my teetotalism with him and I believed he respected my stance. Until we went out to dinner one evening and he started to coax me into having a glass of wine. He said I am just correlating all these bad memories with alcohol and hinted that me just sticking to a Fanta was spoiling the evening. I figured he had a point but I was apprehensive since I would usually get carried away and struggle to limit myself as soon as I drank. I caved and ended up sharing a bottle of wine with him. In fairness, I felt good in the moment and it didn’t have any negative impact on me but the fact that I compromised my values didn’t sit right with me.

I didn’t drink again until a few months later when I was going out with friends cause I kept thinking about what he told me and I was feeling happy so I assumed it wouldn’t be a problem. And it wasn’t initially. Sure I was feeling worse for wear the day after but it passed quickly.

Then I visit my (now ex) partner for a month and we were drinking heavily mostly every night combined with weed and coke. What started off as fun ended up being a complete nightmare. I was becoming short tempered, paranoid and overly emotional again, slowly falling back into a negative state like where I was at uni. The relationship was turning emotionally abusive besides the drink but I know I didn’t handle myself well when I was having to roll with the punches. I kept encountering multiple retorts and I’d foolishly retaliate while I was under the influence. It all came to a head when after he made a snide comment, I punched a hole through the wall. I was in bits that I had reached such a breaking point and I was very apologetic to my partner about what I had done. I felt absolutely devastated that I acted in that manner. But I was going home in a few days so a part of me felt reassured that I was going to be away from what became a toxic environment and that I was ready to get help.

I went to the doctors and was put back on antidepressants after descending into a depression. I was headstrong in thinking that I won’t ever drink again and technically with my medication, I shouldn’t be drinking anyway. But that was wishful thinking as I went out again and became tempted by getting completely plastered. 

I sober up as a police car pulls up next to me as I’m walking on a motorway. The policeman drove me home and gave a justified rollicking. I was trying to get home but it turns out I was walking 5 miles in the opposite direction. That was well and truly the final straw for me. I could’ve easily not survived that night and I had never felt more humiliated. I’m very grateful that they came and saved me from almost being killed but I should’ve never been in that state in the first place. 

Since the start of February, I haven’t touched alcohol and haven’t had the urge to either. I told my partner how I’m quitting indefinitely but his response was how I shouldn’t rule it out forever. He saw what I was like when drunk and he knows it’s not good for me so I couldn’t understand why he didn’t respect my choice. We broke up some months ago for other reasons, but I’m glad my friends and family have been so supportive of my sobriety on the flipside. 

I perhaps should’ve been more firm with my stance so I wouldn’t have such a destructive relapse but it’s made me realise I don’t need alcohol and the blackouts, chaos and wasted money really isn’t worth it. This will probably sound cliché but life really is too short to not remember what’s supposed to be a good time. 

Currently my life isn’t perfect by any means but I’m in a more positive state of mind now than I have been for a good few years. I’m much happier, healthier and more present. Still working on being more social but that’ll come with time. I often do get offered drinks and was given shots recently but passed them on to someone else. 

I’m proud that I now have the willpower and self discipline to resist the temptation after multiple tries. I just gotta keep this momentum going and hopefully things will continue to get better!

And to all of you who have stopped drinking alcohol, you’re strong and you’ve got this. ❤️

I have been drinking just about every day for several years. The amount varies but alcohol has been a constant crutch to make it through each day.

Brief history (don’t want to dwell here): I’m 37.  Marriage slowly fell apart over the past seven-ish years. Slowly started drinking more to “self medicate” because of anxiety and depression. Went from 2-3 beers a week to drinking a 1500mL bottle of Whiskey in a week (plus several beers). 

I’ve been living mostly alone with joint custody of my daughters the past two years. Doing a lot better emotionally, but I just cant kick my alcohol dependence. It’s rare that I go a day without some alcohol. Sometimes just one beer, but other times I’ll have a couple fingers of scotch and 2-3 strong craft beers. And a couple times a month I may have a lot more and feel like garbage the next day with an truly awful hangover (those hangovers after turning 30...).

I’ve tried to stop drinking a couple dozen times over the past 4 years but it never sticks. I stopped for up to a month before. Or reduced my consumption down to “just on the weekend” or “never when I have work the next day” or “just when socializing”. None of these seem to work because once I get the taste, the craving seem to snowball until it’s out of control again. And then there is the added anxiety caused by everything that is 2020.

Back in 2017 I decided to start getting in better shape, both mentally and physically. Road biking, rock climbing, meditation, eating healthy. All that good stuff.

I put on a pretty phony show to other people. I like the identity of the “healthy active guy.” I mountain bike 3-4 days a week, go to the rock climbing gym, eat sardines and salad for lunch, ride my bike to work. But no matter what, I always crave that instant relaxation and euphoria from having a couple drinks at the end of the day. 

If that were the extent of it I may not worry so much, but it always escalates over days or weeks until I drink so much I have to take another sick day because I can barely function. I also start eating worse and worse the more often I drink. Despite an active lifestyle I have still a managed to gain weight over the past couple months. I could definitely stand to lose 15-20 lbs at this point. The majority of this drinking is at home, so my alcoholism is hidden to most other people. And so much wasted money. I’m terrified to actually calculate how much money I’ve spent on alcohol the past couples years that I’ve consumed by myself alone in my house.

And then there is the social drinking which actually feels justifiable but is the worst thing of all. The drinks and bar food after group rides. Occasionally hanging out with friends on weekends. These types of social events have caused me to relapse several times. Either got my drinking again while I had quit, or just accelerating my fall back into a shitty lifestyle.

Beer culture is just so damn trendy right now. I love it, but deep inside I know it’s slowly killing me. I’m not an alcoholic, just a “craft beer enthusiast” or “scotch whiskey connoisseur”. Feels like large portions of society have been built around normalizing and justifying alcohol use. I love it, and I despise it. And I don’t know what to do about it. I want to stop. I feel like I have to stop for real. Half measures just seem doomed to fail for me.

I’ve been on this edge before and it didn’t turn out well. Resulted in months of self harm (self injury) and it ended in a suicide attempt. I feel like my drinking this time around (I was drinking then too) is my form of self harm. I treat myself badly, I sleep awful, I fuck with my body and mind, and I deal with the after effects the next day. And I keep doing it, night after night. It’s just a more silent form of self harm, except it really isn’t because it effects others too. Maybe it’s an even worse and selfish form.

The worst thing is: I don’t really want to stop. I’m hell bent on self destruction. I’m on the last of last legs with work(s) and relationships. Ive already ruined one really important relationship, apparently irreparably. I’ve rolled the dice so many times with my stupid decisions to drive when I shouldn’t. I’m not managing my finances well, or at all. 

I’m destroying my body, I know it, and moreover my mind. Depression levels are off the charts. I know one feeds into the other and visa versa. But I have just given up and rolled over. My new MO. And one I’ve never had, nor never wanted to have. I feel like my drinking is just going to continue until I’ve lost it all (and then I’m sure there’s more to lose) and then I’ll have even more reason to drink. Like I’m destroying my life, purposefully, so I can have another “see, that’s why I’m a drunk.”

Does any of this make sense? I mean, I know it doesn’t logically but, can anyone else relate. I’m exhausted from my last bender, having to deal with the repercussions of calling out yesterday, my mind is less than sharp. 

I hope I dont keep doing this, and yet I feel like I have no control over if I will or won’t. Very Dr Jeckle and Mr Hyde. I don’t want to go down that dark, dark path again. And yet I’m not doing anything to change it. It makes no fucking sense.

Alcohol consumption's been a part of my identity for so long, I don't know what to do without it.","I'm a saturnine person when sober. I don't know how to have fun without alcohol, or how to feel affable and relaxed. My days are insufferably long now, and I don't have the energy to fill them to the brim with activities, some days I just lie in bed idly browsing, counting hours by quarters until bedtime.

I'm not deeply  depressed. I know when I'm depressed, I've struggled with it on and off for the past 15 years, all things considered I'm decently perky. It's more like... I've got nothing to look forward to. When sober, even the things I used to enjoy suddenly feel like chores when there isn't a promise of a relaxing drink or eight waiting at the end of the day. 

I know it's withdrawals, I've been in the deep of the 'rage stage' before. It feels different this time, though. Something within me this time tells me to commit for good, even though I don't want to. I've never had that instinct to commit to sobriety before so it must be serious.

Every morning I wake up trying to gauge how badly hungover I am before my mind clears and I realise that there's no hangover. Booze bloat's gone from my face, I can see angles again, and my skin's clear. The weight I'd put on from the particular excesses of bored summer drinking's melting off my body. It's all very nice. But I've no idea who I am without alcohol, and I'm not excited to find out because one of the reasons I drank was so that I could 'connect' to the world. I don't feel happy at all. I enjoy not being nauseated in the morning? I guess?  I don't physically crave a drink. I don't *crave* a drink at all, it's been easy on the physical side, I don't get antsy, I haven't gotten tempted to drink for now. It's just that life without the reward of a drink and the emotional bliss (I was a happy, mellow drunk, quite opposite of the intense and aloof sober me) seems so horribly dull and meaningless.

Unfortunately therapy is not an option right now. I am looking for others who, instead of feeling excited and hopeful after sobering up, end up feeling kind of empty instead. Where do you go from having been a functioning alcoholic since 15, and finding at almost 30 that you have no idea who you are without alcohol, and barely have the energy to want to find out?

- Its obvious how drunk I am to others once I reach the threshold. 
- even when I realize I'm over my limit i continue to go hard on the drinks until the night is over
- it also led to another relapse for a habit I had quit for 30 days


Positive things:

- re enforced that alcohol does not raise my confidence at parties
- I'm still in the habit of not drinking alone/at home and I don't go to parties often
- I'm not going back to daily drinking. I will reset my badge, but my progress is is not undone in one night.
- it was still an amazing, memorible time with my family I love. Alcohol did not enhance the experience or make it that much worse. What is worse is what happens to my body and mind afterwards.

I wish I could drop a knowledge bomb, or some secret code that would help others as much as this community and other sober communities have helped me. It feels like no matter what I do, or how much I try to give back, it'll never outweigh how much you've helped me I can't even begin to express my gratitude in a text post. I'll do my best to share a little bit.

Three years ago it was the worst year of my life. I based my identity on this idea that the harder I could party without life falling apart, the cooler I was. What I didn't realize was that life was falling apart around me, and I just noticed it less and less. I was untrustworthy, I was unreliable, I was dishonest. The relationships I had were mostly based around alcohol abuse. Even though I was a working professional living in an LA beach town, 100% of my social contact took place in bars and restaurants (but only restaurants that served alcohol). 

When I couldn't face the day without a morning cocktail, I knew something was wrong. All the fun and glamour was gone. If for one fleeting second I would consider dialing it back, the anxiety and existential doom would absolutely crush me. I recognized physical dependency. I didn't know hangovers anymore, I only knew fearsome and terrifying withdrawal symptoms. I needed help. 

I sought treatment with a bottle in one hand and the phone in the other. I was ready to hang up my social life, to never have fun again. I had resigned myself to ""failure"" in the realm of cool and fashionable fun. I'll always remember that feeling as pitiful and (previously) incomprehensible demoralization. 

I was ready to give up. I had resigned myself to the fact that I would never have fun again. I felt threatened by people who had fun without drugs and alcohol. Nerds. No chance they were as ""cool"" as me. The truth was, I was miserable, and I'm not even sure I knew the depths of the inadequacy and imposter syndrome I felt. 

I'm so glad that I was wrong about sobriety then. Treatment was hard. It sucks. But it sucked less than being trapped in the world of alcohol and mounting consequences. Facing people like my family and my boss sucked. But the embarrassment of being honest had this silver lining of taking responsibility that I didn't even recognize yet. The honesty was simultaneously destructive to my bullshit ego and laying the foundation for my new self esteem.

I held super tight onto my first 30 days of sobriety. There was only one thing I knew, and that was that I was unable to moderate on my own. I always, certainly, without a doubt, slipped back into abuse if I tried to moderate. So I didn't try to be an exception anymore. 

I found freedom in doing the things that I had pretended to do in the past. I listened to my friends. I showed up for my family. I worked hard. I hit the gym. I ate well. None of this happened all at once. It happened in little tiny moments here and there. After the first few weeks, I had a little tiny shred of self esteem that I desperately wanted to hang on to, and build on.

About 2 months after I got sober, my best friend said he was ready to quit as well. After a few weeks, we discovered we had this superpower of a healthy diet, enough sleep, and an absence of hangovers. What a novel concept it was to feel good waking up in the morning. We still ran with the same crowd, but we went out less. We used the gym as our ""excuse"" to not party like we did before.

We started hitting an AA meeting here and there. Lots of them weren't right for me, but we found an awesome men's stag that would meet for 30-45 min (no birthdays, no announcements, no crosstalk, everyone shares for 60 seconds on topic). We drove by it every day on the way to the gym. We figured we ought to give it a shot, and it became part of our daily ritual M-F before the gym. Our sober crew started to grow.

Within 18 months or so we had a solid crew of genuine dudes who were cool as hell. We had one thing in common - we had partied hard, didn't regret most things, and were happy to turn things around. We built solid friendships around showing up for one another and pushing each other to be better people.

Some of the worst life stuff has happened to me since I got sober. My dad was diagnosed with invasive and aggressive cancer. I was with him at every damned doctors appointment and chemo session. He beat it. My cousin, at 33 (my age), was diagnosed with Glioblastoma (brain tumor), and it took him within 6 months - leaving behind his 1 year old daughter. In the midst of all this, my mom was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. It'll be a long road ahead for her, and for all of the family. 

But I showed up for my dad. I showed up for my cousin. I showed up for my mom. I was there, taking notes at every doc appointment. I was there trying my best to keep them positive and optimistic, even grateful, in the face of what seemed like hopeless situations. I didn't come up with any of that stuff on my own. You guys taught me how to do it. You guys taught me how to try my best to be a decent human being. 

I hold on tight to the idea that little stuff here and there makes a big difference. The sum of our good decisions, however small, can be huge. I won't give up on being sober anytime soon, but I know the threat is always there. I know I'm only one or two bad decisions away from throwing all my progress away and falling back into old ways. Three years feels like a lifetime when I look ahead, but the blink of an eye looking back. As long as I continue to make decent decisions, one at a time, I don't have to let worrying about the whole damned future crush me. I have three years of decent decision making behind me. Not perfect, but decent. I'm only going to concern myself with today. On that note, I will not drink with you today!



TL:DR
Three years sober. I decided to get help. I was desperate. Eating right, sleeping enough, and hitting the gym helped me a lot. Finding friends in sobriety helped me a lot. I couldn't change all at once, it was impossible. I make little decisions, one at a time, to be the person I want to be. It adds up to big changes over time. Dealing with life head-on and being there for friends and family gives me the self-worth that I could only fake before. You guys help me a lot. Thank you!

the longest I managed was 8 days and I felt really great when I did that, no problems at all but that was around 6 months ago.

I’ve only started to seriously try and cut back within the past month or so, though I haven’t been able to go completely cold turkey yet. I’m hoping this sub will help give me the support and confidence to quit drinking once and for all.

I’m so tired of waking up in the morning with no recollection of the night before. I’m so tired of having to have the details filled in by other people, hoping I didn’t do anything awful. I’m so tired of finding out that I have once again let down my girlfriend, lashing out at her and making her take care of me because my drunkenness unleashed my insecurities and flaws that are in turn, created by my alcoholism. I’ve said horrible things to her and I have no memory of it.

So, yesterday was my 21st birthday, a day that I’d been fearing for weeks, if not months. I was so scared to have the freedom to get alcohol whenever I want, and I still am, if I’m being honest. But while I did drink yesterday (won’t lie and say I didn’t), I listened to my girlfriend and didn’t go behind her back to drink more. I paced myself and drank water in between. I focused on playing pool and experiencing different bars rather than how many drinks I could discretely finish. I didn’t get black out drunk, and I don’t have a horrible hangover to go into work with. I wasn’t perfect, but I’m proud of myself that I was able to exert control in a tempting environment. There’s a half full bottle of vodka in the kitchen that I’m not going to touch today, despite being alone in the house. I’m going to keep believing in myself to get completely sober, and I believe in everyone on this sub too!

As we all know, cutting back and getting sober is hard, but when I put myself out here last Monday, I said that I would be honest with myself about my drinking going forward and that's what I am trying to accomplish in this post. I went 6 days without a drink and I'm proud of myself for that, but yesterday I cracked and let my impulse take control and grabbed some beers on the way home from the gym to have during my online fantasy football draft and drank them all.

I am slightly disappointed in myself, but I am going to use last week as a learning experience. I now have a good idea that days 1-4 aren't too rough as far as cravings go, but days 5-6 hit me hard, but this is to be expected. We can't grow as individuals without trudging through the mud. So, no matter how many times we may slip up on our journey of getting sober or cutting back, what matters is that we learn from these moments and try to be better the next time I get to day 5 and beyond. Even though this is another day 1, I'm going to remember what I accomplished last week and continue building on it.

I'm happy, sober, and living a life that I could only dream of two years ago. I've forgiven you for the slander and the lies you've spread about me. I've forgiven you for burning my jacket. The memories and lessons I learned while serving will live with me forever. I will never allow you to come back into my life for what you have said about me, but I hope someday, you will find the happiness you so obviously lack in your life and that someday, you will find the maturity you obviously lack.",1093,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9712963700294495}"

2020-08-30 10:52:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ijdw0n/not_going_to_reset_my_badge/,Not going to reset my badge,"I stopped drinking two months ago to lose weight.  I'm down about 17 pounds with a lot more to go.

Yesterday was a milestone of sorts.  We bought a ridiculously expensive car (Porsche Taycan Turbo S--you can look up the price).  My husband said it is the third most expensive thing we've ever bought.  I said it cost the equivalent of our first and second houses together.  All day the previous day and all day yesterday I thought about celebrating with one drink.  Just one drink.

And I did.  One. Only one.

And I didn't enjoy it.

The taste (bourbon--my old go-to) was acrid.  I remember drinking this on a daily basis and just loving the first sip and this first sip was...just alcohol.  It reminded me of my teenage self first drinking some hard liquor and wondering why people drank.  It tasted bad.  Just strong and bad.

So I finished the one drink, put away my glass and poured a tall ice water to enjoy the rest of the evening and was very happy.

You see, I really don't see myself as an alcoholic.  I used to drink too much--just over drank which added weight to my body.  I knew for years I needed to cut back.  I needed to lose weight.  I finally made the decision to quit in order to lose and I'm doing it.  But I'm pretty sure I don't want to be a teetotaler for the rest of my life.  I don't drink to excess (in terms of blackout).  I rarely drink to the point where the next morning is a hangover.  But the amount I was drinking was doing things to my health that I finally realized.  I didn't sleep well (I do now).  My resting heart rate was high (78) and now it isn't (52).  My blood pressure, on meds, was high and now I need to see my doctor to lower the dosage. And I am losing the weigh I need to.

This is just part of my journey.  I appreciate each and everyone here and your comments and advice.  I hope I can be of help to others.  I made a choice and frankly it just makes me not want to drink more.

Work doesn't start until next month, and I'm bleeding out my savings as I wait for a paycheck for a job that doesn't pay well and I don't really want to do, but I'm too depressed to get back into another month of job searching. My girlfriend broke up with me, and I don't blame her.I'm here to live out the fantasy of becoming fluent in a foreign language, get involved in the local music scene, and generally ""have fun"" while I'm still in my early 20s.The thing is, as reality sets in, I'm wondering what the fuck I've done. I'm now alone in a country full of people I don't know.It's as though I was already drinking, back in my high school days, when I came up with this fantasy to be an international cool guy musician like the guys in the movies. Since then, as the cynicism of adult life sets in, alcohol has been substituting for that lost childish sense of romanticism.

Ever since I started getting drunk 5 or 6 nights a week, I've been telling myself that alcohol is a useful tool: I can go out and work as hard as I do to improve myself, day after day, despite the lack of familiarity of one's native land and comfort of human contact that people need, BECAUSE I have a magic potion that cures loneliness, introverted-ness, and cynicism after a hard day's work. I can get off of work, go to the gym, practice my instrument, and study language every day with great focus because I know I can turn my brain off at the end of the day. I say this while knowing that I'm constantly losing the precious time of those 4 hours a night in which I'm rendered basically useless.

Now that I'm faced with the prospect of going out and meeting new people, despite a language (and more importantly, culture) barrier, I'm likely to have to do it in a place where alcohol is served. Furthermore, the reality is that I'm usually apathetic for most people I'm not already familiar with/can't be myself around.

And yet, I want to stop. My hair has begun falling out, reminding me that my body isn't invincible forever; one day, if I continue on like this, I'm going to lose the attractiveness that I work so hard to maintain with diet and exercise. If I continue like this, I'm never going to make any new friends, since I'll always have a cup of whiskey waiting for me at home. And, eventually, those 4 wasted hours a night are going to stack up and keep me from accomplishing what I want in life.

I have a feeling that, despite all of my problems right now seeming to point to alcohol, I could start on a new foot. It's because the circumstances are all new that I could somehow retrain years of this habit somehow.

For now, I'm just glad to have found this place. The posts here really help.  I'd say that you for reading, but I don't ask that anyone even read this shit. It felt good enough to write it out and post it for the first time somewhere.",32,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9979999661445618}"

Shape Up Sunday is the day of the week where we come together to high five over new PRs and clap shoulders and “next time, man” over missed goals.

I want to hear all about your walks, steps challenges, hikes, fitness programs, marathon plans (is anyone actually racing soon?), cycling adventures, rollerblading sessions, tennis games, golf rounds, and anything and everything that got your heart rate up and blood pumpin.

**Bonus Topic**

It was through marathon training last year that I finally understood a rather basic idea: what is possible is only a matter of perspective. When the furthest I had run was a half marathon, I couldn’t CONCEIVE of running a full. Another one of *those*?! Back to back with this one that’s nearly killed me?! As I started training, I feared the race itself because the plan only had me run up to 20 miles at most. What about those extra 6? But through the magic of time and non linear progression I began to realize the goal posts are indeed movable. Instead of “but 20 miles is the furthest I’ve run, what if I just can’t run those final 6??” it was “6 miles? Please, I run 6 miles on any given Wednesday before work! 6 miles is a *stroll*”

What secret doors in your heart has fitness unlocked for you?

Lay it all on my kitchen counter, folks, just mind my coffee.  I want to hear the good, the bad, and the ugly. I want the runners stomach (as I sit here waiting for my coffee to do it’s pre-run job heaven save me from runners stomach), cramps, charley horses, victories, losses, missed goals, new PRs, and everything in between.

It’s time for Shape Up Sunday!

**Wins**

I ran a 4 mile tempo run at a speedy 8:03 average mile. I run the BULK of my runs at an 11 minute mile and I’m coming to really cherish these harder efforts. Like I’m releasing a part of me to finally fly out at full power. I also finally sorted my Fitbod app (which is what I use for strength training) so my workouts actually take the full hour they’re supposed to. You’re supposed to rest in between sets! Who knew lol  

**editing to add**: I finished my long run this morning! 13 miles run at an 11 minute average. I've been really struggling at my longer runs to get under 9:45 and I'm accepting that at this point in time, that's just not where my fitness and endurance levels are at. Though man, my hydration vest chafed the crap out of my collarbones! I ended up taking off my shirt and using it as a scarf kinda barrier between the straps of the vest and my, ah, skin. lol.

**Losses**

Still can’t seem to get up the GAF (that is the give a fuck) for yoga. I just don’t find it relaxing or in any way enjoyable which is weird because it’s just body weight stuff. I know it’s good for mobility and flexibility in running but I just can’t seem to muster up the energy for it.

Be good today, guys and gals, and thanks again for stopping by!

I was a heavy drinker before and it’s been hard having to give it up- although it was a blessing in disguise. I’ve been doing really well so far and managing to stick to a one drink policy, with most of the time I go out I managed to stick to AF options the entire night.

Last night I fucked up although it wasn’t too bad a fuck up. I had a half pint of real beer and then a large glass of wine. I got a wee bit of a flare up but not too bad in that regard. It was my first big night out since covid hit in March. My friends and I went out to a nice steak place then went back to mine and then went out to a casino. I got all dressed up and felt like normal, I was so happy and that’s when I poured myself a half pint. I felt a wee buzz so I poured myself a large glass of wine, but then caught myself from going any further and drank water for the rest of the night.

I feel shit this morning. I feel like I could go back to sleep, I’m really hungry and my eyes are dry. I managed to get myself out of bed to my favourite cafe to get a good breakfast before starting my day. I need to remember how shit this mini hangover feels. I can’t even have a caffeinated coffee to make me feel alive again.

Currently having stomach pains, nausea, sweating, cold, headache and bad anxiety. Like unreal anxiety. I tried buying Valium to get off alcohol but was abusing both. So going cold turkey-ish. 

I’ve tried filling up with carbs to level my sugar but feel like I have the flu. 

I was recently laid off and am in the process of contacting rehabs so I can go back to work. I’m not sure if I can detox myself or need professional help. I have a fear of hospitals and would rather do it in the comfort of my own home. However, I’m more likely to cave and drink too much. 

I’m at that point where I know I need to quit and quit for good. Accepting the fact I’m an alcoholic is difficult but looking back at any issue in my life has been caused by my drinking and my self-sabotaging behaviours while drunk. 

Does anyone have a regime for quitting without medical intervention? 

I’ve been on a two week bender, however, in the past I’ve had periods of sobriety lasting a couple of days to nearly two weeks. I’ve been a weekend binge drinker since about 19 up until 27 when I started drinking heavily. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. TIA.

Edit: in the past did visit the ER and spent two nights there where I was given Ativan. I went home and drank because I felt depression from the Ativan.

Since my apartment doesn’t have much storage space, my neighbour let me use the nook under her back stairs to store it.  Discussing it on the phone, she mentioned that she had something she had been meaning to give me.  I had a pretty good idea what it was, and, yep, when I arrived there were the two little bottles of plum brandy I had suggested months prior when she offered to bring me a souvenir from a trip to Serbia.  

Thanks, I said, but I don’t drink anymore.  You can give them to someone else.  I’m sure they’ll be happy to receive. 

She looked a bit miffed but didn’t try to convince me otherwise.

While I was stacking the wood, the family with the apartment below mine came out and started helping.  It was amazing - the usual 2 hours it takes me was reduced to 45min.  After, following up on a promise she’d made earlier, the first neighbour gave the family a bottle of good Alvarinho.  Looking at me and grinning, the mom suggested we drink it then and there.  I was sweaty and ready to take a load off but this time I didn’t even need to say no - my neighbour piped up for me to remind the family that I don’t drink. 

I’ve always had a soft spot for culturally-interesting/traditional alcohol, so it was a bit sad to refuse.  But I have zero regrets.  Instead of breaking the promise I’ve made to myself to live the life I want to live and not some painful, confused facsimile, I went upstairs and finished stacking the wood I’d brought up initially.  Then I cracked a ginger ale, put on some music, and snapped some photos of the stacked firewood for my friends and fam.  I was proud, lol.  

And you know what?  Today I feel fantastic.

Looking back now, without the weird magic goggles that it makes you wear, I was probably going downhill destroying my body, carreer and probably hurting the few people I have close to me. During this quarantine I've been using alcohol as a way to cope with the sadness and loneliness, binge drinking close to the point of blacking out at least once a month alone.

On August 4th, because I had to take some medicine I took the first step to stop drinking and, since I've read many good stories in this reddit in the past, I've decided to stick to it  and I've been alcohol free so far.

I won't deny it's not been easy to stop. I had at least a couple of really bad craves when I've been feeling numb and it was really hard to stick through and deny it to myself when the only thing I've wanted to do was to drink until I lose most of my sense of self and feel some sort of happiness. This weekend I've also craved it a lot but was easier to get through. Writing this post here to share with you all got rid of all the remaining crave I've been feeling.

I'm not really sure what to expect from here on, before alcohol, when I was a teenager, I've always used to be the awkward type, mostly non-social without leaving my home. But I've came to love the social interaction and I have no idea how I'll be doing it sober.

I would be most grateful to hear any ideas, tips on how to learn to become social without any help from alcohol. Also it would be interesting to know how you all have changed since you stopped drinking.

I hope that some of what I wrote inspires someone to make a change to improve his/her life. I would also love to be able to have some special words for that kid that's reading this and been through some really tough moments.

I cleaned up my apt some before my parents' visit (they're renovating their house currently and there's no room for me to stay the weekend), and also played a game with some new friends I met.

I feel like thankful for this.

I'm taking back my weekends, I'm hitting the gym to take back my body, and most importantly, I'm taking back my life. 

I was in a very dark place this summer - still am in that hole, but something happened or rather some things happened that got me started digging my way out.

I'd like to thank my new gaming friends, many of which we've shared our life stories and problems, being supportive all while progressing together in-game. Despite having just met and not in person, being from various backgrounds, we just clicked immediately, and it's amazing.

 Like I was telling them,  each one of us have to individually dig ourselves out of our individual holes, but we have tools like fitness, music, tea, for me cheese, and we have each other.

I'm a 33 year old who drank regularly for 13 years, and became a serious alcoholic during covid trying to cope. Two weeks ago today i called 911 because i went into a seizure after two days of white knuckling not drinking. I honestly thought i was going to die. Every ICU bed was full and when the ambulance came they told me they could take me to a walk in clinic or a local detox facility adjoined to a prison known for some of the scariest conditions imaginable. I stumbled back upstairs horrified laid down and googled detox in my area. The first result i immediately called, got an awesome guy (thanks mike) who calmed me down and had a van at my door in 30 minutes. I checked in to what i thought was going to be a ""give me some drugs and fluids and send me home tomorrow"" treatmebt and quickly found out it was a 7 day program where i would forfeit my phone and wallet and if i didnt agree to it I would not be covered by my insurance. I had no choice to agree and quickly had to call a few loved ones and be honest about why id be totally radio silent for 7 days.

Today is day 13 of sobriety and the level of joy and and happiness i have felt since i havent felt in 10 years. Im enjoying the little things in life again. My anxiety is almost non existent. My relationships are stronger. I thought alcohol was the magic formula for happiness and with a clear mind i now know it was what had choked out the enjoyment of all of the small things.

I pushed away a lot of people in my life with my drinking, and I burned a lot of bridges professionally... I still try and get jobs where I can use my degree, but it tends to fizzle out when they start grilling me about what happened in the past, or why I don't have current references.

I know this isn't the best time to try looking, but my confidence is shot. I can get work, but it is usually boring and doesn't pay anywhere near what I used to earn. So I tend to get bored and relapse. Which then starts the cycle again.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It’s helping me to read your posts. I can’t say that I haven’t slipped a few times since I started reading, but I’m trying. I really want to stop. I need to stop. Somehow I always bargain my way into another drink, which soon turns into a 6 pack of the highest ABV beer I can buy or a pint of vodka, or both, hell throw a fifth of vodka in there sometimes or if I’m being really sneaky grab the grand marnier (since no one pays attention to that one daily). 12 days since a blackout, 2 days since my last 6 pack. 

The past 10 years has been really good to me, and I feel like I’ve pissed away what should have been my best, most healthy years, of my life away. I fell in love with my wife, we have a beautiful daughter, I have a great family who loves and supports me, I have a good job where I make pretty decent money for my field, I own a house, have a nice car, and a couple of friends that without a doubt would lay down their life for me...yet I still drink. I still find a way to feel sorry for myself. I wake up and go to sleep feeling like a piece of trash for all that I take for granted, and I swear every day I’m going to stop...yet I still drink. I’m overweight, eat terrible, pretty much a half pint to a pint of liquor a day for a solid 6 of the past 10 years, the rest weren’t much better, I’ve had scares with my health (right now I’m too afraid to go to the doctor because I don’t want them to give me bad news). My memory is so spotty for these past years, I know I’ve missed so much important things (my wedding among countless other very important things). I was a machine before I started drinking - easily could have held my own with professional athletes in terms of endurance and natural ability (though not naturally talented enough with sports - really just not interested enough - to excel here)...now I can hardly jog a half mile (probably have 5 times in the past year, don’t exercise because I’m very lazy), knees hurt, back kills me, and I know I can do better, but I don’t.

My wife knows most of my issues as this point and has forgiven me - what she doesn’t know isn’t me keeping anything from her...I just don’t remember. I’ve hidden alcohol everywhere (I’m pretty good at hiding it considering she’s only found it a handful of times and I’ve hidden it at least 1000 - not exaggerating). She supports me, and we talk about it. She’s trying to help me keep up with the days I’m sober and keep me motivated. I have no fear she will leave me, but I’m afraid I will do something stupid and it won’t leave her a choice one day. Or perhaps I’ll just have destroyed my body enough that I won’t be able to stick around for my daughter to grow up and get to spend time with my wife when (hopefully) we can stop working so hard at our jobs and just take some time to ourselves for a bit.

I am in counseling (will be talking about this in my next session this week, but there's a few days between now and then). I have tried to get sober a few other times before this, stringing together lots of days until I would start to get that tickle, that itch... to burn it all down. 

In the past, that feeling usually meant a big, bad, blackout, binge was coming... fast. The *really* big, bad kind. The spectacularly destructive and painful kind. The do whatever I want, drink until I fall on my face, be thankful I somehow didn't die kind. With the accompanying day-after shame spiral, naturally.

I just hit 9 months fully and 100% sober this week. This is the longest I have *ever* gone without a single drop of alcohol (no more fooling myself into thinking moderation could work for me.) But here is that fucking tickle to do something... bad. Still. Outta nowhere. My fucked up alcoholic mind is finding new ways now (in work, relationships) because normally it would be booze, but since I absolutely will not drink... I can feel my mind reaching out, searching, for something to... relieve stress? Get attention? Feel better about myself? All the things I used to believe (incorrectly) that alcohol did. 

I feel of out on control and like I'm going to sabotage myself and my relationship because I can't appropriately handle these feelings now that I don't have alcohol as a crutch. Like the booze is gone, but the feelings and therefore the destructive tendencies are still here... which I wasn't expecting or didn't realize was a *pattern* until right now. Shouldn't quitting booze be all I have to do to stop the self-destruction? That's what I feel like everyone is talking about, meanwhile I'm over here acting like a complete fucking reckless asshole... just *minus booze*.

Anyone else ever feel like this? Though I will not drink, I'm spiraling kind of and worried I'm going to fuck everything up anyway, just not because I'm blacked out this time.

Today was different, today I didn’t pour the whiskey, I just did my work. 
The craving kept telling me “you can have a drink”. No real rationalization behind it, no thoughts of moderation or how good it would taste, just “you can. . . It’s what you do”. 
I fought against the urges for the next few hours until I finished, took some breaks to read this Reddit, look at chess, try and take my mind off of it.

I have suffered real losses because of my drinking and if I'm being honest iv hurt people in my wake. But despite all the loss the pain  the regret saturday shoots down the otherwise accomplished week.

It's not all doom and gloom though the strides iv made thus far demonstrate to myself the fact that this is completely possible and that my goals are neither to lofty or diluted.

Iv faught this war so far by myself. This has been the reason iv wandered from relapse to relapse, because although I have always viewed my recovery through the analogy of war I allowed my pride to obstruct my view of the fact that no war has ever been faught alone. 

It's not easy for me to accept that I cant do this by myself. But the stakes are to high for me to succumb to pettiness and pride.

I’d like to say that I love being part of this community, even though my part has been limited to reading the stories that you were so open to share. Thank you. 

Since February, I’ve (27F) decided that I needed to reconsider my relationship with alcohol. In a drunken state of rage, I demonstrated such unkindness and disrespect to my partner that I am deeply ashamed of. That was the straw that broke the camels back. He forgave me and for 160+ days or so, I abstained entirely from alcohol without problem. He drinks in moderation and was supportive/encouraging that I may drink again and learn to moderate my drinking. 

I’ve probably drank a handful of times since and have been cautious about who I surround myself with. However, I have decided to go back to cold turkey. I know that otherwise, there will only be more problems, be it with my partner, or more likely, my family. 

Here is where I am asking for advice. The problems that occur(ed) are verbal arguments with my family that become heated and aggressive. I have a very close family with two sisters and a mom, all of whom drink frequently and excessively. None of us would be seen as alcoholics, but “problem drinkers” is certainly an accurate description. I have just moved back to the city in which they live and will be expected to spend more time with them - that generally includes home-cooked meals with wine followed by conversation into late hours. We will also all be on a vacation together for the next 10 days. 

The problem I am struggling with is that they do not seriously acknowledge how much alcohol has negatively affected their relationships with one another. Each have acknowledged at some point that they “should probably drink less” but have never made a commitment to make a significant change in their lives. They are aware of my commitment to stop drinking and my stance on there being a family problem. 

I find there are two types of issues: 

* Conflicts that truly need resolution - those in which parties should be sober to discuss. For us, these include expectations not being met from one other. 
* Conflicts that never would have occurred but for drinking - insensitivity, interupting, etc.  

Both types are equally common in my family. With the excessive consumption of alcohol, there is serious emotional volatility and too many nights end with someone in tears. My plan moving forward is to abstain from alcohol and leave the room when it becomes out of control - however, that will be hard to do in the next two weeks due to the close quarters. How can I navigate these relationships? How can I be a positive influence? How can I protect myself when verbally attacked while others are drinking? I love my family and will always be close to them but I want to reduce the toxicity. 

Any and all thoughts appreciated. Thank you to everyone for your openness and thoughtfulness to this community.

I'm very proud of myself because I know, if I had accepted one of the offers, I would be drinking more now at home and would end up throwing up the whole day tomorrow asking myself what I told my neighbors and who of my friends I drunkenly chatted up and forced to stay awake again afterwards.

My goal when I decided to quit after the relapse was to break that 60-day record. And I did. Then I decided to see just how far I could take it.  

Wow. Today is Day 2700 and I can't believe I made it this far. I have to tell you, my life now...I couldn't have imagined it 2700 days ago. I have stability and serenity, and I am able to help out other people when I can. People know they can rely on me, they can trust my word, and my self-esteem and sense of integrity has been restored.  

Please, I promise you, you *want* recovery. Stay the course, stick with it. My alcoholism created a lot of damage in my life, and it took some time to rebuild it.  

Don't quit, don't ever throw in the towel. Keep going. Not only does it get easier, but YOU get stronger.  

Every time my badge count trips over an even hundred I pop in here and pledge not to drink for another 100 days. You have it. You have my promise...and unlike the promises I made before I quit, you can believe this one.  

I hope you don't drink for the next 100 days, too.

I knew that I had once been fun, and vibrant, and funny, and intelligent, and confident. I was a bit of a know-it-all and a relaxed person who could get along with anyone and was good at many things. I liked life, even if it was hard or made me sad sometimes. I didn't feel like I needed anyone to make decisions for me or carry me through my struggles, because I was confident in my ability to do those things myself. I remembered this person that I used to like so much, and I felt such fear that I had drowned that person in alcohol and they would never be coming back.

I realized this week that I recognize that person in the mirror again. I like how I look, and how I think. Usually, I like how I act. When I don't, I take steps to make things better. I've taken on a new challenge at work that had been terrifying me--I didn't think I could do it. And I'm shocked to see myself excel at my work. It feeds my confidence even more. It hasn't even been that long, but here I am getting to be the person I thought I'd lost forever. I just spoke to my mom, and she told me, ""I knew you would get better, but I didn't realize you were going to get SO MUCH better. I'd almost forgotten what you used to be like."" So had I.

I'd been struggling lately. New stressors had made me feel like I was in danger of falling in a hole of old habits. I'm reminded how much I DO NOT need alcohol in my life. I don't miss the apathy, the fear of the future, the cosmic anxiety, the self-loathing, the rock-solid certainty that I was a bad person. I don't miss any of it, and I never need to welcome it back again.

I don't remember what happened exactly to set it off but I remember making the choice to drink, then finding just open jars of vodka on my shelf and taking huge swigs whenever I thought my wife wasn't paying attention. They tasted of ash, from the wild fires of course. It was extremely nerve wracking because even in the dream I knew I was fucking up, but also I wasn't feeling the alcohol at all. So like, what was the point? It wasn't a fun dream. I remember thinking I'd have to figure out how to reset my counter here and being annoyed.

I’m down. I feel depressed, irritable, lacking motivation, could sleep for 20 hours & not feel rested. I’m unintentionally snippy & short with co-workers & friends. I have a powerful case of the “fuck its” & am struggling to keep my head in the game with regards to self-care. I’m not finding joy or relief in my usual toolbox of meal prep, exercise, meditation, sleep hygiene routine, yoga, journaling, etc. I can’t even bring myself to string together a short list of gratefuls, because fuck it, what’s the point. I’m eating waaaaay too much ice cream & binge watching the entirety of Bojack Horseman when I usually don’t even like to watch tv.

I looked up symptoms of pandemic fatigue & I pretty well check every one of the boxes there: 

- Brian fog
- Trouble focusing
- Edginess/nervousness
- Irritability
- Lack of motivation
- Persistent racing thoughts
- Abnormal sleep/eating habits

but then my therapist planted the, “maybe it’s Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome,” seed in my brain. Lo & behold the symptoms have an extraordinary amount of overlap:

- Brain fog/short term memory issues
- Urges/cravings
- Irritability/hostility
- Sleep disturbances
- Fatigue
- Issues with fine motor coordination
- Stress sensitivity 
- Anxiety/panic
- Depression
- Lack of initiative
- Impaired ability to focus
- Mood swings

I don’t want to drink & my fine motor skills are seemingly fine, but you could pin the whole rest of that list on me real easy right now. But, I’m over a year into this journey, is PAWS honestly still on the table? Does the source of these symptoms I’m experiencing really even matter? Do you have any insights or recommendations for coping mechanisms that are working/or have worked for you?

And then I remember this - in these months I've been sober, how generous sobriety has been to me - without any effort, 1) I have lost weight, 2) I look healthy again, 3) I've regained my confidence, 4) I have a better outlook on life and I make rational considered decisions , 5) my days are immeasurably better, more fulfilling, 6) my bank account and investments have skyrocketed, 7) I want for nothing - all the material possessions, and quality food I've wanted I could buy without breaking a sweat, 8) fulfilling night's sleep - no more restless, dehydrated nights and absolutely terrible mornings (afternoons). 

What I know sobriety WILL provide, but takes effort (and sobriety has given me the willpower to go after it) - I'm currently doing a research report for a company which I hope will hire me once I present it to them, if not I can use it in my portfolio to present to others.
 
The truth is that sobriety is an entity in and of itself - it wants to give you your best life. There are no real regrets with sobriety. The benefits are immediate. I will make another post on this at some other point.

Anyway, I feel better having written this and I think I'll go swing my kettlebells, having a bath and jump into bed.

2020-08-29 12:18:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iiv65v/my_story/,My story,"  

Every story I’ve read here has helped me. If I can pay this kindness forward to one person, this lengthy post will all be worth it. 

Here’s my (32f) story

First time trying alcohol: I was 10 or 11 and about to take first communion. My mom wanted to make sure I tried wine first because she didn’t want me to have a “yuck” reaction at church. I definitely did not like white wine. I didn’t like the red wine at church either. 

First time trying alcohol to rebel: 13 or 14, I was at my dad’s girlfriend’s house with my best friend at the time and we tried playing a drinking game with vodka. I remember it was really hard to play the game since the vodka tasted so bad. 

First time blacking out: I was 16 or 17 and invited to a party with a new friend. I didn’t know anyone other than her at the party, and I was not a social butterfly. I accepted peer pressure with open arms and downed a LOT of jack daniels straight with a dr. pepper chaser. I blacked out and a bunch of strangers were nice enough to take care of me. We somehow ended up at a 24-hour restaurant and the staff threatened to call an ambulance if someone didn’t drag my underage lifeless body out of the bathroom and out of their restaurant.

When I was brought home I was incredibly sick and my mom was livid. In her mind the right lesson for me was to bring me another beer just to make sure I was ashamed of myself. I was also grounded indefinitely and required to attend church. (I am no longer religious what so ever)

I continued to binge drink anytime I would hang out with friends/go to parties. 

I would usually black out and/or vomit. It was worth it for the liquid courage. I was such an awkward child who desperately wanted to fit in. 

I was never sexually assaulted by a stranger. I was sexually assaulted by a previous boyfriend. 

I met my husband while I was still dating this previous boyfriend. That boyfriend finally cut the ties to our relationship that I was too scared to do myself. 

I used to think alcohol is what gave me the courage to reach out to my husband. Turns out this quiet guy I met through my ex was the most incredible person in the whole world. 

Even though I found my person, I continued to binge drink. He did too. He’s a lot bigger than me and I have been trying to keep up with his drinking for our entire relationship of 9 years. (He still drinks. He knows he can come to me for help if he’s ever interested in quitting or cutting back and that’s good enough for me)

In 2019 I was accepted into a highly regarded and difficult Dental Hygiene program (this was my second year applying). I celebrated by getting drunk off champagne. A classy drunk. 

I joined the stopdrinking subreddit right before I started the dental hygiene program. My plan was to stop drinking all together then. I’ve reset my badge so many times. I purchased This Naked Mind on audiobook and I would listen when I’d have time but not *really* listen. I knew a lot of the stuff Annie was saying. Alcohol is bad for you, DUH. We all know that. The thing is I didn’t fucking care. It took me more than 4 months to get through 6 little chapters because I was mostly drunk or hungover and I didn’t want to use my time to listen to what she had to tell me. I would read posts on here about how people actually quit alcohol one day because something just “switched” in their brain. I wanted that switch so badly. I was so envious of the people who didn’t need to hit rock bottom. I was scared for what my rock bottom was going to be. Was I going to kill someone driving home? Cheat on my husband? Kill myself? 

I continued to drink as a relief from the anxiety the program was giving me. Every day was so impacted with challenges. I started working on live patients in the first month. I had never even put my hands in anyone else’s mouth before! The teachers were strict and rough around the edges. I made a few friends who relieved their stress from drinking as well so we started getting drinks after class together. I noticed that most of their stress was actually relieved from that one or two drinks we had during happy hour. I was becoming self-conscious of the fact that I’d rather save money and drink at home so I could drink a whole bottle or two of wine. Also it was so hard to not get too drunk to drive home from happy hour. It wasn’t that much fun when I was constantly trying to make sure I was ok to drive. 

COVID-19 shut down happened for me on March 12th. I was at school preparing for clinical practice. Instead, the school closed so my friends and I went for drinks. Then I went home and continued to be drunk almost every day until June 8th.

My routine was becoming: get through online dental hygiene school Monday through Thursday and drink until the next Monday. If I had nothing to study for on Monday I would do “Beer Sunday”. And try to just have one beer every hour until around 7pm and drink water before going to bed at 10pm. Most “Beer Sunday’s” turned into hiding vodka in our spare bedroom and taking shots until I blacked out or cried myself to sleep. Turns out I have A LOT of unprocessed trauma from my past that manifested in to self-hatred. I was destroying myself and I felt like I deserved it.

I woke up on June 8th after a 4-day binge. I was in pain and covered in bruises. The pain helped me remember that I fell (hard) in the bathroom. My husband heard a crash and he found me stuck, almost comatose, in between the toilet and the shower. That was not my rock bottom. I had MANY bottoms in my drinking career. I did countless stupid, careless, awful things while I was drunk. Apologizing to my family and friends for my behavior was becoming routine and meaningless. 

On June 8th I was just DONE with alcohol. I was tired of acting like I had no control. I re-started This Naked Mind and really *heard* her. I believe that the choice I made that day to truly take in the facts she compiled through years of her own research saved my life. I’ve lost count how many times I’ve listened to the book. I listen when I go to sleep, I listen when I go for walks, when I clean, when I drive, when I shower, anytime I need a reminder of why this is all worth it. Alcohol made me believe I needed it to celebrate good times and to get through the bad times, when in reality it was making the good times bad and the bad times worse. Seeing alcohol for what it truly is, the villain of the story that is my life, is what I needed to be free. There is alcohol in my house that I don’t crave. I don’t want a drop. I finally agree with Annie Grace when she says “I drink as much as I want, which is none at all”. I’m not depriving myself of alcohol, I’m free.

So here’s what I did starting June 8th to get through the hardest part of quitting alcohol. 

· Started listening to This Naked Mind by Annie Grace

· Joined The Alcohol Experiment online and checked in every day for 30 days (IT’S FREE)

· Listen to This Naked Mind podcast (other podcasts I like are: Unlocking us w/ Brene Brown, the seltzer squad, my favorite murder \*SSDGM\*) 

· Reached out to a good therapist and established continuing therapy

· Started taking a multivitamin (I actually jumped on the Ritual Vitamin train and I like them a lot)

· Changed my diet. Since I’m not hungover/drunk all the time I eat a lot less taco bell\*

\* I literally had taco bell last night. I still eat junk sometimes, just not nearly as much as I used to.

· Regular exercise: walking, running, yoga

· Meditation (I use the app: insight timer)

I had gained a lot of weight from the effects of alcohol. However I have struggled with anorexia, bulimia, and body dysmorphia for over 15 years so I was just starting to hover around the overweight BMI. I was looking forward to shedding a few pounds when I quit drinking. But because I struggled with eating disorders and exercised regularly already I didn’t lose any weight. In fact, I GAINED!

I was confused and frustrated. I cried, bitched, and moaned. Then I talked to my therapist about how to love myself regardless of what my scale says. I threw the scale away. 

It’s been almost 3 months now, I don’t remember the last time I weighed myself, but I look fucking AMAZING. Plenty of love to grab on to :) I was always thin but never healthy. I starved myself for so long. These days I truly and deeply love myself. I am strong both physically and mentally. I have so much more work to do but I’m looking forward to becoming an even stronger and smarter me in the future. 

(Also I started the fall semester last week and am kicking ass. I can’t wait to get back to clinic and practice on humans again!)

Quitting drinking brought back the light that had been blocked out for half of my life. I am finally becoming the true, genuine me. I love to make others happy, but now I make myself happy first. I still struggle with people-pleasing and co-dependency but I am establishing new healthy boundaries every day. 

This quote by Ram Dass is a good reminder that in order to be there for others in a healthy way I must take care of myself. “I can do nothing for you but work on myself. You can do nothing for me but work on yourself.” 

I finally give myself permission to be selfish, lazy, cranky, sad, mad, etc. I forgive myself for the past I can’t change. I look to the future with hopeful curiosity. I will be kind and loving to myself and others in the present.

I feel that this story is under-recognized and deters people from getting help early in the progression of their addiction to alcohol. I still never developed a physical addiction because I recognized the signs, fortunately.

Age 16 - I tried my first drink. Rum and countrytime pink lemonade. It was my birthday and I was with friends in a basement. I got pleasantly tipsy and had a great time. It would be a year until I next drank.

Age 17 - Got drunk with my friends off a truly disgusting mix of liquors we stole from his parents. Threw up. Didn't want to drink again for a while.

Age 19 - Went to college. Drinking most weekends, Friday and Saturdays only. Usually having 2-3 drinks a night. Sometimes going overboard.

Age 19.5 - spend the summer abroad in a country where the drinking age is 18. Despite that, I only have 2 drinks for the entire summer because I don't desire alcohol and am not familiar with the culture. My host family gifted me a bottle of the country's famous liquor. I never opened it.

Ages 20-21 - got really into a sport. Rarely drank during the semester. Probably had 1-2 drinks on weekend nights, sometimes weeks going by without.

Age 21- got injured. Couldn't play sport. Started drinking a little more, generally just 1 beer or glass of wine at home at night. This seemed perfectly fine, even sophisticated.

Age 22 - grad school. Still continuing my habit of usually having a drink at night. Can easily go a week without.

Age 23 - move into my own apartment. Start a job. Huge drinking culture at the company. Happy hours twice a week, paid for by the company card. On top of that, I start drinking 2 or 3 or 4 drinks at night instead of 1.

Age 24 - Cravings for alcohol start early in the day. I start buying high ABV IPAs and drink one as soon as I get home, and while cooking dinner. Drinking 2-3 is the equivalent of 5-6 beers. Every morning I tell myself I'll take a break today and every night I break that promise.

Age 25 - start drinking in the afternoon on weekends. I'm spending most of my time hungover. I no longer see a hangover as a reason to stop drinking. I think about drinking all day and sometimes have one in the morning. I start hiding my drinking from my partner and buy liquor for the first time. I start drinking during work. I know I have a problem.

Age 26 - I realize I need to get sober and start my journey. I'm struggling, but at least I know what I need to do. It took a while to get in this mess and will take a while to undo it, but I'll manage.",215,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9890037178993225}"

I thought I'd share that personal discovery with you.  I'm reading this book to help me in my journey through sobriety (the 30 day solution to sobriety) and they keep on telling us that our subconscious is the best ally we can have in this long journey.  It will do everything to help you achieve what you want, it just needs you to feed in the information about what you need and where you need to get to.

So I'm following the instructions of the book and every night before I go to sleep, I repeat what I want for the following day, for example : ""I will be happy and motivated tomorrow to stay sober.  I will have a great day with my family and will take care of my body"".  The process of recovery has been much easier than I expected and I'm convinced my subconscious is helping me tremendously.

Last night, I figured I would ""test"" the system.  The book keeps on telling that the subconscious can help you achieve just about anything in my life, anything.  Even though I'm getting great results, I was still a bit doubtful of such a broad affirmation.  So last night, I added a second instruction to my subconscious that I repeated a few times: ""tomorrow, I want to wake up at 8:00 am"".  I have a crazy inexpiable work schedule, but usually, I would have woken up at approximately 10:30 today.  

Well, this morning, I was having the greatest dream of all time.  I was at a Slipknot concert, my favorite band.  This super cute girl was flirting with me and gave me her phone number (please don't tell my wife!).  All of a sudden, I kept getting this feeling, you have to wake up, you have to wake up.  I was fighting it as much as I could, I really wanted to stick around longer, but I couldn't.  I woke up.  I looked at the clock.  7:59!!!!!!!  Couldn't believe my eyes.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I think the tool that finally took me there - here - was that every time a romantic thought of alcohol tried to bust my sobriety, I counter attacked with all the horrible and worst, the hiding, the passing out on the floor halfway inside my place, the cold sweat puking, the sinking sensation of disgust even before I opened my eyes the next day, the bloated, desperate, aged face in the mirror with eyes only half alive.

That, and of course this sub, which I had read for months before even consider trying and who later helped me so much to stay in track.

I started drinking heavily when I was 13 (tried alcohol for the first time at 10, with friends) so this has been an ongoing issue. 

My personal rock bottom was 28th February this year- went out for a friends going away party, me and my girlfriend got a hotel room and it was meant to be a really nice evening. Instead I got black out drunk, vomited for 7 hours straight and ended up having a seizure, landed in hospital for alcohol poisoning. I’ve never been so ashamed of myself, and even though it’s happened multiple times before then, seeing my girlfriend’s face after no sleep and crying for hours- I haven’t touched alcohol since. 

It’s been going ok, my relationship is so much better for it, I’ve been in therapy and practicing healthier habits. I also cut out weed. 

But I think I’ve replaced binge drinking with binge eating. I’m okay for a few days and then I’ll eat 5000-6000 calories in a day. I’ve gained maybe 30lbs since I stopped drinking.

2020-08-28 22:09:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iikdta/ever_pissed_yourself/,Ever pissed yourself?,"At 12yo, I split a single corona with my buddy in his parent’s garage. He stole it from his father. 

At 14yo, I chugged a water bottle full of red wine I stole from my parents. I puked on the laptop my parents had bought for me. I woke up on the floor of a room in my house that wasn’t my bedroom. I had vomit caked in my hair and ear. I felt then the pain of my very first hangover. I took the laptop to the store and they said it was broken due to water damage. 

On my 16th birthday, I drank two 40s after school while my friends each struggled to get through one. I ended up worrying my mother to death, screening her calls because I knew she would hear me slur. I also vomited profusely laying on my back and blacked out. My friends later told me they had considered taking me to the hospital before I eventually sobered up. 

That same year I violated probation (originally for possession of marijuana) after getting breathalyzed. I went to court mandated outpatient rehabilitation center, community service, and counseling. 

At 18yo, I was arrested again for possession of alcohol and did more mandated counseling. During freshman year of college. I blacked out at a party at a fraternity. I woke up on my friends couch. I had pissed myself and pictures of me with the piss stain were included in a group email thread where they wrote witty captions. I also vomited on my friends blanket which his mom had made for him. 

At 19yo, while drunk, I was choked out. I fell like a rock and hit my head off the washer and ground of a filthy basement floor. The gash and amount of blood was tremendous. I couldn’t focus for a month. There was a large free college party event the day after, I remember being disappointed I wasn’t well enough to go and join the people drinking.

At 21yo, I ruined my birthday by blacking out. I had a fake ID and had already been kicked out of countless bars for being too drunk/argumentative with the bartender. I spent the start of my 21st year of life feeling like death. That year, I also mixed substances, the confidence from alcohol to take risks and say yes to bad decisions. I didn’t develop a habit but many of my friends from that time are still grappling with hardcore drug abuse.

And still. For four more years, I continued to drink. Not everyday. Not always to excess. I wanted so badly to be somebody who can drink. I wanted to prove to others that I wasn’t always a problem drinker. That I could be in control. My worst decisions. Lost countless hours, tons if money. Embarrassed myself at work functions. Tried to moderate. Blacked out. Tried to moderate again. 

I was the drunk asshole at the party on so many occasions. I was critical of the too-drunk person when it wasn’t me. Its because I could recognize that I act the exact same way and it is so off-putting. I acted like an ass in front of my family and friends. I felt so much shame. Hangovers continued to get worse and worse, from a few hours in the morning to two full days of feeling like complete and absolute shit.

Today, I am 25yo and 30+ days sober. I have a great life. I feel so proud to be sober. Sometimes there is temptation. But I feel strong in my resolve. And I remind myself of what I’ve described above and how I felt. No alcohol for me. It has never been good for me. My biggest regrets all involve alcohol. 

I wish I could have a little chat with my 18yo self. Or my 21yo self. Or my 24yo self. Each of those selves already knew that alcohol is not for me, he just found a way around it so that he could continue drinking. IWNDWYT",520,{'rona': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.998335063457489}"

If someone would have told me 1,828 days ago, ""In five years I'd be sober, happy, skinny(!), and never seriously think about drinking,""  I would have told them they must have me confused with someone else.  I felt hopeless and had resigned myself to thinking I would die a drunk. I woke up every morning hating myself as my brain did battle with the demon over whether I would drink that day.  I had lost all control and I didn't seem to care. I blamed everyone except myself for the circumstances I was in.

I got divorced over my drinking. My children stopped talking to me. I lost all of my friends.  My own dog was even afraid of me.  I went into massive debt and nearly ran my business into the ground.  A DUI in 2008 only made things worse as I stopped socializing all together and drank at home all by myself for the next seven (7) years.  No amount of threats or rehab would have helped me until **I** made the decision to help myself. That come hell or high water, I was going to get better with all the strength I had left because I was sick and tired of *being* sick and tired.

After a life threatening health scare, I white-knuckled it for eight days and seriously considered suicide. By the grace of God and/or my Guardian Angel, a Google search found R/StopDrinking and the Daily Check-In page.  Something about the following sentence gave me hope that I could finally unlock the chains of the addiction that took nearly everything away from me:

>> Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.

I saw people with 30 days and beyond and it seemed daunting that I could ever make it that far.  Something very powerful happened in my brain when I typed, ""I will not drink TODAY.""  I read this sub constantly and honed in on what those with long term sobriety were advising because I wanted what they had.  I had to have faith and believe it would get easier.

I made a commitment each morning to not drink that day.  I stayed extra busy by cleaning the home I'd neglected for a decade. I followed (and *still* follow) the ""Dry People/Dry Places"" rule.  I went to AA as a safe haven for socializing when I felt alone.  I fought each urge to drink by acknowledging it and then telling my demon, ""No, Not Today.""  I can't pinpoint when it actually happened, but the demon stopped screaming at me on a regular basis --something the long-timers promised would happen.

If you're new here, keep coming back.  Make the decision, ""No, Not Today"" as soon as you wake up and then do whatever it takes to make it happen. It really does get easier and I promise your life will improve in ways you can't even imagine right now!  Miracles happen on this sub and I am grateful to be one of them.

Though I hated myself, my appearance, thought I was less than / worthless, that wasn’t true. The alcohol reinforced all of that in a big way for 13 years. 

It’s hard to move on because I worry something from my drinking past that I’m not even fully aware of will come back to haunt me. I can’t even rationalize what alcohol did to me... all that gives me solace is to accept the disease is ‘cunning, baffling, powerful’. It helps me stop trying to figure it out.

(I cannot believe I used to drink before my other jobs! Wtf was wrong with me. If you knew my home you would say the same.)

I don't know how to go to sleep without SOMETHING helping me and I'm scared to try. I drink 3-6 beers and 1-4 shots depending on the night. Nights when I drink a tiny bit I have difficulty getting in to a deep sleep. I toss. I turn. I sweat. Is that a withdrawal? Is that just how sleep is for me without something to help me pass out? God I hope not...I love sleep too much. 

I hate the hangover, when I get it. It's not every morning anymore, thankfully. (No more puking my guts up every night before bed!) I just feel no control some nights and other nights I'm good with a couple. I was going to not drink today, that hangover sucked at work this morning, but it's getting to dusk and it's getting harder to fight. I opened my SO's beer and had some before we took the kids down the street to play. (He has his own battle with alcohol as well, so that doesn't help. We're both aware. He can go a day here and there without. I cannot. He starts drinking at 12, I wait until at least 5 most days. Thankfully we rarely get trashed before the kids go to sleep. But nights they're not here is very different. 50/50 custody.)

I'm not sure the point of all this but I feel I need to post. Maybe advice? Idk... I quit cigarettes though and have stayed away from marijuana and CBD. I'm very proud of myself for that.

He left three ciders in my fridge and I'm just so angry and I don't know why.

Ideally, I imagined, her friends would be leaving and we could continue the music and life chat we had been having and hopefully make a nuanced connection and fulfil both of our desires, maybe with some mood lighting and Portishead/Massive Attack music to compliment the scene. I even pictured her drinking wine, as if that was somehow a preferable decision, which was a wake up call to how my mind isn’t as bulletproof as I thought. 

Anyway, I’m glad I had this slice of internal anticipation because it turned out to be the highlight of the night as my fantasy bubble was burst immediately on entering the scene. I was met by three drunk girls who were friendly but loud in an apartment so overflowing with bottles and pizza boxes it looked like an episode of Hoarders. All the lights were on, commercial TV in the background with teenage pop music playing, hardly the fanciful scene I had imagined. 

The girl I was meeting looked so different from her pictures it was basically a catfish situation. The pictures were her but they were from her early 20’s. Now in her mid 20’s she looked like she could be 40, which was a shocking wake up call to the physical effects that drinking can have. The whole time I was there she was drinking, smoking and trying to get everyone to do drugs. This should be a person in the prime of their life, who a few years ago was probably out of my league, who is now in as poor a physical (and possibly mental) state as possible. 

I stayed for 30 minutes out of curiosity to learn more about her life. We mainly talked about such exhilarating topics as clubs we used to go to and clubs we want to go to after lockout is over. How interesting. 

After leaving I had some conflicting feelings. I was a little disappointed at the let down but also happy I was away from that life and thankful for the reminder of what a life of drinking entails. I also considered how many times I would have made a similar negative impression on others simply by being my former drunk self and how many friends or potential romantic interests were repelled by my behaviour and vowed not to let that happen again.

At first I would decide every 100 days if I was going to resume drinking. I was afraid of the idea of “never again”

It’s only in the last few months that I’ve become comfortable with the concept that this is for the rest of my life and, not only is that ok, it’s actually amazing. I have this tremendous opportunity to achieve and live and grow again. I was definitely headed the other direction before.  I was going to die, and sooner than later. 

I believe one of the best things I did to help myself was to banish the myth of moderation. I never let myself indulge in moderation fantasies. That’s all they are. They’re lies from a brain that is trying to betray you in order to fill empty neuroreceptors. Don’t listen. If you could moderate you wouldn’t be here reading this. 

So be tough. Realize it takes time and, time takes time.  Be gentle with yourself. Reach out for help. 

And mostly,  be proud of the work you are putting in. This is hard and serious and maddening and  saddening and joyful stuff we are doing here. And each hour you add on is more of that time. 

So keep be amazing. Keep defying the siren call. Because you deserve it. It really does get better and so much easier. 

Hang in there. You’re going to be fine.

Also, athletes, what were your changes?","I was doing okay until this clusterfuck of a spring ruined it all. I (26 m) had surgery in March, three days before my university shut down, leaving me without the resources I needed to efficiently conduct research. I wasn’t able to leave this shitty little city at all this summer and had almost nothing to look forward to. For the past few months, I have been increasingly anxious as I monitored my university’s reopening plans. Working out is how I manage stress, and I’m a pretty fit guy. With no gyms open, surgery restricting me from intense physical activity for months, and unbelievable stress, my moderate drinking spiraled into heavy, frequent drinking as I struggled to cope with daily life. 

While I have hardly packed on the pounds, my muscles lack their former definition and I went from ""oh, he definitely works out"" to ""looks kinda like an average Joe."" Sounds vain, I know, but when you're in a long-term relationship with an elite athlete and pride yourself on your own abilities, it makes you quite self-conscious, and it sucks when your body doesn't reflect your level of fitness--at least in the way that you're made to expect. So, naturally, those shitty feelings only fueled the very thing making it worse: drinking. I kept trading one six pack for another, and it's amazing what nearly five months of bad choices can do.

Well, I’ve been absolutely kicking ass for about five weeks now. I’ve visibly put on muscle to the point that my partner—who seldom remarks on my appearance; it’s just not his way of expressing affection—made a rare and flattering observation about it. I’ve leaned out a tad, too. And yet, my drinking has been all over the place, only occasionally interfering with this commitment to exercise and the joy it brings me, but almost certainly detracting from my results. 

I am on day four of no alcohol, and I think I'm going to take a break for a while, or at least keep almost none in my apartment and force myself to be very moderate. That said, as someone who has successfully been a term moderate drinker for long periods of time in the past, have those of you with similar histories been able to go back to well-controlled drinking? Or was it a matter of completely giving it up? 

And furthermore, what was your timetable like if you were getting your physique back? Being on day four has gotten rid of any bloating and my sleep has been amazing. My mood feels more stable and overall just better, and I have more energy than I'm used to. I’m hoping my pretty intense (but sustainable. I know what I’m doing) routine is going to get me nice and lean again with the sudden cutting out of all of the empty calories and other effects of alcohol speeding that along.

That phrase.. I don’t care.. I used to mutter it in between gulps in reassurance that the alcohol was working. But I did care. I cared so fucking much that I had to shut it down, constantly, or else I would explode into a ball of negative energy taking everything in my path down with me. 

This time is different. I hit 90 days free of alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, and adderall (prescribed, but nonetheless destructive) today. I’m not used to feeling this sad, crying this hard, having these horrible emotions as intense as I’m feeling them.. anymore. 

My dad texted to tell me he has Covid and just tested positive. He started showing symptoms Tuesday, was at my house last Friday. My mom is immune compromised from a kidney transplant 6 years ago and they’re both over 65. My MIL is immune compromised, and my husband is building a deck with his dad right now, has been the last two weeks. They are also over 65. You can see how all of this sucks. I call my mom to ask her if she’s getting tested, which turns into a huge argument and she hangs up on me. I’m sobbing when I call my husband and an hour later am still fighting back tears. 

My, how the tables have turned. I used to be the defensive one, screaming and hanging up out of anger. My relationship with my mom and dad is complicated and definitely a reason I drank. The last day I drank was my moms birthday. Now I sit here, immobilized in silence, processing. In the midst of this I caught the phrase slip past my lips, “I don’t care..”. But I do care. I cared then and I care now and this hurts like hell. 

At least I know I’m not going to pick up a bottle. I’m safe to feel these emotions because I have control over them. I remember thinking I could never have that, but here I am. I am strong and I can handle this.

Usually, I cannot make it through a Tinder date without at least three drinks--these dates are awkward meet ups with strangers from online, intentions are usually vague, and a lot of times they look nothing like their photos and aren't as charming as their profiles. I always drown the night away in dry martinis and end up going home with them because they become more appealing as I become more drunk.

**BUT TONIGHT WAS DIFFERENT!** I had nothing to drink, he was drinking, and as he got more drunk it was like watching the parabola of alcohol (that wave of: good good great--uh oh--bad worse fucking terrible). At one point I went to the bathroom, bored, and thought in my head ""I wish I could drink so this became more fun and he seemed more interesting."" Then I laughed out loud at that thought--I wished I could drink so I could convince myself to do something I don't want to with someone I don't like? And spend lots of money and an entire night of my precious weekend to do it?! ehm....because? That is sick and twisted alcohol logic if I ever heard it.

It's been a really good (and at times, really hard) six months of sobriety. I quit right before my 30th birthday back in February, but this August I had three relapses. The first two felt like minor things (wine on a camping trip, seltzer on a river trip) and I decided to keep my counter. Last night I was catching up with some old friends, finally in person again! I had 2.5 beers, sharing the last with a friend. Nothing terrible happened: no blackouts, embarrassing comments, hangover... But I feel like a badge reset will help more than harm. Similarly, I feel like sharing my feelings in this space will help, so here I am. 😊

I'm trying to come to terms with myself as a nuanced human being and away from all-or-nothing catastrophic thinking. I think a reset will help me restart my expectations with myself and inject fresh motivation into my sobriety goals instead of obscuring these recent exceptions under my counter and easing back into normalizing drinking.

That said, the reset doesn't rob me of my six months of sobriety, which were hard-won and incredibly motivating! I loved living a life of clarity, accountability and health, and I want to continue!!

One of the best tools I've used in the past is pausing to reflect on the need that underlies my urge to drink and treating that need with compassion. All three 'slips' have essentially boiled down to social anxiety triggers - wanting to feel more at ease and/or more 'normal' by engaging in drinking with others.

I'm 29M, as a teenager I had to deal with a toxic family and lot of bullying. One of the reasons was my stubborness, I didn't like loud music and considered drinking a waste of time. People didn't accept that at all and just humiliated me every chance they could. As a kid I didn't knew any better, so being an introverted person, I turned to myself and became addicted to video games. Gaming helped me cope with my situation, but also robbed a lot of years from my life, my social skills never developed like other people did.
Eventually I had health issues related to gaming so much, had to have a surgery and a long recovery. That event helped realise just how I was wasting my life, and since then I have fought against the addiction and to have a better life.

I'm writing this because even though I am socially awkward, people still expect me to drink and keep getting disapproval glares when I refuse, even as an adult. I never liked alcohol and never understood the obsession people have with social drinking. I admire everyone of you, who is struggling and are committed to improving their life, to not let the addiction ruin your potential. I still feel like an odd guy because I don't want to drink, the social pressure is still there even if these days I don't care about what others think of me.

Sometimes I wish I would have drunk as a teenager, maybe I would have enjoyed those parties and went to more of them. Maybe I would have had the courage to ask girls, to do more things instead of just sitting in front of the computer. Maybe I wouldn't be so socially awkward, I don't know. I stand by what I did, but I do think there is a cost associated in our society with refusing to partake in drinking at all.

I always tell people to load up on support.  Don't be discouraged if you can't quit on your own..Just get more help.

And to remember that it gets easier the longer you stay sober.

Pretty much no one would stay sober if it it stayed like early sobriety.  Because it sucks.

But the suckage is temporary.

And here is a study that shows that the brain does heal, the longer you stay sober.

""Sobriety does not cure ""being a human being and that's life"".  People that take sobriety will still experience normal human feelings like grief, boredom, anger, sadness and failure.  These side effects should not be taken as proof that sobriety doesn't work.

We have a bit of a chat as I've not been in for a week or so (last time was to buy 8 cans and an energy drink which was pretty normal for me and when he asks why I've not been in, I make a few excuses about work being busy, and thank my face mask for hiding the look of shame. He asks me twice if I want anything else, and as I'm putting everything in my little bag, he finally asks ""No drink?"" 

I make a vague joke about getting my life together and trying to lose some weight, and we both do an awkward laugh as he realises he's basically called me an alcoholic and I realise that he's probably known the whole time. Shouldn't come as a shock, I worked in a corner shop and recognised nearly every regular after a few weeks but it really hit home. Next time he asks, hopefully I'll be able to stand tall and say ""No thanks, I'm not drinking.""",9,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.996653139591217}"

since my old name has now since been banned from reddit and was forced to start a new one, i guess ill do my best to tell my story from the start up until the past few days. i am also having memory problems so ill graze over some parts and really try and focus on the last few year and a half. take your time to read this or dont, i really just need to let this out.

i live in a heavy drinking state in the US. we produce more beer and cheese than anyone else if you can guess which one.  growing up i had a great family, middle child with a younger sister and a brother.  i was an outgoing child and really excelled in things like gifted and talented and even was able to go to australia with an organization that sends students abroad. around 14 or so i had had only a few sips out of my dads beer on occaision and my parents enjoyed their nightly glass of wine over dinner or a movie.  they are both great people, my mom and dad met in med school and both continued on in very successful practices.  growing up, and i still dont know if this has something to do with this situation i am in now, but i really dont remember much of them in my early years outside of their work.  i remember a lot of babysitters.  me and older brother were rascals and got some of them fired or just fucked with them for no reason other than being brats.  my sister was born in 95, i was around 5 or so and my mom decided to quit her job as a doc and raise the kids at home in a small town where i grew up.  

fast forward to middle school, where alot of people suffer, and being one of those kids i sought help from my older brother who introduced me to pot and more importantly alcohol.  i was in eighth grade and he was a senior in high school and we did, in retrospect, some really fucked up shit. stealing the family car to break into our grandparents house an hour away while they were wintering in florida, i was brought to high school parties, and i kinda just got the sense that this was the norm.  i remember one time me and my brother were on a roadie smoking a bowl and sharing a beer and a friend of his drove up beside us and he was SHOCKED i was in the car next to him.  at the time i thought it meant i was cool, but to be honest red flag.  long story short the parents caught on to the fact that why is a high school senior spending so much time doing sketchy shit with his eighth grade brother on an almost daily basis.  one night before he graduated he got so drunk he couldnt perform in the senior showcase with a girlfriend of his, had to be picked up passed out in a cornfield and proceeded to tell my parents ""well if you are gonna be so mad at me? you should be pissed at \*me\* as well cause i did it too. he wasnt too worried since he was moving off to college soon at the state school, and this left me with four years of high school already busted.

it also just so happened at the time we were moving to the same city as his college, and i was to start my freshmen year in high school.  instead of trying to start a new life, i used my skills id learned from my brother and became the instant stoner persona and thought all the kids would flock to me as the cool new kid.  i knew about glass, i drank a tiny bit at the time, i wore tye-dye. and i did make a few friends, but by my sophmore year things started to peter out.  i didnt notice it at the time, but this was the turning point in my life.  

my friends were all part of a tight knit group and i didnt realize i was being slowly fizzled out.  i started working, smoking more and started going back to my brother who lived just a couple miles down the road for advice.  he had begun selling weed... i on the otherhand had a whole market of young dumb kids to sell to so again i fell into his grasp and i was buying ounces from him. later to learn only at an inflated price cause i was still dumb to the business, but i thought i was the shit that i could get weed from college kids.  i even got to hang out with him a few times not about business.  but again getting caught by parents started happening.  side note by my senior year i literally lost track of how many times id been busted by mom and dad, but thats not even the worst of it. 

i got really cocky with myself, started dating.  at this point no one really talked to me except if they needed a bag, but i always thought i was still cool for doing so only to get kicked out of their car as soon as they had it in their hands.  i could always find weed, it honestly is something i havent seen in many people but in the mid 2000s it felt like a gift from god to be the only person in our age group to do so.  

my junior year my brother again sold me a new drug mushrooms and i tripped for the first time on my birthday on a camping trip with my best psychonaught friend.  we packed up yoda the toyota with a tent some food and my dog and left for the weekend.  it was the first time i had ever been able to do this. trip went fine, i learned how great mushrooms were and some blurry weeks later i went to a phish show, knowing thats where i could get acid.  i gathered up some hooligans we went and wouldnt you know everyone else couldnt find anything but some dirt weed where i happened to find a ten strip for me and my buddies for the weekend.  everyone was stoked and from what i can remember it was a good time.  even though we were underage and had gotten kicked off our original camping site for not having proper id some dude saw us and let us camp in a sand pit in his back yard. it was gnarly.  one of those summers you look back on just think that was one hell of a time to be alive.  but back to the incurring issues of my life.  somewhere around that time i randomly found an id of a 25 year old 350 lbs man on the street and thought wow i can do something with this.  somehow someway we found one of those gas stations just outside of town that doesnt really care and within a few weeks i was supplying the incoming senior class with hundreds of dollars of alcohol at every party that was thrown.  again in retrospect i was only invited because no one else got booze unless i came, but i always inevitably ended up being the too drunk asshole at the party.  people put up with me.  

somewhere around that time as well, i met another person who ill call patches, and he was selling large quantities of acid to the neighboring highschool.  he bought alcohol from me and one night over a bottle of bourbon (such an odd choice for a senior to choose but he was willing to pay the upcharge) he mentioned that he had no business at my high school and asked me to be a partner.  he was selling gatorade bottles of acid while i was struggling to find two hits for myself and my gf at the time. so again i said yes and went deeper into the drug game.  made alot of money. went to more parties. began just showing up with a case of beer and felony amounts of acid at parties and just stopped caring if people thought i was a drunk idiot. i made money, they got drunk or high or tripped. just said fuck it.

mom finds bags of sour patch kids along with wads of cash in my jacket, got busted for possesion of marijuana, and somehow someway get into a great college in our neighbors to the north.  and then i graduated and left, leaving all that shitty stuff behind me. or so i thought.

i arrived at the university of british columbia in vancouver in the fall of 2010.  immediately had the same problems from when i started high school and tried to be the cool druggie dude to make friends.  problem was everyone sold weed there, and i was nothing special but some kid from bumblefuck.  so i decided to become a chef of marijuana edibles and ended up making quite a bit a cash to supplement my college needs. as well the drinking age was 19 which i had just turned prior to moving there.  MY DRINKING SKYROCKETED, i was having a blast but ended up with nicknames about my drinking and have been told on numerous occaisions ""ive never met anyone in my life who drinks like \*name redacted\*"" and i basically spent the year never going to class selling edibles and drinking my ever living ass off.  again i made a group of friends.

the story is gonna speed up now a bit because i really dont remember much of my twenties as im coming to the end of them now.  but long story short i dropped out my sophmore year due to introducing my room mate to cocaine (never really my thing) but to him i remember it as giving gollum the ring.  he would snort lines and come into my room at night only to beat me up for not putting my dishes away or attacking me at parties for not giving him his bag in time.  i often asked my friends for help but was just told why dont you stand up for yourself? i was flabbergasted and lost, and one night just called my mom and said i needed to come home.  she obliged and i gave up the best opportunity i ever had in my life.  

again moving back is such a blur now.  more on the memory problems later, but the early years are alot more clear than that past eight or so.  i came home and began drinking more and more.  first it was a six pack, then twelve, then for the majority of my twenties i was averaging an eighteen pack of highlife a night drinking alone.  i had friends come and go.  several jobs working in sandwhich places, pizza places, or as a line cook. some good some bad. as i said most of my twenties are a blur.  i remember things like turning 21 or getting jumped outside of the bar i worked at, but in all honesty i really dont remember much.  i did rehab around 23. ended up in the drunk tank many many times always picked up by my loving but growingly tired parents the next morning or worst case monday when i was picked up on a friday ugh. but nothing phased me.  i went to meetings strung together moments in time of sobriety but i always went back.  

so now onto my final chapter, or at least i hope its not. and if youve made it this far.... thanks and this is about to get really really dark.  

my entire family moved across country to big sky land, leaving me here.  i had no interest in moving, still hadent graduated college, i think i was about twenty six at the time.  i was already told my liver was showing signs of damage and was told to slow the fuck down, better yet stop.  but i decided against it and moved again to a small drinking town in the northern part of my state for school.  i dont think i had ever been evicted before for drinking, but i definatly had never gotten a security deposit back lets put it that way.  so after my first year i was indeed told to leave a very nice house a block from campus. grades were ok but then i decided to switch majors, kept getting fired from jobs, and overall i really didnt have any friends.  i still called my hometown friends but when they didnt answer id just get drunk and just started saying fuck it to beer and switched entirely to whiskey, something i had a problem with before but somehow had sworn off for the better part of a decade. i found a one bedroom off campus, was dog sitting and found a job working at a video store.  i love movies too so it was kinda perfect.  then i lost control and was drinking on the job and ended up getting so drunk before work one day i just called them and told them if they wanted someone wasted to come in and work ill do it like i do every other night but to be honest id rather not.  so i was fired. ended up in rehab again.  had to drop out of school for the semester. and again its a blur. 

just after rehab i made it about a week i think before i bought my first six pack and within a month i was just living off the money i had saved drinking on my couch waiting for next semester to start and i noticed a sharp pain in my lungs.  my dad being a physician, said no one your age gets something serious like that its problem just pneumonia.  i trusted him as i always do and waited three days til i couldnt take it anymore and was coughing up blood.  turns out i had had a massive pulmonary embolism shoot from my legs to my lungs.  i walked to the ER from my apartment and even the on call doc was shocked and told me i could have died at any point on that walk over there.  so i spent my first time in extended stay at my local hospital. this was two years ago roughly.  and again my memory gets worse and the story goes.

no one could figure why that happened to me... in all honesty im pretty sure it was booze.  i started school again, changed majors again, kept drinking and then this last year happened.  again i apologize my memory has gotten so bad im really having trouble remembering yesterday at this point.  i am only 29 for chirst sake.  

so by january of this year i had gone through withdrawal several times.  mostly un aided but it got to a point sometime last fall where i needed librium.  ive never had a seizure.  but ended up taking the scripts anyway always as prescribed.  i think i did two rounds of withdrawal with librium this last fall before all this started.  withdrawal is horrible. so bad you just want to keep drinking to just stave it off. even with the librium its still hell in a bucket for at least five days for me.  so in january i contacted my only friend i really have here.  shes an older woman who teaches at my university who i met through her dogs.  she and her husband agreed to let me stay there and wait out my last what i would call survivable withdrawal in their guest room for four days while i puked, didnt sleep, and spent the time entirely on reddit chat just counting the minutes. i made it through.  but again started drinking soon after to be honest i really cant remember why at this point.  and this is when things went from what i thought were snowballs to avalanches.  

late febuary i was drinking around a 750 of old thompson a day and again knew i had to take care of it.  i went to the ER one night for some reason or i was drunk off my ass and sure i was just gonna be given another script and leave to just do another 5 days of hell.  id done it so many times before and yet when you think about that first drink afterwords, it doesnt seems so bad.  

things quickly deterioriated and i was admitted to intensive care and began what i thought were DTs at the time but were what is called alcoholic hallucinosis.  I spent seven days hospitalized there. the only two i clearly remember were the last two but aparently i almost attacked a night nurse with a needle i pulled out of my arm, was constantly screaming out my door about things that werent going on like my dad was there even though he now lives across the country, and assuming most of the staff was trying to poison me.  but i walked out april first. i remember because rent was due and i didnt want anyone to know i was in the hospital for that long even though i had constantly called my family telling them about my secret assasins. i thought i could here them talking from the help desk just outside my room and spent many of those nights quietly arguing with them under my breath knowing they had micd my bed so all i had to do was listen and speak quietly and they would hear me.  im still not sure exactly what happened.  

i think i made it a month before i started buying beer again thinking it was ok, and then a six pack turned into a six pack with two shooters of old thompson on the side, then just the old thompson again.  ive been told many times i need to stop drinking, but for some reason my brain always thought im not that old.  it really hit me when a nurse told me to my face, while youre not that young either.  by june things started to change again.,,

I had been noticing very erratic behavior on my part. i was doing things even the drunkest version of me wouldnt do like try to kiss a neighbor even though i knew she was living with her boyfriend of several years. things again escalated and everyone around me kept just saying oh thats \*name redacted\* just being a useless drunk again.  and around this time my landlord gave me warning to stop bothering the people around me.... so i drank it off.

There was this one week in early june i began putting pieces together. i never had good bowel movements so the increase in diarhea never really rose any flags until one day i shat black.  i went to the ER and again was just given librium to go home with.  the next day, i thought one more day couldnt hurt and i picked up my whiskey and the next day was back in the ER because everytime i was drinking water i was pissing it out within minutes of consuming it.  I kept telling them something was wrong. they at this point are seeing me as a frequent flyer or a GOMER if you know the term.  after five or so days i had been to the ER six times and each time sent home until an on call doc diagnosed it.  alcoholic ketoacidosis.  it basically means i was drinking so much i wasnt eating and my body started eating itself instead of the nutrients i was giving it.  so the reason i was pissing water so fast was my body just didnt know what to do with it and was like alright flush it.  i told him about my past of hallucinations and how i drank to a level where i get scared to stop because i dont ever want to go back into that week long acid trip that i try to taper on my own..... that doesnt work. he decided to admit me. i spent the night again on the icu floor awaiting the inevitable start to my hallucinations.  by the next morning, i hadnt had any, i was on cloud nine and stupidly asked to be dishcharged.  they agreed after some consults and blood work. i didnt leave ama but there was some trepidation on their part.  

within minutes of walking home and picking up a pack of smokes, my apartment was an alcoholic mess and i didnt want to risk my landlord somehow seeing it so i tried to clean it as best i could. i began to have panic attacks and was so worried i made the wrong decision to leave so i raced back to the ER to be readmitted.  thats not how this works at all, my bed was already taken even though i was only gone about two hours tops with reintake to the ER included.  i still had needle marks in my arms from the IVs.  oh and i forgot to mention i tested positive for opiates when i was admitted, something i am still trying to figure out since i dont do pills or shoot, so the new doc on the floor was instantly suspicious and told me he could get me to detox.  thinking it was the same floor i was on before i was elated, but when i got there i realized it was just the detox i had actually spent time in before a year or so prior.  even their running doc was my psych eval from a few hours earlier.  being worried about a skyrocketing heart rate and starting to hallucinate, and nothing against this facility but i had been there before and knew the system, and knew i had to pay out of pocket which i couldnt do, i left AMA within 15 minutes.  dumb i know, but im an alcoholic addict, if i knew how to make good decisions i wouldnt be here, id be married with some kids out west somewhere by now instead of neck deep in a bottle of whiskey every night.  so i left and decided ONCE AND FOR ALL i would just go buy some beer and taper on my own.  

a few weeks later i turned 29, drank alone and dont really remember the rest. at some point in time between these two events i did in fact talk to one of my neighbors, i dont know when but i was sober enought to remember the details.  i didnt do anything wrong (in my mind) and helped her carry some records from her car to her apartment next to mine, and even excused myself from going fully into her apartment to set them down and just left them at her door and back to my lonely one bedroom.  She contacted the landlord about me contacting her and i got the best birthday present i could have asked for..... a thirty day notice.

lets just say my taper turned into a bender and over thirty days couldnt find a place other than moving back into the dorms for the second time in my life.... at almost 30 years old.  i became mean, lashed out at those i loved, lost friends and some of the family left who will even still talk to me, and was still needing to move anyway. 

During that period, my drinking got OUT OF CONTROL again, fuck tapering, fuck life, fuck this shit, fuck my landlord, fuck my neighbor.  Idk i started realizing my sweats werent just night sweats anymore, my heartbeat was at an all time high when for a period in the spring i could get it under 80 for a resting heart rate for a short time of sobriety, my shits went from pale to dark dark brown and waivered between water and shitting rocks. Ive been stuggling with alcohol for over a decade, i am no fool, i know what this means, liver failure.  with liver ltes in the 600s in june before all this i knew i must be pushing something but id just wake up. take a shot for the shakes, turn my AC to 65 to fight the sweats, and go get my daily bottle and pack of smokes.  

Three days ago i began moving into the dorms from my old apartment.  I havent slept since then.  I cant eat. i was puking up every bit of water i was able to keep down for an hour or so.  Wen i finally did move, the same woman that helped me earlier basically moved for me because i was wheezing and sweating through my shirt so hard she was alarmed. i did what i could and dipped out for a quick breather and puking in the bushes from the water i tried to down earlier that morning to fight the hangover from the night before.  Yesterday was my first day here.  i forgot dorms dont have AC and yes the whether was in the 90s, a record for heat and humidity, but i was dying.  i spent the day in a fetal position away from the window under a barely working desk fan just hoping to stay awake long enough so i could get a good sleep tonight(?) last night(?) its almost 7 am i still havent slept.  

I didnt have to research it, but did so anyway because im a paranoid freak, i show all the signs of acute liver failure all the way to end stage liver failure to a tee.  I spent the night in tears, i spent the night silently sipping whiskey in my unpacked dorm room boiling from the heat unable to sleep, i spent the night googling when to go the to ER for liver complete failure.  its here folks. i am not even 30 yet.  

There is no point to this story that i lead.  i have a doctors appointment set for next friday that i had to schedule back in july (yay american healthcare) ive metaphorically screamed at the top of my lungs to both my AODA counsellor, mental health professional, and family for help saying that since that last bought in june things have gotten worse and worse.  each day now is harder and harder to do.  im exhausted and absolutly hate the small bumble fuck town i am have been stuck in for the past three years. and my main thought last night was i dont want to die here. i want to see my mom and dad again. but theres little use. i am circling a drain for sure.  

So at the end of my post, if you made it this far. take this as a warning.  i want to go to urgent care today and get my levels checked but i cant make it more than a few hours without a sip of alcohol now. which negates the test due to BAC. i have the meeting next week but at the rate ive declined in the last week im not so sure i can even make it there.  I freaked out and drank most of a bottle of whiskey even while typing this over the past few hours.  im tired. i want sleep. the sun is rising, but im still sweating balls and not hungry but starving at the same time.  i know i am dying.  just if you read this i hope life is better for you than my journey.  i had some good times, but the bad have outweighed the good and what could have been by millions.  so long, if things change ill make another post.

I have been treated for alcohol abuse in the past,but it was because of self-medicating due to undiagnosed bipolar. I am now taking medication and drink far less. I am prone to the occasional binge however and can easily get into the habit of a nightly 2-3 beers (1 to 1.5 litres). I find it way easier to just not drink rather than to try and moderate.

Basically, I want to lead a generally alcohol-free life. I might drink at a wedding or other major social occasion and I won't beat myself up about maintaining a streak. Do you guys think I belong here or should I find a different sub-reddit?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

When I woke up this morning I took my anabuse to make sure I wouldn't be able to drink today.  I followed my new and improved sober living morning routine.  I had a great lift at the gym, pushed my cardio to a new level.  I showered and felt like a million bucks, I had a healthy breakfast and sat down to do some final research on the company I was gonna interview, I found a quote from their CEO in a trade publication about a machine learning initiative, That'll make a great question to ask I thought.

I was going to kill this interview, I'd been practicing what to say, how to say it, and felt confident.  I could taste it.  I flipped through my notes again, and implemented quicksort on paper, that could come in handy.  I put on a suit with a nice blue shirt on, it was a bit formal for a programming interview, but I was pulling out all the stops.  It was familiar commute to their office, funny enough it was three doors down from the company that had laid me off a few months back after 15 years of service.  I caught some feels on the way down, god knows I hate change so He wasn't even going to alter my commute when I got this job.

I showed up and charmed the pants off of my first two interviews, they expressed great interest in having me on the team, and told them I felt the same way.  There was just one last formality, a programming skills assessment, debug a couple functions, fix crashing, etc.  I sat down to do the assessment on their laptop, it was hooked up to a projector so the dude in the room could better see how I got to my solutions.  I sat down looked at the first question and I couldn't remember what SOLID stood for in object oriented programming.  I had reviewed this a few times that day, as it was obvious based on the job description that the question was gonna be asked.  I stared at the code and started reading it, but it wouldn't come together in my mind.  It was like I was down clocked, or put on a cursed sword.  All of a sudden I had a -5 intelligence modifier.  I remembered what the c++ syntax was, but I couldn't string more than one line of code together in my short term memory at a time.  It was humiliating, I couldn't do it.  I'm supposed to be a programmer with 5 years experience and I completely failed.  I fumbled around for an hour making no meaningful progress, and was walked out of the building.  I managed to make it home safely weeping the whole 30 minute drive.

I don't know if I had an anxiety attack or what the fuck happened to me.  The dude even suggested that I could use the internet to search for whatever, but I couldn't even comprehend what to search for.  I've never felt so dumb.  Dumb and devoid of all hope.  But I didn't drink.  So that's what 14 days.  And before anyone suggests it I did get to schedule an emergency session with my psychiatrist this weekend, so I'm getting professional help for what I hope was just an anxiety attack.  I've still got lingering doubts, what if I actually can't do my profession any more....  thanks for reading this.  

edit: I should be honest, I smoked some weed as soon as I got home, I didn't drink but i got high and that's just as bad for me.  I'm gonna reset the old counter.

Years ago, in my 20s, when I was drinking all the alcohol and coffee and chain smoking cigarettes and weed, I woke up feeling like ass with a terrible hangover. 

I developed the worst headache and decided to take a nap. When I woke up, I was blind in the right lower quadrant of my vision in both eyes. Like, I could see fine but if I stared straight ahead and waved my hand down and to the right I couldn’t see anything. Kinda like that space didn’t exist. (When I tried it on my left eye the blind spot was kinda by my nose.)

So, freaked out when this didn’t go away, on hangover day 2 or 3, I went to my doctor and got a bunch of referrals. One guy thought I had cancer (nope). I got tested for stroke and MS. Got CT scans and spinal taps and regular MRIs. But no diagnosis.  

There was some sort of lesion on my brain shown  in the MRI, but docs has no idea what it was. Didn’t look like something from a stroke and wasn’t getting bigger/killing me so not a tumor.

Eventually my vision came back. And the lesion got smaller.

Eventually my neurologist kinda shrugged and told me to stop coming unless something changes.

Now that I’ve been AF and cigarettes and weed free for a while (still drink too much coffee) and feeling pretty good, I’m wondering how many of what seemed like isolated issues were cured by the “silver bullet” of lifestyle change.

Anxiety down. Heart beat now normal. No intrusive thoughts. More self confidence. Interest in hobbies again...

Instead of his usual seizures (he says he doesn’t know what’s causing them, I do), he had a full on psychotic break after drinking a 40 of rum and stealing his roommates meds. I told him if he didn’t get help I couldn’t be a part of his life anymore.

After a tearful few hours and messaging back and forth, he committed himself to inpatient treatment. He was there for 3 days when “they told him he had to leave to make space for someone else” - I still don’t buy this. 

He messaged me and apologized and promised he’d go to AA and really work to stop. I live out of town but a friend who lives near him told him it seemed different, like he really wanted to get better this time.

Fast forward a few weeks and I hear he’s drinking again, but it’s just beer so it’s ok right? I saw him about a month ago when visiting and no matter what time of day, he had a beer in his hand. 

And now the constant drinking posts again. I feel so betrayed. It is tragic to watch a loved one lie over and over again, while watching their health deteriorate. 

I know now deep in my heart that I’ve done all I can for him and now all I can do is take care of myself. I will not ruin my mind and my body for the temporary escape that alcohol offers, only to leave your problems amplified later. I’m so fucking over it. IWNDWYT

Per my previous post, I got a blood test and everything was fine bar triglycerides and cholesterol, which I'm working to get down. I had to insist on getting an ultrasound as my Dr was pretty blasé about the whole thing. 

The good news is that my liver is normal. No scarring, no fatty liver etc. I was sure that I was experiencing symptoms of cirrhosis (thanks Dr Google), which made me stop drinking in the first place (non-sarcastic thanks to Dr Google). The dread of receiving a bad prognosis was what stopped me from getting the tests done years ago, along with the ""screw it, I've already done the damage why stop drinking now.....drink more!"".  In the light of a clearer, sober mind I took the tests and now have a huge weight off of my shoulders. 

The best news is that this will not change my sobriety. I love going to sleep and waking up on purpose. Next on the agenda is cigarettes. Damn those gorgeous white and orange heaven sticks \*shakes fist\*. IWNDWYT",30,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.996126115322113}"

I'm fucking *bored* right now and it's hot as hell outside. I've been mildly depressed all day. Usually I'd be reaching for a drink. But now I am choosing to run the tape forward instead. I'd start with one drink which would feel good as the first few sips release those coveted endorphins, so I'd probably reach for another, and then another. By nightfall I'd probably be good and drunk, and I'd probably not eat dinner--or if I did, it would be unhealthy because I eat like shit when I'm drinking.

I've been toying around in my head if i'm an alcoholic or merely enjoy a drink every night. I've decided to lean towards the former for a multitude of reasons

1. I work in a retail job which involves the sale of alcohol. Sometimes when it is delivered there are damaged cases and they end up getting reduced in price to which i usually end up taking them home. I tend to justify this usually by either saying i'm helping my bank balance out or the company out, but we all know it is just to feed on the addiction.
2. I have been severely struggling with finances recently, often spending most of the month at the bottom of my overdraft, not because of bills, not because of trips away or purchasing porn online or anything like that but because of drinking. It came to a point where i was a bit short for what i usually purchase and so asked a family member to lend me some money in order to pay for my dads birthday present in a few days. As soon as the money arrived it was spent at the bar (Don't worry i already have the present sorted i just needed a good excuse for money)
3. I constantly find excuses to head to the local store in order to get alcohol without my partner finding out. I usually end up getting something cheap and a can of beer which i usually consume before i get home and throw deep in the recycling.
4. I'm finding it a struggle to focus on anything without feeling a little buzzed. For example i purchased a game online and as it was downloading i went to the store to get a bottle of rum ""in order to enjoy the game fully"".
5. To further extend my point above, i find that if i have even a little buzz going on, life is easier to manage. I struggle a lot with depression and anxiety and once i have that can of beer down me and i feel that warm buzz life becomes funnier again. I was recently re-watching a comedy special which i didn't appreciate at all when sober but two beers in it was suddenly the funniest thing ever to me

I didn't think i'd be calling myself an alcoholic today. I thought that term only applied to people who got blackout drunk every night. Turns out it can apply to me to and saying that i am an alcoholic is already a weight off my chest. It's pay day today and instead of heading to the 24 hour garage to get a bottle of wine i'm sitting here typing out my thoughts to you guys. Now some questions

1. I have a few get togethers with co workers involving meals out, heading to bars etc. I have already promised to go but i don't want to make it obvious that i'm not drinking as i know that the conversations will send me into an anxiety attack and ruin my night and potentially my reputation with co workers. What would be the best  course of action for this?
2. I'm heading to my parents for a get together. Some information about my parents, they drink daily, not enough to worry anyone and it is well within their means financially. I went alcohol free for a few weeks whilst i was at living at home and all i received was teasing from them ""Oh he's not drinking. He's gone tee-total"". Again nothing too over the top just simple harmless family jokes. I don't want to explain to my parents why i'm not drinking as in their eyes it doesn't make sense to them why i'm stopping so should i drink when i'm there and then reset the count from that day or just bite the bullet and hope my anxiety doesn't flare up
3. Does drinking alcohol free beer and wine count as drinking in this subreddits eyes?
4. Do you have any information, tips or any guidance whatsoever on what to do if the demons start pecking away at my brain for ""Just one more""

For me it's when I do drink and do go out with friends, I've caused so many issues. I've disgraced myself so many times and I've been in some very dangerous states. I've ruined relationships and so many other things.

Here are the most distraceful states I've been in:

- I've been in a hospital in Bulgaria on holiday with two drips needed to make me wake up.

- I've pissed myself a couple of times in broad daylight at drinking events and at hotels. (There is a photo on my friend's Facebook account of me with wet jeans) 

- I've been asleep in my own sick in different hotels and also in corridors and caused mayhem. (Also in ANOTHER hotel to where I wasn't even staying). 

- I've lost money

- I've given my phone away...

- I've somehow (just this weekend) came home with someone else's phone (returned it)

- I've been weird with females 

- I've been texting horrible messages at random to ex's

- I've harassed a girlfriend over the phone (now ex) 

- I get terrible, AWFUL anxiety and low mood after I drink alcohol both because of what I've done or because of the mental effects. 

- I've had countless blackouts and not known how I've been able to get home or where I've been or what I've done. 

There's probably a whole lot more stupid things I have done that I haven't listed here. 

I think it's time to stop. I have a good job. I have a loving family and I'm lucky with what I have in life but I feel as though going out drinking is ruining my life and causing me some real problems. I don't recognise my limits and I have no self control.

Instead of binge drinking on the weekends my stupid theory was to spread all those drinks through the entire week. It didn’t work too well so in 2017 I actively tried to moderate my drinking and continued to fail.

After a few bouts of sobriety lasting anywhere between a week or 3 I decided on the 27th of August 2017, after waking up slightly hungover, that I was done. I committed to meditating everyday for at least a month and that seemed to help me focus on my intentions. That 30 days turned into a 92 day meditation streak and I honestly believe those 15-20 minutes of setting intentions and focusing on myself everyday helped me remain sober. 

The first year was difficult in social situations but I’ve found my circle of friends I want to be around who don’t want to drink all the time. They don’t judge or care about my abstinence. In larger social gatherings I still say “fuck it” and let loose while slamming down a few La Croixs and coffee.

I was brought up in a family where alcohol has always been a big thing so I never thought I had any issues.

I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety a long time ago but my mental health has been getting worse and worse and my drinking has been getting heavier and heavier.

Normally I’d lie but I realised I had hit my breaking point and didn’t want to be this way anymore so I admitted for the first time I’ve been abusing alcohol heavily to cope with my mental health (which obviously doesn’t work but bipolar and alcohol abuse are closely linked for a reason). I’ve lurked here for a long time wishing I could be as strong as you guys and I’m so very scared but here I am anyway.

* My shoes are starting to fit a bit better! I went up about 1.5 shoes sizes due to the weight gain/swelling....I was a size 8.5 before and now even a size 10 hardly fits. But my sneakers are fitting a bit looser today
* My sweat is somehow smelling a bit better (I don't know how to explain this one) 
* I have collected 5 garbage bags full of cans/bottles and will be taking them in to the bottle depot today! My bedroom looks and smells a lot better so far

Just small things...but they are enough to keep me going. I hope everyone else is doing okay on their journey! I'm going to try to get some fresh air and sun today, as i've been sitting in my room a bit too much for the past 3 days.

I've been lurking on this sub for a bit and I'm inspired and impressed but I really want to ask how do you all deal with the psychological aspect of wanting to drink? A little about myself: I've been drinking pretty much every day for about 10 years. I'm in my early 30s, female, have kids (I didn't drink through pregnancies), divorced, make good money, fit and good-looking. Everything is seemingly normal when it comes to me, white collar professional, I have a ton of friends and overall am happy and positive. I also had 2 DUIs. The last one was so bad, I was driving on a highway in the opposite direction that landed me in jail for 3 weeks, house arrest after that for 3 months, totaled my car, lost my job, put me on 2 year probation... That was last year. I was sober for about 4 months but as soon as I was able to go back to drinking that was what I did. My average intake is about two bottles of wine a night. I've been to AA and that is absolutely not a place for me. They are depressing and I don't agree with the religious narrative they carry. I've been through therapy, educational and mental courses. I feel like it's all bs and all the same and literally all the arguments I've heard against alcohol are so cliche and boring they straight up don't work on me. I asked my doctor to prescribe pills. She put me on Acamprosate. I felt like it was helping but I only lasted a couple of weeks trying. After that I stopped taking the pills and went back to drinking. Why? Because I love it and I don't understand why. It's like I may not drink for a few days and feel great physically but then my mental state is miserable. I feel deprived and like I'm missing out. Then I say to myself: ""Why live if you can't even enjoy the life?"" And I'm back to my hole drinking, staying up, and feeling like trash the next day. My days revolve around the time I can start drinking. It's always the highlight and the most exciting part of the day. I started dating a guy earlier this year. He is great and we got along so well, but when I drink I get so nasty to him, I kick him out, ghost him, just a straight up asshole. I hurt him so much and it hurts me too. Yesterday I told him I couldn't do it anymore and asked to please not contact me again. He was so sad and I was sad too. I am the problem. My alcohol is the problem. We could've been great together but I can't help but sabotage everything. So that's pretty much my situation and at this point I don't know how to get myself to give up alcohol and not miss it so much. How do you deal with it? I see people on here who's been clean for months and years. That's so awesome and I wish I could say it one day.. Yet here I am. Any advice?",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9968806505203247}"

I hope nobody takes offence but this is something I’ve wanted to say for a while. It’s also something that is by no means directed at everyone on this group or people who are sober.

When I first got sober I was told by my sponsor to pay close attention to those that are suffering after getting clean. Those that are in the multiple digits of sobriety and are still suffering. And when she said suffering she meant being inundated with cravings; still suffering from those punch in the stomach cravings; still considering every day to be a ‘battle’. She advised me that a great many people use drugs whilst still attending support groups and many of these people also take several types of medication. She told me I would heal and not only could I live a life without alcohol, that I could thrive too.

She was right. Yet foolishly I allowed these people to scare me. For months and months. I allowed them to convince me that I would be a slave forever, and every day I would struggle. God forbid I choose to leave AA I would surely fail. 

Not only am I still sober, I never think about alcohol now. I never get those crippling moments of stress to drink. I can sooth my worries, sadness, anxieties through natural means. In fact, some days I forget I was ever an alcoholic. My body and brain healed. My memory returned. My judgement came back. And most importantly: my sanity came back. 

Am at risk? Always. Can I ever drink again? Ha! Not even a drop. Do I need to remain vigilant? For the rest of my life. But I am free. And had I listened to those people I don’t think I would be making this post today.

But I’m going thru a thing and I just don’t know who I can talk to about what I’m feeling. 

Yesterday I was supposed to have a tooth pulled. I drove myself there, filled out my paperwork, paid for my visit, received the anesthetic injections and then was handed my consent form for the procedure. I froze up, my entire body broke into a flop sweat and I became extremely dizzy and anxiety took over. 

Ultimately, I had to opt out of the surgery because I’m too terrified to be awake while it happens. Being put to sleep for the procedure basically doubles the price and quadruples the guilt I feel for not being able to step up to the plate and do this relatively simple thing that people do every day.

The rational part of my brain understands that this is perfectly reasonable and that there’s no shame in the alternative. But then there’s that nagging part in the back that insists that I have something that I should feel bad about. That part is dangerous. When I indulge my perceived shortcomings I get self destructive, and there is a potential for poor decision making. 

Basically, I’m scared. I wish things weren’t the way they are. I’m worrying about money. My mind keeps wandering to all the substances I could use to escape dealing with the problem. I have every intention of following up with the surgeon and getting the procedure completed, but I feel my mind trying to retreat into itself and I just wanted someone to listen and talk to.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9968960285186768}"

Looking back (as I tend to do this time of year) it feels like I took the hard road though 20/20 hindsight does tend to gloss over some of the things I had to overcome in order to get sober.

* I had to get over my conviction that I was getting away with it, that I was 'high functioning', that somehow I deserved it as a reward.

* I had to get over being right all the time. Having all the answers - and so incapable listening to suggestions or taking direction.

* I had to admit that maybe I needed help; that my drinking was not a switch I could turn off.

* I had to get out of my fear and actually ask for help.  There is no coast guard equivalent flying around in helicopters looking for drunks who are headed for a reef. Part of this fear was compounded by shame and the conviction that I was unique that nobody else had ever....

* I had to get over the 'poor me-s' as in, ""if you were married to my wife, had my job, stress ... you would  drink too.""

* I also had to get over the notion that I was a total fuckup and that I was incapable of change.  Some of that took seeing others who I recognized as fellow fuckups getting sober (and this is where a group setting like AA, Smart, refuge recovery was so important to me.)

But the whole point is I did it. Somehow I was able to listen, to accept help and I got and stayed sober- despite all the denial, rationalization, and fuckits I could throw at my recovery.

I am very lucky I was able to survive all those slips, that I did keep coming back (some don't).

A final note: long term recovery is such a wonderful state of being; it's worth all the trials, tribulations, angst and gnashing it takes...

KNOW YOUR TRIGGERS 

• Spontanious drinking sessions - Breathe. Relax. Compose yourself. Always give yourself time to read this advice fully before rushing away to drink. 

• Boredom - i.e.' when you don't have anything better to do. Breathe. Relax. 

• Holidays / weekend breaks - the need to have a 'much better' time than usual and 'let hair down'. You will totally enjoy it more if you just relax, enjoy yourself and actually remember the whole experience. 

It's enjoyable because of the lovely, new location you're in and the company you're with. Getting wasted isn't going to make it any better. The risks on holiday are FAR higher as you are not in a familiar setting. 

• After parties - avoid. 

• Pre drinks - avoid where possible. 

• Sunny weather: beer gardens, bbqs - associate this with relaxing, sunbathing, food and cold, hydrating soft drinks. 

Enjoy a nice refreshing alcohol-free drink and some snacks first. Then have lower alcohol alternatives first instead of hitting the pints or hard stuff straight away. Take it easy and enjoy the company. It's not a race. 

• Nights out and pub crawls - you can still enjoy these. Just limit units. Have shandies, wine spritzers. 

• Day-drinking sessions - same as above. Enjoy company and take it easy - it's not a race! :) 

• Hanging out with people who you know are a bad influence - avoid entirely. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
TIPS AND ADVICE 

• MAXIMUM units rule. 

• ALWAYS pre-plan drinking sessions and set out limit beforehand 

• ALWAYS have food beforehand or during

• Drink soft drinks, coffee, energy drinks, water, or tea during or afterwards. 

• When out, shandies and wine spritzers are your best friend! 

• Offer to be the designated driver 

• Go home early. Nothing good ever happens after about 12pm anyway. 

• Don't ABUSE alcohol. Learn to ENJOY and APPRECIATE it. The pleasure only lasts for one or two then after that, you're drinking for the EFFECT.

• If you need to, give people a heads up and let them know you're not drinking much. 

• If ever taking drugs, have a maximum of 4 drinks or eqivalent (8 units) then stick to water, juice or tea. Otherwise, you're on a slippery slope and risk of losing control is HIGH. 

• The anticipation and 'thirst' build up to drink, especially when restless, is one of the worst triggers. Breathe through this and relax. 

• It only takes about 3 drinks to start to lose inhibitions and want to drink more. 

• Focus less on the act of drinking and enjoy the moment. 

• You DON'T need to be DRUNK to be sociable or to have a great time, tipsy stage is more than enough :) 

• Try to avoid or use extra caution with situations that will be a guarenteed sesh

• Plan more fun, sober activities!

• If you do feel like you're losing control, have a nice cup of tea or a PINT of water. It will fill you up, ease 'the thirst', wake you up a bit, help you come back to reality and mellow you out :)

RISKS OF BLACKING OUT

• Complete loss of control over brain and rational thinking 

• Getting lost!

• Ruined reputation 

• Bump into someone you know whilst completely obliterated!

• Drunk sleepwalking 

• Hurt self - black eyes, broken nose, hypothermia, death ???

• Getting taken advantage of

• Lose phone, keys, money 

• Saying cringey things or doing something embarrassing 

• Guarenteed 2-day hangover 

• Being hungover, panicky, anxious, stupid and foggy headed at work on Monday morning 

• Flirt (or worse sleep) with people I dont like

• Binge-eating 

• Smoking cigarettes

• Taking drugs 

Imagine if your family saw you in some of the states you've been in. You don't want that to happen again do you? 

If you love and respect yourself, why knowingly put yourself in a situation where you are completely VULNERABLE, at HIGH RISK of DANGER and complete embarrassment? 

You're acting as if you don't give a shit about looking after yourself and completely disrespecting yourself. LOVE yourself, you are worthy of love.

There were no diet restrictions; I had chips, desserts, and soft drinks if I wanted them.  And no exercise besides some short evening walks.  For the second 30 days I have decided to do some exercise every day, which for me is a 2-mile run/walk either first thing in the morning or late afternoon. (Mostly running but a few minutes of walking when I get winded.) After just a few days I can see that this makes a difference. My mind is clearer; I haven't had headaches, and I'm not waking up with those phantom hangovers. It could be sweating out toxins, it is probably just because it is good to get the blood moving. As an added bonus when I exercise I usually think twice about having that dessert or snack while watching TV.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

For me this was the case. I came into college and didn’t drink but on the weekends with some buddy’s. As I progressed through my years at school I gradually began to drink more and more. Let’s say in high school I weighed about 180 (I’m 6’2) but when we were sent home for quarantine this past spring semester I stepped on the scale for the first time... I weighed in at 230. I took this as an absolute shock and decided to diet and work out. I lost about 15 pounds. What I didn’t take out of that diet was Alcohol. I switched from beer to seltzer and from Whiskey to Vodka, thinking this was better. I recently came back to college about a month ago, and it’s very hard to say but I can probably count on one hand the days that I did not consume alcohol. Today has been the first day in about a week and a half where I haven’t had a drink and to be honest it was hard. I just began to realize that after this year, my life will truly begin. I will hopefully find a job, get a crib and progress in my life. I want to be the best person I can be. This being said, I have a couple questions and was curious about everyone’s personal opinions that could help me and others. 

What should I do if there is alcohol out and I can’t throw it away because 4 people split the cost?

When you see your buddy’s drinking, what’s the best advice that could stop me from grabbing a drink and joining them?

What are some alternatives that have proven effective to stop drinking?

I told a medical professional that I was angry with myself. I don’t like being bad at things. And I hated that I sucked at drinking. He helped me realize i shouldn’t be disappointed in myself - in fact it’s a fine thing to be bad at. I just had to realize that it’s not for me.

Just wanted to share my thoughts.,"I lurk on this community a lot, because it's so helpful. I really appreciate the impact ya'll have on my life.

I'm 28 and have been drinking heavily since probably 24 or so. Rarely do I buy a bottle of hard liquor, instead, I for some reason choose to drink 6+ beers each night. The most recent years, I'd buy a 6-pack of Buoy IPAs which are like 7.5%. All would be gone by the end of the night. The pace of my drinking would speed up on the second half of them, usually because I wanted them ""gone"". Once all 6 were consumed, I'd be drunk enough to fall asleep within the hour.

I've had the intention of stopping drinking for a long time now. I know I'm not capable of ""just having one"" like many of my friends can, so I know it's not just a matter of reducing the intake.

The biggest motivator I've had of late is my health. I've begun to see the effects of my lifestyle on my body. I have constant stomach issues, intense anxiety, and a constant feeling of shame for my habits and past actions. I'm intensely worried about the long-lasting effects I've done to my body.

I know this is all one big rant so far, but I had a reason I wanted to post. I want to be accountable, considering the literal 100s of nights I've genuinely planned on quitting for good, only to wake up and make it just halfway through the day before driving to get beer...

I also want to share my experience in hopes that others may learn and help themselves from it. My thoughts aren't organized at all, but I still wanted to share.

This is my Day2, and despite hating myself for saying it again, the sobriety will stick this time.

I had some really hard truths laid out in front of me by my best friend this past weekend. We were going to hang out, I said I was wanting to drink a little. 

She doesn't respond for a while, I'm not bothered, she's got three kids, I understand. Then she sends a long message that just kind of....broke my heart. My feelings were hurt too, but it's really what I needed to hear. She told her husband I was not drinking and he was elated to hear it. And the only way I was allowed over is if I didn't drink. And she thought I should stop, that a mutual friend's partner said I wasn't welcome at their place. Another friend was nervous to hang out again because the last time we did, nearly a year ago, I got so drunk I passed out on the toilet and my then-pregnant best friend couldn't get me up. The other two people were guys so she didn't feel comfortable asking them. I ended up waking up on the toilet, with a long text from her. So they had reason to be nervous. I didn't drink then and I had a good time. I could definitely sense the tension in the room while I was there though. 

All of those things really made me stop and think and of course cry. I couldn't be mad at her, I've put her through so much. And so many other people. I'm just thankful I have a friend who can be honest with me. IWNDWYT

When I think back over the last three years, during my journey into sobriety, this is the time of year for me: time to pack all the things, and morph into a different version of myself.

With that comes that I allowed myself to stop doing what I’m doing (sobriety-wise). 

A two week break from sobriety..

I don’t remember how long I held out in 2018, but I almost made it 9 months I think. I failed to remain sober through Burning Man, though after all that heat and partying, I was very much looking forward to my sober life again, I remember telling a friend after.

Instead, I went off the rails the rest of the year.

Last year, I made it most of the year sober, kept it under control for awhile, didn’t really want it at first. I suppose I was already well on my way to drinking alone and swallowing pills by this time last year. When Burning Man finally rolled around,I was a disaster emotionally, having just broken up with my life, started a new job in a new state as a Consultant, and wasn’t dealing with all that change really well.

So, usually around this time, I’d usually be buying out the Costco for our Whiskey bar, acquiring pallets of beer and pedialyte (great desert hang-over cure), and organizing my treats for out there. 

But this year, I am not. 

I miss my Burner family terribly.
I realize that I am also terribly relieved that it is cancelled.

I’m not sure that I want or need the experience anymore, though I ache with loneliness for my nutty, creative friends, and the gigantic hugs and smiles they bring with them.

Heh, I'm struggling with the words of this post, because no part of me wants to shame anyone for calming their inner drinker with food, crappy or otherwise. If you find a way that works for you, that's amazing! But I need some help finding my own way.

I'm not classically an alcoholic, but I did have a real problem stopping when I started, and also that, ""It's okay to have another glass of wine..."" voice just would never shut. up. Managing that little voice wasted so much mental energy, even if I usually was okay-ish at listening to it. I'm feeling so good now, so much less distracted by urges, I honestly am having trouble imagining bringing alcohol back into my life. (Also, antidepressants, ya'll. What the hell, what took me so long? Those are also REALLY making it hard to imagine bringing it back.)

The question I'd like to posit is: I'm also choosing, personally, to not use food as a comfort anymore. All the classic junk foods are out for me, as sticking to a strict Paleo diet makes me feel so much better in general. So, it means: no gluten/grains, dairy or sugar/sweeteners of any kind. Just eating a whole pizza when I want a drink, as much as I still LOVE pizza, is something I'm choosing to leave behind.

I'm super glad all of ya'll get to find solace in the tastiest, maybe-not-so-great-for-you foods of life, but for me, I've gotta find other things to distract myself.

What are your favorite non-food ways to distract yourself from urges? Your favorite activities and hobbies? Favorite places? Perhaps also, what are your mantras, your (in your mind) happy places, your favorite healthy distractions?

Health improvements I've noticed.","Hello, thank you all always for the inspiring posts, it really helps a lot when the struggle gets a bit too much. I've been 3 weeks sober now, and although my normally alcohol-medicated depression has become exposed bare under broad daylight, things are getting better. Aside from the depression, I noticed numerous improvements in my health:

1. I used to suffer from extreme allergies, or so I thought. I used to go through a box of tissues a day just to blow out my nose. I don't do that anymore! Delightful.
2. My legs, ankles and feet used to swell really tight, especially in the evening. They are much much better now, especially since after about 2 weeks.
3. The tingling in my leg. I had this for more than half a year- I thought I had spine injury, but no. They are almost gone! It used to be so uncomfortable that I couldn't fall asleep. This one I haven't expected, a happy surprise.
4. Skin. Right before I quit, my skin looked dead. Greyish, with tons of blemishes, dry and coarse. Now although the blemishes are still there, it feels much hydrated and plump.
5. Brain! My brain... Before I quit, I had this feeling, similar to when your muscles are so weak, you can't form a firm fist. When you can't flex your muscles. I had this with my brain. It felt like something was loose, smushy, like not-wet-enough sand. I have been increasingly productive the past few days, which feels amazing. I hope this improvement continues.
6. Dizziness. Before when I simply got up, even during the day when I was sober, I felt like fainting. My vision would go black. I had to hold on to something to not fall. I thought I was iron deficient. But again, no. Jeez.
7. Fatigue. I used to be ALWAYS so so tired. I did sports, (which I think is the one thing that let me maintain my 'functioning' alcoholic status), but when I came home I was immediately glued to the sofa until I moved to the bed. Now when I'm awake, I FEEL awake, which is awesome.
8. Digestion. I feel my stomach is in much better shape. I used to feel nauseous pretty much all the time, but now I feel normal again.

Hm, let's see. Are there more? Maybe in the coming days!

Sending love and hope,

I will never drink with you today. <3<3<3

Edit: I tried to reply to most of the comments, thank you all for sharing your story and the encouragement! it means a lot.. I am aware there are better days to come, and also tougher ones.. my anxiety never let's me be 100% confident nor 100% hopeful, but this time I am determined to \*logically/objectively\* hold on to the sobriety, and not rely on emotions, which often made me slip back into the old habit. Justification and self-pity is a helluva drug in itself. Wish you all a wonderful crystal-clear day!

2020-08-26 18:24:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ih8x2i/my_story_the_medical_emergency_blessing_in/,My Story: The medical emergency blessing in disguise!,"I have been lurking on this sub for a couple years. I finally am able to tell my story. I was drinking half of a 750ml bottle of whisky every weeknight and nearly a whole bottle on the weekends as I would start drinking before 9am since I didn't have to ""work"". I had been drinking since I was 34. Never really did before then. At 34 it was just in the evenings on the weekends. It slowly progressed to daily, but not a large amount. No blackouts, no hangovers. 

During this time, I had a major hiccup in my marriage to my husband of 18 yrs. Not due to drinking though, just a pretty rough patch that we have now worked through but at the time my drinking really did increase to just about the half bottle situation. My husband does drink (and still does) but he was always able to moderate. I was never able to successfully accomplish moderation for myself.

So I had been drinking that half bottle nightly and more on weekends for approx 5 years. It had gotten to the point where my anxiety in the mornings was nearly crippling and I basically became a potato at my desk job all day. Then I was required to work from home during the day as my office closed to the public during this pandemic. I found myself drinking more and more during the day. I never hid this from my husband but I knew he was worried. I also told him I knew I needed help and would look into a treatment program, because I knew I was headed for trouble. He told me he would do whatever I needed him to do and he has kept his word.

I am 44 now. Last month I confided in my best friend who admitted she had been worried about my drinking for a couple years. She looked into a few programs for me but as we are in a rural area, there was not much to choose from and I sat on the info for a bit. I sat and sat on it. I even came down with a nasty sinus infection in March and went to my Doc and didn't tell him about my drinking. I can't even tell you why I didn't tell him and ask for help. I just don't know. He prescribed antibx for my infection, which I never took because I couldn't drink while on them.

On July 23rd I started having some major cramping in my gut. I assumed that it was an ovarian cyst that had ruptured and I waited for the pain to subside. I get cysts several times a year and the pain goes away in a day or two in my experience. I don't go to the Doc every time this happens as there is nothing they can really do for it. So, I waited and waited as the pain increased and even the whisky couldn't relieve the pain, until 4 days went by and I asked my husband to take me to the ER at 2am. I actually thought I had a burst appendix at this point since the pain was about 8-9 on the scale. Docs did a CT and found that I had torn a hole in my colon! I had diverticulitis and didn't know it! I've likely had it for several years and just attributed my stomach pains as ovarian cysts or the stomach bug. But something happened last month that caused a hole which explained the pain and the very high white blood cell count. They couldn't believe I waited so long in that much pain. I was admitted to the hospital and they kept me for 5 days. I told them right away I was a heavy daily drinker and I wanted to quit. Since this is a rural hospital, they do not do inpatient detox as a rule and will ship you out of town, but I knew they would have to help me through withdrawals as I was inpatient for the diverticulitis. 

I had a rough couple of days on 3 and 4 but the nurses helped me through it with atavan and counseling and I have now been alcohol free for 31 days! I had some minor cravings that I pushed though. It was easier than I though since I had been feeling so lousy for so long and after I was discharged from the hospital I felt wonderful and sober (which is a great feeling!). I have lost 30 lbs (a liquid diet helped with that too) and my skin looks wonderful. My hair is not falling out anymore! I can sleep all night. I actually do things in the evenings! I have become very productive at work too. My hands don't shake. I am saving money too! I am wearing makeup again. Dressing a bit dressier! My fingers are not swollen so I can wear my rings again! I feel like my brain is actually working. So many little joys of being sober. I wish I had started sooner. My fear was the withdrawal symptoms. Once I was admitted to the hospital I realized it was now or never. I am so proud of myself for speaking up to the Docs and nurses there. 

There is no way to tell if the alcohol caused the diverticulitis, but I am positive it kept my whole GI tract inflamed for years. I still remember the pain it caused and that is what keeps me from drinking. I never want to feel that pain ever again. I need to have a bowel resection eventually and I must keep the inflammation down so I don't have another flare up before then. I always assumed that I would have an acute liver or pancreas problem, and I felt that it was just around the corner. I never thought it would be diverticulitis. My Doc informed me yesterday at my check up that my liver, pancreas and kidneys are just fine. Phew. I got really lucky. I'm not going to mess this up now! 

If my story helps just one person today, I am elated!

I would end up hiding out at home after a heavy night of drinking, with heavy anxiety about what had happened during a blackout the night before and who I needed to apologize to. It’s not been easy, but I feel markedly better than what I expected. I’m not bloated or physically sick and it feels so much easier to maintain my diet. Started looking through this subreddit and even made an account to follow along. Flirted with the idea of sobriety for years. I will make this time stick. As usual, I blacked out the night before I got sober. I know my mind will start rationalizing taking another drink after some sober time. Its a pattern for me. I will resist that urge. As I’ve related to here, my mind becomes a ‘hamster wheel’ with the first drink (whens the next, is there enough, am i saying that b/c im tipsy, do they notice im drinking faster and more).

Thankfully I made it through because I'm a ""professional"" at hiding hangovers, which is so pathetic.... So enough is enough; I'm ready, and I will not drink (or abuse my medication) today.

Last night was a little harder than usual and Im proud for making it through. I got a call from a buddy of mine who I used to drink with constantly. He was who I escalated with as I got more and more comfortable joking about drinking regularly and a lot. Sometimes we would also do these calls where we’d sit and get hammered and just talk about whatever. Yesterday was my first time being on one such call with him where I didnt drink and suddenly things got a lot more clear. 

At the start of the call I was a little upset that I couldnt drink. Seeing him happy and smiling and generally joking around with me and our other friend on the line made me miss that giddy feeling I got when I was tipsy. And theeeen he suck to tradition and killed maybe three drinks in an hour. I watched over the course of the call as he got more defensive and domineered the conversation. He started acting not like himself. I realized thats how I am too when I drink. What feels like being fun and open rapidly turns into running people over and getting obstinate about things that don’t matter. That fun feeling always rapidly shifted into this out of control aggressive mania and left me feeling anxious and destroyed the next day even when my friends werent bothered by it. 
Im proud of myself for realizing that what I wanted was to feel connected to my people and that drinking may have simulated that feeling but it would only ever cut me off from fostering it for real. On the other hand, I’m sad because I think I’m going to have to pull away from that friend for a little while. Ive tried gently bringing his drinking up but now that I’m sober I feel like it just comes across as preachy (“i have an issue, therefore you must also have an issue”).

After renewing my therapy sessions for the first time in years, the therapist has put it pretty clearly - I have to stop drinking. I am making myself depressed at night and an anxious wreck during the day. I can feel myself slipping back into depression which I haven’t seen for a few years. 

So I finished my therapy session today where I committed to not drinking for 2 weeks and told my SO I need support, and to not be around alcohol. So that will mean either I eat dinner separately from him or he doesn’t drink at dinner. 

He’s been in a sulking mood ever since. Barely talking to me and outright rude. 

I’ve never asked him to do this before. He knows I’ve got a problem but reacting with such a bad attitude isn’t helping me with how fragile I am feeling. 

Any tips on how to ask for more support or in a better way? I am fine to be in a different room while he drinks.",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9978297352790833}"

I am very proud of him and want to help him as much as I can, especially as it relates to finding the right place and right approach to quitting.

Like a firehose coming from my eyeballs.

Even six months later, I obsessively focus on the abandonment from my ex I created out of my fear of abandonment, continued fighting (pushing/pulling away), and eventually, my verbal abuse while blackout drunk to make him hate me.

Subconsciously, I needed out of the relationship. Wasn't healthy for either of us, I guess. I didn't have the communication to fix it.

I miss him a lot, have been completely isolated since day 1 of quarantine, not seeing people for days at a time. I stayed sober April - May, June was a blackout and decided July 4th, I'm done with this BS.

Recently, I moved out of that apartment he lived in with me. I thought I would be free from the pain and the memories of him. Absolutely not. Since now I'm able to actually relax, it's flooding out of me. All the PTSD is releasing out of the floodgates of my eyeballs.

I have spent the last five days crying. Fetal position. On the floor. Sometimes I lay on the balcony to be outside but trying to stay quiet so no one will hear the sobbing. Knowing that no one is coming to care about me -- except ME!

Seeing him on social media out of the lake ""enjoying life"" and not responding to any of my pleas to reconcile kills me. Telling him about how alone I've been. He knew I didn't know many people in this town and he was my whole life. I placed all the blame on my loneliness on him when I'm responsible.

But today, when I saw his photos, I realized something.

The lake isn't ""enjoying life."" It's another form of avoiding, just like drinking, just like not responding—anything to not have to deal with our feelings.

(I'm not saying this 100% of the time, but using him as a mirror into my own life and what we used to do together).

So I asked myself, how do I avoid my feelings? The list was HUUUUUUUUGE!!!!!!!!

I know that because I've done it my entire life. I never wanted to feel. It's why I loved the lake, too—a fantastic escape from my painful reality. I could pretend that my life was great when it was all BS.

That's what I've been running from with booze, partying, sex, bars, festivals, EDM, Instagram, and food. FEELING. BEING ALIVE. 

I've had a relentless amount of coping mechanisms—most of it revolving around alcohol.

I never wanted to feel. I was scared of this. This intense FEELING. But this is life, THIS IS FREEDOM!

And you know what I learned from this? Where my original abandonment came from -- at 18 months old. Now I KNOW why I feel this way, and I don't have to run/hide/shame myself for it and drink away that feeling to hide it.

Also, realized how much I loved him, and I never showed it out of fear. I loved him, yet I focused on a lot of the bad because I treated myself poorly at the time. With alcohol, especially. I would drink to hide my feelings... and then be a raging bitch. When, in fact, I loved and adored him, and he was one of the best things to happen to me. And I pushed him away and created my abandonment.

I wasn't ready to let go of the old me, until now. At times I thought about suicide, but it wasn't a suicide itself; it was the death of the old me.

So much resistance in my own life to move forward. Yet I would point the finger at him for his resistance. I could always see so much potential in him, yet he would hold himself back. THANK YOU JESUS -- THAT IS ME!!!! Thank you for being my mirror!!! What a lightbulb moment today!!

I know I have to let that 'old me' go and accept this new me. But I don't know who the hell this new me is. I don't have any memories of her.

The girl that sees only one way out and the world in black and white has to transition to the new girl who sees life in full color.

From chaos to consistency.

From fear to trust and love.

Letting go of that old me is terrifying. I don't know this new me.

Beliving and trusting a person I've never met before this 'new me.' My brain still wants to use the roadmap from the old me. But I can't let that happen anymore.

Every day is a fight for me to change, and I beat myself up that it hasn't happened yet. But look at how far I've come, just in these past five months!

Yes, I've been alone -- but the clarity on my life has been amazing. If I stayed with him, I would've kept drinking and avoiding, and who knows where I would be.

I know this -- I'm glad I am where I am now, in the fetal position crying, accepting the decades of stuffed pain that's finally coming out.

Everything in life revolves around feelings. And everything in my life used to revolve around NOT feeling them. That can't happen anymore.

I'm ready to *feel* and to heal.

The choices we make every single day revolve around what we want to feel or not feel. I guess I just never realized that or thought of it that way. Was too numb.

Quitting drinking has been one of the most challenging things for me because I was scared of this, the feeling, and the guttural crying.

But I can't hide my soul at the bottom of the bottle anymore.

I'm thankful for these past five days of tears, so I don't spend five more decades running.

It's time to use the new hard drive.

Now I can see how pain doesn't go away, but learning how to face it makes it not follow me for the rest of my life.

TL;DR My fear of abandonment caused me to abandon myself in relationships through drinking. Ding ding ding my lightbulb moment. Face my fear, feel it, and learn a new way of living my life as a 'new me'.

Stephen King has been clean and sober for decades, ever since his family staged an intervention in the late 1980s. Before that King was angry and depressed, smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, drinking beer all the time (a case of beer a night), regularly snorting coke, entertaining suicidal thoughts and having frequent blackouts.

King has said he can't recall most of the 1980's. He feels THE TOMMYKNOCKERS is an ""awful book"". It was the last one he wrote before he cleaned up. MISERY is a book about cocaine, where Annie Wilkes is cocaine. Annie was King's drug problem he has said. She never wanted to leave. While directing MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE, King has admitted that he was coked out of his mind the entire time and often didn't know what he was doing. He wrote the majority of CUJO in a single night on a coke binge and drinking heavily so he doesn't remember writing it. 

King’s wife, Tabitha, organized an intervention formed of family and friends. She dumped a trash bag full of stuff from King's office out on the rug: beer cans, cigarette butts, cocaine in gram bottles, cocaine in plastic baggies, coke spoons caked with snot and blood, Valium, Xanax, bottles of Robitussin cough syrup, NyQuil cold medicine and even bottles of mouthwash which he also drank. Tabby told King he had a choice... he could get help at a rehab or he could get the hell out of the house. She said that she and the kids loved him and they didn't want to witness his suicide. King bargained for 2 weeks to think about it, then he went and got treatment. He has been clean and sober ever since. In 1999 he was in an accident that left him severely injured and prescribed Oxycontin for pain. He didn't break his sobriety at that time as the Oxy was definitely needed for his intense pain, but King has said he was pretty stoned on it when he wrote DREAMCATCHER during his recovery. He feels that's another book that shows drugs at work.

Throughout Stephen King's journey to fame, and during his career, he has battled A LOT to become one of the most successful horror authors of all time. The challenges he has met and habits he has conquered are well described in his biography HAUNTED HEARTS by Lisa Rogak, and in his personal memoir ON WRITING written in his own hand.

I think King's personal story of overcoming alcoholism and addiction is inspirational. There are so many people who do not recover as many of us may know. I have struggled with the same disease throughout my life. I don’t usually admit that often outside of meetings, close friends and family... but I love this group. I believe the disease shouldn't be something to be hidden or ashamed of and that is why King shared his personal fight.",132,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9889805316925049}"

I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy.”","That quote is from the Indian poet Radindranath Tagore, and it is one of my favorite articulations of what sobriety has taught me (and was the inspiration for my username). Looking back on my drinking days now, I was truly asleep, chasing a dream of what I thought represented happiness. In reality, it was unattainable, an ever-escaping mark that I could never catch up to, no matter how long I chased it. 

Then I started getting sober. I started attending meetings, working with a sponsor, and working the 12 steps. In time, my eyes were opened, and I realized that the meaning of life is to be the most useful person that I can be, being of maximum service to my fellow man. Organizing my life around this principle has given me a newfound sense of stability in my life, and a confidence that I am putting my life to good use. There is a meaning to my life today, and it has nothing to do with alcohol.

Finally, doing service has brought me immense joy. I always enjoyed doing community service and giving back, but foolishly turned away from that truly rewarding activity in favor of seeking enjoyment from booze. Sobriety taught me that the fleeting enjoyment alcohol provided was an illusion, disguising the heartache and anguish that it inevitably brought. The true enjoyment I get from being of service to others is joy, pure and consequence free.

I suppose some sort of alcoholic's blog. Once the rest of the house goes to bed, I spend every night drinking alone. I use alcohol as a way to be happy at the end of a chaotic day. I drink while doing things that I enjoy, such as TV/movies or playing video games.

Last night at 1 AM, while drinking, I realized I just wasn't having a good time. It was a dreadful feeling since, at that point in the night, I was about 6 shots in and pretty buzzed. But last night, buzzed did not equal happiness. My answer was that I needed more alcohol, so I doubled down on my next drink. And the drink after. Last night, to find joy, I needed to get trashed. Anything less than that would not be enough.

This is interesting and terrifying to me because, usually, my subconscious is fairly nonchalant about my addiction. It starts with ""Let me grab a drink"" and the night ends with ""I'll just have one more"" or ""I've already loaded up on the rum so I can have a beer as a night cap."" Last night was different. I discovered an emptiness inside of me, and decided that I needed A LOT more alcohol to deaden that feeling. 

I've wanted to quit for a long time. I have been drinking daily for the last 6 years and have tried to ""cut back"" a million times and I know I am not capable of that. I have a handful of ""Day 1s"" but have never lasted more than a week. I am fully aware of what alcohol is doing to me. I wake up hungover every day and have gained 50 pounds over the last 2 years. 

I don't know what makes this ""Day 1"" different than the others but I need to find a way to stop. I am writing this during the first chunk of my drinking time and have a few hours to go before bed. I know I can make it through to the end of the day, but I am nervous for the days ahead.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9911760091781616}"

Since I was a child I’ve struggled with anxiety and sleep. I was afraid to go to sleep, but after a good night’s sleep I felt better. I also enjoyed keeping a dream journal. 

The anxiety continued into adulthood, and somewhere along the lines I found that alcohol (wine) would numb my sleep anxiety and I couldnt go to bed at night without a few good glasses of wine. Not the way to deal with sleep issues. 

When I became pregnant I quit completely, and slept really well in my pregnancy. My baby was born, so now being a new mom in a pandemic on top of my anxiety issues has me thinking back to my wine days. Trying to justify having a glass of wine when its my turn to sleep and my husband cares for baby. I dont want to drink anymore. Im not pregnant anymore though so it feels okay, even though it’s not what I want.

I had some wine last night before my turn to sleep and OMG I’ve felt awful all day. No more! But my thoughts have me craving the numbing part, like “you’ll fall asleep faster if you have wine” but its terrible quality sleep and a total waste. I refuse to live that way anymore especially being a mother. 

Just wanted to vent a little about this. Im praying I get better sleep tonight, I just lay there thinking about everything. Im SO tired and need every bit of sleep I can get-without wine!!!

I’ve been doing some incredible self-growth work, and everything that involves serving me seems to be falling into place. But there was one obstacle - hot girls who’s boobies I wanted to play with. 

Now I’ve never, ever been on a sober date. In fact, the only first date I could even comprehend of was going to a bar and getting lit. I’m quite a familiar face around the bars in my city (drinking and working in the industry) so when I’ve taken a date out on the past, we’re treated like royalty by my friends, as a result I look awesome and the lady is usually quite impressed. 

So imagine my dismay when a beautiful young girl and her friends wandered into my bar one evening. I’d clocked off for the night and was enjoying an expertly prepared non-alcoholic old fashioned. 

“If you don’t get up and go sit with them, you’re gonna be disappointed in yourself” my inner voice told me. 

Fuck it. What have I got to lose? Embers started feeding a fire within me. All the voices belonging to the parts of me that hate myself, feel worthless and insecure we’re cheering me on, something that hasn’t happened before. (This is a direct result from the personal growth work I’ve been doing). 

Normally this is the point of shots. Two quick 30ml injections of courage would help me. Not this time bucko, we’re going in raw. 

I Infiltrated their group like solid snake; cracking jokes, telling stories, involving everyone in the conversation and asking questions. I was rolling baby - this was me. Actually me. 100% bonafide genuine British twat. 

Whatever I did seemed to work and we organised to meet up. What the fuck am I supposed to do now? What other things can we do as a date? 

I soon realised that it really isn’t the time or place we meet - she wants to hang out with me as a person. So I took a new approach, with confidence and leadership I informed her we shall grab a coffee and go for a walk. I ended up having such a wonderful afternoon with a new, interesting person. No drunken regrets or awful hangover the next morning.

I’m able to eat normally.  I’ve fixed all my blood work issues. I’m always happy, rarely ever pissed off which used to be everyday. No more constant pain. No more being sick.

1. I makes me fat, plus I eat shitty food and that makes me fatter.

2. I spend at least $100 per week on it.

3. I have unsafe one-night stands (fortunately no STDs or babies by some miracle).

4. I say stupid shit to people.

5. I become unnecessarily emotional.

6. I tell myself I won’t drink and drive, but I do. I’ll find myself driving home at 3am nervous about the police, kidding myself that the fact I stopped drinking an hour ago and drank a bunch of water makes it okay.

7. Hangovers, dear god. Enough said there.

8. I’m bad at my job. I don’t grade my papers and assignments over the weekend like I should so my work week becomes even more of a hungover nightmare.

10. I don’t run or exercise.

11. I wake up in strange apartments or houses on someone’s couch or in someone’s bed very confused and poorly rested, then slip out in the harsh daylight feeling like a vampire.

12. I ruminate on past relationships and friendships that went sour and prevent myself from growing and moving on.

13. I say and do things that cause said relationships and friendships to go sour.

14. I take weird shits.

15. Sometimes I throw up and sleep in the bathroom.

17. Earlier this year I fell down the stairs, like literally tumbled head over heels like a goddamn cartoon.

18. I have bad sex and take too long to come or sometimes can’t at all.

19. I sweat in my sleep.

20. It says not to on my antidepressants.

- I still have cravings and thoughts about drinking. That’s okay.

- Some days I don’t make great choices. Other days I do. 1,500 is just a stack of days where I made enough good choices day to day so I didn’t drink.

- I am lovable and can love myself.

- I am not a slave to my addictions.

- I can forgive myself and when I can’t, at least I can practice trying.

- I have experienced drastically fewer traumas in recovery because I made different choices and am less vulnerable.

- I can make a positive difference in the lives of others.

- I caused a lot of pain when I was drinking. I cause less pain being in recovery.

- There are many roads to Rome. Everyone’s recovery journey is different and different approaches work for different people.

- I have worked hard but there is a lot of hard work to come.

- It’s much easier to lose progress than make progress. Taking a drink is effortless. Not doing the thing that is most natural to me every day for 1,500 days is a lot of effort. But it is worth it.

- Sometimes there are days in recovery that are worse than days in active addiction. That’s okay. Overall, it’s much better.

- The thing that I wish I could give folks the most who are earlier in their recovery is a look through the lenses that I see everyday. So that they could know that it gets better. That there is choice. That compassion and acceptance are the path.

I want nothing, never really have I suppose. Chemical stimulation and sedation was a consuming obsession. I try to cultivate goals and dreams to work toward but I just don’t want or care about anything, I get no enjoyment from the things that once brought me joy, I feel exhausted always and sleep whenever possible. I’m becoming rather obsessed with this quandary: what is the point of even carrying on?

My life is pretty good, in spite of the messes I’ve created for myself. I am grateful, or rather I know I should be. However there is no primal motivation, no connection, it’s as if my very existence is divorced from feeling. Like my soul has been sucked out of my body. It’s a subtle and unique agony, calmly terrifying, a quiet torture. 

There are brief moments where I suspect I may still be alive and capable of passion, but they are so fleeting and infrequent that there is little hope to be inspired. It’s barely been two weeks, it feels like 6 months have passed. I’m plagued by the phrase “I don’t know who I am anymore” but I guess the truth is I never have. I’m terribly afraid that underneath the years of intoxication and the persona I built around it, there is nothing. That I am nothing.

So here I am, sober and afraid. Putting on a brave face for the people who seem to see so much good in me. Hoping to all great flaming fuck that the light they see inside me isn’t just wishful thinking.

""Karkuz, don't drink, you know it will do you no good""

""Karkuz, DRINK!!! You know it won't mess you up nearly as bad as this wacko is saying, and you will get to bed without having to deal with the anxiety of controlling what you eat and will get the bonus of many happy thoughts""

(The second one is quite good at spilling bullshit, as you might see. If you're new to all of this, you should know a clean night of drinking is like a rich man going to heaven: it's easier for a camel to go through the hole in a needle)

So there I was on the supermarket, staring at the hot sauces lane, after having drifted by the beers lane like a thousand times. Earlier I had thought that it was on me, the Universe was not going to send any angels and that this decision was on me. It made me feel a little alone.

And then, a friend walks by. She calls my name and I turn around. We chat about what's been going on, and I spontaneously open up that she came by on a great moment because I was just having this hard moment where the urge to drink was nearly breaking me. She didn't even let me finish: ""Nope. Don't drink. Don't even think about it."" 

We had a laugh and went out to the cashier, and I walked happily home with my hot sauce and a perfect sober night ahead of me, knowing that sometimes the universe *does* send out an angel.

Now, I know this is not something to rely on. Ultimately, I could always had turned back and bought the drink anyway. On the end, the responsibility **does** fall on me. But knowing that I'm not alone on this even on random moments where the people closest to me can't reach out certainly makes me feel a lot stronger and full of purpose. 

And I want you to know you're not alone either. We are all here rooting for you. We want you to win this battle and we will stand by your side throughout it. This community helped me go a long way in realizing that I needed help, and I will always be grateful in repaying the good it did me.

In may I was laid off due to covid. Last time I was unemployed I hit the bottle hard. This time I replaced liquor with beer, then started buying less beer. A friend of mine was dealing with some work drama and he took it really hard and started drinking after getting to step 4 on AA. He became a mess overnight. He would join discord chat with my friends who've never met him and soon as he logged out comments would be made like ""wow he was drunk wasn't he."" He was impossible to talk to or play games with, he got angry at anything, and would just disappear mid conversation. 

Him and I made a pact 3 weeks ago to both quit. It was going well till he met a girl who wanted to drink. He slipped up but is back on track. 

Watching his behavior really put into perspective how I acted when I was drunk and the conversations that would happen when I logged off games with my friends mid black out. Or how co-workers saw me. I don't want to be that person anymore.

I don't have this euphoria about how much better life is. I'm bored, I feel like I wasted my 20's, I live at home, I'm without a job in the middle of a pandemic. I'm fucking miserable. But I'm not drunk and because of that I'm working on my certs for work and going on walks for some exercise.

The other day I had a real urge to buy alcohol and instead bought a few energy drinks and a candy bar. Felt good.

But for some reason, over the last 10-14 days, I have just been wanting to get drunk. I'm not craving a beer or anything, and I'm generally very happy with my life (great wife, great kid, good job, sustaining fulfilling meaningful creative goals that I work on every day, without fail, fun hobby to de-stress, daily exercise, blah blah BLAH), but lately I've just been wanting something, you know...

EXCITING.

My life is good. But it's not EXCITING. I want to feel a rush, I want to look forward to some abandon, I want to GET OUT OF MY HEAD. And I don't know anything that does that better than alcohol. So lately every single night I have been planning to drink, and every night I basically just wait it out until it's logically way too late to start, and then I go to bed. But the battle is exhausting.

Last night, I was literally looking for any reason to convince myself not to drink. I saw an article on reddit about how otters will take down crocodiles by fighting the beast to exhaustion, then eating it. For undisclosed reasons, otters have symbolic significance to me, and I saw the obvious parallel with my battle not to drink. Also otters are super playful and joyful; qualities that I have felt drained of lately in my nightly white-knuckling.

Anyway, I took that as reason enough, and got ready for bed. I figured I'd check my badge here, and saw that it was at 99 days. Another good reason not to drink! I could at least make it 100 days. And then tomorrow...I could drink if I wanted to.

So today I came here, and saw that my badge was still stuck on 99 days. Weird. Oh, right--I had checked after midnight last night.

Which means, goddammit, that I can't drink *tonight*, either, because then I won't make it to 100 days (which is a meaningless number, but psychologically powerful).

Ugh. So I'm not going to drink with you today, for christ's sake. We'll see about tomorrow.

On this milestone I’d like to reflect back on that person who I used to be before I embarked on possibly the most rewarding journey of my life. Observing him and his habits objectively from the perspective of sober me reinforces my determination to go another 100 days. 

You started off fine, drinking casually and socially. In fact, you didn’t like it that much. Then you discovered craft beers and for roughly 10 years not a day, not a single day, did you forgo a six pack of your favorite obscure beer. You had graduated to an enthusiast, a connoisseur. People now associated you with beer. You proudly incorporated beer into your identity. Bars, sixers, and growlers became inextricable from your Self. 

Then you discovered wine. Oh sweet red wine. Draining bottles while chain smoking on the porch surely represented a fundamental shift in my habit, but you rationalized this troubling development by telling yourself “hey I’m living a life of the mind, slowly but surely crafting a dissertation that will revolutionize the discipline!” Apparently the red wine and endless stream of cigarettes were all integral to achieving the PhD. “I’m fine, I’m better than fine,” you told yourself, “I’m thriving!”

Then the bottles kept accumulating. It took more and more wine to stimulate the mind. You had to hide all of this, so you developed a very respectable ritual of drinking wine in your car parked in store lots. Maybe you’d finish the bottle prior to 4pm when buy one get one happy hour started. Better stumble into the market and grab a couple tall boys to pass the time, you thought. And there you go, racing inside to the bathroom so not to piss yourself. Red faced and bloated with a self-satisfying grin, you purchase (or did you steal this time?) yet more booze. Booze that you will quickly drink in your car to make sure you get your seat at the bar at exactly 4pm. Toss those empty cans next to that empty wine bottle, you’ll diligently dispose of them later. 

3 rounds of 2 beers in and you’re ready to drive back to the market to grab a nightcap. But wait, the gentleman next to you ordered what appears to be a delicious Moscow mule. Might as well try it. Then after retrieving that newly released six pack you stumble home. Polish that baby off while watching some random, mediocre show as you drift off...knowing tomorrow will be exactly the same.

If they knew what she put me through maybe they'd understand, but at the same time, I shouldn't have blown up like that. Now I look like the bad guy. And they all knew I was trying to be sober but relapsed that night. I haven't talked to anyone since then, I feel sick to my stomach all the time. I drank for this entire past week but I realized I was just getting more and more depressed and anxious so I got rid of all my alcohol again. On day 2 now... I know things will get better, logically, but I feel so worthless. My girlfriend and family are supporting me, thank god, but I don't think I deserve their support. None of my friends have reached out to me at all. I feel like I could get years of sobriety under my belt and still never make up for all the harm I've been causing people.",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.999026894569397}"

2020-08-25 13:29:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iggroc/62_days_in/,62 DAYS IN,"hey everyone, been lurking around since the beginning of 2019 I think. Posted a little bit . This will be hectic, but I think I need someone to read this.

Had a run of sobriety for 30 \~ days in early 2019. Then 2 weeks here and there. Mostly nothing too serious. Then started the new year sober on 2020. Stopped before New Years, gave myself I think aroud 32-33 days.

I understood during that time that I really need therapy. I worked out. Meditated. Also I am working horrible hours (which I did to myself). I work in entertainment industry (to be specific - theatre director). I then wobbled, I tried to see why I started to drink again - meaning blind drunk once or twice a week. Pounding 10 beers or whatever comes to mind. So after this 32-33 days in February I started again. Weekend drunk. Left for another country for work (staging a play abroad) also went totally sober but drinking was on my mind quite a lot. Managed to do a lot of work and COVID happend had to leave the country pretty fast. I understood that I used that excuse just to get fucked up and leave the country. They almost didn't let me in the second plane as I was coming back. Went to lockdown in my own town with my father. Started online therapy, lots of issues emerged. Still had so much work coming up - it seemed at moments all too much. I was thinking quite often? Why do I do so much? Is it to be loved and wanted?

Therapy helped, also meditation. Lockdown eased and just as the bars reopened we were the first in. Drank and drank and drank. For my birthday (turned 30 on may 25th) I asked for transcendental meditation courses. Started those. My birthday was massive. All the town's legendary drunks and substance abusers even dealers showed up. After that I worked my ass off for theatre like crazy and saw that this doesn't bring me happiness. I again stopped, again and again for week. Or two weeks. Been now monitoring my drinking and drug use since 2018 with a little app called momentum.

When I drink I get like a lot of beers in front. just keep them coming, not at home. One two three four, ofcourse order something to snort. Get blind drunk. Blackout. So again I stopped on June 17th and it lasted more than ever. Until last thursday. My friend was going sober at that time and we went on holidays together so I kept him company. I didn't drink until last Thursday. It was 62-63 days. The day before I had a big premier and was a little disappointed with the result, or myself, or everyone else. Or who knows what.

I just ordered a beer which turned into 4 and some coke - then all-nighter at a bar. Next morning I just went out without going to a shower and any other thought - took my notebook and sat at a bar orderred not a beer but a margaritta, another friend came we drank, went away to see another friend. More coke. Then in the evening I missed one thing and just went on drinking. Went to a club. Don't remember how I came back home. Woke up on Saturday. OH MY GOD, I was just a corpse. I know I have been working for the last two months and this Saturday/Sunday/Monday I was just in constant FEAR, ANGST, ANXIETY... and everything everything in between. Never lasted this long. More than two months sober and no fear, no anxiety... But oh-my-god I forgot how crippling this was. Really. This mix of alcoholism and other substances. On Saturday and Sunday I was like a corpse. My friends called and called, I missed one work appointment (which I set myself, because I am the leader) it was just OH MY GOD. Where does this fear come from?

It seems that all the progress I made with transcendental meditation in defeating anxiety and being just an energy ball all the time has just vanished completely. How and why? I have no idea.So I made it 62 days. I know I have a problem. I am exchanging this drinking for love. I remember my biggest fear during this sober time was - If I dont go out I will not find any kind of love. That I will have to work and make more projects for the people just to be with me... And any kind words just go away. I disappointed myself so much in this. 62 days.

Guys, how to you rest when you rest? How do you rest, when you have to rest? How do you rest after hardday or a hardweek at work? how to you put that crown on? That crown that alcohol can give for 1 minute. I need to work on myself. Not overwork. I felt I gave away to much and just fell over.

I will not drink with you today. I had my last drink on Saturday morning\~. By the way, this is the longest I haven't had a drink since I can't remember when.",4,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 2}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9986273050308228}"

2020-08-25 12:52:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/igg0jf/100_mondays/,100 Mondays,"TL;DR It's a long one. Former Boozemaker has a bad ticker, quits the sauce, happy for today.

If you had told me on my 30th birthday, that when I turned 32, I would be sober for almost 2 years, I would have bet anything that you were wrong.  That information just didn’t compute in my head.  There was literally no scenario I could imagine of why I wouldn’t continue to drink alcohol.  My job consisted of making spirits for a craft distillery in Ohio.  It was a part of what made me, me.  

All of that changed 700 days ago.  The month leading up to September 23rd, 2018, was hardly any different than the previous 10 years.  I had noticed in the past month, I was getting a little short of breath while moving around, my energy level seemed a bit lacking, and I just felt a little off.  I chalked it up to turning 30, and finally it seemed what all of my older friends were saying came true.  You start to feel it a lot more, the older you get.  This is 30 I thought. 

It turns out; this wasn’t just about getting older and the youthful bounce back eroding away.  I was nearly dead.  I haven’t read a ton of reviews about actively dying, but I can tell you from personal experience, it’s not something that I would recommend to anyone.

 There’s a big long story about what happened, and why I feel so very lucky to be alive, but this is not why I’m writing this post.  The short version is, I had a heart attack; A bad one, 100% blockage of the left anterior descending artery.  It’s better known as the widow maker.  Looking back I probably had that heart attack on September 6th about 3 weeks earlier, and it wasn’t heat exhaustion like I initially credited that extra hard day at work. 

After I had been in the hospital for a few days, I had multiple strokes (3) over a two-day period.  Those were actually worse than the heart attack, and that’s when they first learned of the complete blockage in my heart.  It wasn’t a bacterial infection like they originally thought.  I spent 12 days in intensive care, and my life completely changed in a matter of two weeks.

Due to the time that had passed from the heart attack, to when they discovered it, my heart was in pretty bad shape.  I had an ejection fraction of 10%, (normally 60-70%, heart failure starts at anything under 35%) and my memory and speech wasn’t the best due to the strokes.

I started cardiac rehab therapy, a low sodium diet, a pretty extensive group of prescription drugs, and of course no booze.  I’ll be honest, the first 2 months, I honestly didn’t think about how I wasn’t’ able to drink.  I was more concentrated on trying to improve the function of my heart, gaining my speech back and readjusting to a completely different lifestyle. 

One thing I’ll give myself credit for, is being a very compliant patient.  I’m a booze maker, not a doctor, clearly what I did in the past, didn’t lead me to a great place regarding my health.  Nearly dying has its benefits, it shocked my stroke-damaged brain into being a good listener.  During my initial 3-month follow-up, I asked if I’d be able to start drinking again.  That was the first time I had really thought about consuming alcohol again, and my cardiologist said, not right now, to just continue doing what I was doing.  So I listened.  I continued with my diet, taking all of my pills, and started exercising.  A few months later, my heart had improved, a little bit, (20% EF) but it meant at that time I didn’t’ need to be on the transplant list.  I think those first few months are when you are going to see a lot of the progress that's going to happen with the hearts recovery.  They decided they were going to put in a type of pacemaker, just in case things got out of hand again.

It was around this time that I originally joined [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/).  I had seen some references to it in other subreddits as a place where people mentioned how it helped them cut back or totally abstain from alcohol.  I really liked the idea of not looking so far into the future of never drinking again, but you just needed to worry about today.  That part really resonated with me.  On one of my follow-ups, my Dr. was pretty honest with me.  He said I probably had less than a day left to live when I first came into the hospital.  I probably would have just fallen asleep, and not woken back up again.  After hearing that, it actually was an adjustment falling asleep some nights, because there was a thought in my head, I might not wake up again.   My whole outlook on life changed going forward, I was excited, and more thankful, that I got to wake up in the mornings.  I was happy for today. All I had to do was also not drink, just for the today, and I’ll worry about those thoughts, if and when they come tomorrow.

I kept making more progress, and started to socialize with friends again.  I quickly learned a lot of the people I thought were friends, were actually just drinking buddies.   Before my health events, I was never an every day drinker, but I was having a few sips/tastes of the booze as it was coming off the Still to make sure everything was Ok with it, or a beer after my shift to wind down, but I clearly didn’t have a problem, because in my own head, you only have a problem if you are getting drunk every day.  I’d still really get after it probably 2 or 3 nights a week, but in my mind, it was no different than what we did in college.  Also, I never drank alone, so that was another check in the “I don’t have a drinking problem checklist. I’d also go to different bars, and see the same people, some of which were way worse than I was, and I was just letting off steam and having a good time.  Everyone my age drinks like this, how can that be bad?

When you continually hang out with people in bars, where drinking is the excuse of getting together, it becomes so normalized and part of the culture, I truly thought I was normal.  I would joke with people that maybe sometimes when I drank there were a few concerns, but definitely not a problem, because I didn’t’ drink every day.  Since the age of 18-30, I don’t think I think I took 10 days off exactly 1 time, proving to myself I’m clearly just fine.  When people would do sober October, or dry January, I thought it was silly.  There was always an excuse of why I couldn’t take that much time off in a row: a friend coming in Saturday, a concert on Sunday, football on Monday, trivia on Tuesday, happy hour Wednesday, Karaoke Thursday, and it’s going to be nice out Friday.  There can always be a reason why you shouldn’t give up drinking this week, or you are definitely going to start next Monday.  But Monday always comes, and so do the excuses and the cognitive Olympics, which your brain is a 4 time gold medalist in, starts performing its routine.

All of a sudden, I had to learn how to be Dave again.  Not distiller Dave, or 4-beer guy confidence Dave, or Double Fisting Dave (beer in one hand bourbon in the other), which usually led to brown/black out Dave and than eventually hung-over Dave.   I was great at being those guys, because I had a lot of practice.  I honestly didn’t’ know how to just be me.  That takes some work, and I’m still discovering parts of him to this day.  At the beginning, this was the hardest part.  How in the hell can I possibly socialize with my friends and just be sober.  It takes work.  Like everything else, I think the more you do something, the better you get at it, or at least you feel more comfortable. 

I started to feel actual feelings for the first time in nearly a decade.  It’s not always easy, and I have to retrain my brain to sit with those uncomfortable feelings and actually process them sometimes, because I know it’s for the best.   Dating early on was really, really hard.  I think especially in my age group, and the city I’m in, drinking is a huge part of the dating scene.  I know that I’m lucky in the fact that I’m comfortable being around booze, and don’t feel the need to drink, mostly because my Dr. said it would be bad for my heart, and I’ve had quite a few reps at being Sober while dating.  I thought for sure that I’d only be able to be funny if I had a few beers in me, but that’s just because I was usually around people with a few beers.  It really does get easier as time passes.  Early on, I couldn’t imagine thinking “ohh I’ll definitely be able to be confident, witty, funny, and charming with this person I just met.”  Some nights, that’s definitely true, but other nights I surprise myself with how far I’ve come. 

If you are worried about the hypothetical social pressure that you’ll experience with people knowing you aren’t drinking, I can guarantee it’s so much more overblown in your own head.  Just about everyone you come into contact with, does not care at all that you aren’t drinking.  The people that do, tend to be projecting their own insecurities onto you regarding their own drinking, and probably are wishing they didn’t have to be as drunk as they are to be out in public.

Before September 2018, I’ve had 100s, if not 1000’s of mornings where I woke up thinking, I wish I didn’t drink so much last night.  I feel like a human garbage pile.

I don’t think I’ve ever had a morning where I woke up and thought, you know I really should have drunk more than I did, that would have made last night and this morning so much better.  It just doesn’t happen

I guess if you take anything from this long and rambling nonsense, my life is better now than it was before.  I recently had another Echocardiogram done, and my Ejection Fraction was at 40%.  My speech is back to normal.  I still have some memory issues, and my energy levels can vary quite a bit day to day.  However, I know for a fact, that if I started drinking again, I would not have had the same results.

I used to hate Mondays, especially Monday mornings.  That was usually due to the fact I was utterly exhausted from a weekend of drinking and barely sleeping. It would usually take me to Thursday to really feel Ok again, and then by Friday I was excited to repeat the madness.  I was stuck in a bad loop and it took a giant wake up call to get me out of that cycle.  My hope for some of you still reading this, you don’t have to go through what I did to get the message.  GO TO THE DOCTOR IF YOU ARE NOT FEELING WELL.  I may have been able to save a lot of my hearts muscle if I would have gone into the hospital earlier, and not typed my symptoms into Webmd.   If you are worried about bad news, it’s not going to get better on it’s own.  A lot of the health benefits you get by not drinking, start much sooner than you think.

I think today is the 100th Monday I’ve had totally booze free.  I now run 8-10 miles a week. Pre covid I was doing yoga 2-3 times a week, also swimming.  I make sure I at least do something once a day, even if its just walking.  I’m still a really good patient about taking my meds and sticking to my diet, which has it’s benefits.  I look way hotter than I was before.  I definitely went from a Cleveland 5 to a Columbus 8. I have a much better and fulfilling relationship with my family.  My real friends are still my friends, and I waste so much less time worrying about what other people think of me.  No more Sunday scaries or hangxiety.   I started going to therapy to deal with some of these and past issues, and I’m a big fan of that.

I’m starting to enjoy Dave again, and it’s been nice getting to know and spend a lot of quality time with him (even though he’s still kind of a nerd).   I’m ok for the first time in a very long time, just being able to sit with my thoughts, and not feel like I’m missing something.  If anyone has questions, feel free to message me or leave them here and I’ll try to get to them later today.  I hope this may help someone on the fence about whether or not they need to cut back or want to try not drinking for a bit.  In my personal experience, 30 days is great, 3-6 months you start to think Oh I totally got this, I might as well drink again, and it’s after a year or so, when I really started to see the benefits and my comfort level with sobriety really felt like it was coming into shape.  However, during that time, I just tried to concentrate on today; and I’m happy for all of the todays.

It’s weird, every day is another day good or bad. One of my friends died yesterday. Those closest to me don’t know how to just be there when I cry. I won’t drink about this, not drinking about this has made this bearable, process-able, real. It reminds me of when my Grammy died and I refused to drink for that moment in time. But that was many years ago and I went back to the drink. 

It’s been 414 days and everything has changed but things don’t look the way I thought they would. I’ve built healthy habits like flossing every night and taking my vitamins. I’ve done incredibly well in my classes (for the first time since I started drinking in junior high). I walk most mornings now, journal and meditate often enough before bed. 

But I’m around the same weight I was when I started (wtf) and I am not great at controlling my emotions especially when it comes to my husband. I’m trying to be compassionate and loving to myself but that shit doesn’t come easy. I seriously expected a year later to be a svelte yogi master and look ten years younger. So delusions present during the height of my alcohol abuse still persist. 

But everything is incomparably better sober. I’m a present mom to my kind, brilliant 2 year old. I’m eternally grateful that she will grow up and not see me drunk, as long as I keep doing the work and keep choosing this life. I know I’m doing it for mostly her, because I’ve tried so many times to do it for me and I never could.

When I’d be alone thinking about how frustrated I was, I’d-you guessed it-drink. There’s a big part of me right now that so badly wants to give in.

I’m so humbled. Not only did I black out that night, but spend 5 hours throwing up the day after my wedding. Oh, and I was a mega sassy bitch to my husband. I’m the midst of crying and puking on the bathroom floor, I realized I’m not immune. I wasn’t immune to having a night like that just bc I hadn’t drank in a while. 

It gets better!

I was struggling with my WHY this time. Last time I had an embarrassing story. This time, I have a husband who I wouldn’t have had I not quit drinking last time. I have my health. I have TIME and I’m taking my time back. I’ve given it all to drinking the last month and cannot do that anymore.

Sure, going through celebrations has been an adjustment - birthdays, anniversaries, etc. are a different experience at a nice restaurant without a celebratory cocktail (at first I felt let down or disappointed because the urge to drink was so severe it made the celebration difficult to enjoy).

The quarantine experience has been a real test for that. I guess I'm just shocked at how clear it is that my drive to drink was anxiety and depression-related and less social/celebratory than I thought. By staying sober, I've forced myself to face a lot of demons I spent years numbing away with alcohol. It's been painful, but worth it.

I’m adding this post more for accountability than anything else. I’m 29 and have probably had a problem with alcohol for 10 years at least.

I’ve gotten in trouble with the police because of drinking, lost my driving licence and emotionally hurt the people I love over those 10 years.

Weirdly, I always took them as one off incidents and never made the connection that they were all as a result of my problems with alcohol.

In addition to this, I’ve struggled horrifically with anxiety and perhaps depression over the past three years.

I’ve worked hard to go back through my past to find the root cause of my issues and to learn coping mechanisms for my mental health. Yesterday I realised that booze was probably one of the biggest contributors to my poor mental health over the last three years.

This weekend just gone I had a friend over from home
and we didn’t drink like we would have done when we were 18, but we still drank plenty.

Yesterday I felt terrible mentally, my anxiety was through the roof and it was completely irrational, today it’s slightly improved, but I recognise now that it’s all because of the alcohol I consumed.

I don’t want to forget this realisation on Friday and end up having a six pack or a few pints down the pub. I don’t want to come to this realisation another five or six times, I want it to stick now.

Last night I had one can of beer which was left in the fridge to ‘settle my anxiety’, well that’s the last alcohol I’ll be touching for the foreseeable future.

Drinking for me is stupid, it worsens my mental health and makes me a worse person for my friends and family, so that’s it.

Hopefully this can be a motivation for me in my new month, three months, six months and maybe even a year!",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9955486059188843}"

I'm presently on Day 18 and while I have been sober before (max was 3,5 months since I started drinking about 20 years ago), it feels a little different this time. It's like I feel the benefits, especially physically, much stronger than before.
Maybe it's a certain mindset, maybe it's my age, but it wasn't this 'alright' when I was in rehab, in therapy, medication, groups. Though..
18 days its still early and I don't really want to count the days, but I am currently painfully aware, that two decades of drinking won't turn my body into a greek god and my life into an elysium over a span of a few weeks. I know that.
My sleep got better, but my brain is foggy. I'm motivated to exercise and diet, but I am tired all the time. With all the benefits I am already experiencing I'm hopeful there is a lot more potential.
Also, I am looking like a walking corpse. Like I haven't slept in years. Maybe I didn't really sleep for years. Alcohol induced coma is not sleep. It's kind silly, when you start to feel better and look into the mirror and feel like the damage has been done. That I damaged my body and soul and might never be there person I would have been always, if I didn't get addicted.

I wonder how you experienced the benefits when you realized it isn't just another 'new year's resolution'. That this time it has, pardon the choice of words, substance.

I wanted to wait a few days before I posted so I was sure I would actually go through with it this time.

I've been really struggling with drinking for almost 7 years now, and I finally started to notice the toll it's taken on myself and my family. It started as sneaking whiskey from my parent's liquor cabinet in my late teens, to weekly (sometimes daily) binge drinking in college.

Lately, I've been trying to cut back and put limits on how much I drink in a night. I started out by cutting it down to 6 drinks from just going until I blacked out. But everytime I would try to cut back, I would just keep going no holds barred until I was slammed. 

It wasn't until very recently, that I sat down with my parents and came to terms with my alcoholism. I was afraid to post about it in case I sounded like I was whining, or like it wasn't serious enough for me to quit.

So this is just me confirming with myself, that I'm finally going to stop drinking and get help for it, before it messes me up more.

I'll get right to it. I've been an alcoholic for a good 6 yrs or so. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get off the bottle. Drinking copious amounts, effecting my work, health and relationships. 
FINALLY, after 6 yrs, I recently was sober for about 4 months.
At first it was hard, for like a week, and then I came to absolutely love it!
I felt healthy, was motivated, actually had a memory, felt deeper connections with my friends, partners, etc...

But then... My work has been extremely stressful lately, I've been working a ton of (salaried) overtime, meaning I see no extra income for my hard work, etc...
Work had been so painfully stressful, and I was there so damn much, I guess I just wanted a way to turn my brain off and escape.

All to say, I picked up the bottle and it's been about 2 months now of me drinking about 1/2 a bottle of tequila a night and a bottle+ on weekends (115 lb 30 yr old F). I'm so disappointed in myself. Just like that, I'm back in the throws of this habit that kills and I hate more than anything.

I (to my own shock) genuinely loved being sober and I never wanted to go back. Yet here I am. I'm in therapy, which helps a ton, but Im having SUCH a hard time breaking this cycle and getting back on the sober train.

Any advice AT ALL, on getting back on track, would be so very appreciated.

I got up early to get some work done while he slept in, and when he got up we biked to the farmer's market and got some fresh produce and other things. There was a family there, originally from the Bahamas, selling homemade rum cake. I hadn't had it in a long time, but I always liked it. Some warning bells chimed softly in my head. I wasn't sure how rummy it would taste, but I wanted to support their business as they were the only Black vendors at the market. As we left, the guy made a joke about not driving after eating. Ha ha ha. More warning bells. But it's baked, so the rum cooks off, right? 

My husband and I biked around to a nice spot and eat together, and the first slice we shared wasn't too rummy...just enough to taste like good rum cake. I braced for an altered state, thinking if I felt anything it would send me spiraling, and I kept thinking why? Why did I really want this rum cake? But the day was nice and I didn't feel anything and the rum taste faded quickly. We biked home and stuck the second slice in the fridge all was well.

Later that night, my hub brought it out, and he ate his half first before handing it to me. This one, I could smell. It was soggy wet like it had been dunked in rum. I knew it would be a mistake, but I ate it anyway. My mouth filmed over with that burning feeling. I swear it was just like taking a shot, feeling like my mouth was filling with the hot vapor of liquor. 

I had a lot of feelings about it. I got sullen, tried to eat something else to cover the taste, considering just throwing it up. Mostly I just sat there on the couch and faced my discomfort. I wasn't upset with myself, just surprised it was such a thing. I hadn't been faced with it before, or at least not as intensely: I'd eaten other desserts made with like liquers or whatever, but I also refused a de-alcoholized wine my hub brought home one night. I was just torn. I sat there feeling it and eventually I felt ok. I just know not to do that again. It was a lesson I needed to learn, and I'm proud of still feeling solidly sober: little things will come up, and now I know to stay away from rum cake because it's just too triggering.

It’s been on my list for a while and I got around to it at just the perfect time. Right when my soul needed a band-aid, here’s Ross Gay going “you need the little circle one or the strip, friend?” 

I’m not a big indoor events person anyway, not a big shopper, not big on gatherings of any type at this phase of my life so Covid hasn’t been too hard on me from a down-time perspective. Besides moving and all that entailed, I’ve spent as much free time as possible outdoors either walking my dogs or at the dog park or hiking with them or going jogging in the early morning as the sunrises. Now that I live in an apartment, all week at work I look forward to using the pool on the weekend, which is only open during apartment office hours and limited to small numbers of people, but I usually can get in for a while. Being outside LOTS has made this all bearable. But now where I live is hot and smoky (many forest fires nearby) and it’s hard not to keep finding the word “hellish” coming to mind regarding my local environment, so I’m stuck inside. And we all are around here. And we’re all cranky. 

But this little book has perked me up. And it has me journaling more now. All I’ve really been keeping up, journal-wise, for months now has been my 5-year journal. Now for each entry of Ross’s, I make an entry, however large or small. A lot of it has me pondering alcohol even still. It's awful in the true sense of ""striking awe into me"" how much alcohol was able to change my brain to where even today the first thing that pops in to my mind, often-times, when I hear words like ""delight"" or ""joy"" is alcohol in one of its incarnations or other. So I am heartened that I'm about 30% into this book and the author hasn't mentioned it once yet. An un-hijacked mind at work, I think. Here is a person who doesn't automatically equate happiness with a drink. A person almost as old as me! Very cool. 

So what’s keeping your world together this week, SD? As always, in addition to your current list, if you have recs on sobriety 101 for our lurkers or sober-curious who might be dropping in, we appreciate a mention. One I've been thinking of that is great for a newly sober or sober curious and relates to Ross Gay's book here, is Catherine Gray's lovely little *The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober.*",18,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9813823699951172}"

My first few years of college I barely drank while taking vyvanse. My last year of college was when it started getting really bad. I’ve been drinking excessively every other day since my last year of college. I take vyvanse, go to work, and drink at the end of the day. I’m not talking about 1 or 2 drinks, more like 10+. The day after taking vyvanse/binge drinking I’m too hungover/anxious to even take my vyvanse so I just suffer through work with a severe hangover and take my anxiety meds. And then the next day I do it all over again- vyvanse, binge drink. I’ve talked to my psychiatrist about this and he doesn’t think it’s the vyvanse that’s causing my urge to drink because I’ve been taking it for so long and I never had this issue when I first started taking vyvanse. I went to AA meetings, was prescribed a “recovery” med, etc. Neither of those things worked. 

Here’s the thing, the days I don’t take vyvanse, I literally have zero urge to drink. I’m usually hungover on the days I don’t take vyvanse but I’ve tested this- I’ve gone days without taking vyvanse and I don’t have a single sip of alcohol, I just don’t have that urge/need to. This is why I feel like vyvanse/ADHD medication is the direct cause of my alcoholism. I’ve tried other ADHD meds and I still binge drink every other day. I just want to know if anyone else has dealt with this toxic cycle. I need to take vyvanse because it acts as an antidepressant for me. I’ve tried a few different antidepressants but had to stop taking them because they weren’t helping me.

Just over a week ago I turned 30. I bid a long and sad goodbye to a relationship, a city and alcohol in the week leading up to it. Here's how it broke down for me.

Brown out Monday to Thursday, blackout Friday and Saturday, the day my mom squeezed my fat head into the world (thanks ma, still owe you one for that). Lots of tears and reckoning and meditation and my first ever therapy session. Great guy, he might move in with me. ANYWAY Sunday, day one, a year to the day since I got engaged and now I'm alone, hungover and scared of life without booze. I wondered if each day without her, without my friends, without alcohol would be so hard.

For the next week, and friends, believe me when I tell you this... Every. Single. Day. Has been better than the one before it. I was even left alone in Friday with a box of wine, looked it right in its stupid face, and said fuck no. The feeling of having my mind back, my emotions under control, my memory of what I'd done on any given night is so much better than drinking.

If you're reading this and thinking about leaving it behind, just go for it. Fill up your time with all of the things you've been meaning to get to. Write that letter, Susan, pay that bill, Bill, call that friend, Kaitlyn, go to that place, Mohammed, and for FUCK sake Gary, build that cabinet! REVERSE THE CURSE!

It's hard, and I know there will be challenges ahead for me when I'm still this early in the game, but I am shocked at how much smaller all my problems seem.

I’m not going to lie... I’ve been struggling lately. Passing another year of not drinking felt rather bland this time around, and I found myself recently having feelings of complacency. It was almost as if the novelty of not drinking and feeling that achievement had worn off.

I needed some reminders of why I’m still keeping at it. I decided to read through some threads in this community, as well, I reached out to a couple friends that have been in recovery for significantly longer than myself; and it was exactly what I needed.

It’s times like these where I’m reminded just how easily the rug can be pulled from under me. I’m reminded of how much of a nightmare my life was and can still be, if I give up. I’m reminded of the importance of being reminded, that this is a lifelong fight, and reaching out is crucial to my continued success.

Those were always the moments I felt the lowest most powerless, telling myself I wouldn’t do it again, knowing full well that was a lie. Completely ignoring that promise to myself or the nightly hour of torture I was sure to endure when it came time to buy booze the next day. 

There are so many wonderful things about being sober that keep me on track, but goddamn - just the thought of living through that again is enough.

I always wanted to give my dogs more exercise and attention but never had enough energy to give them. Now we go on two-a-day walks. 

I always berated myself for not brushing my teeth at night. Now I brush my teeth, wash my face, and read before bed instead of passing out naked and numb. 

I no longer worry about getting a DUI. Nor do I wake up pissed at myself for driving drunk, hating the thought that I could have hurt someone. 

My shifts don't feel as long and I have the energy to pick up extras.

I feel better connected to people when we're together because my mind isn't half-asleep.

What I'm seeking advice on is when is a good time to reach out to those I feel like I owe an apology. I understand in the AA program they recommend this after a certain period of time but I feel like I need to do it now.

What have your experiences been when doing this? How'd you go about it? More times than not has it been welcomed by the person you hurt?  Does the apology carry more weight if you can tell them you've been sober for an extended period of time rather than just a couple of weeks?

Right now these first couple of weeks have been great. I feel strong and confident in my ability to make this change. The only burden I'm experiencing right now is the guilt and sadness I feel.

I've had some pretty solid breaks here and there, but lately this pandemic has had been killing boredom with a bottle. 

Back in May, I ended up acute pancreatitis, which landed me in the ER. They told me I must stop drinking or my pancreas could go necrotic. 

So I did, wasn't that hard because of the health scare. I started feeling really good, got a little cocky, felt like I was out of the woods. So this past weekend, I said fk it and ""accidentally"" put down two bottles of whiskey with friends. 

Later that night, I experienced the most excruciating abdominal and kidney pain imaginable. It felt like a demon baby was in my belly with a chainsaw.  Back in the ER, frowns of disapproval and judgment. 

I came home 3 days ago deflated and disappointed in myself.  Did a quick 3 day taper (with the help of CBD/THC). 

The point is at this point, each drink is russian roulette. If you've ever experienced pancreatitis, it unreal how much that hurts. I lost a week of my life. 

I can't keep killing myself with drink. It was fun while it lasted, but at this rate I won't see 40.

I broke up with my girlfriend, lost my job and my dog died in that order, all within the first week of quarantine.  My immediate response was to spend $800 at the liquor store because I was terrified that the liquor stores would close. I spent every waking moment trashed. As soon as I woke up I'd start drinking until I passed out, rinse and repeat. I've managed to white knuckle a few days sober here and there since then, but nothing serious

The last time I drank a good friend of mine was visiting from out of town and our friend group went to a local taco place, I ordered a margarita pitcher for myself. No glass, just a large straw please. My visiting friend and my roommate kinda jokingly got on the topic of me drinking too much, until my roommate said dead serious "" he has a serious problem and I'm worried about him"" . I was wasted at that point so I just kind of took it in stride and left early so I could hit the liquor store before it closed. Got shit housed by myself, woke up on my bedroom floor feeling like absolute death. Started crying, thinking about all the embarrassing shit I did ( I have a habit of getting into political arguments with people on Facebook when I'm wasted), thinking about how much I hated my life, how I've wasted my youth and how helpless I felt. Just wallowing in a deep deep state of depression where I truly wondered if I wanted to even try to keep going. I decided that I needed to make a serious effort if I was ever going to get better

I haven't drank since then, and frankly I haven't wanted to. Ive kinda played with the idea in my head but Everytime I do my brain just says ""WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW THATS GONNA END"". It just genuinely doesn't sound appealing. I feel great, I'm still a lazy slob but I'm beginning to do small exercises and getting more active.

I was disappointed in myself, but made no effort to stop. I had already started. This is the way it always was. The on switch gets flipped and the lights don't go out until I pass out or puke--and maybe not even then.

In the dream, I thought, you don't want to have to deal with the guilt of this tomorrow. You don't want to wake up to the water-gulping and the head aching behind the eyes, the sleeping till noon that won't negate the effects of the previous night's bottles of wine or vodka shots I'd done so fast so I couldn't keep count. You don't want to suffer the multi-day hangover and the sleep deprivation. You don't want to waste the entire day in bed or on the couch, wanting to die and feeling guilty for the fragments of what you remember doing and the fear of what you don't, frittering time away waiting for the day to end so you can start drinking again.

Instead today, I got to wake up, stoked that my dream was just a dream. It has been four months today since I stopped drinking. I got up at 6am and went for a 10mi bike ride--less than I normally do, which is 15. I registered for a cycling challenge in October. I took my antidepressants and my anti-anxiety medication and I played my favorite video game. I went on a walk with my dog. I decided to write this post. I GET to do these things again--I get to enjoy them in a way I'd forgotten you can enjoy things and not just have life feel like constant torture. Everything is so much more manageable when you're not trying to swim with your hands and feet tied together.

They are incredibly informative and enlightening books that have revolutionized the way I look at alcohol in our culture and in my own life.

So I’ve used this subreddit in the past and I found it a really good platform for finding more experienced sober people who have gone through similar experiences with what I’m currently experiencing.

I had a relapse about 3 weeks ago. It happened after I put a lot of work into myself including rehab and several months living at a sober community.

I finally landed another “real” job and things were going great for a month or two until I had a slip. Since I had put so much work into myself I got really upset with myself and just flat out shut down... went out of control fast. I lied and said I needed a covid test the first day, tried to make up something else the second and then the third day I just stopped showing up entirely. I continued to drink for like two weeks until I finally pulled myself together and was able to stop... it has now been yet an additional week of sobriety and I have not contacted them.

Part of me feels like I should get in touch with them. It’s a good company, I know the owner himself is also in recovery. Part of me also thinks this might cause even more problems, I don’t really know. My sponsor says to give them a call and don’t delay any longer but I also fear phone calls and am not sure if I’m ready for that. I was wondering if an email would be worth sending if I can’t build the nerve to call him.



Has anyone else gone through a similar situation? How did you handle this and what was the result?

I, like many others here, feel deep shame, guilt, and self-hatred for lying and concealing my alcohol use. Alcoholism runs in my family; as far as I know, both my father and my mom's dad were alcoholics. My dad died in his early 50s in large part due to his heavy drinking and hitting his head multiple times. I know that alcohol and my family don't mix, and YET in my late 20s I started to drink hard alcohol on a semi-regular basis. My drinking wasn't causing significant negative consequences until my mid to late 30s, when I started to notice experiencing cravings, enjoying drinking much less, more serious hangovers, drinking more than I intended to, preoccupation with drinking, and starting to hide my drinking from others. By my late 30s I started doing things I never thought I'd do, like drink alcohol before 10am, drink while working, drink my first drinks very quickly, hide bottles around the house, driving when I shouldn't, and drinking daily.  On many occasions (heck, almost daily) I wanted to quit, dumping alcohol down the drain a few times with the intention to quit. But then my addict mind would convince me that I would be fine, could drink ""normally"", control myself. I did quit for 3 months in 2017 and felt great (including running a half marathon), but then I allowed alcohol slowly come back into my life and that's why I am now here. I fear I have some neuropathy, plus chronic diarrhea, weight gain, lethargy, irritability, but all of this was not enough for me to quit until now. I know drinking for alcoholics isn't rational; it's an attempt to change how we feel, and it never works in the long run because one is too many and 1,000 is never enough. I do plan to restart therapy and work a program, and I do believe I will feel much better about myself. I know my life will only get worse if continue to go down this path, so I need to summon the courage to ask for help and let others know I have a problem.

It was like being drunk without actually being drunk. But I'm not sure how I feel about that. It was a little too close to the real thing. 

One good lesson came out of it though: I kept wanting more of them, so it's clear that the alcoholic part of my brain was triggered, at least psychologically.

This time I made it over the 1 year mark on the first of this month. My first time lasted over 4 years. After my our wedding I found myself with an abundance of alchohol in the house, having that kind of access began the problem that grew until one weekend my wife went out of town for the weekend. I couldn't wait for her to leave, I love her dearly, but with her out of the house I could drink whatever I wanted and just be free from any form of judgment. I bought a handle of something, I don't even remember what, and a few stuffed crust pizzas and prepared for drunken video games with friends online. The next morning I knew I over did it and I started reflecting on what my priorities were. When night rolled around I had made my choice; this was the last day of drinking. I spoke with my best friend about it that night so that it was out in the open, with the hope it would be embarrassing to go back on so quickly. It worked, for 4 years it worked. 

6 years ago my first son was born. I was still sober at the time, but the stress of a newborn and the lack of sleep started to wear on me and I thought I could handle the occasional beer to take the edge off. I was honestly fairly responsible for a good long while, really only drinking in social settings and with friends and family. Next thing I know we are expecting twins,  slowly the drinking increased, moving from beers to my Achilles heel; brandy. Twins are born and the drinking continues, all the while I feel like I have it completely under control. 

My brother and his girlfriend visit from out if state, he was huge drinker and I was excited to just knock back drinks and play some Kingdom Death (a boardgame) with him. First night he out paces me by a large degree and after we all go to sleep he got in a fight with his girlfriend and pushed her down, that was the beginning of the end of their relationship and it ruined the entire trip for everyone. A few weeks after their trip she gives him an ultimatum, he either stops drinking and seeks counseling or she walks. He threw their multi year relationship out the window because of his addiction. She was incredible and made him a much better person (well, when he was sober), my family was sad to have her out our lives.

These events didn't put an end to my drinking, actually the opposite happened. I spoke with my mom about my grandfather (her father) who never drank, even during holidays, apparently he was an alcoholic and was sober for decades. Kinda wished I had kniw this earlier. In the same conversation I find out another family member just recently got a DUI. It was time to quit again.

This second attempt at sobriety lasted less than a year and ended in much the same way the first time did. A key difference in this second try verses the first was it ramped up much much faster. I drank over the course of around a year before deciding on August 1st 2019 I was to be sober once again, and for good this time. I will draw on the strength of my grandfather, the lessons leaned from my family to see me past that 1 year mark.

To anyone struggling, find your own way, your own inspiration. It could be closer than you think; if I had only be fully aware of my grandfather's battle with addiction sooner, maybe I could have saved myself from the same mistake. The choice to give up alcohol was an easy one for me to make, it's staying away that's the real test.

I’m kind of writing because I’m concerned about my current situation, as I increasingly see my sobriety as unsustainable given the impetus not to drink. I stopped drinking because it was out of control and my fiancé never tired of telling me so. Yet after I quit she never once inquired into how I was doing, how many days, etc. I’m a bit confused because if my drinking was such a problem that caused great distress then not drinking should have a proportionate response, I think. And it’s been the same with cigarettes. I’m now 15 days off the smokes (and suffering mightily) but...nothing, no support, no encouragement. So my abstinence is largely attributable to my contempt for her indifference. I don’t see this as a sustainable way of maintaining my sobriety.

This Saturday I met a friend for some drinks in the park (socially distanced). Good fun, and then we decide to go to karaoke for the first time since the pandemic started. We figured it would be okay with just the two of us. Temperature checks at door, etc. Also good fun, but by the end I was pretty drunk...

Instead of going home (like my friend), I threw caution to the wind and went to my fave neighborhood bar, which I also haven’t been to since entering the Coronaverse, because the place is small, poorly ventilated and crowded.  Ended up totally mangled. I hardly even remember my long awaited return to a fave spot. 

I probably got super sloppy with acquaintances I haven’t seen in the bar for months. 
I probably left without paying (don’t remember)
I think I went to the wrong apartment and tried to unlock it and pissed off a neighbor (but don’t remember). 
I told my wife to to fuck off when she said something to me (don’t remember but she told me). 
Overslept and missed first two hours of a DnD game. 
After struggling through the game, I spent the day in heap, feeling totally numb. Not so much hungover than as if every endorphin had been drained from my body. Really sucked. 

I’ve pissed off neighbors before in a similar way, so there are possible repercussions with the landlord (at least an embarrassing phone call).  I totally put myself at risk for COVID-19, and I don’t remember hardly any of it. 

So now it’s been 2 days without drinking and thinking about what I want to do. 

Does anyone here follow a cutting back strategy or is it mostly sobriety-based?

Part of me thinks I should try not to drink my usually 3-5 beers per night (i.e. not drinking alone) and limit myself to a few drinks on social occasions while making an effort to more strictly limit myself. 

But part of me thinks that is probably a very slippery slope.  

My main goal is not to drink to the point of being out of control, which obviously not drinking at all accomplishes. That said, the thought of 100% sober karaoke isn’t too appealing....has anyone managed to successfully thread the needle?

This is the first time I have ever put my thoughts on the page regarding my alcoholism, but it is not the first time I have acknowledged that I have a problem when it comes to alcohol. Honestly, I'm just at the point where I am tired of constantly lying to myself and creating an illusion that I can control my drinking impulses. If I could control them, then I wouldn't be here.

Yesterday I spent the afternoon hiding my drinking from my girlfriend of 7 years, a habit that has sadly become more and more common than I'd like to admit. My girlfriend and I had a talk about my drinking earlier this year after I spent a Sunday night chugging down a 6 pack of 9% brews for no reason other than chasing a buzz and passed out early, but I wasn't ready to make a meaningful commitment to change back then, but I did try to cut back but that often didn't last very long. I often feel guilty because my girlfriend doesn't really drink much/at all any more. She never had a drinking problem like I do, but she got to the point where a hangover just isn't worth it in her mind and has been slowly encouraging me to drink less and I owe it to her to really put in a better effort at cutting back and taking alcohol out of my life going forward. 

I know how this story ends if I continue down this path, my father (72) has been an alcoholic for my entire 33 years of existence, my mother on the other hand will have a small glass of baileys Christmas morning and if I don't make a change soon I'm scared that I'll find myself just like him one day, and down the road when my girlfriend and I get married and have kids, I don't want them to grow up with a parent like that.

So, today I begin again from scratch with a new approach. I am going to take this one day at a time, and try to actively be aware of my impulses. I am going to talk out loud about my problem and not just keep to myself and repeat the same story in my head over and over that has brought me to this point, and go into this understanding that becoming a better version of myself is a process and the beginning is always the hardest, but as I have seen numerous times in this group, change is possible and none of us have to go through this journey alone. My girlfriend deserves a better me, my friends and family deserve a better me, and I deserve a better me.

-when you are watching your friends sip their drinks, and still find yourself trying to work out how most of them only nursed ONE drink through the course of two hours, knowing that you would have been on your fourth by the end of dinner, PLUS shots, AND pregaming before

-when everyone starts talking about dessert, and your mind flashes back to 6 months prior, when you considered your dessert to be a pack of oreos paired with gulps from the wine bottle hidden in the back of your closet at 10 PM every night

-when your friends get up to go to the bathroom, leaving you alone at the bar, and your hand hovers over your credit card, wondering if it would be so bad for you to order just ONE whiskey sour before they come back

-when you're driving down Broadway and everyone is screaming ABBA at the top of their lungs, and you slowly start to sing along, finding the natural rush of dopamine in your veins that you didn't think it was possible to feel unless you were at least 2 drinks in

-when you get home, and you find your husband waiting up, and you ignore the sadness and regret that pulls at your stomach when you realize hes subconsciously sniffing your breath and watching your eyes for any sign that you may have slipped-you’ve done it countless times before

-when you’re able to put your baby to bed that night, completely aware of his tiny hands, his little noises, and the contentment and security he must feel to have his mom soothing him to sleep instead of blacked out in the other room 

-when you’re able to wake up for work the next morning on time-with a clear head, clear eyes, and enough energy to get you and your husband ready for the day

-when you go to the kitchen to clean up and see the open bottle of champagne in the sink. You remember a time when you would finish it off, with maybe a beer or two, so you could have a nice buzz for work. You pour it down the drain.

I am an alcoholic. I'm not a ditzy girl who doesn't know her limits, I'm not a ""wine mom"", I'm not someone who just needs to ""take a break"". I am an alcoholic. The booze will always be there, watching and waiting for me to let my guard down, to answer it's deathly call and rationalize it with the excuse of ""moderation"". But I am in recovery. I know my body, I know my mind, and above all else, I know my heart. I have a strength and resolve to say NO-even when I'm by myself. I've made mistakes, I've hurt people I love, I've hurt myself. I've wasted money, resources, and time on a poison that will never give me back what I have given it. But I can make amends, for every time I've said yes to it, I am making up for lost time by now saying NO. I have found power in the rejection of my greatest temptation-and the joy in that is better than any buzz. I don't know if anyone needed this today, but I am here, I hear you, I'm with you, I'm holding up your arms, and I will NOT drink with you today!

I am on day 12 after years and years off heavy drinking daily.  I would start at 12 noon on the weekends and drink till I ran out of booze or passed out. I have a wife and two kids.  This weekend, I did not drink.....   my weekend was the exact same as if I was drinking. Haf friends over went to a birthday party.

The only difference is I workeda out both mornings, didn’t argue with my wife,didn’t snap at the kids, probably saved $50 without buying beer and booze, saved about 5000 calories, ate healthier and no fucking hangover that made every little chore feel like a major pain in the ass.   First Monday I feel good, although still rough detoxing foggy head ect....

This is just some of the benefits from not drinking I’m sure there are many more if I look into.  Looking towards a productive week and another FUN (not hung over drunk miserable) weekend

It gets all the day time sun, but I never opened the curtains. I never even really spent time in there in the day, I've been taking my breaks in my my office. The living room wasn't where I lived, it was were I \*drank\*.

Somehow without my noticing, it had become a nest of empty beer cans, wine bottles, discarded craft supplies, and more pizza boxes than I'd care to own up to. Somewhere a month or two ago I shut the door and stopped going in there entirely.

I booked this week off work months ago for a bit of a rest, and decided there was no time like Monday morning (the first one without at least a mild hangover in probably 2-3 years) to get it sorted. My recycling bin is pretty much full now, and I got rid of two trash bags of detritus from the floor as well. I'm ashamed of how bad I let it get, why is why I never opened the curtains to let the day light in. The thought of people walking past and seeing it filled me with dread. Maybe it was walking up to my front door on a sunny morning and seeing those closed curtains and filthy windowsill, but I realised I needed to do something. It took 3 hours to get it to a presentable state, but I've finally opened my living room curtains, and I'm sat typing this with the sun on my face! :)

I've tried quitting before and it didn't stick (max 2 days without alcohol). I've asked myself 'why did it stick this time?' (at least for the moment). The best way for me to articulate (heh) my answer would be by using an analogy. Alcohol is akin to domestic violence.

Found the right medication for my mental illness in January. Got laid off in March, which gave me time to finish reading This Naked Mind. Joined this group around the same time. Haven't had a craving since. Found a great, sober guy on OKC in May and we've been together ever since. The past few months have been a breeze.

My biggest hurdle with stopping drinking was the idea that alcohol is more powerful than I am, and that I can’t let myself have a sip, because I would be too weak to stop myself. I did want to wait for enough time that I knew I could survive the typical frustrations of daily life without turning to drinking, but also a short enough interval that I wouldn’t feel terribly guilty about resetting the clock. There was also the idea that drinking was something I enjoyed, and that while not drinking was good for my life in some ways, it came at the expense of whatever enjoyment I would have gotten by continuing to drink. After 50 days with no alcohol, I considered it for an afternoon, and then decided to try it and see what happened.

What happened was this: I can’t remember why I ever liked drinking in the first place. The very first thing I noticed was that my initial sip of wine was...unpleasant. If you’d asked me on day 49 what the first drink of the evening tasted like over the four years I was putting a bottle away a night? I would have said I remembered it being delicious and refreshing.

Make no mistake, this was the same wine I used to buy in cases, lying to the cashier at the liquor store that it was for clients at work, or to the other cashier at the other liquor store that it was for a party. I know these bottles well, I was the one hoarding the empty ones before making a break for the recycling bin late Tuesday night so no one else at my apartment complex would see them before the recycling was picked up Wednesday morning. If I didn’t know my drink of choice so well I would have assumed I made a mistake and picked the wrong bottle out of the pantry.

It was neither delicious nor refreshing, and a headache started to set up camp in a far corner of my brain while I desperately began making toast to get the taste out of my mouth. Condensation on the side of my glass reminded me that this wine was at least chilled. Two months ago I would have sworn to you that it was yummy even at room temperature, and that was why I didn’t bother keeping it refrigerated before pouring myself a glass as soon as I could rationalize it. Last night, I was angrily doing the math to calculate how much extra time on my Peloton this metallic- and sour-tasting headache would end up costing me, not to mention the slices of buttered toast (what, you expected me not to butter the toast?) I had to get the unfamiliar taste that I thought I knew out of my mouth.

I’m sure I’ll have cravings at some point, and I don’t feel as bad about resetting my sobriety clock as I expected. For me, it was worth it to know for sure that I am not sacrificing anything by not drinking; this is a decision without a downside.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

On Saturday I had decided to get back up again after falling down. I drank enough water. I ate better.

On Sunday, yesterday, I saw a GP and ended up at the hospital with suspected alcohol induced pancreatitis. I'd woken up with a lot of pain in the middle of my lower abdomen that slowly moved upwards and around to my back. I'd been curled in the fetal position for five hours before I called someone to drive me. Attempting to drink water had made the pain a lot worse. Going to the bathroom hadn't helped. I was waiting around there for a long time before a doctor came to see me, by which time I'd been stabbed and poked and prodded and covid tested yet again (which was honestly the worst part, I'd take being stabbed with needles 500 times over having that swab shoved up my nose and twisted for six seconds!). She poked around my stomach again and told me the 'inflammation levels in my blood were a little bit high, but not as bad as they could be'.

I have to have more tests this morning to see if anything has changed, as my blood work wasn't entirely finished being tested last night and I didn't get any definite diagnosis/verdict beyond ""not pregnant"" and ""not diabetic"" and ""does not have covid or MRSA"", which is something I knew, but is great to hear. I'm not in anywhere near as much pain as I was yesterday, but I'm still uncomfortable.

I'm 27. I've done this to myself and I knew I wouldn't get away with no real damage forever. I knew this day was coming, and I won't be surprised if I get incredibly bad news today, but I am blindly hoping it leans towards ""you've caused a lot of damage but it isn't an entire death sentence if you stay sober from now on, you utter fuck"" instead of something far worse.

I hope you don’t mind but I thought I would reach out as I will need some help over the next few weeks and months.

I’m in my early 30s and have been a heavy drinker since my late teens (probably considered a binge drinker from my early teens really). I didn’t drink every day most weeks, usually Thursday to Sunday, but earlier in the week if a work lunch, dinner or networking event called for it.

I won’t bore you with the full detail but in June 2019 I decided to give up drinking. I did around 120 days before convincing myself that in reality I wasn’t going to/didn’t need to give up forever, it was an important part of my job, etc etc. And so I began drinking again around late October 2019.

I have again (a week ago today) decided to give up drinking, but this time I have decided that it is for ever.

I am fine with the acute issues, I don’t get many cravings, in fact I have had far fewer than I did last year, but it is the more behavioural/social bits that really get me. What about parties, work events, etc. That’s what made me convince myself that drinking actually is a good idea last October.

I listened to Craig Beck’s book, Alcohol Lied to Me, last year and I have again this year (and will continue to do so). I believe it. My concern is that 3/4/5 months in I forget like I did last year and think everything is fine and go back to how things were.

I wanted to introduce myself as I plan to lean on the support of this group over the next weeks, months and years to keep me focussed and remind me that my life is better without this poison.

Thanks for reading.

to clarify, i am 14. 

my life hasn’t exactly been easy, drinking has been a part of me since i was 3 years old. i kid you not. it’s a godawful, heart wrenching story i don’t even want to think about right now.

i always found myself sneaking alcohol at family gatherings/parties while i was growing up. i never got too drunk, but i always took what i could.

then for 3 years i slipped out of the habit. i forgot why it was so deeply rooted in me.

until the vacation, when i was about 11 years old. i went to a restaurant with my family. nearly everyone in there had some kind of alcohol, so the smells were already bringing back powerful, melancholic nostalgia. 

my mom sat her drink down. (she has never been and still isn’t aware of my problems) i asked for a sip. “sure, what the hell?” she replied. that sip pulled me by the head back into deep, deep memories long forgotten. ones rooted so deep, that after a while i was unable to find them.

the sip turned into the whole drink downed (over time). she noticed but guessed my father did it as i placed it next to him when he wasn’t looking. 

when we got home, i started drinking again. i splurged for a little while, but stopped as the hangovers hurt so badly. 

i still sipped, stoke drinks. did everything in my power to chase that childhood feeling. 

1 year and a half later, worst time of my life. i began smoking weed on top of drinking excessively. i was twelve back then. (and belonged to a gang)

there were a couple suicide attempts, but i made it through. somehow.

when i got caught attempting, i was locked in my goddamn room with nothing to entertain myself with, and no contact with the outside world. i didn’t even go to school for a while.

that fiasco lasted for two whole months before my parents decided i was “stable enough” to ignore me again. 

i couldn’t do this. i hated my life. everything was going to shit.

but then i met my friends. my best friends in the whole fucking world. i love them all so much i would die for them all no doubt.

when i was 13, i told my best bud about my drinking problem. slowly, we got the others on board and they helped me stay sober for a whole 3 months! (still did weed occasionally) i was the happiest ever. i cut off the fuckers that thought i was only fun drunk. i left the gang. i thought this happiness would last.

i, a changed man, relapsed. so. fucking. hard.

i was suspended at school for a trivial altercation. i was kicked out of some clubs i joined. i had to do yard work in the 105 degree weather, 3-4 hours per day for it. i started to get drunk once again. 


i was drunk every day for a solid 2 weeks. it felt like being drunk was just a quick pause between the intense hangovers. i blacked out some. i fucking lost it. 

my friends couldn’t support me at that time because my things were taken away. 

i had nothing, or so it seemed. 

one fine day, my cousins came over. we took a wonderful nature hike which made me truly appreciate the planet we live on, and how lucky i am to be here. that began day 1 of no drinking.

i got back in contact with my friends. they understood. they did not abandon me like i expected. i still was doing weed here and there for my depression, but overall i was clean.

i remember that 1 month mark. i was out taking pictures of my woods when i remembered the date and did a fist pump in celebration. 

a month turned into 2. and 3. then 6, and now, 10. whole. fucking. months. i have never been happier. i got a boyfriend and i’m surrounded by the best people i could ever ask for. 

i wake up each day to realize that i’m no longer a drug addict on the verge of suicide. (my one friend found out about my weed and she intervened. i am 6 months clean in that area.) 

i have hobbies, interests, and a heart full of love. i let each of my friends know how much i love them each day. i day where i don’t affirm my love for them is a day wasted in my book.

my appearance has changed. my mood has changed. everything is just... wonderful!!! 

i am sorry for this, long, drawn-out tale of woe, but i just wanted to talk about this so badly. my parents are too fucking oblivious to know about any of this and it’s too late to tell them now.

During high school I ironically drank nothing, no parties (wasn’t interested) and no fake id’s. As soon as I got to college everything changed, my friends (who I love dearly) introduced me to alcohol. Smuggling alcohol into our dorms and sneaking shots and mixed drinks with only god knows what, it seemed like an amazing rush at the time and I craved that feeling. I started looking forward to the weekends and started neglecting my classes. 

Fast forward to now, I’m engaged, out of college (never completed my degree because I frankly
Got offered a great job in Austin without needing my degree and it seemed like a good idea the time) and I’m drinking almost every single night. I’m spending the last of my paychecks on beer, because that’s just what I did. I was trying to budget in my “alcohol funds” so that I could make sure I had enough to drink for 2 weeks until I got paid. I’m budgeting alcohol money when I can’t even budget for my wedding, my house, or anything important in my life.  

On 08/10/20 I decided to get sober. Things have been going really well, I haven’t had anything to drink. I have had urges, oh dear lord have I had urges, but I’ve stayed true to myself and my fiancée. My fiancée encouraged me to get sober because it was getting to the point where it started to affect my relationship with my future wife. I want to spend the rest of my life with this woman and raise kids with her but I was putting alcohol above all else and that’s not fair to her or anyone else in my life.

I don’t know if I’m an alcoholic but I know that the path I was headed down was not healthy and that it needed to change. I don’t know how long this will last, it might be a month, it might be a year, it might be for the rest of my life. All I know is that right now I’m the happiest I’ve been in a very long time. I have more energy, I sleep a million times better, and it has been the best thing I’ve ever done.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

The AoK I'm sharing this week was a news item I saw about [a couple in Ohio who donated the food from their canceled wedding reception to a women's shelter - and showed up after their wedding to serve it themselves.](https://www.wltx.com/mobile/article/life/heartwarming/parma-newlyweds-donate-and-serve-their-own-reception-food-to-women-and-children-living-at-the-city-mission/95-7b8c9660-be20-47b7-a50c-4679606c74fd) 

It was a huge AoK, but it was also a really excellent example to me of how attitude is everything. I'm sure that having to deal with changing and canceling wedding plans during the pandemic is an absolute nightmare for everyone who's gone through it, and a huge disappointment. I'm really impressed by the way this couple has turned it around into something that brightened up the day for other people who are also struggling. 

They aren't pretending that it doesn't suck to drop a ton of cash on a reception that didn't happen, and to not be able to celebrate getting married with their friends and families. But they rolled with it, and they saw a way to utilize what they had and where they were at for the benefit of others. That's pretty awesome. I often fail to look beyond how a situation affects me, and this is a great example of how a change in perception can change a whole situation.

That's me for this week. How's everyone else doing, any AoK that you'd like to share?",34,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9932829141616821}"

My SO’s younger brother came to visit for two weeks and I offered to drive. They grabbed a cider and a beer after we got some ice cream and we all chatted and I had a good time.

I did catch some wiffs, particularly of the cider - which I never drank, but still triggered that longing. I almost even reached to pull my SO’s beer toward me for a sip just after he set it down (something I saw myself doing in my mind, but also something I never realized I always did, until that moment. I’d always even try a drink if it was there).

Well, today I didn’t. I sat as they enjoyed two rounds and we talked and laughed about family and Internet things. And I glanced around admiring how clear everything looked. I also had a sinking feeling seeing a drunk looking guy drinking by himself and scrolling through his phone, probably because I used to always spend the majority of my time drinking alone and it reminded me of how awful I used to feel in those moments. 

I know 19 days was probably too soon for me to test myself like that. I know that I had a big problem and I had admitted that to myself, accepting it. I know I tried to take “breaks” before but wouldn’t reach my intended goals... but I think that was because I truly didn’t want to.

Well I do now. And I feel good, better than I have in years. I can still have fun being out and I can enjoy my outings in a new and clearer perspective. I’m excited to continue on this journey, good days and bad. I’ll keep fighting for the motivation to keep me healthy and happy and away from what I went through for the past few years.

Then, my attention turned toward the fact that this was the first time I've been around this particular friend without drinking.

I just turned 18 a few months ago, but I have been drinking for about a year now as I used to trick my parents in to buying wine for cooking and then drink most of it, also my dad was fairly relaxed in terms of letting me drink.

Since I have turned 18, my drinking has obviously gotten significantly more frequent and I find myself averaging around 6-8 std a night. I tried doing a one month dry but failed after a week. And within the past 5 months have thrown up 2 to 3 times, once whilst drinking alone. I do see the benefit of not drinking but do find it quite difficult not to, everyone I have mentioned it to recons its just because I only turned 18 a few months ago but everyone around me that are my age dont seem to drink nearly as much and I feel like Im going down the wrong path, and if nothing else it costs a shitload. 

Back when I would trick my parents for alcohol alot of my friends would call me the group alcoholic even though I knew it wasnt true I feel like it has made me more self concious about it. Knowing that I use alcohol to get over certain things like social akwardness etc. I feel like it might end up being true. 

All I really want is just some assurance, should I be doing anything about it or am I just overreacting?

Thanks

2020-08-23 22:22:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ifghrz/when_cars_crash_and_worlds_collide/,When Cars Crash and Worlds Collide,"One week ago, my past and present met in an unexpected way - in the form of a car accident.    


These days, I go for a run at 6:30a on Saturday mornings.  While running last week, I realized my morning workouts were essentially just replacing my old drinking habits.  The early morning pursuit of endorphins; the end result is the same, but the means of achieving that result are very different. After our run, I chatted with my workout partner about this topic and how much has changed in the last 500-some-odd-days.    


After our run and chat, I went inside to stretch when I heard the unmistakable crunch of bumpers colliding.  I looked out my window and saw that someone had indeed hit my parked car.  I went out to check on the situation and realized the driver was unconscious.  I called for help, but what unfolded is not what I expected.  The cops arrived at almost the same moment as the ambulance, and the cop said, ""We know who this dude is.  We were wondering where this would end.""  Apparently, he was having quite the morning and had been refused while attempting to purchase more booze at a gas station nearby.  As best anyone can tell, he thought he put the car in park down my block to sleep off some booze, but instead idled down the street unconscious until hitting my car.  There was an open, and nearly empty, bottle of vodka sitting in his cup holder.  It still wasn't 8 a.m. yet.  


I can't judge that dude.  I've been every bit as out of control as him.  We aren't different - just at different points, and the contrast felt surreal.  There he is at what I hope to God is his rock bottom.  There I stood, on my 567th day of climbing out of rock bottom, reflecting on how far away rock bottom felt when a view of it literally came crashing into my front yard.  


I like these mornings better.

It's leap year so technically I'm a day over a year. Couldn't have done it without the number one person in my life. You know who you are. I feel good. Look better. And I am addicted to water haha.

This is my second time going sober after binge drinking 12 years. Lived with my parents when I was 18-21 and they gave me booze as long as I didn't leave. My dad was addicted but he kicked it but my mom still drinks. 

Anyways, I felt like just giving some advice from what I've learned about myself and how I kicked booze in the gonads.

First of all, you all are here because you acknowledge that drinking may be affecting your life in a negative way. That's my first tip. Practicing becoming self aware. When you get good at self-awareness, you are able to conquer it and you can use that skill for the rest of your life in many situations.

I realized drinking effected my work, my family, my friends, my home life, and I always put alcohol before everything else. I got 16 bucks in my wallet and payday is tomorrow. Cool I'll spend 13 on beer and 3 on food, I'm good. I hated doing that but it was necessary to support my habit. I started thinking about what I was about to say before saying it while sober. After awhile I realized I was being a real piece of shit.  I got sober and got way better at all of these.

It's okay if you don't want to quit today or tomorrow, two weeks from now or two months from now, you'll know when you're ready. For me, the two times I quit drinking and the one time I quit smoking cigarettes, I felt like I was floating in the clouds. I felt like I had constant runners high. My body felt great, I felt like I knew I was going to do this and I was happy. I just knew it was time. I felt like I got a huge shot of pure happiness. I had two beers left in my fridge and instead of going to the store after work I went home and grabbed those two beers and dumped them out, recorded it and I still have the video today.

Get a stop drinking app. Today I'm 1 year sober and I've saved $5127. That's fucking crazy. For a while there I had a Culligan jug and I put $13 in it each day because it's how much I spent on beer. I wanted to save it for a year but I had to start using the money but it's fantastic watching it grow. Then you can spoil yourself someday.

You may not like this but I took 10 to 15 minute long videos of me before I went to bed when I was completely plastered everyday 5 days before I went sober. They made me cringe so hard for the first year when I was sober. But I watched them the next day when I was obliterated and it just kept pushing me to go sober. When I saw my face was so terrible looking. I kept dropping my phone. My 50 beers cans just sitting there on the table because I was too depression to clean. I can watch them now with the ease knowing I don't look like that and I'm not depressed like that anymore. I was a fucking disgusting wreck.

The first couple weeks, it's okay to just sleep all the time. Cravings are hard to beat those first two weeks. They can last hours or all day. Just take a nap! I still get cravings every couple weeks but they don't even last for 2 minutes.

Exercise was my favorite thing to do when I had a craving. Just hoped on my bike, got my blood flowing, get that runners high. I went home after half an hour and the craving was gone.

I'm sure I have more tips but my last one is, if you don't want to tell anyone that you're going sober like family or friends, don't. I'm a pretty independent person and I felt that if I told my family, they would make comments like they feel bad about drinking in front of me. Truth is, for me it bugged me more when I felt like they have to change what they want to do around me. By the time I told them I was going sober, I was well enough for them to drink in front of me and it wouldn't make me crave it.

I just wanted to say a few things that I've been thinking about for the past year and a couple months.

Sober, not sober and working up to it, I'm so proud of you. You'll know when you're ready friend. Good luck and we're all here for you.",170,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9412485957145691}"

The doctor informed the alcoholic patient he was in really bad shape. The alcoholic patient asked for a liver transplant and the doctor informed him alcoholics are at the bottom of the list and that he would soon die.  The alcoholic patient died some 10 days later. That video scared me. I noticed the link r/stopdrinking in the comments.

Thirty two days ago I went back to the video and linked to Stop Drinking and read for a long time. And I cried for reasons I couldn't explain. It was all very emotional for me, I suppose cathartic. I've known for 20 some odd years I would have to stop drinking but there was always an excuse: My friends drink, my wife drinks, my wife's friends drink. My life is too busy, too stressful, I have crippling anxiety. Drinking is fun and it makes me creative and life's too boring if I'm not drunk - the whole gamut.

Thirty one days ago I didn't drink that day. I don't know how I did it, but I did. I didn't get a beer, I didn't get a whiskey, and I didn't get a vodka.  I didn't panic and I didn't freak out and also I didn't sleep.  The next day, I came back to Stop Drinking in the morning and at Happy Hour and read and read and cried and cried and didn't drink again. And the days have gone by like this for the past month.

I told myself if I made it to 30 days I'd have a beer to celebrate.  I am - A delicious non-alcoholic beer.

I recently fell and have stupid bruises and on top of it all I am hangign around with others who use drugs and basically dont like me. I'm getting too old for all this and really want to quit drinking so I decided to join this group and make my first post for motivation. 
   Drinking has been taking its toll on my health and I feel like I get riddled with anxiety. But what has been bothering me the most is the social complications of drinking alcohol. I start drinking and people seem to become more hostile and over all crummy to me. Women tend to try to flirt or whatever and I get worried it will go some place even though I reall dont want any of that (some are married which is even crazier, but noni have not done anything) I lose control of my standards...its just been bad. A very close friend of mine started to treat me like garbage and has absolutely 0 respect for me or my life. He is super self loathing and drinks constantly and becomes someone who flies off the handle. I need to get away from these toxic people and get my life straight. I've noticed that all these big mistakes are being made while I'm drunk....its like I have no moral compass after drinking and I literally rolled around in the grass with my shirt off and slowly remember other stupid things I did or said. I feel embarrassed and sad like I let myself down and need to make a change. I'm spending more time at bars than with my GF and its hurting our relationship. When does the weird embarrassment feeling go away?

One issue I am facing is that I am unable to stop thinking about work. There is no off switch anymore (and part of this is due to WFH during the pandemic). Previously, I would start drinking around 5 or 6 pm, and that would automatically ""context-switch"" my brain. I would stop thinking about work and forget about the frustrations and concerns for the night. I could then focus on other things -- catching up with friends and family, doing some writing, some other hobbies, etc. That sip of a beer or scotch would be a trigger to just hit the ""off"" switch for work. (Of course, too often the drinking would go out of hand, which is why I quit). 

Is there some other way I can switch off work mentally? I have tried exercise, green tea, herbal tea, etc. But they don't have the same potency. Same with guided and unguided meditation. One thing that sometimes works is around 200mg to 400mg of L-Theanine. That seems to calm the brain down a bit that allows me to come back from the work rabbit holes.

This was the first time in our 11 years relationship he’s ever said any of these things. I had a weight loss surgery in November, which doesn’t help my alcohol intake.

He's gone a lot for work and recently I talked to him about the possibility of him finding a different career, one where he's gone less, as we're talking about having kids not too far down the line, and I don't want to raise them alone.  At the time he seemed mostly ok with the idea, but apparently he was not.

I'm fairly new to sobriety, and I've been having a harder time with him being gone recently. I feel like it's partially because of being cooped up inside because of the pandemic, but also because I'm actually present in my day to day life now. I no longer drink away the time that he's gone. 

He brought up in our fight how it seems I suddenly have much more of a problem with him being gone than I did before, and I mentioned being sober. Honestly I don't even remember his response, but I remember it made me feel like he'd rather I get drunk and be ok with him being gone again. That isn't what he said, but that's what I heard.
I went for a drive and am sitting in a parking lot in my car, crying. And the thought of ""maybe I should just start drinking again"" crossed my mind. 

I've worked so hard to get here...and mostly I feel like my life is better for it...but right at this moment I don't see the point.

Just so depressed. Easy to run to the store for fireballs and just take the Librium and maybe it’ll balance me out?

I don’t know where to start because my story feels so messed up. Five years ago CPS took my kids away because I got involved in hard drugs. I went to rehab for 90 days and never really had a problem drinking until I stopped one addiction and traded it for alcohol. When I got home from rehab I had to get a job and an apartment to get my kids back. I did that. All while drinking more than I should but nothing out of hand. I was proud of myself for getting my shit together and “just drinking”. I met my now husband who also has two kids and he also likes to drink. When we got married I became a stay at home mom and that’s when it really got bad. The thing about me is I don’t like to drink at night...at night I like to sleep. I like to drink during the day. This has obviously caused many problems. More than I can count. Right now my husbands not even talking to me because of a bender I went on Friday with a box of wine. We also have a 3 year old that up until tomorrow I have had almost all the time. Sometimes it’s just the stress and knowing the next day is going to be the same as the next. I know I should probably go to rehab but I just don’t think it’s an option right now. Tips on stopping without rehab would be appreciated. I have horrible depression and anxiety too.

So yesterday I woke up feeling great...Yeah day 5! Had all the feels, had a decent sleep, enjoyed coffee outside as the sun rose, showered (standing up even), even got in and did some stuff around the house.

Then at around 11 I started feeling NQR, so I took a valium (I'll note here also that I'm benzo dependent - on a small dose closely monitored by my dr, and I want off those as well at some point) .... but everything just kept escalating, it was like I was back in full blown withdrawal again, I feel like I lost hours - I felt close to psychosis (Only experienced that once before due to an anti-psychotic I was put on once). It's hard to remember everything, but I was frantic, pulse was ranging between 50 and 150, uncontrollable bouts of shaking, could not get enough water in me, was seeing things in my peripheral vision, couldn't read, couldn't focus, was disassociative, was imagining losing control (like imagining clawing my eyes out and skin off) - it was all fucking Terrifying!!!! finally took enough valium so I was calm but still not quite with it.

I've never experienced anything like it, especially on Day 5, Normally Day 3 is my worst and and I improve dramatically after that..... I'm wondering if this is part of kindling or something?

I know you can't give medical advice - and I will be speaking with my Dr by tomorrow, but it was just awful and scary - mostly as it was unexpected and just seemed to come out of nowhere.

Now I'm just scared that this isn't going to end...... That I've finally damaged myself beyond repair :(

I felt like I was living two lives because I had no problem limiting my drinking when I was out with friends but I found myself drinking a bottle three or four nights a week, sometimes to manage anxiety and other times just out of boredom and habit. I tried to start substituting with marijuana - and then it just morphed into the same thing as drinking, just going back substituting one for the other. 

After some unsuccessful attempts to pare back I decided to go sober for 90 days and see where I’m at there. I’m not entirely sold that I can never drink again but certainly not in my home and not to the point of being drunk. But I also recognize I formed a really unhealthy relationship with alcohol and marijuana and it may never be possible to turn it back into an occasional social event. I tried having a last hoorah on July 31 with a bottle of wine and half way through I just realized “what’s the point I don’t even enjoy this” and dumped the rest. 

I’m now 23 days into sobriety and it feels like a fog is clearing and I’m seeing nearly all other aspects of my life improve. It helps that I recently got a dog and my partner now knows and has agreed to not have alcohol in the house for the time being. I went on vacation with friends who drank heavily but I just stuck to ginger ale and la croix and said I was doing dry August without making a big deal out of it. I also went through some major stressers that typically have me running to substances and found alternatives instead.

I’m kind of uneasy that it hasn’t been too hard to abstain for me so far and I’m worried I’m developing a false sense of security. The cravings I’ve had have been fairly fleeting. I came close once when my mood was all over the place (I have an underlying mental health disorder and my doctor thinks I’ve been self medicating) and had joints in the house, but I threw them out instead and felt proud of myself.

I’d welcome any advice on how to sustain a path and what to look out for as warning signs for relapse or attempts at rationalizations.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9977763295173645}"

I always had this fantasy of being a successful and happy woman, laughing in a bar with a red wine in hand. It's like that image is burnt into my brain as the picture of success and happiness.

I don't even know where to start. I'm constantly letting myself down and I'm a liar. I feel guilty everyday for all the lies I tell the people that love me and want the best for me. I watch criminal documentaries to feel better about myself (At least I'm not as bad as a murderer. I'm just morally corrupt.)

There have been so many day ones and empty promises. I'm at a point where I feel pretty hopeless. But when I read that people feel happy after long term sobriety, there is a sense of peace that comforts me more than anything else in my life.
Is it really possible to live sober and love my life? Can I actually live without obsessing over a poisonous liquid?

This is my first time reaching out to anyone. Looking for help getting past 1 week..1 month.,"I’m in a professional field that makes it very difficult to get help with problem drinking and is (appropriately) heavily regulated and requires reporting.
Asking for help could mean loss of my job and license. I have never allowed alcohol to interfere with my work. By the potential penalties have kept me from asking for help.

I am a parent with teens and I know that my “stealth” drinking is setting a terrible example. I change from a passive kind loving person to a short tempered person and my life is too busy and I have too many people who rely on me emotionally for me to lose my patience. I pick fights with my spouse. 

When I don’t drink our marriage is much better. When I do, I withdraw, we fight, and I rationalize and blame my spouse (who never drinks). My spouse has faults of course but I am intolerant to those faults when I drink.

I am coming to terms with how significant this problem is. Given that I keep making and breaking promises to myself -it clearly is. I can see the effects on my weight, skin, blood pressure, yet I don’t abstain. I cannot have just one.
I clearly have some anxiety issues and some post-traumatic stress. Alcohol is my crutch for calming myself quickly.

I am a high achieving type.
I think that is how I’ve deluded myself for so long. Not me. But my family is full of alcoholics. I drank with friends my senior year of high school (I think this was a mistake). But then for the 15+ years after that of college grad school and training as I was focused on my career and had a goal to attain I NEVER drank at all. No desire at all.

But after having children and trying to manage career and family and Feeling overwhelmed-and dealing with sadness and grief that is inherent in my profession (I often take care of people that are dying) I started evening drinking alone-purely motivated by the need for stress relief. 

I feel that so many people depend on me emotionally (I’m the friend people come to-the parent my kids bring their worries to-but I don’t bring my worries to other people I just swallow them). Elderly parents. Everyone comes to me. I am not good at asking for help.

It has escalated to many/most evenings unless I am working early the next morning. If I get past the first few days I stop thinking about it, and I see a bunch of positives (I start running, less anxious, more “productive”) 
...but then I will get a sneaky idea in my head a week later that justifies why I should go ahead and drink. It can be “I deserve to relax today”

I don’t know how to get past these rationalizations? 

And I clearly need a more effective stress relief plan.


I’m tracking metrics of success for motivation-$ saved, weight loss.

I’m afraid to journal because someone may find it (this is the most I’ve ever written on the topic)

What else can I do to make this stick??

For context I'm currently over 5 weeks alcohol free and have been chugging along on the Sober Express with no issue. Until yesterday.

If I'm honest, the craving hit Friday at 11:45 p.m. which was an odd time because my usual witching hour is the evening between 6 p.m. & 8 p.m. (I was never a day drinker, but there was never an evening I didn't tuck into a handle of rum by 7 p.m.) ""Whatever"" I thought as I casually dismissed the urge for alcohol ""I can keep playing Animal Crossing and drinking black cherry cola and shoving my face full of strawberry gummies  (I bought a 5lb bag for reasons...)"".

I made it through Friday night. But maybe with too little patience for my clearly struggling intention. So fast forward to yesterday evening. I'm at a thrift store with my significant other and we're having the best time. I know we have nothing else planned for later (thanks to the pandemic) and the thought of playing video games AGAIN prompts the addict edict  ""You know what makes everything more fun? Alcohol!!"" My rational thoughts, usually so eager to debate the addiction's arguments, gave up. I don't know why but they shrugged their shoulders and said, ""Sounds good to us. You know you've been sober for over 5 weeks. You deserve a break. Do you girl!"" At this point I can feel my body reacting in a biological way to merely the prospect of drinking alcohol. Last step is to convince my significant other that this is a good idea, not a moment of weakness. He doesn't actually care about my drinking (or lack thereof) so I start to pitch him on all the ways me backing out of my commitment of staying alcohol free for 7 weeks to take a self improvement course is totally normal and not cause for concern at all. I throw in ""It's a totally normal thing that any other adult in my situation would want to do."" ""It's what Saturday night's are made for!"" I conclude triumphantly. I can feel my scumbag brain practically fist pumping in excitement. ""Got 'em!"" I think. My body begins to feel anticipation for that first sip. ""What will I get at the liquor store?"" I think to myself quickly. ""Which liquor store should I even go to?"" My mind is racing. My partner, who is a quiet man, responds a moment later, amid my whirling thoughts of next steps and hits me with ""Maybe you are correct, but if that's true, why haven't you done all that for the past 5 weekends? It may be what ""any"" normal adult would do, but it isn't what you have been, or want to be, doing. What makes this weekend different?""

That question broke the destructive thought patterns I had fallen into. I all of a sudden had the resolve to play it forward. Yeah a drink would be fun. But I can't stop at one. I'll be blackout wasted if I even attempt to go hard like I used to after resetting my tolerance. A drink may not effect gaming too much but that second one might. And the third and fourth will definitely have adverse reaction to my hand/eye coordination. I won't want to interact. Or talk. Or be connected. I'll throw away a whole night and the better part of the next morning for a warm rush of feelings that lasts 20 minutes max. The rest will be chasing that high. And I can't guarantee that one night won't turn into two nights. And drinking on a Sunday night is definitely gonna affect my work on Monday, and the whole week really. All that damage done. And for what?

I'm happy to say that even though I almost slipped up last night, I woke up today bright eyed and bushy tailed. No hangover. No pain in my stomach and intestines. No intense dehydration. No racing thoughts. No shame. I was reading others stories on here and realized that today is my 40th day free of alcohol. It's the first time in a decade that I've strung so many days together! I've never hit 40 before. I've done month long sobriety times many times but always justify breaking after the calendar month is over. So yeah. It's like I subconsciously knew I was breaking through an obstacle. Had I drank last night, I wouldn't have broken 40 days sober. I wasn't the most cheerful about my choice to remain clearheaded last night. And I even woke up a bit grouchy over my boring weekend that I ""wasted"" which is why I came here first thing to connect with the community here, read your posts, get inspired, all that. But someone here triggered me to do a day count and now I couldn't be prouder and more enthused for myself.

I LOVE the freedom of sobriety - I can make plans for the morning, easily get up early and be fully functional whereas before it was AWFUL to have to be up for something. 

I love that the people who work in the corner shop I used to buy a lot booze from only see me buying diet cokes and snacks now. I’m sure they noticed me coming in pissed, buying more wine than one person should be able to consume. I think they felt sad for me and knew I was an alcoholic. 

I love that when I feel sick/ill it’s not from drinking. I can acknowledge it as something ‘legitimate’ and not just dismiss it as my fault for drinking so much. 

I HATED the hangovers from drinking. The ones after I had managed to get a few days sober were the worst. Whole body exhaustion and heaviness, complete lack of energy, nausea, unquenchable thirst, pounding head, jangling nerves, paralysis and panic about what I’d done the night before, tingling liver, zapping brain, just deathly awfulness. I never want to forget that horror.

Quitting drinking during a pandemic is hard, but tbh I was pretty isolated before all of this, between juggling life and my mental and physical health issues. 

I am loved and have friends but they've got their own lives and with most of them I'm lucky if I can get them on the phone once a week. Im taking a semester off school so all my grad school friends are busy with that and moving forward and I am stuck in one spot yet again. It doesn't help that I cant really do outside socially distanced hangs anymore because it's been too hot for me to tolerate being outdoors very long. 

I am not close with my family, despite trying to reach out to my parents more,and they live far away so I don't have much contact with them. Only child. 

I live alone and I'm not dating anyone. 

Drinking was a little bit too good at squashing my loneliness and I'm honestly a little adrift without it. I read, play video games, interact with people here, try to do art things, but there is a hole none of that fills. If it weren't pandemic times I think I'd have an easier time finding stuff to do/meet people.

I have tools and coping mechanisms. My wife has been my rock but she was super stressed to the point of tears last night so I didn't want to add to it. I know I should have come here or to the chat, but at that point I was in pure ""fuck it, who cares"" mode.

I only made one drink (one of MY drinks...think about a third of one of those 750 ml bottles) and my wife threw the rest away on me. We got into a humungous fight and I went to sleep pissed off at both myself and her (mainly at me).

The thing is....I knew it was wrong when I was doing it. Even when I was walking to the checkout there was a part of my brain that was screaming ""No! What the hell are you doing? Stop!"". But it was like I was driven by a motor. I made the choice to go there but once I was there I was powerless to stop myself.

I got into work, listened to some of my favourite tunes while opening up, and when my  coworkers came in they'd brought me cute gifts, cake and photoshopped some hilarious birthday cards with me in the arms of my favourite movie characters. It was really nice.

I tried tapering off gradually and was doing ok but yesterday after I started drinking I just ended up drinking at my normal level again.

On a good week I’d be drinking 3 nights. On a bad week every day.

My favourite was 4 litres Coke Zero and a 750ml bottle of Smirnoff with a big bag of ice in the freezer.

I am aware now I was self medicating. Painkiller for my mind.

I had lots of unwanted thoughts, feelings, emotions. I was taught to be dishonest and not to be honest and vulnerable. 

I bottle shit up. Keep it all to myself. Put the mask on. Try to control the world around me.

Thankfully I don’t do that shit any more.

First 3 months were killer. Craving. Boredom.

Now it’s routine.

I use aa - I still don’t believe in Father Christmas - I have a support network to open up to.

I believe there are many ways to get sober. I also believe that all of them will involve taking it one day at a time. You only have today. All the rest in in the head.

Keep reaching out. Keep asking for help. 

Back in the dark days, I’d figured life out - it was all shit and pointless.

Now I genuinely enjoy just being alive and sober. It feels good most of the time.

Me and alcohol don’t mix. I don’t want one/two drinks. I want all the drinks. Iam an addict, only my addiction will kill me painfully.

Life can be good and simple and peaceful and enjoyable. I laugh all the time these days. I didn’t realise quite how shit I felt everyday or that there was another way.

Shape Up Sunday is the day of the week where you tell me where and when and how and how fast or hard or heavy you kicked ass. I want to hear your new PRs, updates on training plans, and goals and dreams and plans for the week. I want to hoist you on my shoulders and give you a shoulder to lean on. Tell me your Ls, your Ws, your PRs and PBs and any other letters you string together in between!   

**Win**: I ran my 5 mile run Wednesday quite quickly at a 8:28 min/mile average! I’d been really trying to run slower throughout the week and only allowing myself one harder effort per week and all those slow endurance building miles really paid off. It was a hard effort but by no means a sprint. Just an overall great run.   

**Losses**: I’ve been struggling all week with exhaustion. I’m not sure why, I think I’m getting good sleep. I’ve been struggling to get in my strength training 2x a week (and yoga, that red headed stepchild has been dropped all together). I think a particularly fast burning (and thankfully brief lol) figurative fire at work really overworked and stressed me out creating this wave of exhaustion and comedown off the stress that I just couldn’t seem to get ahead of.   

All of this culminated in a pretty lousy birthday run yesterday. Back in January I’d decided I was going to run my age in miles (33). An overuse injury in March set me back weeks and by June and July it was clear a run that long was out of the question. I’m just not THERE fit wise, I’d probably break a bone or tear a ligament trying. So yesterday I just ran my normal mileage 13... I made it 10 before giving up and walking home. Well. Giving up and calling my husband to come get me because I was a solid 40 minute walk out. :/. I guess some days that’s just how it goes.   

**what went wrong**    

I ran too fast. My long runs, I think, should still be “easy” and I just can’t hold a 9:30 average pace for that long yet. I need to slow down.   

**next steps**  

I’m gonna not increase my mileage this coming week. Let myself really recover from last week. Next long run will be run at an easy pace. Yes it’s frustrating not being able to run as fast as I could last year. Thems the breaks, speed will return in time if I’m patient and consistent.   

**long term**   

I think I’m going to hang out at 30 miles per week for awhile. I’d been just increasing mileage with no real plan to stop but I think I’d like to stop at 30 (at 25 currently) and then focus on speed. Since my marathons are canceled in the fall there’s no pressure to get marathon mileage in.

Brace yourself, it's gonna be a long one.

In the dream, I was at home and trying to hide a six pack in the fridge. There was already one missing. I went to my room and saw the empty can in the trash. I could still taste it. I was mortified. I was coming up on a month and I felt so disappointed in myself. I gained some awareness and told myself it was a dream. 

I thought I had woken up, but the can was still there and beer was still in the fridge. Crestfallen, I took another from the fridge and snuck it back into my room. My roommates saw me. I could not make eye contact.

Then I woke up for real. All was well. No beer, no empties, still sober. And yet, I couldn't shake the guilt. I felt gross. Later that night, my band mate asked if I wanted to hang. He said they were planning on drinking, but I didn't have to. I said no because I was planning on Postmate-ing that night, but honestly, I was also scared to be around alcohol. 

Today, we were supposed to have rehearsal, but we ended up cancelling because from what I can gather they were too hungover to rehearse. I feel so many things about this. 

I'm annoyed because part of why I quit drinking was because I wanted to be a more reliable band mate and now I know how it feels like to be on the other side of my shit. In turn, I feel bad because I don't wanna be judgemental and they're nowhere near as bad as I was. This might actually be the first time this has happened.

I'm kinda sad because between quarantine and not drinking, practice is the only time I get any social interaction lately, and I already felt fomo from the other night. I knew not drinking was gonna affect my social life, but I'm scared that it'll drive a wedge between me and my friends. I know they support me, and they did invite me to hang even if I was gonna be  sober, but I'm don't know if I'm comfortable enough to do that yet. 

Basically, I've been feeling restless and depressed all day because of this. I was supposed to work, but I didn't have it in me. I kinda wanted to drink, but I just ended up smoking weed (don't @ me) and eating a pint of ice cream instead. I'm not so much concerned about my sobriety right now. I'm kinda just stuck on everything else. So far, I felt nothing but positive things about not drinking, but I'm starting to see how it's going to be difficult. All in all, I'm still stoked to be hitting a month soon.

She’s also got the need to be a victim, and has gone as far as fabricating a gambling addiction (sometimes she really wants to stop and buy a lottery scratch off ticket when she passes a filling station) and compared it to my being in recovery trying to stay sober. 

Well I extended an olive branch and invited her out to dinner last weekend and invited my sister and her little ones to make it less awkward (hard to get heated in front of a 2 and 9 year old). It went well, she thanked me and asked for some one on one time. I was hesitant but asked if she could teach me her zucchini bread recipe so I can use up some of my garden squash. It was a pleasant time. Caught her in more fibs but let them slide for now. I took her to dinner and she said something that I was unsure how to take so I emailed my therapist the exact wording to discuss on Monday. She said, “I’m sorry I don’t call to check in and see how you’re doing but I don’t want that relationship. I’m your mother and want a mother daughter relationship. But I still support your recovery and am reading the al anon book.” Not sure what to make of that but I can process on Monday.

I was conceived in August, born to parents who met in rehab. My father was an angry drunk, my mother was bipolar. Both were Navy brats from conservative Christian families— she was Methodist (and of all things also from the “Illiuminati”—Scots-Irish Freemasonry was a thing in 1970s Millington TN) and he was from a distinctly lower class Catholic family. They compromised matters of faith by raising me and my brother to be Baptist. Our young family rented a small house in Memphis, so our elementary education was sponsored by my mom’s family at a private Baptist school because it was considered unacceptable for us to attend public school with Black children. I didn’t take readily to school at first, and was corporally punished for my separation anxiety by the school principal at my mother’s request. The shame she felt at having to have me disciplined by others is understandable in retrospect, but at the time I was just six years old. However, I did eventually learn that I was safer at school than I was at home. My mom was unpredictable, but my father was worse. I won’t go into details here, I’ll just say that I did end up escaping, to college and then figuring out I had complex PTSD from child sex abuse. I’ve been kind of meandering here, I didn’t expect to be sharing so much but I want to say that August has always been my enemy. It’s the worst month of the year, full of memories of days and weeks with no escape. I’m 45 years old, and I have two wonderful daughters (17 & 20) and a wonderful partner (he’s on the spectrum and brilliant and patient and kind). I have struggled with mental illness and addiction my whole adult life, but this August—in the midst of this pandemic and chaos the whole world is suffering—I am as strong and as confident as I’ve ever been.

2020-08-22 23:23:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iew7m8/one_year/,One year.,"This post is a little late, and the timing is slightly off, but this is my story. Just over a year ago, my girlfriend and I went up to my mom's to take care of the her house and dogs while she was away on a little vacation with my sisters. We were up there for about a week, and during that time I ended up on the heaviest bender I had yet been on. I mean, my life was basically a bender at that point. I wasn't constantly drinking, but I might as well have been. I was drunk on brandy every night. While up there I went beyond over board and in five days, drank nearly as many liters. I knew at the time that this wasn't good, but was having a very hard time stopping/wanting to stop. When we got back I had a job interview, and was offered the job nearly on the spot. I went to the store to buy something to celebrate, despite really not wanting to drink. I ended up sitting in my kitchen staring at the bottle behind my laptop, until I got a few texts from my mom. She was upset. Not about the booze. I had hidden that evidence pretty well in her recycling bins. But about some things about the house. 

We had mostly taken care of it, but we had let the dogs on the couch, and I had forgotten to vacuum before we left. Suddenly I was overwhelmed with guilt, and couldn't bring myself to drink. I became terrified that she would find the bottles in the recycling, and suddenly found myself realizing just how much I had drank. I was scared shitless. Too shitless to drink. As I lay in bed that night, I swore then and there that I was quitting. I came back here. I made a doctor's appointment. I had the doctor's appointment maybe a week later (can't quite remember) and at that point started on my road to recovery with, luckily, few withdrawal symptoms. Despite all of this, my journey was still just starting. 

After the initial blood test, my joy got the better of me and I kept drinking. I had a nagging voice telling me not to though, and so I only did it in small sips, and it wasn't every night now, but nonetheless, I continued to drink. Eventually in October I decided to make another appointment. I had experienced a dull pain in my right abdomen while driving home from dropping off my girlfriend one day that persisted for quite a while. This time my doctor ran more tests, and asked me to schedule an ultrasound and possibly a CT scan depending on the results. With each scan, things came back good! Because of all the appointments that month, I had managed to stop myself from drinking. I was so ecstatic that I also finally told my girlfriend about both the results, and my drinking. She was supportive and happy. But like last time, my joy at the results gave me an excuse ""Everything was fine!"" I said. And in that first week of November I had a night of binging. My girlfriend found out about it, because I called her during it. The next day we talked about it, and I resolved then and there that I couldn't do that to her again. That I needed to be better. 

It hasn't been a year since I sobered up, but it's been a year since I started this journey of realization and health. I've taken steps to ensure my health (as best I can). I eat a diet high in protein and fiber, and try to limit my sodium intake (per doc's recommendations). Red meat and potatoes still make up more of my diet than I care to admit, but I've managed to cut back and replace them with more chicken, and more gym time. I've learned a lot. I've learned that health is a lifestyle choice that you make. That it doesn't matter what walk of life you're from, we're all on the same path (thanks for that one guys); I've learned that you need to be persistent with your dreams and goals in order to make them a reality, I've learned to find joy in the mundane in life, and I've learned that we need to learn healthy ways to manage the highs and lows of life. Most of all, I've learned that your best self is your genuine, sober self. This has been one hell of a journey, and I'm still on it, trying to learn new things and actively avoiding booze like my life depends on it (because it does).

So my family drinks quite a lot on both side (Mom and Dad)

Today i visited my mom and it was the first day i had dinner with her and her husband ( Pretty much my second Dad, i've known him for more than 14 years now ) without partaking in their drinking .  I told them i stopped drinking and smoking cannabis 5 days ago and that i wanted to make a change in my life. My mom looked happy and proud for about 2 seconds then instantly asked me if i was comfortable with them drinking in front of me. I told them there was no problem and that if i couldnt handle seiing them drinking, it meant i wasnt really on the path to sobriety.

And then they started. 1-2-3 bottle of wine later and god .... I never realized how it changed their attitude so much. It made them messy in the kitchen, made the conversation turn to petty subject. My stepfather argued against me just for the sake of it on such ridiculous subject that i knew for sure i was right. They literally started gossiping on the neighbour new neck tattoo in front of me while my full neck is tattooed. I usually have so much fun with them but now i realize most of it was probably just the alcohol.

It made me Sad and motivated at the same time. They are really great when sober and i love them. But i now realize that i need to first save myself from it and that i'll have to distance myself first ... There's a lot of alzheimer case in my family and my mom started forgetting some stuff 2-3 years ago. I told her she should stop drinking at that time but she didnt really listen even tough she know she should cut down. I dont know if showing them that its possible might help but it was overall a weird experience to process.

It was sort of a bomb dropped suddenly, we thought the doctor's instructions would be ""take this medicine for a few months and you'll be back to normal""... but no, it was ""you can't drink for a year.""

So what have I learned and how do I keep going?

- Being sober is like a hero trait. You have friggin’ clarity, which can be a huge help in dealing with life.
- By staying sober when going through stressful or emotional stuff (like a loss, a break up, or job uncertainty, or moving), you are able to deal with it better. You become disciplined.
- After a while sobriety becomes a default mode, this is both a good thing and a thing to watch. You never drink automatically, HOWEVER: you also sometimes forget why you are sober again, and that might tempt you. The trick is to warn yourself what might happen when you touch that one drink, and focus on the happiness you have from being clear.
- People around you need some explanation, it’s an odd thing to not drink in today’s culture, so have some answers ready. It can vary from ‘I find not drinking more pleasurable’ to explaining why you don’t like drinking.
- Be accepting of people who DO drink. It’s their party, it doesn’t have to be yours. You don’t have to be in bars, but sooner or later you will encounter people who drink in front of you. That is their life, not yours. You’re happy with the boss you are now.
- Don’t say: I will never drink again in my life. That is a huge promise to make and to keep to yourself, that stress alone may tempt you again. Just one day at a time: do I feel like drinking today? No I do not, because I’m cool and clear the way that I am.
- Find something edgy about yourself outside drinking. A cool hobby, a solo traveling experience, maybe the way you dress or the way you cook or the way you carry yourself. Who are YOU and how do you want to express yourself? Cool stuff to dive in.
- Try to put things of the past that shame you into perspective. One: it’s the past, and you can’t help it, two: you’re behaviour isn’t as bad as it is in your head, sure it might be ugly, but people might have experienced it different, and they probably aren’t even thinking about it anymore. Just let waves of reflection roll by. Meditate on them and let them go. Focus on things that need to be dealt with today.
- Love people who love you for who you are. You will find anything that you need from them.

All of your stories are so inspirational, and between them, my tracking app, and therapy I’ve stayed sober for almost a month. But I fell off the wagon yesterday and I’m having a difficult time. 

I’ve been struggling with my emotions as a father, my stress regarding my children hit a fever pitch yesterday. They’re both quite young, they are amazing kids, but they constantly fight. It’s a product of their age, not a single day goes by without one of them screaming and crying at the other. It makes my skin crawl and sends me into essentially a fight or flight mode. I used to drink to (this was my excuse) be a better, attentive father. When I would drink I would get bubbly and play with them more, I’d be more understanding of their feelings and emotions...until I wasn’t anymore. After years of alcoholism I became irritable, short, distant. I no longer saw my kids as the beautiful gift they are, and that breaks my damn heart. 

My wife and I have both been trying to stay sober now. For each other, for ourselves, and most importantly for our beautiful kids. They deserve the world, they deserve a father who is present and will remember all those awesome moments as they grow up. I feel like I’ve failed them because yesterday I couldn’t take anymore and went to the bar and got drunk. I’m so ashamed, but I’m trying to hold onto hope. I’ve lost almost 15 pounds being sober, I’ve had so much energy, I’ve finally been able to help clean, read books to my kids, establish a routine for them and myself, snuggle them to bed, but this morning I was so hungover (like so many days before) I could barely get out of bed.

I guess I just wanted to vent to you all because I know you understand the struggle. I’m restarting my clock today, with the hope that I can make it another month, or two, or 500.

2020-08-22 11:55:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iekw34/my_sad_but_hopeful_story/,My sad but hopeful story,"I’ve been lurking here for a while and decided it’s time to introduce myself.  I’m a middle aged woman, married with older kids, and I’ve been problem drinking since my early 30s. I've given it up a hundred times, including once when I went 5 years without alcohol. But one day that voice in my head convinced me that it would be ok if I bought a bottle, and it was like I’d never stopped.  I was a secret home drinker, vodka bottles hidden around the house. Nobody who knows me socially has ever seen me with a drink or tipsy, and even my closest friends never guessed until I told them. I’ve never driven drunk, but I’ve been horribly hungover the next day, and surely not sharp enough to drive.  Instead of drinking to excess at parties, I blackout drank at home, several times per week, even when my kids were small. My husband was understandably angry when I drank, and shut me out emotionally, which is the excuse I needed to drink some more.  My teen son has helped me to bed when I was stumbling around totally wasted. I’ve woken up with a black eye and cuts and bruises from hurting myself when I fell or banged on something, and I didn’t remember a thing.  I’m so ashamed even typing these things, but it’s the ugly truth. I guess if I can’t be a good example, maybe I can be a hideous warning! 

I attended AA for five months. Everyone was friendly and understanding at my little home group (which meets once a week) but I was pressured to go to meetings every day, and to only go to social functions with other AAs. My husband travels for work and I had kids in school and sports who couldn’t drive at the time, and most meetings were 30-60 minutes drive from home (we live rurally). My sponsor worked full time and was also very busy with grad school, so sometimes it took her half a day to reply when I texted her. She also had limited time to meet with me outside AA meetings, so I eventually just dropped out.  I tried online AA meetings but found them confusing with everyone texting comments at once.  No disrespect to AA intended, because I know many people's lives have been saved by them - it was just a bad fit for me. 

I also tried two counselors to work on why I was such a mess. The in-person one was a religious zealot who spent most of our two sessions praying with her hands on me. I’m a Christian, but she scared me. The online counselor I found later sent me alcoholic questionnaires to fill out, then never replied to my emails after that.  Was I so awful that nobody wanted to deal with me? I certainly wasn’t brave enough to look for another counselor.  So I wallowed in self pity and continued drinking. 

I’ve had bouts of depression and anxiety most of my life, and between raising kids and having my husband gone so much for work, I sometimes doubted my sanity.  Initially alcohol seemed to help, but the more I drank, the more anxious and sad I became. Driving was a special hell, where I usually had to pull over, hyperventilating and crying. I gained weight and lost days to hangovers, and I looked puffy and bloated. With my disgust at my appearance and my lack of self control, I drank even more. 

Then came the pandemic and quarantine. Suddenly my husband was at home every day, my kids weren’t racing around to sports and activities, and I loved it. I stopped drinking on my birthday in late February.  I cooked big family dinners, got a lot of neglected projects done, took walks outside to get some sunshine and exercise, and I even lost a little weight. My anxiety has almost disappeared, and my periods of depression are farther apart and less severe. My husband is proud of me for the first time in many years, and my kids are too. I've been totally honest with my husband about how much, when and why I drank, and I've also confided in several close friends. A weight lifted off my shoulders, sharing my ugliest secret and still feeling loved and supported.  

I know my struggle isn’t over - the beast in the bottle will always be there waiting for me to weaken. But with six months under my belt I feel strong enough to continue One Day At A Time. I don’t think about alcohol, I don’t miss it, and I especially don’t miss the hangover, vomiting and diarrhea after a blackout night with vodka. Once we've gotten past the pandemic, and work and school are back to normal - that is when my real test will begin.  For now I read this sub, and I’m currently reading “This Naked Mind.” I wake up each morning feeling clear headed, and it's a good feeling, being free!

Thank you to all the people in this sub, who share their awful stories, celebrate big and small milestones, give advice and prop each other up during the bad times.  Whatever hour of the day or night someone is here, ready to help. I hope I can help someone too, someone who is sitting home alone, feeling like nobody cares, like they're beyond help. Our stories may differ but we’re all sadly alike in our addiction to alcohol.

I greatly appreciate everyone's honesty on here. It helps me to feel less alone in a time where we are all isolated islands.   


I woke up this morning with dried vomit in my bathroom, doors unlocked, lights on everywhere, and the last remaining rum cocktail that I couldn't finish sitting on my coffee table. I dumped out the drink, cleaned up the vomit, and went halfway through all of the texts that I sent last night (before the guilt overwhelmed me to the point that I had to stop).   


I feel so completely and utterly defeated. I have gone 10 months without drinking before...and that was only two years ago. I know that I started and stopped my sobriety multiple times before hitting my stride, but this time is just so much harder. I can't go anywhere due to the pandemic. No gym, no movie theaters, no malls to walk around. Nothing...all I have is my apartment/office/jail cell and the three liquor stores within close walking distance. I have gained so much weight during this time that I am too embarrassed to go out in broad daylight because I don't really have anything to wear that fits anymore.   


Again, my apologies for being a downer. I understand that my problem isn't any more important or worse than anyone else on here. I am just so tired of carrying this demon; I want it off of my back and out of my head. I am not a stupid person, I know that I can overcome it....it has just gotten to a point that I can't find the proper place to start climbing out of the hole. The hole is just driving itself deeper and deeper beneath me.   


I know that there are programs. I gave AA a shot during my first run of sobriety. I just go so tired of the phoniness of many of the people, the overly optimistic shares and attempts at bad humor, and people CONSTANTLY checking on me. I know that is ALL a part of the experience, but it doesn't work for me. Being agnostic doesn't help, but that wasn't the main reason I walked away from AA. It was just a combination of the entire atmosphere. There were some genuinely great people in it, though, it is just that I never felt I could connect with them THROUGH AA. If we had connected through something more meaningful outside that, it would have been better.

  So after 12 or so days I relapsed. Had a good buzz. The overwhelming confidence rushed over me. I finally decided to use tinder again.

   I matched with a girl. Hit it off quick based on mutual interests.I was being more forward in conversation. Reading flirtatious texts that I could respond quickly without thinking about it. I was happy that I was able to engage in a conversation.
Actually talking to another human who might actually been interested in what I had to say. It felt amazing. 

  I wasn't on my way to getting blacked out or  destructive. I was able to ""read the atmosphere"" not too inebriated but not sober by any means 

  6-7 beers in I went to bed feeling content,  happy...

  Then I wake up...
Powerful waves of insecurity hit me.
Anxiety flushed back. Telling myself lies and horrible things. Scared as fuck to even send her another message. left her on read.

  what prompted this post is that she reached out asking why I never responded even though we shared some chemistry.

  I dont even have much of an explanation for myself let alone her. I'm sorry tinder girl ""it's not you its me""
 
  Why is it that when I'm sober I always feel incredibly insecure and anxious. 

  Why do I feel I'm undeserving of other people's attention.

  Why do I feel like I'm better off alone.

  Why do I have wonderful friends around the globe, a caring family ; Quality people in my life that have reminded me that my interests/character matters.

  Why is it so hard to believe them...

  Why does ""Liquid Courage"" make me feel like the confident, unafraid, perfect persona of myself that should always be present.

  Why does ""Liquid Courage"" feel like that magical potion that cures all my anxiety...

  ""Liquid Courage"" is an illusion. It will convince you that you are invincible

  Behind the gilded veil, 

  ""Liquid Courage"" destroyed my closest friendship of 8 years.

  ""Liquid Courage"" landed me in a hostpital, a lost job and kicked out of my apartment.

 ""Liquid Courage"" told me to couch surf and drive cross country to live with my parents.

  ""Liquid Courage"" has only left me broken, unable to face reality.

  I hope one day I will find the ""Courage""
to not rely on alchohol. To accept myself for who I am and that I do matter to others.

Today is day 1.,"Yesterday started out great. Met a buddy for sushi and a beer at 3 pm. We ended up moving onto another place (both outdoor patios, socially distanced) and started drinking whiskey cocktails. 

At one point he wanted to leave but I kept saying let’s have another. Pretty soon it was 7 pm and I realized I had plans with another friend. Instead, I convinced them to come meet up with us. My phone died. Friend got there. Was mad I was super drunk. Quickly left. 

The bill was over $500. I paid it because my friend is not consistently employed right now. What a waste of money. 

I didn’t get home until after midnight. Probably had over 10 whiskey cocktails when all was said and done.

Today I was supposed to fly with a friend as we were coincidentally going to the same place. She was looking forward to it. Her boyfriend broke up with her this week and she’s been really sad. Instead I had to cancel and now she’ll be taking the trip alone.

It’s Saturday morning, I’m sick from the booze. I’ve been trying to lose weight as I went from 200 to 245 during COVID. This is not a good start. And I just saw all the drunk texts I sent - thank god I don’t have social media anymore or my “story posts” would’ve been regretful too.

Today will be a coffee and water day for me. I hope tomorrow will be too.

Thank you!)- Thank you too: [u/Slipacre](https://www.reddit.com/user/Slipacre) \- [u/SOmuch2learn](https://www.reddit.com/user/SOmuch2learn) \- [u/coolcrosby](https://www.reddit.com/user/coolcrosby) who all replied back to me on the first post I made asking for help. People made it look so simple. [u/coolcrosby](https://www.reddit.com/user/coolcrosby) used to say that I could use [the baby steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) ! Man! he would post that all the fucking time! I hated him for it. Eventually, I could manage to do 2 of the 3 baby steps, but that’s all I needed to do at the time, stay sober, do it again tomorrow! Hit my head on the pillow, sober. Simple. I wanted nothing to do with that 2nd one.

But! I was becoming deeply miserable, and I needed a way to deal, a way to cope. After nearly drinking again, I started to do what [u/coolcrosby](https://www.reddit.com/user/coolcrosby) suggested and began going to meetings. 

**If you are new to this thing! Keep going! It gets better, I promise!** But you have to do some of the things (and sometimes ALL of the things) that these people suggest you do. I got in my own way so much in my life. Today, I have so much more than I ever imagined, and I nearly threw it all away 6 years ago. Instead of killing myself, I posted/asked for help here. It didn’t save my life; it started me down a path of claiming a life I never knew existed. It allowed me to step into the wonderful life I already had. Beautiful stuff! (“I want to live again” - It’s a Wonderful Life). Today, I feel that I am living the life I was given and stepping into the role that I should have been in all along. It is amazing! I do not resemble the person I was except for my exterior (and some of those things have surely changed). I help others as much as I can. Started a podcast on sobriety. (That shit is pretty fun!), and I look to give back whenever I can.  

My good friend [u/preventient\_grace](https://www.reddit.com/user/preventient_grace) often reminds me of my true beginning into a life of recovery, and I am thankful for every interaction and reply; “**If you are persistent, you will get it, and if you are consistent you will keep it.”** \- A sentiment often echoed in the last six years.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I couldn't decide between all the great quotes today so pick your favourite. 

*To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.* Ralph Waldo Emerson

*Always be a first rate version of yourself and not a second rate version of someone else.* Judy Garland

*Find out who you are and do it on purpose.* Dolly Parton

*The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.* Friedrich Nietzsche

*Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring.* Marilyn Monroe

*Forget trying to pass for normal. Follow your geekdom. Embrace nerditude. In the immortal words of Lafcadio Hearn, a geek of incredible obscurity whose work is still in print after a hundred years, “Woo the muse of the odd.” You may be a geek. You may have geek written all over you. You should aim to be one geek they'll never forget. Don't aim to be civilized. Don’t hope that straight people will keep you on as some sort of pet. To hell with them. You should fully realize what society has made of you and take a terrible revenge. Get weird. Get way weird. Get dangerously weird. Get sophisticatedly, thoroughly weird, and don't do it halfway. Put every ounce of horsepower you have behind it. Don't become a well-rounded person. Well-rounded people are smooth and dull. Become a thoroughly spiky person. Grow spikes from every angle. Stick in their throats like a pufferfish.* Bruce Sterling

*It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for something you are not.* Andre Gide

*Taking into account the public’s regrettable lack of taste, it is incumbent upon you not to fit in..* Janeane Garofalo

*If you end up with a boring miserable life because you listened to your mom, your dad, your teacher, your priest, or some guy on television telling you how to do your shit, then you deserve it.* Frank Zappa

*Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.* Oscar Wilde

I was planning to talk about something else today but this came to me and I had to share.

Being yourself is hard. It's something people say when they don't have any advice - 'just be yourself' - but I doubt any of us truly are 100% of the time. 

With low self-esteem and imposter syndrome, I spent a lot of time being someone else at work. With high expectations from family I spent a lot of time being someone else around them. Desperate for love and safety, I spent so much time being what I thought different friendship groups and partners wanted me to be. And do you know what? It's exhausting, and completely unfulfilling. It took a lot of alcohol to numb the real me into submission and I got to my 30s realising I had no idea who I was. 

Now I often think of the poem 'Warning' by Jenny Joseph:

*When I am an old woman I shall wear purple
With a red hat which doesn’t go, and doesn’t suit me.*

It's a poem about nonconformity and she goes on to list all the socially unacceptable things she will do when she isn't so concerned with others' opinions, to make up for the 'sobriety' of her youth (the boring kind, not the good kind). She says she might start acting more like that now, so others aren't so surprised later. That's how I want to live. Just being myself and not worrying about what others may or may not think. 

Someone who has truly embraced this idea is Amy Sedaris, the American actor. I came across [this video](https://youtu.be/eYHE7UIVpTs) of her giving a tour of her home, and she is a joy to watch.  

What if you aren't a big fan of the real you? It's so easy to compare yourself to people and find yourself lacking in some respect, but life's too short for that. We are each a wonderful combination of personality, interests, experience, habits, passions, perspectives and tastes that is completely unique. It's a cliche but there will never be another you. Why hide yourself or drown the real you in alcohol? If you think you're too weird to fit in, find some other weirdos and be weird together. 

Maybe you always stack the dishwasher the same way. Maybe you eat sandwiches off the chopping board to save washing up. Maybe you have a catchphrase, or a favourite possession you're never without. Maybe you are always 2 minutes late, or 2 minutes early. You might worship the sun or love thunderstorms. Do you whistle? Do you sing while you clean? Are you funny? Deadpan? Sombre? Do you love routines or are you more spontaneous? Can you be trusted? Do you love to gossip? What do you like to wear? What are your hobbies? Are you quick tempered or more laid back? What are you like as a friend?  What gets you excited? 

Let's all celebrate who we are. What are your idiosyncrasies? What makes you, you? 

It has been an absolute pleasure to host this week and I've got even more out of it than I expected so thank you all. I'm still working my way through all the comments, but I am planning to make a keepsake with all the posts and messages to add to my self-care kit.

Reworked my budget and am well on my way to being back on track without all my money being wasted on booze, drugs and cigarettes. Been much more present with my kids. Been just generally happier and more positive and have tons more plans to incorporate into my future, in every way form long term to day to day.

Booze and other substance use was literally holding me back all this time and now that I’ve finally been able to get rid of it I feel like the world is my oyster. I’ve quit before but the big difference this time is that I was finally able to change my mindset to that of a non-user, period. Instead of the usual “oh I’ll just lay off for a bit then drink moderately.” The monkey is finally off my back and it feels amazing!

I encourage all of you to keep at it and don’t give up, it’s so worth it! I hope that if you’re struggling perhaps you can rekindle those old passions and interests and let those be the substance in your life. It’s working wonders for me.

Good luck, I’m proud of you all and thank you all for the support you give just by posting here and I’ll see you at the 60 day mark!

(indulgent reflecting),"Tonight a friend came over with a deck of cards and a bottle of wine. While she and my roommate were pouring themselves a glass, I went to grab a la croix—but before I could, our friend called out to me that she’d actually brought me a raspberry tea drink and stuck it in the fridge. Homemade, with a sticker on the thermos listing the ingredients, all for me. 

It was so delicious and refreshing and thoughtful. As they drank the two of them got a little flushed but not unbearably loud or incoherent. I caught myself looking at the wine in the bottle, but not necessarily craving it. Mostly I was just thrown hearing that familiar crack as my friend twisted the cheap bottlecap open — and not feeling it in my own hands in front of the open fridge at 1am, lol. 

As we talked our friend told us, somewhat casually, how she had blacked out over the weekend (a rare occurrence for her) and how she was embarrassed and a little worried over what she’d missed. We talked about different kinds of alcohol and how it affected us, exchanged stories that were both funny and painful. She asked me how long it had been and I said I wasn’t sure, probably around 50 days or so, and she was visibly impressed. “I can’t even imagine,” she said, and it was very cool to say a number that not only felt substantial, but for other people to think so too. 

After she left I checked my app and it was exactly 50 days. I excitedly told my roommate and she congratulated me, mentioning she’d been drinking less since I stopped and been enjoying it. She asked in an entirely no-pressure way if I ever might drink again — I said I didn’t know. That of course I often think I might someday magically be able to split a bottle of wine and not immediately crave more. But I don’t want to find out right now whether it’s possible. 

And I really don’t! Definitely not during quarantine, not with fall term starting Monday, not during my two new jobs’ training periods the next week, or as we move into a new house the next. I literally do not have time in my schedule to experiment — and it really is finally making sense that I don’t ever have to worry about fighting the temptation for the second drink if I never take the first.

Wish me luck. It's been a bad few weeks with it,"The last few weeks I've had some days of uncontrollable rage and anger, days of desolate feelings and more. I'm definitely manic depressive or something else to begin with (undiagnosed but going on 22 years of whatever it is) but lately besides my lack of energy and health concerns I think drinking is taking a toll on my sanity. I don't even drink enough to feel like I'm an alcoholic. I'd put it in the rough guess if 6 to 8 shots of whiskey but every single night for a few years. I get it, sobriety is typically the goal but I'll feel pretty decent if I get down to beer at first. I can't drink that much beer honestly, 3 in the evening and I'm pissing all night. I hope the quantity of beer works as a replacement for the quantity of whiskey. Perhaps I'll try a sober week beginning next Friday. Not sure if I'll notice a difference or how quick but, it's something. The depression I can deal with I guess. The absolute rage I cannot.

**Awaken**. It’s still dark in my room. I rub sleep from my tired eyes. I immediately know it’s the middle of the night (or morning) and like the houseguest from Hell that she is, addiction, is knocking at my door.

She never announces herself. Like a predator in the night, she creeps into my conscience. She is precise, she is quiet, she moves with stealth. Each step of hers is delicate, ensuring I don’t notice her presence until she’s standing at the foot of my bed. My eyes dart from my bed to my phone, it’s late. Why am I awake? Why do I want to drink? **What is she doing here?** I went to bed, covered in blankets and peace. My body warm & safe, ready to awake to another day. Tomorrow.

But here I am, in the dark. Thoughts racing. My heartbeat works earnestly to match its pace. They work as a team and they call themselves anxiety. They are undefeated. I become paralyzed in their presence.

I’ve grown though right? Here’s my therapy: casually showing up. Always late to the party, therapy. You want to be mad at its timing, but deep down you’re just glad that it arrived. Better late than never? My mind is racing again. Like the gas pedal in a vehicle, I can feel everything inside of me accelerating. Slow. Steady. But moving faster nonetheless. I breathe. I’ve grown. I know what this. I know who she is. ***It’s addiction.*** Back in all her overrated glory, romanticizing a life that I’ve long left behind.

What do you want? Why do you haunt me? I’m anxious. Racing thoughts. Elevated heartbeat. I feel myself biting my lips. Rubbing my thighs. My stomach is in knots. I need to move. I stand & lean confidently into the darkness, relying on familiarity to guide me instead of my eyes. I can’t decide if this is just literal, or both figurative and literal. Bittersweet irony. My uncertainty emboldens me.

I move swiftly. I fumble around and feel for the light in my kitchen. Upon finding it, I feel all my fear depart with the arrival of the light. I look around my kitchen. The dishes are done. My counters clean. It feels like home. It smells like yesterday’s dinner. My heart warms at the sight of hot wheels and dinosaurs scattered beneath my table. It feels safe. It feels familiar. Comfort settles into my skin. I can feel that it’s fleeting, but I take it and hold onto it for dear life. *What the fuck is going on with me?*

My eyes dart to the fridge. Maybe I need some water? A snack? My body is crying out for something. I know its alcohol, but I quickly silence that voice. Desperate to fill the growing void inside of me, I open the door- a fully stocked fridge stares back at me. Water. Fruit. Leftovers. Marinated meat. It looks like someone with a life owns this fridge. Maybe even someone who cares about themselves? Indecision wins, I close the door- empty-handed. Some demons never leave us entirely: one of mine is named indecision. As I close the door, I glance up and see the door of my fridge. It is littered with papers. Pictures. Notes. Artwork. It portrays a life: **my life.** I have artwork from my kid on it. I have self-affirmations. I have certificates. I have goals. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say this fridge belongs to someone who loves themselves. Someone who loves their life.

I pause. A long breath escapes my lungs. A reminder of who I am settles in my brain. I feel a warmth run through my veins. *Is that you, pride?* Is that you, love?

For one brief moment, I feel safe. I feel validated, maybe? I stand in my kitchen and ponder my next move. Seconds go by, just enough time for anxiety and self-debt to creep back into my heart. Sure, I see all this change. This growth. This healthy person I see on my fridge—***she is me***.

Or is she? Who am I, *really*? I feel doubt crawling up my throat. I quickly swallow, putting her back in my belly where she belongs. I’ll deal with you later.

I look around the kitchen, absorbing all that is the quiet comfort of my home. I built this. I fought for this. I did this. I feel unsettled. Lost in the familiarity of my tiny kitchen. I can’t help but feel like an imposter in this space. Unwelcome. **What is happening?**

Seduction shows up to the emotional orgy that is happening in my kitchen. Just in motherfucking time. My brain is trying to comfort me. She trades all that anxiety and overthinking for pleasure. A reoccurring theme in my 30 years. My body responds to the thought. The word. I feel warm. I feel… loose. My face is flushed. My joints aren’t as tight. My mouth salivates. I can feel a grin creep across my face.

That’s what she does: **addiction.** She shows up in your favorite dress. In the sweetest perfume. That one you loved so much. You feel hesitant, you feel fear, you feel cautious… but she embraces you. You take a whiff of her hair, there she is. You feel her touch. You hear her voice. Your vulnerabilities and fears cast themselves like stones into the sea. She is a traveler of your body, your mind, and your soul. **She knows all parts of you.** Her passport is stained with stamps, fingerprints, and signatures. Each crevice. Each once hidden valley. She has explored every layer of all that is who you are. She has kissed all your scars. She has undressed you. Once upon a time, you were tangled in her vines. For a long time, she was your comfort. I feel violently conflicted. My heart is racing. I feel the shame creeping in like fog. Thick. All enveloping. Make it hard to see what’s right in front of my face. **Why am I struggling like this?**

Suddenly hyper-aware of my surroundings, I am painfully aware of the sad fact I am an adult, in my kitchen, struggling to make the choice to go back to my warm bed or…

Or get in my car and drive to the nearest poorly-lit convenience store. Something about the lights, the way they glow. The quietness of the parking lot after midnight. It’s welcoming. Like a moth to the flame…

More like a mosquito. Wandering both by accident & instinct nearer to that poorly-lit convenience store. Ravenously thirsty, I pierce the skin of my target and drink greedily.

I used to live only for that moment, the act of devouring- willfully ignorant to the predictable death that drew nearer with every gulp.

*Didn’t I move past this?* This shouldn’t be so hard, right? My mind reaches desperately for validation. Grasping at kitchen appliances and still furniture like straws. I need to hear I am right. I need someone to acknowledge I have changed. I listen intently. ***Silence.*** I don’t believe in signs unless they are negative, so this outcome is just the push I needed to start co-signing my own bullshit.

My hands shake as I pull out the pen.

Is this my ego speaking? My addiction? My present self? **Who am I right now?**

I feel like a car on the highway. Middle of the night. The radio is too loud. The road before and behind me is endless. I am moving, fast. Direction and destination unknown. I can’t see the driver. Who is in control? Am I the driver or am I the passenger? That’s addiction. It’s being in a car that’s on the run, not sure who is driving, running as fast as you can into the unknown to escape your current situation.

I don’t miss that. I like driving. I’ve been driving my own car as of late, and I have grown to love the feeling of my hands on the wheel. The earth of the sun on my skin. Destination unknown? Sure, maybe. But I’m ok with that. I’m driving now. I am in control. **But am I?** I am immediately aware once again, that I’m a grown adult, almost a year into my sobriety, pacing my kitchen like a forgotten circus animal. Terror in my eyes. A hunger growing in my stomach. Not sure if I should run or attack. I don’t like this. This feeling. The loss of control. ***It used to excite me, now it terrifies me.***

Maybe I’ve grown soft. Maybe all this peace, this growth, this healing… it’s a hoax. It was never real. **I am who I am**. Aren’t I? Except I have evolved into someone else. If I doubt her existence, all I have to do is look around the place I call home. Her fingerprints are everywhere. There are photos on the walls. There is a calendar. My home is clean. My fridge is stocked. There are tiny shoes and bouncy balls and yoga mats by my door. Insignificant upon first glance. However, for a person who spent a decade not loving themselves, these are symbols. Of my growth. Of my self-love. Of my realization that I am someone worth investing in.

Moving on.

Next stop: anxiety. I can feel my skin, it’s tight and it’s clammy. My heart is doing the dance of indecision, swiftly moving from black to white. Unable to feel settled in the grey. The irony? ***That’s where the peace lies.*** That’s where the answer is.

I feel my mind sprint: where are my keys? ***There she is. Addiction.*** Twirling her hair. Licking her lips. Welcoming me back into her arms. She smells like home. She looks like home. I hesitate. I feel my mind separate from my body. I feel fear. Am I in control? Who is driving? I grasp for my seatbelt with unsteady hands, oblivious to the fact my feet are planted firmly on cheap tile. I am looking for security- regardless of which seat I am in. I know she is bad news. I know she is a ghost here to rattler her chains, haunt me as she does so well. I know she is the past and I have been living in the present for quite some time. I made a home here, in healing. I forward my mail I have moved on. But not enough, I realize, to be immune to her pull. Her familiarity, fuck, it feels like home. I meet her eyes. Yes, I’ve grown. I’m in a good place. I’m sober. I can say no. But… don’t I deserve a yes? She hears my confliction. She nods her head. I step towards her. Doing all I can to silence my mind, as I knowingly take a step towards all that is her chaos. She is home. I haven’t visited in a while.

Before I can reach her… I hear a voice. My name. Who is calling for me? It’s coming from the abyss that is my hallway. It’s dark. I don’t know who it is? Should I go?

I look back to addiction. She’s waiting, licking her lips, begging me to embrace her. I can feel her pull just like gravity. It’s overwhelming and undeniable. But I am curious. I promise addiction, I’ll be back. Let’s talk about this. We can figure this shit out.

That’s addictions ugly sister: justifying. Co-signing my bullshit. Validating my toxicity. I know this. I am aware, but I proceed anyways with my promises, although they are halfhearted and full of doubt. I guide myself down my hallway in the dark. I keep hearing my name. Someone is calling for me.

I make my way hesitantly back to my bed. It’s recovery. She is enslaved in blankets. Her face is both concerned and full of love. She opens her arms. I open my mouth to apologize. Her presence is overwhelming. Her light is heavy. It’s blinding at first. Uncomfortable. But after some time, it’s warm. It begins to feel… like home. I collapse into her arms. Apology flows out of me like a river. I can’t stop. I am so sorry. I am so ashamed.  She looks at me, smiles, wipes tears from my eyes. “It’s ok” she says. “I understand why you went to her. I am not angry. You are loved. You are not judged. You are safe here. I know it’s uncomfortable, but give me a chance.”

My ego dissipates. My body relaxes. I breathe. Her forgiveness, her honesty, her understanding: it makes me uncomfortable. I don’t deserve this. I open my mouth to object but she quiets me. She wraps her arms around me. “You made the right choice, right now” she says. “This is where you belong.” I close my eyes. I may not believe her. But I decide I will accept it.

My mind wanders to my long-lost love down the hall. Will she miss me, I wonder. I feel my heart start to pound… I didn’t get to say goodbye. I have to say goodbye. *Am I ready to say goodbye?*

I meet the eyes of recovery. With just a look, she assures me I am exactly where I belong.

How did I end up in this bed?

How I arrived here is irrelevant. ***I have arrived.*** I am safe. I am sober. I am ok. She can read my mind.

*Maybe she is me?*

Maybe that person down the hall is a stranger.

I have no definitive answers.

But I am sober.

And for now? That’s all I need.

I fall back to sleep, ready to do it all again tomorrow. **I want a fucking drink. But I am ok without one.**",6,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9866828918457031}"

Just wrapped a week of heavy evening drinking that was triggered by my girlfriend bringing cider over. She's a heavy and frequent drinker and general over-indulger (diabetic and various health issues.) She's sweet, kind, funny, generous to a fault, and was there for me all of the past year and a half while I struggled pretty hard with mental health issues and family problems....although given how much alcohol she bought me, maybe she wasn't there for me in the healthy ways.

I needed her to cling to when we got together and we'd been flirty for years, but these days.... last weekend I had told her I wasn't drinking but she didn't respect my wishes and the fragility of where I am and ""just one"" turned into about 10,000 extra calories of hangovers and being tired and grumpy over the course of the week. I drank the drinks by myself of course, but I asked her not to tip the domino and all night she just kept opening bottles and pouring so by the next day I was back to the cycle of hangover->drink to feel better -> repeat. Ugh.

I'm starting to think this relationship may be seriously unhealthy for me. My interests have shifted to frequent hiking and refocusing on my art, and she's still on the couch eating and drinking her life away, and still wants it to be a party when we get together - she physically can't do the things I do and doesn't have any interest in changing.

I feel terrible.

I got sober (and stayed sober) because I knew if I kept drinking I would end up dead, by my own hand. I didn’t go to any meetings. I didn’t read any books. I didn’t make any new sober friends either. I just kept to myself and handled my business. But that’s not really a success story. The reason why I almost killed myself two years ago is because after a relapse I cheated on my then boyfriend, now husband. And the guilt consumed every part of my being. I didn’t reach out for any help, almost as a way to punish myself. Since then I’ve accomplished things I never thought possible. Too many things to name, and I don’t want a giant pat on the back for them anyway. The point of this random late night post is to say that at the end of the day, I didn’t deserve to kill myself just because I fucked up. I wouldn’t be sitting here right now, snuggled up to someone who loves me and forgives me. I would be in the ground and everyone I know would be broken, forever. 

My story worked out, but please don’t think you don’t deserve to be alive and sober. Nothing you’ve done is worth ending your life over it. If you need help. Get help. If you can’t do it on your own that’s okay. It’s more than okay.

2020-08-21 21:53:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/iea0qu/coming_up_on_weekend_number_two_which_will_be_the/,"Coming up on weekend number two, which will be the longest I (34m) have gone in ~15 years. I have some observations and a question.","First of all, I am finally sitting down at my desktop computer to write this, which is way easier than trying to type on my phone, so I can share some thoughts with you all. I have been checking in with the sub daily for the past few weeks, and it has been extremely helpful and enlightening to read about everyone's journey, whether you are on day 1 or day 1000.

Some observations:

1. Having the little blue number next to my user name is turning out to be a great motivator. I want that number to go up! It's so small right now, but knowing each day it will increase is like having money in a stock market that is always rising. I'll really be excited when I hit a month, then two, and for some reason especially 3. That will lead into the holidays, which are usually a time of heavy drinking for me, so I will need to devise strategies to deal with that, maybe even take a solo trip and avoid the usual routines.

2. I have been exercising like crazy. I ran 4 miles today after work and then I lifted weights. I think if you can couple fitness with newfound sobriety the process is much more rewarding.

3. I am finding that lonely weekends are perfectly okay with me. In the past, I would have already called up friends to go grab a drink at one of a handful of local bars here in my mid-sized city, and I would probably end up crashing on someone's couch or riding home in an uber at 2am, then suffering with a hangover that lasts all weekend, because the pattern would repeat again on Saturday night. Instead, last weekend I went to bed early on a Friday night, just like I plan to do here in a bit, and I woke up early enough to go for a sunrise run, drink coffee, fix a delicious breakfast, and then it was 10am and I was like ""well what the hell do I do now?"" Which was a fantastic feeling, because in the past I would have a splitting headache and dry mouth and roll around in bed until 11 or 12. For the rest of the day I read at a coffee shop, worked on lesson plans for school, and worked on my art, which is a little side gig I have that I have sorely neglected over the years.

4. Being drunk and out on the town in my city has grown old. How many times can I go to the same bars, walk down the same streets, over the same bridges, drunk and miserable? How long before I have a run-in with the law and lose my career, because I end up with shady people, doing shady things, or circumstances that I would never put myself in sober? How many regrettable one-night stands do I need to have?

5. One last observation: I think this pandemic is the perfect time to get sober. Yes, it's sad that the country is somewhat shut down, and has been since March, but the silver lining is that it is risky, if not just plain weird to go out to eating and drinking establishments in the current climate anyhow. A lot of people are staying home and laying low, and I have already used the pandemic at least twice to deny invitations to go drink with people. After I have a month or more under my belt I will feel more comfortable saying ""I've decided to quit drinking,"" but for now it's a lot easier to tell people I'm quarantining. With all of this social isolation comes a rare chance to better myself, really take a hard look at my life, my past, what all I have done to get where I am, the mistakes I have made, the good decisions, too, and then start to piece together what I really want out of this life. I'm in no rush. That's one thing I keep telling myself. I have one mission: don't drink. I can save figuring my life out for later.

That all leads to my question, because part of bettering myself has been to invest in Audible, and I have been listening to some great, and some not-so-great books, in my opinion, and I was hoping to get some more recommendations. All the ones I have listened to I heard about in this subreddit, so I'm sure they are familiar:

- ""This Naked Mind"" by Annie Grace - loved this one
- ""The Easy Way to Control Alcohol"" by Allen Carr - loved this one, too
- ""Recovery"" by Russell Brand - did not love this one (will explain why in a second)
- ""Alcohol Lied to Me"" by Craig Beck - loved this one
- ""The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober"" by Catherine Gray - listening to this one now, and love it

I love books that do not talk about the 12 step program, and even though Brand's is wonderfully well-written, I just cannot get on board with that program. If I do not succeed at quitting alcohol on my own, or rather with the help of this subreddit and the other books I mentioned, then maybe I will give it a second thought, but I have always had an intense aversion to religion, or the submission to a higher power step, whatever you want to call it, as well as the notion that someone must brand themselves an alcoholic for the rest of their lives, and use disease language. To those of you who advocate for the 12 step program, I sincerely apologize that I cannot get on board, and I wish you the best with your approach, as I'm sure it works quite well for you and has many great aspects; however, I would like to connect with other authors or groups that discuss sobriety without the 12 steps. I think I named some of the most common books, but are there other sober authors out there I should add to my Audible library?

I have found that going for long walks with my headphones, or listening to the books while I drive to and from work is really helpful.

Anyway, hope that wasn't too long-winded. Better get to bed. Once this weekend is over, I'm pretty damn sure it will be the longest I have gone without drinking since I was in college, which was a big SEC party school, so you can imagine I started off strong and never let up.

I came downstairs from a frustrating day of WFH to see it, and just got soooooooooo mad. 

He was sitting on the porch talking for a while longer, so in the meantime I experienced the following thoughts:

I was pissed at him for drinking 

I was pissed at him for drinking at 4pm

I was pissed at him for drinking on a weeknight when he had just promised me 2 days before that he was going to cut back how many days a week he drank

I was pissed at him for drinking red wine, which was my go-to drink

I was pissed that I couldn't drink the wine

I was pissed at myself for wanting to drink the wine 

I was pissed at myself for being an alcoholic and not being able to drink wine anymore 

I was pissed at myself for feeling mad at my fiance

I was pissed at myself for feeling all the rest of those feelings as well

It took a good hour or two, but I finally got over that craving. Its been weeks since I've had a craving hit me so hard, strong, and persistent as that one and it was a lot to shake. Later on, when I was feeling more rational, I was thinking about why I had it and what it means. I used to get cravings like that all the time both when I was drinking and during my previous attempts at sobriety. And on reflection, it feels like its that ever present addict part of my brain that will occasionally be loud enough to make everyone miserable if it doesn't get what it wants. I can't ever fully silence it, and suppressing it will only make it louder and more insistent. But I can take away its power, slowly, gradually, bit by bit with the work I am doing right now. Therapy with some intense diving into my harmful thought processes, self care, meetings with my wonderful support group of ladies, being gentle and compassionate with myself, prayer, meditation, and all of the things I've never fully surrendered to. That's how I rise above the noise.

I am on day 43 and I am feeling so much better I can't describe it. I was mainly a weekend binger but when life got worse I'd drink heavily during the week too. It started to get real bad about 5 years ago.  I'm afraid if I relapse again I won't have the strength to get sober

 I know if I keep up my past drinking I'll be dead in my 40/50s, I'm about 27. I'm single have no kids and don't want to be that drunk uncle that died from alcoholism. Lol if I need to be the example of why my family has alcoholism in it I'd rather be alive and sober than 6 feet under

 I have had a few slip ups with seeing friends (I tried again to quit in the begining of June. I tried the ""no booze in my apartment"" approach which has shown that it has to be no alcohol). I haven't told anyone that I stopped drinking yet but it has to be pretty obvious... I was one of the people with a reputation for bring the drunkest and that turned into a total substance abuse problem. It completely crippled my life and wrecked my self-confidence. I was a broken person. 

I'm going to talk to close friends about sobriety next time I see them but the label of ""alcoholic"" has stopped me from being open about this prior. Any tips would be much appreciated. I think part of it is just me accepting reality and living accordingly but it just blows to admit how out of control I've been. 

TLDR: I've accepted moderation is not a viable strategy and my attempted rule of ""no alcohol in my apartment"" is not going to work. I'm afraid I'll relapse and won't have the willpower I have rn. I need some advice about redefining myself, I've read about people moving away from friends and family and am interviewing for a position 1500 miles away in a state I want to move too anyway.

I almost thought I was craving booze just now after a difficult phone Zoom meeting with my boss, but it turns out I'm just... experiencing a broader spectrum of emotions. Huh. Feeling stuff ... hurts. Interestingly the weight in my gut that I'd normally relieve with alcohol now indicates to me I need to get up and moving, go distract myself, call someone, take a break etc. 

By only drinking about it in the past, I was effectively preventing myself from using varied coping mechanisms (or drastically reducing their efficiency to the point of not trying to use them anymore, or making me not bother with trying new things). Each additional day I stay booze-free, the better my existing coping mechanisms work, and I see the value in trying new ones as well (some coping mechanisms do get ""stale"" and need to be rotated, it turns out; and this isn't something I'm doing ""wrong"", it just is what it is). In the past week, I've been clear-headed enough to interpret what I'm feeling and act based on the specifics -- instead of thinking booze is a one-size-fits-all solution.

After all, there is never a silver bullet for anything. I can see how that distorted my thinking in the past, and happy to be moving onto healthier solutions, even if they do mean feeling more pain and putting in more work. The effort at the end of the day makes me feel fulfilled even if my initial distress prevented me from working/doing chores/etc. I won't lie, this is all very overwhelming. But I know (and this sub has helped tremendously with this) the booze would only make everything worse, and I'm happy to finally be aware of this + see the results of not drinking unfold.

I just finished “The Naked Mind” and “the Unexpected Joy of Being Sober” and I highly recommend both of them. In the Naked Mind, the author alleges that once we “peek behind the curtain” about how harmful alcohol is, you won’t even desire it. 

I’m 27 days sober and have no cravings anymore. However, it’s Friday, and I’m looking at another dry weekend. I plan to get enjoyment out of a nice long bike ride tomorrow, time with my wife and family relaxing, and getting some delicious “treat” food this weekend. However, I’m concerned that this is the 4th weekend in a row without alcohol and the prospect of an alcohol free weekend seems...dull. 

The author of “Unexpected joy of being sober” alleges that it takes upwards of 60-something days to realize the true benefits and joy of sobriety so I’ve committed to 90 days sober.

So...finally, I want to ask all of you that have gone a while sober, did you find that you started getting more pleasure from non-alcohol related events and weekends? Did you start to get “excited” again about days without alcohol? Did you find that your brain’s pleasure center become more normalized and less reliant on the drug?

I’ve seen SO many benefits to a sober life, and this is the only downside! I know that it is because of a decade of excessive drinking on weekends and always looking forward to a couple six packs to “reward” me for a long week of work, but I’m genuinely concerned I’ve done some damage to my brain.

The restaurant or bar nearby my hotel in whatever town I was in became how I killed the evening hours, and how I managed to fall asleep in a strange room and strange bed.

While I never drank in the morning or afternoon, every evening I'd have 6 or more drinks. It's a habit I've tried and failed to kick for 5 years by making schedules of reducing by a drink every 2-3 days, but I'd never get past 5-7 days without cheating and drinking extra. Frustrated, I'd reset the process, or even abandon it for a while. I'd still log my drinks, but I'd make all the excuses I needed for how much I drank any particular night. Paper after paper of checkboxes that made me feel worse because it was just evidence of no progress despite wanting it so bad.

Enough was enough; I finally admitted that willpower wasn't going to beat this, and that's not my fault. I'm not weak. I needed help. Yesterday I visited my doctor, who was great about everything. No judgment, no condescension, just facts and building a plan, and focusing on the positive incomes. He even delayed my normal yearly blood work because he wants me to do it 2-3 months from now so that we'll get real data, not ""booze"" data.

My wife is my support system, and I also told my best friend and asked him to be my external accountability partner, which he heartily accepted.

I'm at about 35 hours now without a drink, on a tapering week of chlordiazepoxide (Librium) to manage withdrawal symptoms and avoid the serious withdrawal risks, and a month of acamprosate (Campral) to manage cravings. It was tough sleeping last night, but at least I don't feel hung over, just tired.

Because my other post today was a hell of a downer, I’d like to also post some great things about where I’m at now at 45 days sober that are still great despite how shitty I feel right now

1. more free space in my brain. Holy SHIT, the amount of mental and physical energy and work required to maintain a serious alcohol addiction is unreal. 
2. I no longer live in terror of getting a DUI or crashing my car drunk or losing my job. It’s amazing how constant those fears and anxieties were before I quit. It’s like a boulder off my chest. I got pulled over for the first time in years the other day and the giddy relief that there was no alcohol in my system and no empties in my car was so extreme that I pretty much giggled like a fool the whole time I was talking to the cop. Pretty sure he thought I was on something. Don’t care. God, what an immense relief. 
3. Even in the throes of the worst of the post acutes (depression, anxiety, boredom, spaciness, cravings), it feels so nice to know that I feel like shit because I am STRONG and beating my addiction, rather than feeling like shit from a hangover and alcohol induced anxiety and being WEAK for letting alcohol run my life. 1-1 is a hell of a lot better than 0-2.

I might think of more later. I just want people to know that even when quitting sucks ass, there are really amazing upsides.

I’d nearly lost my job, I felt like shit all the time, and I realized I was self medicating on a regular basis. Finding this sub was a life saver and inspired me to do better for myself. And I did, for about a solid two years, give or take. 

Then in August of 2019 I watched as my entire family dynamic shattered and splintered apart in ways I’ve only ever seen on NBC prime time dramas. The details aren’t relevant to this part of my story. Suffice it to say, though, that rather than acknowledging and healthily processing my feelings (as four years of paid therapy has, ya know, taught me to do), I decided to drink about it instead. 

I rode that downward spiral all the way into 2020 and then some. In between hangovers I thought so many times about coming back to this sub, but every time I justified to myself why I didn’t need to. I should have come back so much sooner than this. And I’ve gotta be honest, Im not sure I would have stopped with the drunken pity party had I not gotten a DUI at the end of January. 

It was my first offense, but it was a doozy. One minute i was filling my car with gas; the next thing I remember there’s a cop knocking on my driver’s side window to wake me up. I’d fallen asleep in the gas station parking lot, phone in hand, apparently in the middle of trying to send a text. The keys were in the ignition, but I hadn’t even managed to turn the car on. In that sense, I suppose it could have been so much worse.

Because of quarantine, my court date kept getting pushed further and further back. I was originally supposed to go in front of the judge in April; quarantine made it so that I had to wait till the first week of August. So here I am, starting twelve months of probation nearly six and a half months after my DUI. And honestly, I can’t even be mad about it because it’s a straight up miracle that this hadn’t happened to me before, and this is the perfect way to make sure it never happens again. 

Anyway. All of this is a very long winded way of saying, I’m happy to be back in this community, I’m just disappointed it took a DUI to get me back here. I know sobriety is a one day at a time sort of thing. But this is the first time in 2020 that I’ve genuinely been hopeful when thinking about the months ahead.

I know that Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome is a thing and I’m guessing that’s what I’m dealing with now. I feel so foggy and dull; absolutely everything seems boring and stupid to me. My brain feels like the old windows screensaver, slowly and aimlessly bouncing around at random. I’m having so much trouble remembering things and keeping focused on ANYTHING for more than a few seconds. I’ve had to explain to my family what a difficult time I’ve been having with focus and memory because we were getting into arguments over my inability to remember even the simplest thing (they are being much more understanding now thankfully). My moods are like the world’s most insane rollercoaster - suicidal one minute, fine the next, panic attack the next minute, euphoria for a few minutes after that, back to suicidal and round and round we go (to be clear, I suffer from depression anyway and I’m used to feeling suicidal, I have no plans to act on it, so please don’t worry). My husband proposed a change I wasn’t expecting to a cabinet we’re building together and just that slight deviation from what I was expecting to happen sent me into an anxiety spiral that lasted for hours. Poor guy, he’s trying so hard to be supportive and I’m literally a grab bag of insanity all the time it feels like. Cravings come and go but when they come it feels like my skin is crawling and my whole body is begging me for a drink. I shove anything I can into my mouth to try to make the feeling go away - ice cream seems to actually help a bit, but I have a dairy sensitivity and eating a pint of ice cream every other day is not a sustainable long term plan for dealing with this. 

I still don’t want to drink. I’m committed. By quitting I have proved that I am strong and tough enough to beat this and that’s what I’m holding onto. But I would love to stop feeling like I ruined my whole life by quitting. 

How long does PAWS last? How do I cope? How do I help my brain straighten out? I’d love to hear other people’s advice and experiences. I’m open to basically any suggestions at this point and especially interested in any supplements or diet changes people found helpful.

Beating myself up everyday for making the same mistake over and over again even when I full well knew the consequences. Being in physical pain and experiencing uncontrolled anxiety everyday was stressing me out so much it was a burden to be in my own skin. It was frankly exhausting. I used to just want to take my mind with me and hop out for a while so I can feel some kind of relief that didn’t have to be through alcohol.

My bloating is down, my redness has faded, my stools are normal, I can’t feel any of my organs or my racing heartbeat, my gums feel better and I’m not longer grinding as horribly as I did throughout the day and when I slept. I no longer dig my finger nails in the palm of my hand to focus on that pain over the burning pain I had in my gut. I didn’t realize just how bad my anxiety was. 

I don’t even want this feeling to end. What was I doing drinking like that every day? 

I’m so looking forward to living my thirties like this. I’m glad I’m putting my foot down now even when the people around me won’t and likely won’t for a long time.

I was hoping to get some ideas on how you stay sober and involved in the sober world. For the last few years I’ve been in and out of AA. After my last relapse, I finally concluded it just wasn’t for me at this time. I might revisit it down the road but it was not helping me. I’m now over 3 months and getting close to beating my sober record! Woo! But I don’t know what to do with myself. The drinking cravings have been intense. I’m trying to start journalling again. I am medicated for depression for the first time in years. My marriage has healed. My friends can tell I’m better. But underneath all the positive, I just want to drink. I don’t have a sober community other than some sober family and I’m lost at what to do.

This is all kind of train of thought. But does anyone with some time have some new suggestions for staying involved in sobriety? I need something new. I’ve read books, I work out, I eat healthy ish, I follow people on Instagram. I’m honestly trying to just live my life. But I’m realizing I miss the part of AA where you connected with another alcoholic. I just feel stagnant in my sobriety but also TIRED OF IMPROVING. Lol idk if that makes sense. I’ve done so much work on myself and I’m burnt out. Can anyone relate to that? I miss being a piece of shit how messed up is that.

If you got far thanks! I just don’t want to drink again but I know I’m starting to feel that pre relapse feeling.

I loved the way it made me feel and I would drink any chance I got, I raided relatives fridges and cabinets for beer and liquor, I chugged rum straight from the bottle. It got to the point I needed at least 4 or 5 drinks midway through the day to stop the shakes and nausea along with at least 8 more at night to sleep. It's never been confirmed but I suspect I had a mild form of acute pancreatitis at least 3 times due to my drinking 2 of which I had to go to the emergency room because the pain was so bad and I was so dehydrated from vomiting everytime I tried to drink anything. Eventually after the worst of it I decided I would quit and it wasn't worth it anymore and I did for about a month before old habits came back and I hit the bottle again. I went straight back to binge drinking, a few weeks ago on vacation I passed out or tripped while drunk in 100 degree heat after not drinking any water the entire day and suffered a concussion, my grandparents found me lying face down in the dirt unconscious...

I realized I don’t know how to really date as an adult! Or have meaningful relationships without having to drink to become vulnerable. I’m not sure if I’m even super familiar with myself at this point. At first this all scared me, I used this as a deterrent. I always thought “I’m young, I have plenty of time to get sober”, but I’m allowing myself to really realize how much I was lying to myself. The longer I drink the harder it will be to quit. The more damage will be done. I plan on finding an AA group and utilizing this wonderful sub.

I think for years I lived with the delusion that my inability to moderate was simply a moral failing---and that if I could just get my shit together enough, I could be ""normal"" drinker.

But I think I thought of myself as more just mentally ill, or lacking willpower, or self indulgent, etc. Right now though....It just keeps hitting me over and over, that No! Actually I am an addict. I *am.* It's not a maybe---I really am. 

Growing up my family warned me that there was alcoholism in our blood. My great-grandfather and great uncle both died of it. I made a classic mistake---I thought it couldn't happen to me.

I went to bed sober last night.  Other than when on medication for diverticulitis a couple times over the last 4 years, I honestly don't remember the last time I did that.  I'm guessing it was somewhere around 8-10 years ago.

My body has been telling me for about the last 4-5 months that I am heading towards some health issues if I don't get the drinking under control.  I know myself well enough to know that trying to go ""beer only"" or limit volume will be an exercise in futility.

I am going cold turkey.  I guess I am probably 40 hours since my last drink.

I am not telling the people around me, as they don't know the extent of how much I actually drink and I really don't want to get into it at the moment.  I know, most of you will tell me that I should, but I am just not going to right now.

I slept great last night and am have felt good all day.  I am a little nervous about if/when withdrawal symptoms might kick in and if they will be like the horror stories you read about.  It is crazy, but I actually feel a little euphoric today having successfully gone to bed last night without drinking!  I have told myself several times over the last few years, mostly while in the shower in the morning, that I need to stop, but never did until last night.

**Remember that you can never drink responsibly**

**Remember that alcohol is already causing you health issues at 22**

**Remember that if you stop, you will get to enjoy things the way you once did. Food, video games, gardening**

**Remember that you will wake up having sent embarrassing texts, and mysterious wounds that you can’t remember how you got**

**Remember that alcohol causes you to lie to yourself, and it is very good at it**

**Remember, you have a 100% failure rate with moderation. What makes you think that it will change now**


The list for me goes on. I find this method extremely effective for myself. When I feel like taking a drink, reading through my notes makes me realize how foolish it would be to drink. It’s not foolproof of course, but it does help. If you were to take your own notes of course you would substitute with your own experiences. Try to write a short message that makes you think of a very specific time/instance. A time that you never want to relive. A reminder that this “time” will happen again if you drink today.

A dozen dozen, 12 sober days times 12, 5 months and change. Yins get the idea. I haven't done one of these reflective posts yet and want to force myself to write some so here this is. I feel as though I don't have a ton to say on the topic if I'm being honest lol. Things have been slow and weird in quarantine and after I really admitted to myself that I needed to abstain versus trying to moderate my sober journey has been oddly smooth.

Earlier this year I drove blackout drunk after my roommates birthday party and totaled my car. I have flashes of memory of rolling over, getting out of my car, walking along the highway and being picked up by cops. The next day it felt like I was waking up from a bad dream. I didn't know exactly what happened. It was bizarre and only got more insane once things fell into place. Literally half an hour from my house in the opposite direction, completely totaled after I thought I just kinda went into a ditch. I drank fairly normally after that for a few weeks until an online acquaintance shamed me (he's still a lumpen prick but he knows what he's talking about in this specific circumstance) and I decided to try to moderate. That went poorly. I had found r/stopdrinking at this point. I went a couple of weeks only drinking twice but both times I stayed up until all hours of the night and was terribly hungover and knew I needed to change. 

So 144 days ago I decided to say no to any and all alcohol. I read stories here, I participated in check-ins religiously, and read \*This Naked Mind\*. Because of quarantine, and my roommate only really drinking when I drink, things have been pretty simple since then. There have obviously been times where I'm like ""man I should have a beer"" but I've been able to suppress those thoughts. Like everyone says, drinking hasn't solved my problems but I'm able to face them with a clear mind. I'm still dealing with anxiety/depression but I'm able to force myself to do the administrative stuff that I never did before to take care of those things and make myself feel a bit better. Physically I feel fucking awesome. No hangovers is truly the shit. I've lost close to 15 pounds, down sub-170 lbs for the first time since high school. I still need to get the discipline/motivation to hit the weights to build muscle and level up the cardio but alas I'm making progress there. Still not great with money but also getting better about that, it's AMAZING not spending 20-60 bucks on beer/whiskey every day holy shit. I'm still in a weird place financially, mentally (full disclosure: I quit smoking weed about a month ago and my mood has been a little worse since then, depression naps are back on my days off and even before work on some days, it's not great!)… My court date is set in a few weeks and after that I think I'll have a better idea of where I'm at. 

I'm excited for what life is going to be like after the god damned pandemic is over. I want to be able to hang out with friends. I want to go to yoga classes, I want to start going to the gym again, I want to play sports with people again (I'm about to be the Mike Trout of kickball now that I'm gonna be one of the few sober people on the field lol). I don't know… being alcohol free is great.

Then I started drinking again. It started small but grew. I could cut back during family holidays to hide it (everyone didn't know o started drinking again) and would drink more again when I was alone. The past few months during coronavirus have gotten bad, to where I was drinking up to 24 shots a day, all day. I would have to get up at 7 and have 2 or 3 shots to function. I would continue to drink throughout the day to just feel OK until right at the end of the night I would have around 6 just so I could get some sleep. I couldn't seem to slow down.

Enter fortunate accident. I had been trying to slow down and had gotten to around a fifth a day. Through complete bad luck (but luck, for me) I was injured in an event, unrelated to alcohol. I was told that it could be very serious if I didn't go to the hospital that day. I really didn't want to because I knew I couldn't drink if I went and they kept me overnight. I was scared of withdrawal so bad. What if I had a seizure? What if I got DTs? 

But I went anyway. While taking care of the major stuff they noticed I was severely dehydrated, so they got me some IVs. In my blood work they noticed other nutrients that were lacking and so I got those added to more IVs. 

The hospital was so incredibly busy and stretched thin because of covid. I was put in a room and had to wait over a day to properly talk to a doctor about the issue I came in for (they stopped by a few times but just to hear my story and get more info). In the meantime, they kept me on fluids and vitamin IVs. It was slightly uncomfortable, but honestly not as bad as I had dreaded it would be. Minimal sweats and shakes, even.

Its corona time, my country is having PEEK numbers and the main people in control treat us like secondary citizens in our own country since its tourists season , they literally don't give 2 shits about us just to get money in the budget, I really dont get it, this march we closed everything when we had 50ish cases daily , and now we have 250+ and literally NOTHING is happening.
My boss was diagnosed with corona a week ago , he owns a couple of places and he didnt list his close contacts ...... why? Cause its tourists season , he doesn't give 2 shits about us , except making money that he lost during quarantine. 2 people are feeling a bit under the weather and they won't go get tested in fear they will close the place we work at......... im so frustrated that everywhere where I live no one gives a shit about me.

Im overweight and today I decided to change my life around. I feel so bad and I'm doing this as well, I dont care. Ill quit alcohol and weed that I used to cope with.
Ill get mentally destroyed... its been 12 hours and I am so angry and sad, at myself , at my workplace at my country.

Im 30 , had 2 girlfriends in my life , Im not really interested for dating and I get bored easily and I want my freedom, I dont get in love , I get obsessed about someone to I point I cant stop thinking about her, and I cooldown quickly and I end up hurting that someone.
But... I want to feel loved and love , I dont go out , I dont socialize , and I know its highly unlikely anything will happen , but now that I will try to turn my life around, I will get motivated and actually chase that dream.

I live with my mom , she broke her ankle 2 months ago and went to a rehabilitation centre for a month. For a month first time in my life I lived alone, I loved it so much and I started to look for a small place for myself and my dog , but ..... everything..... is soo expensive ...... CAUSE OF TOURISM , many places are just appartments for tourists and us local folk gets screwed again , there are some places that maybe I could afford,  but guess what .... you can stay in them untill 1st of June , then you have to move out cause tourists pay more for the place.

I am so unhappy.
Im happy only when high and drunk, but then in the morning I hate myself and make a plan to not drink and smoke, Im so determined I will follow through  untill 10pm ish when I give in EVERY day and buy alcohol and roll a blunt, then the next day the same thing and so on ,and so on,  even day....

I just feel my life change of today will help me to feel a bit better with myself , I will have a rough week and I hope i will endure.
I hope I will feel better with myself , I hope I won't feel so heavy waking up , I hope I will be able to sleep decently and finally get some proper rest instead of a high and drunk sweaty night of sleep.

I hope with this change I will be better mentally and I will find some sort of peace....",3,"{'rona': 2, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.997768759727478}"

The day’s old stench of not taking care of myself, food bags everywhere. Putting on clothes that had been crumpled on the floor with possible vomit on them.

However, waking up every day with increasingly worse anxiety and self hatred because of the night before, makes the urge to drink so much stronger!

What started you on the road to alcohol abuse?

———————-

I hope this doesn’t trigger somebody. It’s something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately. Why did you ever start drinking in the first place? I don’t mean why did you take your first drink ever. For me that original drink was when I was 15 and sneaked some rotgut that my parents had kept in the pantry for years, probably. They weren’t drinkers. But that one occasion wasn’t the true start, it was just a singular experience that didn’t really lead to anything.

I mean why did you start heavy drinking to the point of abuse and obvious self-harm?

For me it was an ex-wife who saw any drink as alcoholism, shamed me, and basically didn’t allow me to drink unless she also wanted to drink. Somehow the drinks she consumed didn’t qualify for that “alcoholic” labeling, but I’ve resigned that there are things about that relationship I will never understand. Thankfully that relationship ended (for a lot of reasons mostly not related to alcohol) but I took the new freedom to indulge my cravings and ran with it. That led to daily drinking pretty quickly. Combine that with new people who came into my life who also like to drink, and it really got out of control.

But the root of my issue all started with that past relationship. So now I’m asking myself why do I want to keep carrying that garbage around. The pain and nonsense related to that past part of my life is over with, except that I’m still killing myself with booze over it. I’m fairly successful, and I can’t complain about the status of my circumstances, but I also know there are a lot of situations in my life since then that would have turned out differently if I had been thinking with a mind that wasn’t constantly either drunk or reeling from the side effects of having recently been drunk. I’ve made generally good decisions, married a great woman, got a second degree, moved, and I’m doing well, but I’ve made some stupid decisions too, and alcohol was nearly always involved in those.

So that’s me, and the perspective has helped a lot in feeding my willpower to stop.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9927874207496643}"

Alcoholism runs in my family my father passed away when I was 11 and parents were divorced 7 years prior when my mother gave him an ultimatum to stop drinking. Most of the memories I have with my dad he's holding a Budweiser can.

I dont really know how I ended up starting to see him when I looked in the mirror but at 29 I am now at the point where I have been drinking with various frequency for around 14 years. I didn't start seeing any signs of problems until I was around 20. By that point I had plenty of blackout moments that people had told me about where I would be partying and driving and going places but I had no memory of it when I'd wake up the next morning. And now almost a decade later I have more shameful mundane alcoholic stories then I'd ever care to recall. I tried moderation more times than I care to remember. I found a wonderful wife who had given me 8 years of patience and understanding and I know my drinking wears on her too. It seems me and her have 2 or 3 good ""falling outs"" a year that scare me sober for a week or two but then I always end up back to drinking and hiding it until she eventually gets used to me having beer in the house again. I'm tired of  putting her through it over and over and abusing her love knowing that as much as she hates the drinking she loves me more. 
I don't even want to tell her I'm quitting because of the times I've tried and failed I dont want to get her hopes up, so I'm thinking about calling my mom and telling her which would be a huge deal because I wanted to hide it from mom just as much as from my wife.

First time posting here but after reading all of the love and support of this community, I just felt like I needed to for myself. Today is day #1 without alcohol. It's not the first, but damn it I want it to be the last. I've struggled with drinking about a 6 pack or more a day for the past 10 years. When my wife and I first met, we would drink a good bit together. Over time though, she cut back and now doesn't really drink at all anymore. Meanwhile, I'm still going to the store every single day and buying either beer or liquor or sometimes both. Last night after about 6 beers and a half a pint, she came into the kitchen for some cereal. I went on with my usual ramble about how I want to lose weight and quit drinking. This time instead of her just going along with me, she looked at me and said ""I've heard this over and over for the past 6 years and nothing has changed. You need to do this for you and stop talking about it"" and went to bed. I stepped into my gaming room and just sat there staring at the screen for about 10 straight minutes and just started crying. This is the first time that has ever happened to me before. (Not crying but crying over just wanting to be done) It was different this time. 

I want to be able to enjoy things without thinking I have to drink or smoke. I want this constant anxiety to lighten up. I want to get my weight under control but it will never happen unless I quit drinking. Most importantly, I want to do this not only for myself, but for my loved ones. I know the road to complete sobriety and self love/care is a difficult one. I'm scared and I honestly have no idea what to expect, but I will persevere. I can do this.

What can I say? Quitting drinking has changed my life. It has made the impossible not only possible, but a reality.

In the last 20 months I’ve cut out alcohol, started eating healthier and getting regular, quality sleep. I’ve lost 50 pounds and have been learning Muay Thai and boxing. I just started sparring with my trainer this past weekend and got punched in the face for the first time in my life and it was better than I ever could have imagined 😂

There is not a single thing that I miss about alcohol. I don’t crave it any longer and I rarely spontaneously think about it. When I do, it’s not with nostalgia or longing; at best it’s with indifference but more often than not, it’s with distaste. I certainly don’t miss the good ol’ drinkin’ days; it seems kind of crazy to me now that I ever glorified them.

Life is so much better on the other side, you guys. It’s possible. If you want to quit, you can do it. *You* can do it. Keep coming back here - this place has been my #1 support and has literally made all the difference for me.

His job was salaried and allowed me to stay home and work on college (I have less than 6 credits to graduate). Online school was not working for me, I dropped my courses, and I knew the additional unemployment benefits were ending soon so I got a job. 

My only real experience is caregiving for the disabled and elderly, but the last time I worked in the field is when I started drinking and developing problems with it. I thought maybe this time it wouldn’t be so bad. I got hired at an assisted living facility. It was great the first couple weeks. But my anxiety started consuming me, so much so that I woke up crying every day even though I only worked weekends (12 hour shifts, 24 hours over both days). For the first time in months I wanted a drink to escape that horrible feeling.

It’s probably not the smartest move right now but I quit. As soon as I recognized those feelings I knew I had to get away from that field, it caused me so much trauma and pain over the three years I just can’t be near it anymore without turning to old habits. Long story short there was a threat to my sobriety and it had to be eliminated at all costs. Caregiving is soul eating work and it’s incredibly painful to watch people you developed a caring relationship with die over and over again. It’s not that I can’t handle stress, it’s that I can’t handle what feels like personal loss that often, and I can’t handle the toxic culture those facilities breed (SO many coworkers laughing about drinking to forget every day).

So I’m jobless again, and I have no personal pride right now. I either based it on my school or work accomplishments and I have neither of those right now. I’m going to apply for retail jobs since I genuinely enjoyed working retail before starting caregiving. I guess I’m just here to try and remind myself that I’m looking out for the most important thing in all of this because none of life will function correctly if I drop off the wagon.

I have drank at home alone once in the past five weeks, which is a massive reduction on the 2-3 times a week I was managing beforehand. 

I have had two 'social' drinks in that time, and I am meeting a friend for another social drink this weekend. I recognise that many in this sub would say that I am dancing with danger but at present, this feels manageable and I am trying to keep up the motivation to not ruin my life with drinking by continuing to post here, so I hope that is okay. I by no way want to encourage anyone else to try moderating when I am sure that there is a wealth of people who will tell you that it doesn't work (I'm sure I have even been one of those people). But I want to be honest about what I am doing whilst still hoping to be able to glean wisdom and insight from this fantastic community. 

My post today isn't about the above, but about something else that troubles me. 

One of my big issues with drinking is binging. Though I have been more troubled by drinking alone in the past year or so, I still have a tendency to go off the rails on nights out, and sometimes contact people by phone/text when I am drunk and feel horribly embarrassed about this the next day. Often, I can put this to one side, but there have been one or two occasions that I feel have done lasting damage to relationships, and I wanted some perspective on broaching these issues with the people involved. 

For example, one friend who I was very close to no longer talks to me. Things became strained when I drunk dialled her back in February of this year. I can't fully remember the conversation. I feel like I have to accept that I have lost a close friendship because of what I did when I was drunk, but I wonder about raising this with her? The embarrassment that I feel about it has stopped me from doing this so far, but equally I feel so sad that I have lost a friend in this way. I have done similar things with other friendships that have ceased, and though to an extent I have been able to forgive myself and recognise that I have been drinking alone often because I am really unhappy, and that doesn't make me a bad person. I wonder whether it would be a help or a hindrance to raise this with my now ex friend though.

A few months ago, I almost definitely would have stewed about it and sent a classless, unprofessional, and downright rude reply after a few drinks later that night. Instead, I took a day to think about it (and went to the gym/swam to mull things over), and sent a much more professional reply. I’m still frustrated, but my rapport with my manager will remain great because I’m no longer leaning on an addictive poison to control my emotions.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

*“The key question isn’t “What fosters creativity?” But it is why in God’s name isn’t everyone creative? Where was the human potential lost? How was it crippled?

*“I began by tinkering around with some old tunes I knew. Then, just to try something different, I set to putting some music to the rhythm that I used in jerking ice-cream sodas at the Poodle Dog. I fooled around with the tune more and more until at last, lo and behold, I had completed my first piece of finished music. ”* Duke Ellington

Today I want to write about creativity, not to suggest that anyone change their career path altogether, but to share the joy I feel when being creative. 

Creativity is about using your imagination to create something. Nobody said it has to be 'good', whatever that means. It also doesn't have to be art in the traditional sense. 

I have spent years ignoring ideas because I didn't think they were good enough, didn't think I had the skills, knowledge or the right to execute them, and didn't see the point when they weren't going to be a perfect, fully-realised work of art. 

I bet everyone has had an idea in the shower for a melody, lyric, plot, joke or invention, and not acted on it when you got out. I bet you've all seen one vista and thought it would make a nice photo, but didn't take it. I bet you've all done something you would call creative but gave up before it was finished, because you didn't think it was good enough. 

An artist is someone who makes art. A writer is someone who writes. We only see the finished piece and not the hundreds that ended up in the bin. Plenty of artists who created masterpieces had some less than perfect creations before they got there. Check out the cat in [this painting](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-267) by Mignon and have a look at what Edvard Munch was [up to](https://munch.emuseum.com/en/objects/6577) before The Scream.

This is a haiku.
It took fifteen seconds.
It's still creative.

Another haiku.
It won't win any awards
But it's fun to do. 

Something from nothing.
Isn't that just amazing? 
It's new to the world.

Bad art is still art. 
Sometimes it's even better 
(if it means something).

When I am creating, in any form, I often get into a state of flow. 

From Wikipedia:

*In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.*

I love being in flow. In that moment, nothing else matters. I feel alive, and at peace. For me, it is a way to feel connected to something bigger than myself. It's a joyful, healthy feeling with no downsides, except for sometimes forgetting to pee!

If you are interested in developing your creativity, learning about yourself, being inspired or having more fun then read [The Artist's Way](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-25th-Anniversary/dp/0143129252/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+artist+way+by+julia+cameron&qid=1597906736&sprefix=the+artist&sr=8-1) by Julia Cameron. It's a 12-week programme and I can't recommend it enough. 

I want to thank you as I had been facing a creative block and had been stuck on week 9 for months, but last night I managed to finish it and move on. Week 9 is all about self-compassion and forgiving yourself for your artistic mistakes, so I must have done some growing this week. 

If you are wondering where drinking features in all of this, it doesn't. We have better, creative things to do.

She's my puzzle piece, we've gotten through my addiction, her coming to terms with being transgender, and are still growing. It's been a lot but we are stronger through this.

She was still drinking. Her drinking dropped once she was out of the closet and happy, but she still drank. It's been hard living together and figuring out what our balance is regarding alcohol in our home.

Last weekend we had a fight. She was dealing with a heavy issue and drank herself blacked out twice. I was done. I nearly left her because I didn't know how to voice my needs. I was exhausted with drunken weekends and not having fun together. It was weighing me down and adding stress.

Eventually we talked and she said she was going to stop, for her, for me, for us. This scared me. She's not an alcoholic and I didn't want to be controlling, and wasn't sure how this would change our dynamic.

Tonight we laughed harder than we have in a long time and we're more in sync already. She was more shimmery. I wish I'd communicated this need sooner but I'm glad it happened and that she'd do this for us. I left the door open to discuss her drinking moderately one day down the road and how that would work.

\--

**45 days (third time)**

* Jan 11, 2018 (first time) 
* May 21, 2020 (second time)
* August 19, 2020 (third times a charm?)

I'm posting the dates because I would *be hard on myself* when I would come to SD and see all these people who could somehow get to these more substantial numbers, and I couldn't. That didn't help with my self-esteem, so I'm hoping it will shed light on how a reset isn't a failure. But they were also an incredible source of inspiration. Just keep going!

\--

One of my biggest triggers in life that I have been working on, that I never wanted to admit about myself, is that I have *a lot* of worry and guilt about moving forward in my life.  

When I would start feeling good, meaning I hit a milestone in my sobriety date or was doing great in life and getting closet to any of my goals, typically I would self-sabotage.

Drinking was my perfect self-sabotage. Not in control of my spending, thinking, speaking, what an ideal way to hit a downhill spiral to despair.

I fell in love with the resets, because each of them taught me this lesson. But I didn't learn the lesson overnight; it has taken time. I wasn't ready to admit that alcohol was very destructive in my life. 

Some of the things I've told myself in the past:

* You live in a new city. It's the only way to make friends. 
* You're lonely, and you'll sit in your apartment. 
* You can go out to the bars and get outside esteem from guys hitting on you.
* It's a reason to get out of the house (to go out)
* Well, you wouldn't have met x person if you didn't drink! 
* You wouldn't have had x experience if you weren't drinking.

I learned to live in the opposite of all those statements.

*""You live in a new city. It's the only way to make friends.""*

**It's not the only way to make friends at all.** I have made some fantastic friends even through Reddit -- and guess what! I wasn't at a bar, and I wasn't drinking, which brings me to my next point:

*""You're lonely, and you'll just sit in your apartment.""*

**I'm not lonely because I'm sitting in my apartment.** I'm alone because of the choices I have made in the past to get me here, and I did meet a friend on Reddit being 'lonely in my apartment.' Meeting that person started a chain of events that lead to really great things happening in my life. 

*""It's a reason to get out of the house (to go out)""*

**I can leave the house anytime I want.** I have the choice of free-will. Even better, I'm single, no pets, no kids, no cats, no one depending on me. How amazing is that? I can do WHATEVER I want - I can go for a walk at 3 am or 3 pm. No one will stop me! I have a CHOICE! What FREEDOM! Alcohol took away that freedom and gave me tunnel vision to my choices. My choices are infinite. 

*""Well, you wouldn't have met x person if you didn't drink!""*

**Yeah, I probably wouldn't have met that person.** And they were a perfect mirror into who I was at the time - a drinker - and yes, brought me a lot of clarity. And yes, those experiences were 'great' in my mind at the time. 

*""You wouldn't have had x experience if you weren't drinking.""*

I know **now I wouldn't be drawn to those experiences or want to spend time with the same people**  I used to - because I'm not the same person anymore. Yes, friendships have faded, but I consider it a closed chapter. 

Those experiences reflected who I was and what I wanted at the time, but as I have changed, those desires have changed. 

I wouldn't have had that experience if I was drinking. 

* Copious blackouts
* Friendships ended over an escalation of poor behavior
* Giving myself away to people/places/things I didn't want to
* Excessive spending and tipping bartenders 
* Lashing out 
* Breaking front tooth during a blackout
* Endless text message fights
* Level 1000 panic attacks 

I thought that all the vacations and ""fun"" I was having wouldn't have happened if I wasn't drinking, but much of that time and travel was spent feeling like hot garbage with a massive hangover? Most of the time, pure hot garbage. All the flights I took, throwing up in the airport bathroom in Vegas, etc. Does that sound fun to me now? No.

**Self-love matters**

The way I feel now, the amount of clarity I have, and the amount of love I have for myself now radiates from me. 

Strangers can feel it, I can tell -- I can feel it too. There's just a certain level of darkness I lived in for a very long time because I was in a MASSIVE amount of pain. And so numb to even realize. I have been through *a lot*, and drinking was how I 'coped' with it.

But by actually dealing with my shit, feeling the feelings I stuffed inside of me that would erupt like a volcano was how I learned to not only get them out but also not live out of that pain anymore. I feel free. 

With my continued yoga practice over the years, I was able to physically release PTSD from my body in March of this year. Alcohol would never be capable of giving me that. I'm no longer a prisoner to the past. 

**How my mindset has changed:**

* No longer afraid to admit about quitting drinking, instead of seeing it as evil, and there's something wrong with me, I'm proud of it.
* Alcohol will never solve any of my problems, just makes it worse.
* Alcohol does not bring me closer to anyone or help make friends, in many cases, it's the opposite, and no one around me is present, and we never really connect.
* I love being with myself.
* I'm still awkward at times, I'm still learning, but numbing myself with alcohol just to turn off the thoughts of 'what people might think about me' is not the way to live -- and who cares what they think? The most significant turning point for me was learning that what we don't like about someone else is what we don't love ourselves. A mirror for change if we choose to see it that way.

Probably my longest post, but if it inspires just one person, I'm happy to put it out there.

Thanks for being my beacon of light, SD!

Today marks the longest I've gone (12 days) without consuming any alcohol in the last 15 years. 

I've always recognized I had a drinking problem but like other stories I've read on here I ignored it because for the most part I was a highly functioning person. I was good at my job, made a   
very good income and maintained what I thought was a good appearance and lifestyle. There were countless times over the years where I would have a bad night out and wake up the next morning feeling ashamed of myself and vowed to quit drinking. I'd take a few days off and then go right back to drinking every night after coming home from a long day at work. 

This time it feels different. I am one of the millions that lost their job during this pandemic. The last three months in quarantine I found myself drinking all day instead of just at night when I was working.  I realized one morning how bad it was when I had empty aluminum bottles in what seemed like every room of my apartment. For some reason it just clicked...I have the opportunity to use this time to get healthy.   


So here I am on my longest streak of sobriety. What's cool about it is I will be breaking that record every day moving forward. The first 7 days were tough. The anxiety and insomnia were my biggest obstacles. The weird thing this time around is there hasn't been, except for a couple of minor 5 minute episodes, an urge to have a drink. I have no doubt I will encounter a much stronger urge sometime but for right now I'm really focused on this and look forward to achieving the 30 day mark.

So that's why I joined. I understand there are going to be tough times ahead on my road to recovery and I understand it will be easier with support from this community. Looking forward to all the benefits of an alcohol free life. IWNDWYT.",10,"{'pandemic': 1, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9808351993560791}"

Well, who woulda thunk. I’m exhausted but I’m not hungover. I was able to go camping and have a great time without drinking.

Off to work today after a fun weekend relaxing and am up earlier than I’d rather be but, I can handle it because I’m not hungover!

2020-08-19 07:22:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/icls6n/friends_i_need_some_support/,"Friends, I Need Some Support","Hello friends.  I'm coming to you from a pretty low place.  I've been struggling lately, having many thoughts of drinking and trying to figure out a way to go back.  I know it's not a long term solution.  I'm just craving that rip cord into oblivion.  This post will likely be a bit of a ramble, because I'm partially just trying to untangle and unriddle my own mind.  

I've struggled with anxiety for a large part of my life.  I had debilitating panic attacks back in 2013. Thankfully the only lasted 6 months or so.  The anxiety, however, stuck around and hummed along in the background of whatever I was doing.  

I used to use alcohol to 1) feel euphoria, 2) quiet my anxieties, and 3) drown out the ""big questions"" in life.  ""Why am I here? Is there a God? What happens after I die?"" etc.  I quit drinking over 3 years ago, and for a while it was fairly smooth sailing.  I dug deep into my spirituality and found a good counselor.  I journaled every morning about why I quit drinking and what I liked about my new sobriety.  

There have certainly been ups and downs over the last three years, but the last 6-9 months have been particularly low.  I've been struggling with depression, meaninglessness, and apathy.  I've been struggling to sleep.  I've been struggling to find purpose.  And I've tried many, many things to address all of these issues.

For the sleep: I've done a sleep study, I've tried a sleeping mouthguard, I've changed mattresses, I practice very good sleep hygiene (I workout daily, I eat very healthy, I stop looking at screens 2 hours before bed, I sleep with the room cool, I quit using caffeine 2.5 months ago (this helped a lot with the anxiety but worsened my depression).  To be completely honest, I miss the days when I would drink myself to sleep.  I know it wasn't sleep.  It was blacking out.  I know it wasn't restful or restorative.  I know alcohol inhibits REM.  I know I would wake up at 3am, heart racing and parched.  But still, I miss drinking myself into oblivion.  

I think many of my anxious and depressive thoughts come from the unanswered existential questions.  I was raised in a religious household (Christian), and when I was younger, I definitely had doubts, but my faith felt strong enough to balance them out.  Now that I'm older (I'm 36), I just don't know if any of it is real.  And without that Higher Power, without my old faith system, I'm not left with much of anywhere to stand.

Sorry for the ramble.  I just wanted to get this out there.  Any hope or direction would be appreciated.

So, it happened. I had some drinks a few nights this week after 74 days. Not nearly the amount I used to, but that’s beside the point. I had about a bottle of wine last night.

I know it was dumb, but I’m not going to let it ruin me or make me think I can’t do it. It happened, and I think inevitably it will happen again sometimes. But that doesn’t make me a fuck-up. It just makes me a person in progress. I’m not saying this to invalidate people who do feel intense remorse over breaking sobriety; everyone’s feelings are valid here. But I thought some people might feel like me and would want to hear it too.

Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

*""It is not so much for its beauty that the forest makes a claim upon men’s hearts, as for that subtle something, that quality of air that emanation from old trees, that so wonderfully changes and renews a weary spirit.""* Robert Louis Stevenson

*“For my part, I am almost contented just now, and very thankful. Gratitude is a divine emotion: it fills the heart, but not to bursting; it warms it, but not to fever.”* Charlotte Bronte

*“It’s impossible to be grateful and unhappy at the same moment in time. Any moment, hour, day, or week that you are unhappy, you have chosen to let your focus rest on something other than the gifts you have been given. Let your unhappiness serve as an alarm to redirect your focus and energy.""* Steven K. Scott

Research shows that gratitude makes us happier and healthier, but when we are tired and weary, it is easy to forget the wonderful things in our lives and take what we have for granted. It's easier to spot the one bad thing that happens than the 100 good things that are going well as usual. Sometimes, when life is tough, it can be hard to find any positives at all. 

I find that no matter what, I can be grateful for nature. It's amazing, from the birds tweeting and the sun warming the pavement, to the drama of waves crashing against rocks and the rumble of a thunderstorm. I love twilight, watching the sunset and seeing the colours changing, giving the house a comforting glow. I love the scent of plants and flowers at different times of year. I love the smell of a dewy morning, transporting me back to childhood camping trips. I love breathlessly climbing a hill and being rewarded with a striking view from the top. Nature is truly awe-inspiring, and it's all free. 

Being in nature also improves our mental and physical health. While we don't all have nature on our doorstep, we can always go out and look at the sky, day or night. We can bring a little nature into our homes, or a lot like the folks over at r/houseplants. Even looking at pictures of nature gives us some of the benefits to our wellbeing. But there are plenty of other ways we can cultivate our gratitude:

* Writing 3 good things at the end of the day (focusing on small things that have happened that day like a good meal or clean sheets, rather than general things like family)
* Gratitude journaling
* Being thankful for challenges that will help you grow e.g. my co-worker trying to pass work onto me is an opportunity to practise being more assertive
* Using gratitude prompts
* Sending a thank you note or message to someone
* Using something you already have, like a book you haven't got around to, the fancy toiletries you've stored away, the kit you got for a hobby you haven't done for a while or the old dumbbells
* Using a trigger (I saw a TED talk where the speaker, who hates changing car tyres, said she expresses her gratitude for no flat tyres whenever she goes to her car at the end of the day)
* Watching a film or a documentary where the characters are facing adversity (I am always grateful for my safety, family and quiet at the end of a WWII biopic)

Rampage of abundance

I couldn't find my souce for this, but it's an exercise for when you are feeling that life is lacking and you would like to appreciate what you have. 

Look around you, and say thank you to all the people who contributed to providing you with what you can see. E.g. thank you to the people who designed this bed and mattress, the tree that the wood came from, the people who felled the tree and sourced the other materials, the people who marketed the bed, the people who made it, the people who packed it, the people who delivered it, the people who trained all the people to do all those things, all so I would have a comfortable place to sleep. 

Spend a couple of minutes doing that for everything around you. It really makes you aware of the value of what you have and is a great mood booster. Try it for your phone or laptop, with all the apps, content and wifi.

It is easy to feel that something is missing in the early days of sobriety, and we can even be fooled into thinking we are missing out on something when it has been long enough to forget why we quit. Gratitude helps us to see that our lives are full of wonderful things, with no room and no reason for alcohol. 

*“The more you practice feeling grateful, the more grateful you become. Gratitude is a muscle you strengthen through daily use—an exercise, not an emotion. It’s not something you feel, but something you do. And like most things, the people who are best at it are the ones who do it even when they’re tired and worn out and don’t much feel like it”* Jeff Goins.

I sort of froze for a second like “what was that?” Then I realized the fact I was heading out of the door to the market had been what I did every day for the past couple of years to get wine. It must have triggered me.

But as I made my way down the stairs I started thinking of the smell and taste of my favorite wine and actually felt repulsed. And the idea of becoming super tired from drinking just didn’t appeal to me. Especially now that I’ve focused on getting active and am enjoying my evenings watching my shows without wanting to pass out.

My brain is definitely confused right now. It still wants to think habitually, but now it’s got a new refreshing view of how repulsed I am by alcohol at the moment. I spent way too many days feeling sick with hangovers and even the feeling of being drunk was just becoming a burden because I knew it would just turn me unbelievably tired.

But I’m so thankful to be lying in bed, sober as can be right now. I remember on hungover days I almost could feel my organs weighing down on my belly as if they were weights of their own. My heart would be racing in my ears or occasionally having a flutter sensation.

**The Good:** A gray dove built a nest in the eaves right outside our front door. The temperature got up to one hundred, and I would go out in the midafternoon with a spray bottle of water and try to get a cooling mist going near her. I also kept the bird bath in the yard full of water, even though she never left her roost when I was around. Then, one day as I walked by, two little baby birds peeped out from the nest. I think I was even prouder than the mother.

I don't anyone really talks honestly about that, and it might be a helpful thing to understand better.

2) any good resources on both the physiological effects of stopping or cutting down? A few things I notice during the pandemic, having been a heavy drinker for 20 years (on average, half a fifth a night):

I am not now drinking most weekdays. If I do, a glass of wine, but no drinking (yay!), and the moments I do, not having a 2nd, or more into the night. (yay!)

But, the depressive aspect of ""coming down"" is pretty wild physiologically... just the exhaustion, etc. But also when I do have a martini on a weekend, my tolerance is now so messed up, I am almost just considering not drinking eventually. And the hangovers have these new components of anxiety and their own type of repressiveness.

What's more, I am pretty sure the detox periods have been impacting my blood pressure and spiking, so I am totally going to go to the doc tomorrow/next days.

Just curious about the body/physiological stuff you went through!

Super nice but a switch would flip and my fiancé would get the brunt of my inconsolable emotions. I was never violent, but so not myself. It carried into my daily life. My health. I crave it so much after every hard work day. This quarantine made it worse which is why I had to stop. My body is slowly but surely getting to know itself again. I feel more in control. I’m crying because it’s hard to admit you were losing control. I was so high functioning I didn’t realize my body wasn’t. I’m only a month down (technically tomorrow) but I’m so proud of myself. Nobody knows how badly I needed to be sober. I was really good at hiding how bad it was. I’m just very happy.

A sober buddy of mine describes sobriety as “compounding interest that pays dividends over time”.

So far my dividends include:

-	Extracted myself from a very toxic relationship
-	Lost 60 pounds
-	Bought a new house 
-	Recently waded back into dating and met an amazing woman 
-	Weened off of anxiety meds 
-	Working with a trainer at the gym and seeing huge gains in strength 

I’m a huge fan of the band Frightened Rabbit whose lead singer struggled with depression and substance abuse before finally succumbing to his demons.

Fall prey to the blizzard head  
Wrapped my hand around the glass again  
We all thought that I might change as I got older  
Fell down and nothing bled  
Wrapped in cotton alcohol again

Free pour the fruitless thoughts

Forgive me I can’t

I need black suit for tomorrow, I’m in mourning  

My love you should know  
The best of me left hours ago so  
Shove it right into my mouth and let me smolder  
Fallout and the damage done  
I can’t un-sing the things I’ve sung

I recently added up all the money I've spent on alcohol since the beginning of the month.  In just 18 days, I've spent $700.  That's an average of 40 dollars a day.  That's a fucking flight to Tokyo.  That's a third of my rent.  That's the new computer monitor I've been wanting.  That's more than I've spent on every other daily expense like transportation and groceries COMBINED. 

I've been feeling terrible about my body lately, so I bought a scale to weigh myself and start setting goals.  What I thought I weighed and what I actually weigh were WAY off.  I'm about 30 pounds heavier than I thought I was.  My clothes don't fit me anymore.  I'm tired and bloated.  My feet swell up.  My skin is terrible.  I'm so out of shape than even running up a flight of stairs winds me.  I have burn scars from getting black out drunk and trying to light myself on fire.  I'm eating and snacking in the middle of the night, just packing on calories.  This is what alcohol has done to my physical shape.

When I'm hungover, I'm anxious, I can just barely wake up for my morning meetings, and I waste my weekends because all I do is drink by myself, pass out, repeat.  It's so unfulfilling.  I don't have any interest in hobbies anymore.   I don't talk to friends because I don't want them to know how shitty I feel.

this is my first post here and although I know this is the right community to share, I also wish I wouldn't have to write here in the first place.

I always had a weird relationship to alcohol, but the first year of me going out partying, everything was fine. I never blacked out, never puked and got home at a reasonable time - I was just somehow tipsy. Something I would consider normal, when going out with people.

This all changed when a lot of things happened in my familiy and it was a really stressful time. And this was the point were everything just cracked. I had the first party with a mental breakdown and some memory loss, but no real blackout. Afterwards, I had an immense anxiety, that I told people at the party about my problems without knowing. I was shocked but didn't thought of it as something that is happening again. Well I was totally wrong.

Over the last years going from highschool to university (I am from europe) this happened much more often than I would like to admit. Most nights were still good, but I did not have this tipsy feeling. On some evenings, I experienced these breakdowns in combination with blackouts again. I started crying and telling people about my problems, although I barely knew some of them. I can always remember telling them the worst things about my life and I get a lot of anxiety, the rest of the evening is then mostly just unrecorded for me. The next morning I would panic, hurt myself and try to sleep as much as I can...then laying in bed for days or weeks.

Other nights where I drank a lot with friends and missing some parts or blacking out, nothing happened. My friends just tell me that I appeared drunk, but still can talk and that most of the times I am funny. I even had nights were I realized it is about to happen again - and I got safely home in my bed before having the memory loss. I seem to be normal during a blackout without the mental breakdown and this really scares me - like I am never going to learn from this experience, cause there are no consequences. I talked with some friends about it and while most of them didn't even notice my state, they told me that they would support me and if I decided to attend a party again it would be a safe space.

However, what brought me to this sub is an experience from last weekend. I had fun with some people from my dorm and everything was fine as we went home, that would have been the moment where I should have gone to bed. But I didn't, I asked some neighbour for some drinks and I suddenly realized the switch and I told him way to intimate things about my mental health (depression, medication, my family), while he listened and tried to calm me down. Long story short, I asked to cuddle him while falling asleep and we made out, the next thing I remember is having sex with this person. The thing here is, I wanted to have sex, because I wanted to feel desirable. In this state I was totally fine with doing it, but even during it, I was totally awkward saying weird things to him. However, now I feel a deep shame and guilt for having a one night stand in such state and pouring my heart out to someone I barely know. I feel like I am a slut and disgusting and I still have to see this person hoping that he won't tell anyone, what is going on in my life or how weird the sex was. I don't want to be recognized as the mentally instable slut of the dorm.

So I came to the point, that although my drinking never seems to harm other people around me, I harm myself with it by not knowing my limits. I am going to university and a huge part of socializing is about alcohol, but most of the times I drink with people, it is because I am lonely and depressed. It is a whole loop of anxiety, back and fourth. Most people would say a drunk one night stand is nothing weird. But for me it was somehow another big thing happening realizing that this isn't normal for me - this is not the person I am.

I have immense guilt and hate myself for a few years. I seem to fuck up again and again, never learning, and I don't know how to overcome the shame. Thanks for everyone reading this here.

Thankfully my recurring headaches made me recommit to sobriety.

Over the past year, I’ve come to accept that I have a drinking problem. I drank daily for years and never thought much of it because it was always with other people. But over time the quantity increased, and it took more mental effort to moderate. Drinking became less fun, and the rest of my life became less interesting.

I didn’t drink for three months over the holidays, but when I started again, my consumption returned to previous levels within a couple months. The pandemic and lack of a job didn’t help. Took another break from booze starting on the Fourth of July. Lasted until this past week when I went wine tasting with family. Whenever I take time off from alcohol, I’m initially able to moderate much more adeptly. Maybe it’s the lower tolerance, maybe it’s some brain recovery.

Takeaways:

1. My general anxiety is way down. Day to day I'm less anxious and able to operate better overall. 
2. My social anxiety has not decreased. Social gatherings with people that I'm not entirely comfortable still suck and I don't have booze to lean on to numb the fear. However, I also haven't woken up wondering if the stupid shit I said was annoying or too much.
3. I've been waking up much earlier. I exercise in the mornings on the weekend now. I am not in a foul mood when I wake up. I feel rested for the first time in years. 
4. I'm able to maintain a much more stable weight without starving myself. All the extra booze calories have not been missed at all. 
5. I don't really have the desire to drink. Once in a while, I'm bored or I'm having a shit day and I think, ""Man it would be nice to get drunk so I wouldn't be bored"" then I find something else to do. 
6. Money. I've saved a couple  hundred dollars in the last 30 days alone.
7. I don't get judged as much as I thought I would. I have a few drinking buddies who have been totally cool with me not drinking and it's not weird at all. They actually tend to drink a little less when I'm around too. I was worried at work it would be weird if I didn't partake in happy hours but it hasn't been at all.

1. Drink something else. I feel way less weird at gatherings or happy hours if I'm drinking SOMETHING. I've taken up Iced Tea and CBD waters. This helps me a ton since I need to feel something in my hand.
2. The first 10 days are by far the worst. The first 5 days are the worst of the first 10. The first 3 days are the worst of the first 5. The first day is the worst of the first 3. Your body wants booze. It's used to it. Like most things, it gets easier as you continue to do it. 
3. Tell people. I told my girlfriend, bother, coworkers, and close friends I wasn't drinking. It made it it much easier to do because none of them pressured me into drinking or asked me if I wanted a drink. 
4. Use this sub. I read other people's posts and most of the time just comment IWNDWYT. I'm commenting as much for myself as for them. You are not alone in this.

2020-08-18 12:22:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ic46hg/shy_about_aa_meetingshow_i_got_over_it/,Shy about AA meetings—How I got over it.,"I am a M/37 with 105 days of sobriety. This is a brief synopsis of my experience with AA meetings (in person and over Zoom) and how I got over my shyness. Everybody has different experiences and will approach AA meetings differently. This is what worked for me:

My first meeting ever (circa 2010): I went by myself to a really old building that seemed like a halfway house for addicts. There was a large table in the middle with seats all around it. There were only men in the meeting, most of them old enough to be my father. It was friendly and inviting but I still didn't feel comfortable. Once they started talking and sharing, I questioned whether I even belonged in that meeting with those people. I had never been arrested or gotten a DUI and I wasn't there by court order, as is the case for some people. I learned the serenity prayer but left the meeting feeling like I wasn't sure I'd be back. 

My second meeting ever (circa 2017): I went back to a meeting after getting into a substance abuse and recovery program through my employer's health insurance. I went there voluntarily looking for therapy and psychiatric help, but the deal was that I had to do meetings if I wanted to get help. So I did. This time I was a little more relaxed and familiarized. I still felt that I did NOT belong with those people there, but I was there nonetheless.

Subsequent meetings (infrequent between 2017 and 2018): I showed up to AA meetings here and there whenever I'd find someone to go with me. A colleague from work revealed to me he was in AA and he connected me with some of his friends who then invited to a meeting. I felt more familiarized with the meeting format but all the talk about spirituality and God and the Big Book was so foreign to me that it kinda turned me off. So I stopped showing up. I still felt that I didn't have a problem.

More recent meetings (between April 2020 to current): This was at the beginning of the pandemic lockdown so everything was done virtually through Zoom. Unlike going to meetings in person, Zoom was more convenient for me because I could choose any meeting at any time of the day on any day of the week. My first meeting on Zoom I used a fake name (not my real one, at least) and I was reluctant to come back because I felt people would notice that I was using a fake name. Still I was reluctant to participate and to believe that I belonged with those people, but still, this time I stuck around. I started going into these Reddit forums on sobriety and started asking for help on how to get onto the program. I asked about how to get a sponsor. Eventually I showed up to a Zoom meeting and I asked that someone connect me with a sponsor. And that was the beginning of me getting on board with the program. 

Conclusion: I realize that a lot of my hesitation to going to meetings was my lack of understanding of the AA program. I read a lot of posts on Reddit from users who ask whether AA is free or whether it is religious-leaning or whether the program is for them at all. I had those questions, too. And once I got my answers, I felt more comfortable going to meetings and relating to the people there. These people are now part of my lifeblood. They are like family. They have been there every step of the way in my journey to sobriety and I look forward every day to spending time with them.",15,"{'pandemic': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9928147792816162}"

I know it feels impossible sometimes. It’s so worth it though. I feel like a version of myself I didn’t know was possible even given my current situation.

Well, I grabbed her glass instead and ended up with water tinted with beer residue. It was immediately disgusting before processing what had happened.

I always said I liked the taste of beer and I suppose it wasn't all bad, but so so much alcohol is, ""an acquired taste"". The majority of alcoholic drinks would be considered trash if they didn't make you drunk. A lot of beer tastes like soggy Wonder bread left in the sun for three days.

Just the fact that we have an idea in our society that you have to learn to consume something you don't like to prove your maturity, manliness, coolness, or sophistication is ridiculous. 

Frequently that effort to acquire tastes leads to piss beer, nail polish remover vodka, and rotting wine. It's a societally approved way to shame people to justify decisions you may be concerned about. I despise pickles.

Backstory that got me here (feel free to skip!):

Not excuses at all, just would welcome anyone who's been struggling during the pandemic like me. I lost my job due to covid closures, started drinking more heavily, unexpectedly became pregnant, quit drinking cold turkey after hearing that news, unexpectedly got super excited for a small human (as my boyfriend did too), unexpectedly lost said small human from miscarriage, was immediately labeled high risk for covid due to blood loss and all, was told by my doc that I should avoid visiting the boyfriend because he's in healthcare working hands on with lots of people daily so kind of wound up going through that awful experience by myself. And it sucked, and I drink so that I don't have to feel anything.

&#x200B;

Current state (feel free to skip!):

Still sloping off of alcohol because my doc recommended not going cold turkey due to risk of seizures/stroke at the rate I was going. I've cut back at this point to only being able to have a small drink when I get the DTs and start shaking too badly. So I'm reaching out to you amazing humans for help! I've been to a (virtual) AA meeting every day since I decided drinking had to go, and have gotten so much out of it thus far (but still very green in terms of knowing core beliefs, whatever). If I stay on track I should be medically able to have my last drink on Wednesday.

&#x200B;

WHAT THE FUCK THIS SUCKS AND I NEED YOUR SAGE WISDOM PART:

Any advice on how to sleep? I have only slept about 4 hours a night since I started my tapering off process, and I've completely lost my appetite, too. Any kind of timeline folks could share for their recovery? I am so new to all of this, and the fact that I made choices that led me to be in a place where I medically cannot go cold turkey is very disappointing to me, but also a new challenge I'm excited for. Basically, any words of wisdom for someone who is completely new to this scene, but has been an alcoholic for years and just now realized I have to make changes? The world is beautiful and this community is beautiful and you're beautiful, whoever you are reading this! Sending so many hugs to everyone here and am so grateful for having this sub to get through this rough as hell couple of weeks.

I just wanted to share that I'm finally done with drinking. I've been trying to quit for the last 12 months (almost exactly to the day) and I've had some long stretches (over a month sober in June) but always decided to have 'just a beer or two'. These inevitably turned into more and ruined everything, as I knew they would deep down. It was almost masochistic. But I'm finally done with this cycle. This time feels different.

On Friday I had 'one beer' which turned into many beers, a bottle of wine, and cocaine. I behaved terribly, embarrassed myself in front of my close friends, and hurt my girlfriend. The worst part is I didn't enjoy a second of it. The first drink just started an insatiable thirst for more and I spent the whole night unable to quench my thirst for alcohol, not enjoying the evening with my friends at all. I was so hung over I couldn't do anything on Saturday or Sunday. I'm still not feeling right now. 

In a way I'm grateful for Friday night. Its showed me in a very cold light what alcohol really is.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Yesterday's DCI was about dealing with baggage which can be pretty heavy going, so today's is going to focus on self-care. 

Until recently I thought self-care was a twee fad and a fancy way of talking about massages and spa days. I didn't get it. I hadn't learned to look after my needs, and I didn't even think that I deserved to. Alcohol was a temporary way of blocking out the pain and discomfort of not having my needs met, but it didn't fix anything and came with its own problems.

The first step of practising self-care is tuning into what you need. This is pretty difficult when you're drunk, hungover or craving most of the time. Without alcohol I've found that my instincts are much sharper and it's easier to know when a situation isn't right for me or there is something missing.

Sometimes what I think I want, like alcohol, coffee, junk food or endless browsing/watching, is not actually what I'm craving. If I feel a compulsion towards things that aren't necessarily good for me, I ask myself, what am I really craving? What am I hungry for? Common answers are things like water, sleep, a hug, reassurance and quiet.

When you've worked out what you need, the next step is addressing it. This will be different for everyone, and it's for you to work out. I know if I'm stressed and need to recharge, I shut the windows and pull the blinds, so it's quieter and darker. That removes about 30% of the stress immediately. If I crave sugar mid afternoon, a cup of tea and a stretch usually works. If I'm tense, a run, the gym, or just dancing around the kitchen to loud dance music or metal hits the spot. 

The amazing thing is that there is always something you can do, in any situation. By practising self-care, both reactively and proactively, I've developed a set of tools to help me in any situation.

Some of our issues come from not having the right messages in childhood and not having our needs met as we grew up. It's not too late to address that, and reparenting yourself, or giving yourself what you didn't receive as a child, can help you heal old wounds. 

To me, self-care is revolutionary. It means I can trust that I am and will be enough to cope no matter what happens. Which means I am ok. I am safe. 

It gets easier and easier until it becomes second nature, and when your first instinct in a difficult situation is to take care of yourself and your needs, alcohol doesn't have the same appeal. 

If you don't feel worthy of self-care, it helps me to think about it being basic maintenance to ensure this mind and body are in working order. It's like putting fuel in a car or watering a plant. Then what you choose to do with that working body, like helping others or bettering yourself, is up to you. 

From Wikipedia: *In health care, self-care is any necessary human regulatory function which is under individual control, deliberate and self-initiated.*

For me the key word is necessary. 

**Examples of self-care:**

* Running
* Yoga
* Meditation
* Journaling
* Woodwork
* Art
* TV
* Cooking 
* Eating healthy food
* Car mechanics
* Walking in nature
* Going to the beach
* A bath
* Time alone
* Playing an instrument
* Calling/facetiming/meeting a friend
* Gym
* Gaming
* A nap
* Sleeping
* Closing the blinds
* Lighting candles
* Social media break
* Massage
* Martial arts
* Dance
* Time with pets
* Gardening 
* Knitting
* Shaving
* Colouring
* Cleaning
* Painting nails
* Watching sport
* Listening to music 
* Gigs
* Cup of tea

If you have time, try this now, or later in the day: 

Close your eyes, take a deep breath and feel the weight of your body. What are you feeling? Is there tension anywhere? What do you need right now? What self-care will help you regulate yourself? 

Have a fantastic day taking care of yourselves!

I don’t really even know why I’m posting this, just to tell someone, I guess. Even if no one reads this, at least I’m announcing it somewhere. I’ve been “experimenting” with sobriety over the last couple of months & I am finally ready to just stop. 

A couple of nights ago, I was supposed to have a quiet evening with a couple friends over at my apartment. They wanted to do a “wine night” and since I was somewhat on the fence about still drinking, I didn’t protest. Fast forward about 8 hours after they came over & I was a raging mess. I don’t even know what all I drank but if I had to guess it was a bottle of tequila and then some. I was completely blacked out. From what I was told, I acted really embarrassingly inappropriate to one of my good friends, caused issues between another couple and just generally ruined everyone’s time. 

The following day, I was too hungover to even eat dinner at my sister’s birthday party, & showed up reeking of alcohol, un-showered, and in a foul, sulking mood. Ruined two occasions that were supposed to be wonderful, with people I love. My friends are understandably upset with me, but nowhere near as angry and ashamed as I am with myself. 

I’m done. I’m tired of alcohol stripping me of everything. I’m turning 29 this year & I don’t even know who I am anymore. Drinking has become my whole personality. I let it consume & destroy everything. Countless friendships, relationships, destroyed forever. Even my family, who I am close with and are amazingly supportive and loving, hate the person I become when I drink. 

Drinking has taken from me my dignity, my personality, many people I’ve loved, a job (in the past), my driving privileges (in the past), and it’s still slowly working on stripping everything else including my health. I can’t keep pushing everyone away. 

Now it’s 7:30pm on a Monday & I feel empty, isolated, and lost. I’m single, have no kids, not a lot of friends (no surprise there eh?), have no hobbies to speak of (who has time for that when you’re always drunk?!) and I am mind-numbingly depressed. What’s a girl to do? 

Typically I’d drink two bottles of wine before throwing up and then passing out on the couch. Or maybe, if it was a particularly bad day, I’d invite someone over for some reckless and soul-crushingly-meaningless sex that leaves me feeling like a shell of a person. But not today. I have no idea where I’m going from here, but I know that today won’t be like all those other days.

I broke after like the 20th time. I said fine we can go out again. And since then there has been a huge weight on me and I hate my life.

I made the mistake of barely eating and went for the half of bottle of Everclear in the cabinet.. (Yeah I know last thing in the world an alcoholic needs in the house..) At first I was sipping on Everclear cocktails & watching funny Youtube videos, while my S.O. and dog took a nap next to me and that's the last thing I can recall. 
       The next day I wake up & get a text that says ""I'm getting kicked out."" I remember nothing. You see, my boyfriend and I rent a little room out from a couple that has the bigger bedroom as the area we live in ain't cheap to say the least. Apparently, my roommate's husband heard me ""arguing with the other roommate"" (yeah there's also someone that stays in the living room for the time being) and he was pissed off and annoyed. I talked to my boyfriend today and he told me that I said some pretty mean things to him, fell of the bed at one point...oh and I also wet the bed while I was passed out which is very embarrassing & I haven't done that in a very long time....(I'm very lucky to have a guy that's seen me through my worst times and still supports me, loves me, and wants me to get better) He is very forgiving and understanding as he knows how tough addiction can be.

Apparently while heating up chicken tenders, I dropped a part of the air fryer and crumbs were all over the floor. I have no recollection of any of this...but I apologized of course. They basically responded with ""fuck you...etc etc."" To make matters worse they took videos of me all fucked up and sent them to me. I didn't watch them because I was already feeling ashamed enough of myself. I just want to start a brand new week, apologize, & move on. I'm going to use this Monday as my new day 1.

Quite simply I have never drank due to depression or anxiety, in my case this is what the effects of drinking are. I literally never have the thought to go and buy alcohol alone or rarely think to be the one to suggest going to a bar or start drinking.

However when other people are drinking, I'll join in and then after a few drinks - I get buzzed up and the drink takes over and I just don't want to stop. When everyone one else is done, I just carry on and carry on until there is nothing left to drink, often I'll venture out to buy more booze and carry on until I literally physically cannot continue and have to sleep. This could last upto 24 hours. Alcohol makes a lot of people sleepy, it just wakes me up and makes sleep virtually impossible. The effects on me are something that most people have never seen, its closer to like someone high on stimulants. 

In this time I will go from happy and socialable, to ambitious, to nostalgic and sometimes angry. Sometimes the angry is directed at people who are currently causing me problems and arguments with anyone who tries to stop me drinking.

I  don't really get in physical trouble these days as I am always hidden away during these times but the trouble comes in that I start writing epic emails, facebook messages, texts or any kind of written communications. Its rarely anything offensive but more just highly embarassing, inappropriate or entirely out of context for the recieving person. It could be anything from crazy business plans, creative collaborations or discussing politics or long forgotten old times. It may also include grandiose thinking/plans/schemes or seeking reassurance about previous achievements. These communications cause me to be so embarassed after that I get severe anxiety for days, and the anxiety turns to guilt and the guilt to depression. Many times, I have been so embarassed that I have had to cut people off or disappear after as I can't face them. 

I am at the end of the road with this,so I decided to stop for a set duration and make notes along the way to remind myself of how I feel each day. I believe having something tangible to relate to later will help me see the difference. I've quit for months before and felt great but eventually I always slip up and go back to my old ways.

For me the problem literally is the Alcohol - in other respects, I am living a happy life and I am pretty fufilled. For me its just that after a few drinks, there is no off switch. Today is day 1 and I am determined to make this the first day 1 of a better life and the last day 1 I ever need to do.

I keep justifying it to myself in my head, whereas before I just shut down the argument before it even got started. I keep thinking it won’t be a relapse, it will just be an nice glass of wine, that maybe it’s what I need to examine my relationship to alcohol, maybe if it ends up as a relapse then maybe I’ll be more motivated after. I’m playing the tape forward but all I see is a more enjoyable afternoon at the airport and no nightly hangover. I keep thinking that I was in such a great mood but now I’m in a horrible one and if I don’t have a glass of wine and ‘deprive’ myself then I’ll be in a super agitated mood to see my SO.

Can someone help me?

Edit: thank you guys so much for your responses! The urge has passed. Some extremely spicy chips and a coffee did the trick :)

I think the last time I posted was somewhere in the 70-80 days range, and that just doubled without me realizing it! Life has been busy, so I guess that’s why. 

A couple weeks ago I had a (socially distanced) going away party as I was about to move, and asked the host if they minded if I made a quick pot of coffee for myself. They seemed slightly confused but more than happy for me to not drink their booze like everyone else. One of my boyfriend’s friends asked “are you not drinking or something?” and since I didn’t really have time to come up with a *reason* and hadn’t thought about needing one beforehand I just said “yeah not for a while now” and everyone moved on or didn’t notice in the first place. So overall good experience but it did make me realize I’ve gotten off a bit easy not having to deal with situations like that since my official last Day 1 was around the start of quarantine. 

I’m going to have to get more used to situations like that though, which brings me to my drunk dream. It 100% was because my boyfriend and I decided next on our to do list is swinging stuff, and I had started to poke around those sections of Reddit to see what was up in our new city. Lots of posts about wanting “cool” people, “chill” people, people who “like to party”. I am actually very cool, chill, and like to party, if I do say so myself. Maybe even more “open minded” if I’m willing to do sober what some have to get drunk to not be awkward about (🤔) but I can’t help but think it’s going to put some people off. Which is fine because then they’re not the right people, but it’s gonna be annoying to make a search for 4 people who have chemistry even harder.",1,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.7985042929649353}"

Today I am celebrating the 2 year anniversary of my last drink.  Context for the ""before"" picture:  By this point in my addiction, I was leaving the house only to get vodka from the 7/11 as early as possible.  I would vomit if I didn't get my drink in the morning.  My bedroom was packed with bottles and cans that I was too ashamed to throw out.  Some of the bottles contained urine, because I didn't want to stumble to the bathroom and let my roommate know how drunk I was.  This phase went on for about 6 months.  You can see how red my face was, my blood pressure was through the roof, and I would just lay in bed and sweat through the sheets all day and night.  I was anxious to die.

[Before](https://i.imgur.com/KN5jlof.jpg)

Now, some context for the ""after"" picture.  Because I had stopped drinking, my work performance went through the roof.  I had lost almost 90lbs.  My anxiety was reduced to a trickle.  All this gave me confidence to apply for a new job making 50% more, which I got.  To celebrate, I went out and got a nice dapper outfit to show off the new me.  The picture was taken in my own apartment, which I can now afford.  You can't see it, but the boost gave me the courage to quit smoking, too, so I no longer smelled of cigarettes.  Behind me, you can see the dog I adopted, Casey.  She walks me twice a day.  Through therapy, I have confronted a lot of my issues and can respond to problems in a healthy way, which I have put to use in dating a beautiful and amazing fitness trainer.  (Yeah, I'm bragging)

Can moderation ever be achieved?,"It'll be a year on September 2nd when I had my last alcoholic drink. It's been quite the year where I've been able to take a step back and examine with fresh eyes of how alcohol had become so firmly entrenched into my life. By hanging it up, I've lost some weight, sleep better, don't embarrass myself (as much), and don't feel as anxious/depressed. Obviously so many good things came out of giving it up.

Making it a year with no alcohol has been my own sort of finish line. Back when I was drinking a friend was doing a 'year long booze free' thing which planted the seed of the idea. Huh. I can do that too I bet. And so far I am right on track.

There have been many times where I've wanted to just have one celebratory drink. To congratulate my own engagement. To congratulate my friend getting married. These big milestones. But I've always opted for soda, or water, or juice, or whatever else. I've thought of the possibility of maybe having one alcoholic drink once I surpassed the year mark. But is it just a foolish slippery slope where moderation just goes right out the window? I mean, that's why I stopped right, because I couldn't control my moderation? But I wonder if having this year long time to reflect and extricate myself from the alcohol lifestyle gives me renewed perspective in being able to treat alcohol now like a fire? With great caution and distance. Maybe I'm thinking that this time away from booze gives me renewed perspective, but deep down I'm still the same man probably susceptible to its ill effects.

I guess this is sort of thinking aloud. Has anyone been able to temper their drinking after hanging it up for a while or is that not possible for a problem drinker and is just a fools wish?",6,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9200772047042847}"

She said that i really hurt her, said she hated me, thought i was a sleaze and that she doesnt love me anymore. All true.

Im at university at the moment and it seems impossible to maintain friendships without drinking. Or meet new people. I used to do drugs when i was younger but they affected my mental health too much. I leaned into drinking instead which i percieved to be better for me at the time. Obviously this is incorrect.

Today i had a massive brain zap. Im not sure if others have experienced this when hungover but ive had it a couple times. Ive read its to do with low seratonin but in my case could be tied to anxiety. I was in the car and my brain felt like it was being electrocuted for 3 seconds. The first time this happened it spiralled into a panic attack which led into 3 months of the worst depression of my life (during quarantine). 

I think hearing from someone that i loved that they didnt love me anymore, hated me instead, largely due to my drunken mistakes that i need to quit.

I want to be better. I need to be better for the sake of loved ones still in my life. How can I get through the time of my life when people my age are partying all the time without drinking? I imagine its going to be alot lonelier. Any words of help would be useful.

I'm a PhD candidate, a parent, etc. and the nightly wine-drinking had gotten completely out of hand over these last couple of years. It was hard for me to come to terms with the fact that I had an issue with drinking, as I wouldn't drink until my kids went to bed, I still managed to maintain a professional academic life, publish, etc. However, the 2 bottles of nightly wine and the growing anxiety hit a head about 19 days ago when I woke up massively hungover and with a full blown, horrendous panic attack. I had been slowing down for the previous month, had took a few weeks off when the anxiety got too bad to handle, but really went overboard on the wine, like 2+ bottles, and this level of panic/anxiety was unlike anything I had experienced. 

The panic came in heavy waves that day, was unlike anything I had experienced, and my anxiety levels were through the roof. I made the decision at that moment, maybe after a realization that this was indeed fucking me up in material, physical ways, that I could not continue drinking if I wanted to be around for my kids, my wife, etc.

Anyways, I am writing today, 19 days sober, to ask about the post-drinking anxiety. I hate googling symptoms because that seems to increase my anxiety; but maybe I'd just like to hear if this is normal, how long folks have experienced anxiety after quitting, etc. I have had a few really good days these past couple of weeks, and have thought, ""the anxiety is gone, I must have gotten beyond it""; but woke up today again with waves of existential dread, a little panic, etc.

Besides meds, how do folks manage this? How long does this tend to go on for? What's the worst it's been for you? What are some things that have helped folks when the post-drinking anxiety/panic starts to build? Also, does anyone know the physiology of why this happens? I can't recall ever having so much anxiety in my life.

I'm generally feeling content and clear-headed about my decision to stop drinking completely. I know that it was holding me back in all aspects of life and that I was completely under its control. Taking away my decision to drink has, after many years of struggling with moderation, made the whole conflict go away and I am already starting to really feel like a ""non drinker"" by nature. 

Over the last 2 weeks I've noticed that my cravings, while even more and more infrequent, have had a certain predictability to them. I've been seeing a therapist online to help with my drinking and the emotional stuff that contributed to it, and lately Anger has been a big theme. I don't think of myself as an angry person at all, but all of my recent cravings have had a huge component of ""Ugh! I'm so angry at ______!!! This sucks! I want a beer to feel better."" And maybe its the work I've done in therapy, or the incongruity of that particular series of thoughts, but I am almost instantaneously able to label that anger, acknowledge the craving as a product of that anger, and redirect myself into more productive ways of dealing with it (or at least not self-destructive).

I've lurked for quite a while.  Until about 15 days ago, I drank every day for at least 23 years, except for the two or three days when I was hungover so bad I couldn't drink. I didn't get drunk every day; I'd drink 2-3 glasses of wine. It got worse during covid, and then worse when family moved closer to us- we love them and we love to drink with them. 

I had a hell of a hangover a couple Saturdays ago and decided I've had enough. I'm tired of wasting my Saturdays paying for Friday night. So I downloaded the StopDrinking app and stopped buying booze.  The first three days were really hard, especially around 5pm. I thought about drinking a lot. My boss invited me for drinks but I convinced him that lunch was a better idea. And even though he had a glass of wine with lunch, I had water. On day 4 or 5, I discovered that I had a full bottle of wine in the house. 

Because I had been thinking constantly about not drinking, I followed sober hasthags on social media. I saw a post where some hippy-dippy life coach talked about ""conscientious consumption"" and that it works for some people. Emboldened by my five sober days, I thought I would try to have a glass of wine on Friday and pay attention to it- to how it made me feel, how it tasted...  Well, I probably don't have to tell you that I ended up drinking the whole bottle. But I did pay attention to the wine. It tasted kinda salty and bitter and warm, which was not as refreshing as the cold water I had been drinking. I noted (literally, I took notes on my phone) my decision-making process about having more. It was the most valuable bottle of wine I've ever drunk. 

Saturday morning, I had a mild hangover- nothing I couldn't shake with water, salt, and Tylenol. I didn't reset my counter because I just know myself. I know if I reset to zero, I would tell myself that I failed, so might as well give up. Plus I wanted to see how many days I needed to abstain in order to save one pound of fat. :) 

Each day over the next week got easier and easier. I discovered Spindrift sparkling water which is delicious. I bought and read The Sober Lush, which describes an indulgent, hedonsitic lisfestyle without booze. I spent an evening around the fire with my family which was much easier than I had feared. Friday came, family came over, I was encouraged to have a drink a couple times but once everyone else started drinking they didn't notice that I wasn't. 

Saturday, we went out for a celebratory lunch and I planned to order diet soda at the tavern, but then I noticed that there was a CBD soda, so I asked to sample that. It was really great on a hot day. The bartender told me that a lot of people mix that lemon-ginger soda with mango seltzer (with alcohol). I declined at first, but then I changed my mind and went with the half and half. It was delicious but when it came time for refills, I opted for the soda only. Somehow, a CBD soda feels more cool and indulgent than an Diet Coke. 

So anyway, that's (the highlights of) my story so far. I'm posting today because I don't really talk to anyone about not drinking and I could use some camaraderie.  My husband is still drinking, but it has slowed way down. I think that if I were to say to him, ""I didn't drink today and I feel fantastic!"" what he would hear is: ""I didn't drink today and you shouldn't either!"" which would not be helpful. He needs to get there on his own. 

I still do a habitual self-check every morning when I wake up: How do I feel today? Do I have a headache? Am I nauseous? Oh... that's right... I feel terrific. Let's go.

It was mostly a planned experiment, if I'm really honest I had been waiting for an opportunity like this to try again. Things went better than feared and worse than could be hoped for. I had built up my false narrative around missing out on drinking and telling myself I'm not the same as everyone else, I could manage my alcohol consumption and I wasn't a true alcoholic. I did manage to mostly be semi-responsible with how much I was drinking - the most qualified statement that there alone shows the dysfunction in me :D.

Compared to my former binge drinking and to other alcoholics, it wasn't *bad* but compared to the rest of society, my drinking still would probably fall into *technical binge drinking* (3 nights in a row - 3 beers, then 2 mixed-drinks and 3 beers, then 6 beers) and 14-15 drinks/week is moderate to heavy consumption. My former roommate who has seen many of my worst nights, commented that the way I was drinking was much different than what I used to do. Still, 2 out of 3 nights I drank a couple more than I had *planned* too (told myself I'd stop at 3 every time) and while I stopped myself from drinking anymore those nights as I was content with the buzz I did have plus didn't want to be hungover the next day, I know it wouldn't take long for me to lose control again at some point in the future, particularly if I was in a bad spot emotionally (which drinking would help cultivate). Didn't really have any hangovers, but the cravings were stronger than I remembered. Even after the first day of 3 beers, I remember feeling the pull the whole day and the first drink I had only *normalized* me, IYKYK. For me, the worst part was the last day of my vacation, where I had terrible insomnia and night sweats. Underneath it too is the disappointment in myself as I feel the need to confess the failure to my parents as well as just to myself as my bottom that got me sober for ~2.5 years was so bad. However, I'm also forced to admit that what I did was not just driven by the alcohol but my entire mindset at the time and it's possible for me to fall back into that state without alcohol in the mix too. 

At the very least this relapse forced me to recognize once again that the costs for me to drink are significantly higher than the average person. That may be a price I'm willing to pay in the future under the right circumstances, but I cannot live a functional normal life with regular drinking as a part of it. It's so much easier to consider 0 as a nice easy number to remember. I feel like it has also helped spark me into a motivational period where I'm more focused on doing the right things in my life again, so that was at least helpful too. My plan is I am continuing to move forward as if this was a ""small correction"" in my long term growth - I want to still see myself as mostly sober for 2.5 years (and I have been for 894 of the last 897 days) and after I've gotten past the first weekend, things have mostly returned to how I felt like in sobriety pre-drinking. Still, I'm resetting my badge on this account, as this was not exactly a small slip, and it was a conscious choice so I believe it is the right thing for me to do here in order to keep the wound from festering. Plus I feel like I'm lying and I don't like feeling like I'm hiding something, if I wanted to drink again, I'd have to be honest about it, that much I know.

I'm back after a long crappy year of drinking nearly every night. (with many years prior to that with a 18 month break inbetween) I'm making today my day one again.

I was on year last September/October when I quit for a few weeks. But that quickly went downhill. And surely I wasn't the only one that used alcohol to cover the stress, anxiety and depression when school and everything else closed last spring, right?

I'm tired of pretending everyday that I didn't consume 1/4 or even 1/3 of a handle the night before. I'm tired of being fat and unmotivated. I recently bought a CPAP machine and I'm sick of not feeling the benefits of a good night's sleep from that because the alcohol still makes me sleep like crap. 

I'm going to be 35 soon. It's hard knowing that my oldest brother passed away 1 month after his 40th birthday essentially from liver disease. That's only 5 years from now. I have kids. I have a life. This isn't who I should be. 

I'm mainly just sick of being overweight and not able to do what I want to do. I have plenty of Librium to help me through withdrawal but it's forcing myself to take it instead of drinking that is hard. 

I have to push myself though the hard times I live right now. Trying to work full time and have kids that are supposed to be virtually learning right now as their school is closed. The stress of work and doing all of my parents' shopping and helping them, our busy schedules and fighting my own depression. I've been one of those functional alcoholics.. you know, booze it up at night and get back to life in the morning, although feeling like crap. 

Sorry for this long post. I just need accountability. I need to know that there's other moms out there that struggle with this like I have. Because otherwise I just feel like a terrible, worthless, pathetic mom.",48,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9995970129966736}"

I hadn't forgotten about this incident but last night in remembering again, I FELT it all again in a way I hadn't in a long time. I started thinking about shame and humiliation and how these feelings seem to be themes in my life, whether because other people make me feel that way intentionally, or because my actions have resulted in myself making me feel that way. I felt pretty lost. And then I thought, Hey - this is how you've learned to see yourself. For whatever reasons, these are the default lenses you view your Self through, as you move through Life. Change it.

So, that. And we'll see where Change It takes me with shifting my perspective to a healthier one. Positive self talk. Identifying the positive instead of relying on there being always negative/never enough/always wrong. Sigh.

This has really been true of my life since getting sober.  I'm almost to 9 months and this is the longest sober time I have had by a lot.  Before this the longest I had was 65 days and before that 30 and both of those involved 28 day stays at an inpatient facility.  Since I've been sober I know have the clarity to solve all the things that I had caused due to my drinking.  I was able to get a job despite being fired from the last three for drinking.  I hadn't filed taxes since 2016 but now I have 2016-2019 filed after working with an accountant for about 2 weeks.  I was only able to do that because I was sober and able to follow up with him timely and find all the documents that were needed.  Now I owe a bit of money to the IRS but since I'm no longer getting drunk and blowing money all over the place I have a plan to pay it all off in just a few months.

These are things I now have sober, which I find are the key to getting my life in order:

* A clear head.  Now that I have good and consistent concentration I can follow through on tasks and do them correctly.
* Consistent memory.  Now that there aren't gaps in my memory or foggy memories I remember the things I need to do and know what is being talked about when people ask or remind me of things.
* Taking action.  Doing things like setting reminders or putting things in my calendar when I know there's a thing I need to remember or do on a certain date/time and doing it consistently has made keeping up with tasks easy.
* Multitasking.  With a clear head and good memory I can take care of multiple things at once because I have the mental bandwidth to do it.

If anything it was the opposite, talking to drunk people didn't make me envious, frankly now that I see it from the outside, it re-enforces my decision to be sober. Both nights were a success, I met new people & had a good laugh. Not drinking didn't take away from my enjoyment, if anything it added to the experience. I can remember the whole evenings, and I didn't have the hangover induced fear, worrying that I had made a complete idiot of myself!

Being sober is the gift that keeps giving, long may it last :) Good luck to everyone on their sober journey, whatever stage your at, whether you're contemplating starting or years in.

Dear SD Community,

I (F 57) have been a binge drinker (1 bottle of wine in one-2 nights every week or 2) for decades. Not horrible. Also, not normal. So over the last 5 years or so I've been stopping, limiting, and restarting. Each time I stop, I feel more happy. Each time I start again, I feel more anxious and sad and eager to stop. For me, stopping drinking after I've binged is easy. Staying stopped is the challenge. My last binge was almost 2 weeks ago (yay!). I've stopped for months at a time before. I'm keeping track with my badge so that I can get a stronger sense of when and why I develop the craving to start again. Right now, no craving.

However, my mom who is a binge drinker and who helped socialize and enable my binge drinking, just left after a great visit. Because I wasn't drinking, she was very moderate (1 small glass of wine on 2 of the 4 nights she stayed).  Even though I had told her I am not drinking anymore, she brought 3 bottles of wine with her for the visit. This is typical and in the past we would have finished all three and likely more. When she was leaving, I told her to take the wine with her. She insisted on leaving a bottle with me. ""You might want it to offer company.""

That's such a nice, normal sounding idea. I may keep it where it is in the back of a top shelf in the kitchen. I may pour it out if the appeal to drink it becomes too strong. I will not be drinking it, not today, not tonight, not tomorrow, not tomorrow night. My alcohol free life is too good.

I had planned to attempt drinking again for one night once I had done this, to basically examine my relationship with alcohol now that I had seen ""the other side"".

Thankfully, and predictably, I didn't enjoy one minute of it. I was with some friends and I spent the whole night wishing I was sober and could get back to how good my life had become without the weekly doses of brain poison.

Some of you may judge my actions, but this was something I needed to do. I had to see what I was missing, so I could fully realise how much I no longer get enjoyment from drinking. Think of it like revisiting an abusive partner you've left, to collect your belongings, say goodbye, kick them in the groin and run out the door flipping the bird back at them.

I needed it for closure.

It has been 60 hours since I was drinking, and having gone cold turkey again, I've got quite a bit of anxiety looming.

I wanted to ask, not for medical advice obviously, but for experiences. Anyone who has lapsed after such a long time sober - did you have much bother with prolonged withdrawl/PAWS symptoms happening again?

In hoping I get an easier time this time round. I only had a few glasses of wine after 3 months clean, so hopefully that counts for something. My health anxiety is playing up big time though and I'm worried as hell about seizures and the like.

Despite the fact I currently feel like an abandoned sofa, I'm tremendously glad I did what I did. Like I said, I needed closure to finally make peace with alcohol and show myself that I truly don't miss it.

Now I can finally move on, and plan a life without alcohol. Those three months gave me a taste of what it's like, and I never want to go near that shit ever again.

I mean, have you ever tasted how good breakfast is at 8am on a Saturday morning with no hangover?

Drinking hits the pause button on this monologue, and for a brief moment, the pain stops, the dopamine sedates the ego, and you take a small step towards peace. The futility of using any addiction to pause the tape, so to speak, is that when the fix wears off, the tape begins to play again; you haven't missed any of the gloomy recordings. At no point did you fast forward. You still have all the pain to go through from the moment you hit pause. Plus, you now have the additional problem of withdrawal from an addictive drug and the chemical imbalance that comes from that.""

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

My AoK this week isn't as specific as I'd like it to be. I've got a sister who I'm close with who's been having a hard time lately. I'm not sure what's going on exactly, but she's visibly really struggling, and she's very much not herself.

Part of how this is showing up is a lot of negativity and dwelling on unpleasant encounters with other people. It's been a little hard to be around, and normally I wouldn't continue to talk that much with someone who's going on like that. But something tells me that she needs to know that I'm there for her, so as much as I can, I'm trying to listen to her when she needs to vent.

She's been someone who's shown up for me in my life, and she's given me a lot of unconditional acceptance and love when I've gone through rough times. So I'm consciously spending time listening to her. I'm not really sure what else to do, except to show up for her and be there in her life. And whatever else is going on, she clearly needs support right now.

So that's my AoK for the week, just trying to show up for my sister and listen to her. How's everyone else doing, any AoK that you'd like to share?",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9636433720588684}"

But with the pill, I know that I don’t have the option, so I get through the cravings and out the other side. I already feel like a different version of myself, and just feel a huge sense of relief and freedom from the misery I’ve been living, every other day being so sick I can’t even leave my bed, hating myself, feeling completely trapped and drinking against my own will. I’m scared to death that I’ll have to go back to that life. I want this, but I absolutely know that left to my own devices, the compulsion will take over and I’ll be right back there.

After 18 years of drinking, with the last five being really bad, I finally put the bottle down 16 days ago. I'm female, 49 years old, 5'9"" and currently 230 lbs, which I consider 50lbs overweight for myself (I'm naturally a big, strong lady even when thinner). Honestly I expected at least a dramatic water weight loss in these first few weeks... even if it was just water/bloat, it would have encouraged me. But morning weigh-ins have been a fluctuation of a single pound, up and down, over 15 days! Honestly it makes me feel terrible and almost like I should give up.

I don't feel like I eat particularly poorly. A fried egg and a slice of bacon for breakfast with a diet coke and then black coffee. For lunch maybe a half grilled cheese (one slice of bread, one Velveeta Single, touch of butter to the pan just enough to brown the bread. Literally just touching the stick of butter to the pan to melt a tiny bit, not a whole ""pat"" of butter), and for dinner a baked tilapia fillet sprayed with a single spritz of aerosol olive oil, some garlic powder and salt. Plus a baked vegetable beside it, also spritzed with olive oil and salt. I don't eat cake, cookies, candy, chips, etc.

I know I could really double down and calorie restrict or fast, and I plan to move in that direction... but I've cut out 1200-1800 calories a day (12 to 18 LARGE shots?). That alone should have me losing some weight, right? Or no? I'm so discouraged and if it doesn't improve I don't know if I can stay sober. Why bother if I'm going to stay so big? Sorry just feeling really down.

But I have three brothers, two sisters-in-law, and three nieces. And none of them know.

I've been fucking up a lot recently. I've been working from home ever since COVID-19 hit. This has made it more easy to drink. And worse: it's a family business, so my drinking while I'm working can impact my brothers and their families negatively. And they've noticed. I have told all of them that I have a drinking problem, but they don't know the reason behind my drinking.

I'm transgendered. I was born male, but I've always known that I should've been born female. It was only within the past 5+ years that I found out that alcohol can relax me and make me not care that much about this problem. But, all it's doing is making things worse. I'm drinking far more than I used to and I think I'm starting to ruin some of my relationships. I'm very worried that my brother and his wife, who have three daughters, are going to cut me off if I don't fix things.

So I've decided that I'm going to tell all of them that I'm transgendered. I'm stressing myself out all the time keeping it bottled inside. Then I drink to make the stress go away. Then I do things that I end up regretting.

I've decided that I'm going to send out a long e-mail, because I don't think I can face them when I tell them this. I'm going to tell them my history of knowing I'm transgendered, but feeling like I couldn't do anything about it.

In the past I have partied and done drugs with cousins, Aunts and Uncles, even my sister. Obviously this led to my first experiences with alcohol and drugs to start at a very young age. I remember drinking vodka every morning before school in 10th grade, alcohol provided to me by my mother. I grew up surrounded in this world of addiction that I never even knew I had a problem nor did I know it was something I could escape from. 

But I did it. I clawed my way out of the depths of depression and a slew of addiction and constant self abuse. I stopped drowning out my fears and trauma with bottle upon bottle of beer.

I frequently go through periods of sobriety but after a few weeks I always find myself getting ambivalent about it and thinking something like, “Meh, being sober isn’t all that different and it’s simply civilized to have a glass of wine or two with dinner.” Next thing I know I’m back in a cycle of drinking half a bottle of wine more or less every night, waking up feeling hazy and mildly ill, and dealing with the extreme cognitive dissonance and unease that comes with “enjoying” the relaxation and social comfort on one level but knowing on a deeper and more fundamental level that I’m not doing what’s right for my health and psyche. 

A week ago I got sick of the cycle and decided to stop drinking again. I started reading posts here again, read Alan Carr’s book, started listening to some sobriety podcasts, and got in touch with some sober friends to talk. It has now been eight days since my last drink and (as usual), I’m feeling like a new person. 

This past week I went on an eight mile run, 35 mile bike ride w/ 3500 feet of elevation gain, read books instead of scrolling through Twitter in a tipsy stupor, was super productive at work, and generally just felt more in touch with myself and all of my senses. Jokes are funnier, food tastes better, music sounds better. 

Cut to last night: My family was going to a picnic with friends and I was staying home. All afternoon I was having a subtle but profound internal struggle with myself that went something like: “Hm, maybe I’ll just have a glass of wine with dinner tonight ... I know I want to be sober but maybe I should just have a glass of wine, that way I can see how bad I feel and really commit. Plus I deserve it after such a good week and going on a long bike ride today.” (so irrational thinking about it out now but that’s where I was). 

I went into the kitchen, looked at the nice bottle of red wine open on the counter, walked over to the mini-fridge where we keep seltzers and opened it, then walked back to the bottle of wine. Then I went and stood at the kitchen counter and reflected on who I want to be (easy = the person I am when I’m sober) and “played the tape forward” — even if I only had one glass and woke up feeling fine, this would likely put me right back into my tried and true and exhausting cycle. So I gritted my teeth, walked over to the mini-fridge and grabbed a CBD seltzer. Then I ate my dinner, drank the seltzer, and watched a few episodes of the new season of Selling Sunset. I also texted my partner (who is sober) and she gave me the final boost of motivation I needed to push through and commit to the decision. 

This is a really huge deal for me. I think it’s safe to say I’ve _never_ resisted a craving that big before — especially in a situation where it would have been so, so, so easy to take a drink. It felt like I was painfully carving a new synapse in my brain and going against all of my well-worn “fuck it one drink won’t hurt” synapses. So I wanted to share. On the surface, it’s just one tiny choice and one night, but internally I have fireworks going off and celebratory music playing in my brain because it feels like a really profound step.

During that time there have been periods where I gloss over posts in my feed, unwilling to engage with the thought that I have a problem. There have been periods where I’ve read so many posts, but haven’t had the strength to change my behaviour, and finally, there is now. 

I made this account today because I’m willing to commit to my sobriety. I have realized that if I’m going to be successful, I need to actively engage in my recovery. My friends and family have no idea how much alcohol has been impacting my life. It consumes so much of my headspace and has had profound impacts on my mental and physical health.

I haven’t hit an outward rock bottom. I’m 29, I’m single, no one blinks an eye if I’m out with friends having some drinks over dinner, or at the beach knocking back a few on a sunny day. What they don’t see is the constant battle I face internally. The lonely nights spent drunk and hating myself. The days where I crack a drink alone at 10 am to numb my loneliness. I hate who I am when I drink. I hate the way I always want another once I’ve had one. I hate how any occasion - a celebration, a struggle, a sunny day or a rainy day - has become an occasion to drink.

I’m tired of arguing with myself about whether or not to drink. I’m tired of knowing that the booze is taking a toll on my physical health. That it’s a core contributor to my unrelenting anxiety, my depression, my exhaustion. I’m tired of consuming a poison that makes it hard to be me.

The me who loves yoga, who loves to run, who spends as much time as possible outdoors with her dog. The me that is passionate about her work and strives to achieve more in this life. The me who is eager to grow and heal from my past traumas. 

Alcohol makes me lazy, tired and sick. It makes me claim not to care, to be ok, when I care so, so much, and I’m really not ok at all. I. Am. Done.

Today is my day 5. I’ve told most of my friends I’m taking a break until the end of September. They know I tend to take periodic months off drinking. What they don’t realize is that I’ve always wanted those single months to be longer. That I feel exponentially better on every level when I’m sober. 

So, if you’re still reading this long winded post, thank you for being here. This community is a source of constant inspiration to remind me that a sober life is not only possible, but rewarding.

I went to my dermatologist about 2 years ago because I was getting horrible cystic acne breakouts right before my wedding. She wanted to put me on Accutane then but after my blood work came back, big surprise my liver enzymes were way too high and both she and my primary said hell no. We went with some oral antibiotics but they’ve been less than super effective.

Two years and 200+ alcohol free days later she had me do the blood work again (I posted my results about a month ago) and most of my numbers were back in a normal range, so she cleared me to start it. I was hoping my skin issues would clear up when I quit, but at this point I’m desperate for anything that’ll work because it seems like with or without alcohol, my 31 year old skin still thinks it’s a teen boy going through puberty.

I’m curious if anyone has been in a similar boat, when they had blood work repeated if their numbers shot back up. I’m a little worried that my liver has healed some but might go crazy reintroducing something hard on it. I’m only a few days into starting it on a low dose. So far no weird side effects, and I don’t plan on drinking (although my day counter is off from having a few drinks on vacation... a story for another time, but it made me feel like trash and I’m not looking back on doing it again).

I know it sounds odd, but drinking The milk first kept me from drinking alcohol that evening... I would get sick and throw up if I did.   Although at the time I lacked control, this would buy me another day ... I wasn’t thinking about fighting cravings, I was calmer... I would repeat this a bunch of times until I started building up the number of days sober.

I had been thinking about that day for over a week, and you know what?  For the most part I had absolutely no worries about how the event would affect my new alcohol free life. Sure, there were moments where I questioned whether I would be strong enough, but my conscious voice is so much stronger than the unconscious at present!

I helped the best man sort lifts and times, provided a series of interactive drinking games to in order to shake off the unfamiliarity between different attendees, and offered myself as designated driver for the night. 

And honestly? It was amazing! Not once did I feel awkward or like I was missing out because I wasn't drinking. The games were a great laugh and I was engaged in the conversations just as I would have done drunk.

But I was more present. More alert. More able to appreciate the enjoyment of the day, the camaraderie and good conversation between friends.

And as the day moved to night, and speech became slurred, and people started to engage in what they thought were those deep, meaningful conversations that you think you have when you're inebriated, I could see the incoherence and the lack of ability to articulate properly. And I was grateful that I wasn't in that state. I wasn't envious. I didn't miss drink. I was content.

So yeah, I'm taking that as a big milestone and yesterday I woke up hangover free, at a reasonable time, and got loads done!

I’ve had my moments of craving, for sure, but I’ve found it relatively easy to dip into my sobriety toolbox and overcome the urges. 

Last week, though, was family vacation. I come from a family of very heavy, but highly functioning drinkers. Everyone is gainfully employed, some have kids, all are partnered off. I am most certainly the odd man out for quitting drinking, and most of my family think I did it needlessly. Even though I was blacking our multiple times per week, they still don’t think I had a problem. Because of this, they don’t respect my sobriety. I spent a week watching them spend their days sipping beer and white wine and their nights getting absolutely shithoused. I dealt with them asking me to go on beer runs because I was the one who could drive. I dealt with them waking me and my toddler up every night as they stumbled their way to bed. I dealt with all of it.

Then we got home, and I find out that the whole family thinks I was rude over the course of the week. I’m overly sensitive and uptight. I’m judgmental, and I need to calm down.

I know this is their own insecurities/guilt/addictions talking. But I’m so deeply hurt by it. I love my family, and I’m incredibly close to them, and they are the only people I allow myself to see during coronavirus and quarantine, so right now, they are my only community. But I feel ostracized now. And I feel so fucking lonely and misunderstood. I could try to talk to them but I feel like anything I saw will fall on deaf ears.

I didn’t drink. I told myself drinking again simply to tolerate my drunk family is not the solution. I’m home and proud of myself now. I just wanted to share.

Last weekend, my wife had a pretty bad bike crash and ended up in the ER. The X-rays confirmed the worst — a broken hip. This was devastating news for us. We’re both very active and had lots of plans in the months ahead. All that changed instantly.

This happened on Saturday morning. But, she couldn’t have surgery till Sunday morning. And, I wasn’t allowed to stay with her Saturday night because of COVID. So, that night, I went home and got blasted. One last blowout before the massive lifestyle change.

Surgery was successful and we were back home Sunday night, adjusting to the new norm. I just couldn’t drink. She needed me. All of me, the all-day, all-night sober me. So, I stopped drinking.

And interestingly, it hasn’t been that difficult. I haven’t really missed it. Our evenings are spent with me cooking, cleaning, and helping her. Then we watch shows and go to bed early. The new routine has been helpful in keeping my thoughts focused on something other than drinking.

And holy crap, the sleep has been amazing. Deep and dreamy, and quite restful. And waking up clear headed, ready to help has been nice as well. I’m enjoying the sober nights and hangover-free mornings.

I’m hoping it doesn’t take more pain and heartache to stay sober.

But everything went wrong.  First, both of us forgot to bring our main fishing rods.  Next week up with our friends to get the boats, but we didn't have enough straps.  In the process of attaching one of the boats to my friends car we couldn't get the hood closed.  I thought it would be a great idea to jump on the hood to close it.  Now the trip hasn't even really started and I'm already out $100-500 to repair/replace the hood.  Then we finally get the boats to the launch point.  My friend goes back to get some ice and the other boat.  He comes back with the ice, but no boat.  So he has to make another trip while we all wait.  Finally, after all of this we finally get on the water, and it's great.  For about an hour.  Then we realize that the guy who parked his car at our exit left his key at our launch point.  Alright, no big deal we'll figure it out when we get there.  Then it starts to rain.  Then it rains harder.  At this point we realize that one of our group has not put his clothes in a water proof bag.  Everything he has is soaked.  We decide to bail rather than deal with all of our wet stuff.  At this point while we are waiting I discover that my $40 water resistant phone battery has spent 10 minutes completely submerged with its port open.  Its broken.  We finally get home and this travesty of a trip ends.

2) You drank until you vomited, then continued going. Sometimes after you’d already vomited twice, or after you’d vomited up blood.
3) You’ve mixed alcohol with many medications in which it was dangerous to your well-being—sometimes even life—to do so.
4) You drank until you blacked out on more than one occasion. Browning out was a regular occurrence.
5) You moved on to hard drugs for a brief period because it seemed like a good idea when you were drunk.
6) You’ve slept with countless strangers, many of whom you never would have sober. You’ve been taken advantage of while drunk, and in such a state of consciousness that you were not fully awake for the entire act. Not to mention the countless times you had some form of unprotected sex and then had to worry about testing positive for HIV for weeks on end. Think you want to drink now? Trust me, you’ll want to thousands of times more then.
7) You ignored blatant red flags in regards to who you were hanging out with because you were always fucked up around them.
8) You’ve hurt those closest to you because of things you’ve said and / or done while drinking.
9) You’ve sabotaged potential friendships because of your behavior while drunk.
10) You’ve drank alone, and honestly some times you really liked it even if you’d complain about how boring it was to your friends.
11) You drank until you had a mental breakdown on way too many occasions.
12) You’ve accidentally made a scene on multiple occasions because of the breakdowns you’ve had while drunk.
13) You spent hours walking around trying to get to some random stranger’s house to hook up, just so you didn’t have to pay for a Lyft. But you weren’t able to make it there before your phone died, and instead spent a great deal of time trying to get back to your dorm at 4:30am in a relatively dangerous metropolitan area—all without navigation.
14) You were obsessive with your alcohol supply—the lower it got, the more existential dread you felt.
15) You’ve drank when you were sick, which only exacerbated the illness when you woke up the next day.
16) You’ve put yourself in sketchy situations to obtain your alcohol. Can’t buy it legally because you’re underage? Just go to one of the worst parts of town, unarmed, by yourself in order to purchase your alcohol from a shop that won’t ID you.
17) Almost like clockwork, at some point during a night you were drinking, you’d spend lots of time researching alcoholism to try and figure out if you had a problem. You were aware that you were using alcohol inappropriately even when you were drunk. Do you really want to go back to that?
18) You paid double the price of an already overpriced handle of liquor, simply so you could get someone to go buy it for you for your 20th birthday.

I woke up yesterday morning with the biggest emotional hangover ever, nothing like a chemically toxic hangover, but wow what a low feeling I had. I also felt a massive feeling of bereavement, as if I'd lost a best friend (alcohol), when in honesty, its never been my friend. Anyway, last night we were out with friends for food, which was a lovely evening, yes the other 5 people were drinking alcohol and I stayed sober. We were home for 9.30pm which is also a first for a Saturday night. I've woken up this morning feeling fresh and positive a very proud of myself for being able to navigate my way through the weekend without drink. I'm a alcoholic and know I can't drink alcohol as it is more toxic to me than most of my friends.  I've joined AA and been to 5 meetings already, which is helping massively.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

 “I can shake off everything as I write; my sorrows disappear, my courage is reborn.” Anne Frank

 “I don’t journal to ‘be productive'. I don’t do it to find great ideas or to put down prose I can later publish. The pages aren’t intended for anyone but me. It’s the most cost-effective therapy I’ve ever found.” Tim Ferriss

 “The starting point of discovering who you are, your gifts, your talents, your dreams, is being comfortable with yourself. Spend time alone. Write in a journal.” Robin Sharma

 “I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read on the train.” Oscar Wilde

Suggested benefits of journaling include:

Stress management, problem solving, positive self-talk, understanding yourself, processing events, decision-making, improved memory, more creativity, setting and achieving goals, gaining control of emotions, improved mental health, improved physical health and better sleep.

It seems like a no brainer but I have never been good at writing a diary at the end of the day, as it's when I usually have the least energy. Last year, I started a programme which suggested 'morning pages': three A4 sides on any topic without stopping or thinking too much. 

I have put the programme to one side for now (which I'll be talking about later in the week) but the journaling has been transformative for me and I wake up early every day to do it with pleasure. 

When it comes to sobriety, journaling has been invaluable. When I write I am proactively dealing with stressors, anything that might be a trigger to drink and then with any cravings that arise. 

I've always got somewhere to turn when I need to get something off my chest and, while talking to others is great, it's good to be able to vent and feel self-sufficient at the same time. It is one of the main tools that has helped make the last 90+ days easier. 

If the Dear Diary method doesn't work for you either, there are other options like apps, 'a line a day', and five-year journals showing a comparison to previous years. 

Do you journal? What sort of journaling helps you in your sobriety?

I’ve been sober for two weeks as of today. A friend I don’t get to see often and her sister made a last minute decision to stop by my apartment after a house party they went to. They were pretty drunk already and brought beer over.  On the way in they also struck up a conversation with one of the guys in my neighborhood who happens to drink a lot. He’s a very nice guy, he’s just pretty much always wasted. He somehow wound up joining them, and they were all at my place. I’ve been social distancing pretty seriously, I thought it would just be my friend stopping by alone tonight. I was a bit stressed about that aspect of things, then really stressed by being surrounded by loud drunk people, who were talking about drugs (they wanted cocaine, neighborhood guy could only offer ecstasy). 

Normally I would have just had a drink to ease my nerves about people being in my apartment unexpectedly, but not having that crutch I found myself just being really irritable and kind of rude (lots of asking them to shh, being really snappy about not wanting to talk about drugs). I think I surprised my friend’s sister with my attitude, she definitely noticed and wanted to leave pretty quickly, and I’m feeling bad because she’s only ever seen me drinking/drunk, when I’ve always been pretty bubbly and nice. 

I just feel like I want to be able to be in these triggering situations without later wanting to cry about how badly I handled it. I know hanging out with drunk people trying to get cocaine wouldn’t be great for anyone in early sobriety, but I’m just feeling embarrassed that I don’t know how to be calm and nice when sober, I just went straight to being very tense and unpleasant. I’m hoping that my “real” personality isn’t always this extremely uptight person who shushes people and acts judgmental. I know if I had been drinking too I would have been a lot more fun for them to be around.

Anyways I’m sorry if this is a stupid post, I’m not sure if it even makes sense to anyone else, I just felt like I needed to vent D:",10,{'distancing': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975128173828125}"

I’m just going to start off by saying that Iam 34 year old guy who lives alone. And the 13 or so years alone I have struggled to keep a sober streak. I also suffer from OCD/ anxiety/social anxiety, so drinking allowed me to break away for a short time from my loneliness. I’m also extremely scared about getting into a relationship also ugh. At any rate, I’m almost 3 days now, which I’ve done before, but weekends are obviously rough and I could use any tips about how an isolated person can kick this poison. I’m just so sick of acting like a jackass to family, friends, bartenders, and bar patrons. So sick of fighting ppl and embarrassing myself in public and in private. People have told me I’m a loose cannon/crazy and I’m so sick of these labels. But it’s probably deserved as Alcohol has gotten me in many physical  altercations that have laid me up for days/weeks.The embarrassment is really endless and it began a long time ago in my teens, hell I don’t know how many times I’ve gotten punched and probably concussed by drunken fueled fights and melees.I run a sole-proprietor business now and I’m basically 50,000 in the hole now. The benders and binges have caught up to me both financially,spiritually, everything. I’m alone,scared, but I’m hoping discarding this life destroying habit will finally make me progress somewhere in life. I don’t know. I just hope it get better someday. I try to talk to my parents about it, but their in denial maybe I don’t know. Also, they’re getting up there in age and I don’t like bothering them. So if anyone can give me a few tips on how to deal with it alone that’d be helpful. I hope I was clear, I hate typing on the cellphone . :) I just hope I make it to 12 when the bar down the street closes..

I spent all day cooking which is very meditative and came across a bizarre struggle I have with even the idea of being sober.

I've always fancied myself an artist ( not a good one but still) and the art I both create and that inspires me the most is almost always centered around the macabre and dark side of humanity. I find beauty in the disgusting, in the violent and gross, in darkness, pain, and misery. 

This is also the headspace I live in. I've spent most of my life consumed with despair, leaning my identity on pain and darkness, consumed with self-castigation and self-abuse. It's been my identity so long I don't know anything else. With this comes the ""glamour"" of addiction. I identified with the Bukowski's, the Cobain's, the damaged artists consumed by pain and anger so great they felt compelled to let it out. But those stories almost never end well. 

Sobriety has freaked me out, because without my addiction and pain what will I be? I feel frightened that if I accept peace, happiness, and joy that I will become an airhead, one of those people that close their eyes and ears to reality and finds themselves obsessed with overly positive empty platitudes, and my artistic inspiration will disappear. 

But that's a lie. I'll never forget pain, I'll never end up like that because it's not who I am. I don't need alcohol to access those feelings, they will always be with me. It only makes me wallow, and I end up so sloppy I wouldn't be able to create anything anyways, at least like 90% of the time.

I was sea kayaking with a group, exploring sea caves and paddling around big rocks that rose above the sea level. The water was mostly calm, but occasional big waves came by, and I had to be sure to keep my balance so I wouldn't tip into the ocean. As I was out there, living in the moment and rising/falling with the water, I realized: 

* The waves are like depression or anxiety. They can be scary to feel and when you're sitting in your kayak you're not always sure when they're going to stop... there's a fear of tipping into the water and drowning or getting smashed against rocks.
* Drinking is like choosing to leave the kayak to sit on the rocky islands. There, you can escape the waves! You could even put an eye mask on and pretend the waves don't exist anymore. But, the islands are not connected to the mainland, where the things you need to live and be healthy (e.g. food, drinking water, shelter) are located. The longer you stay on the island, the weaker and sicker your body becomes. And big waves can still jump onto the rocky island and hit you. You are not safe from the real storms out there. 
* The only way to live, to nourish your body, is to learn to balance on the waves. You can't stop the waves. They will always come. But if you can learn to ride them out, you can paddle back to shore. And to be honest, the scenery is more dynamic and enjoyable from the kayak than it is from the rock. 

This analogy and experience helped me to solidify the reasons I wanted to quit drinking. I choose life, I choose my health. I can learn to ride the waves. And with one paddle stroke at a time, one after the other, I can enrich my life with the splendor of experience. IWNDWYT!",7,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9895139932632446}"

I have had at least one drink a day for over 10 years and have averaged maybe 6 for the last year. COVID and living alone has kicked that number up to 12 a day and more on some days in response to what i am sure is some form of depression or anxiety. I will look at the clock and realize its 1pm and i have another 10 hours of isolation in the house and my escape is to drink, and it works. I am a highly functioning alcoholic and can do my job at a high level and attend video calls many drinks in and nobody is any wiser.

I fell into a vicious cycle two weeks ago that terrified me. I had a VERY heavy night of drinking and woke up the next morning and had horrifying withdrawal symptoms like shaking, paralyzing anxiety and complete inability to focus. I had more to drink to dampen the reaction and since then its been 24/7 drinking to keep from experiencing withdrawal. Its made me feel like the hooks are in so deep that if i stop i'll have an anxiety attack or worse. 

I've sworn of hard alochol and slowly started tapering as of 5 days ago. I had 12 5% white claws on day 1, 10 day 2, 8 day 3, 6 day 4 and finally 4 yesterday. Its been tough but today has been really hard. I woke up just staring at the ceiling with my body yelling that i need a drink. I have 3.5% white claw on standby in the event that i feel like its medically unsafe to continue, but 5 hours into the day and hanging but dang is it hard.

I haven't enjoyed anything in life that i used to love in a year and i have to turn this around or wind up in an early grave. Its no way to live. While i can't say i feel clear headed, i feel more clear headed. This is silly but i went outside this morning and picked up the scent of charcoal in the wind. It reminded me of summer bbqs with my family and for a second the memory gave me happiness that i havent had in too long. My plan is to journal once an hour, make myself do activities and break the day up into small chunks at a time that i can make it through.

I've been following this for a couple of weeks and now and decided it's time to stop lurking and start sharing. I went through outpatient treatment almost 3 years ago and had 4-1/2 months of sobriety during and after that. Then I thought, ""what if I just try drinking this once - forgot what it feels like..."" Sound familiar? So of course it wasn't long until I was drinking daily yet again.

Fast forward to now. I've tried MANY times to become sober, to no avail and it's essentially because I've finally admitted to myself that I never really wanted to be sober at all. I just knew I should be but didn't really want it. I've never been one who drinks during the day, only evenings, so I'm a functional alcoholic, so what's the harm right? Well, the harm is it cost me my marriage and very definitely affected my relationships with my 2 children, who are now adults.

I live alone and with the pandemic still raging, loneliness is a HUGE trigger for me. The difference now is that I FINALLY feel like I WANT to be sober, and I want it for me, not for anyone or anything else.

But this time feels completely different....so cautiously optomistic. Its been a minutes since i had this much time. 

Two things that were really bumming me out after day 3 were 
1) Sharp kidney pains at times (and of course i thought i was going to die) .  Read on here, plenty of water and cranberry juice mightt  help.
2) bloating - my whole body  felt like i ate several family size bags of tortilla chips with extra salt.  I was just uncofortable.  I read on here that about a tablespoon of apple cider vinager and about the same of lemon juice , together helps with this.

OK, I am not a doctor....but based on the above.  I came up with this concoction, and I think it hellped me after a couple of days...but it could be just the number of days since last drink?

1) Can of sparkling soda of your choiice (i go with something called Soliel lime flavor, it has a little cafiene in it)
2) Spoon full of apple cider vinigar (GROSS)
3) Spoon Full of  Lemon Juice (the squeese botthe kind, fresh may work the same or better, just what I tried)
      Measurements o n these spoon measurements are never precise by tme
4) 100% pure crandberry juice (not crandberry ""drink"" or ""punch""  ad this to taste

I mix all this in a hiking type drink bottle that keeps things cold, - its 24 oz.   which seems to be just about right. just once a day

I am not going to say it's delicious...it can kind of taste like kombacha (i don't love that stuff).

This seems to be helping with both bloating and kidney pain.  Even if it's just a placebo effect, at least you are hydrating right?

returning to the Kidney (guessing) / lovwer back  on the right side pain.   I found it to be the worst when I first woke up, but if I went for a hike...it would deminish significantly for a while.  I havea been hiking about 3 miles a day.  I don't actually have that pain anymore...it just feels slightly wierd....but it's is deminishing too.

This time, actually the last three days.   Besides exxersize, I have been concentrating on doing nothing...and being at pieece with that.    Many times when I would stop...my mind would race with alll the stuff I needed to get done and I am way behind and ""hurry hurry hurry (i have ADHD to add to the mind race)   That would cause anxiety and a reason to drink.   My mind still races at times but I try to breathe it out, and be more patient with myself...and live in the emediate second until it passes 


OH...benefits so far
Skin is looking better
Face and belly looking closer to one family size bag of tortilla chips vs 5....and way more confortable   And I feel much lighter when I hike. more athletic
Mind is less racey, but I still am cloudy...kind of like an air head.  although maybe i have always been an airhead and didn't' know because I was drunk.

Well thanks for reading that word salad i just wasted a part of your day with.    I am not in any position to give advice, i thought I would share what is working for me so far.

Social anxiety disorder is definitely a real disorder, and I don't want to discount that. For people who think they have real disorders, disorders they may have been using alcohol to mitigate, it's better to consult a professional than to self diagnose and self medicate. But I'd also like people to consider that a lot of the time what is thought of as social anxiety disorder it's really an unfair comparison to an idealized version of particularly outgoing person. I think a lot of this ideal person comes from advertising and from the media.

There is nothing wrong with coming into a bar as a sober person and feeling uncomfortable. there's nothing wrong with going into any situation with a bunch of drunk strangers and feeling uncomfortable. Evolutionarily speaking that's how we should feel. before we start thinking there's something wrong with us about feeling uncomfortable in a particular situation, maybe it's time we paid attention to that feeling and asked ourselves what about the situation makes us uncomfortable.

Anyway, while all of us should be consulting people with more experience and knowledge about some of the strange feelings that go along with sobering up after years of drinking, I want to suggest many of these people who feel like there's something wrong with them as a sober person hang out in situations with people they love and trust...if the social anxiety persist in those situations, talk to a professional, or maybe it's actually just that you aren't happy in that situation and need to find something that does make you happy...something that many of us had forgotten how to do as for years, we just grabbed a bottle instead.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9920908212661743}"

I had my first real drink when I was in 8th grade; just some champagne on New Years. I remember thinking that adults had made alcohol sound gross, but this stuff wasn’t too bad. A year later a friend offered me my first shot of Captain Morgan. I took two back to back with no chaser; from that moment on, I knew this was going to be a problem. Friends were always talking about how they couldn't drink certain things, whether it was from throwing it up or because they just couldn’t stomach it. I never had that problem. I would drink anything and everything, from PBR to a concoction of mouthwash/what was under a friend’s kitchen counter. I never met alcohol I wouldn’t knock back. By the time I had hit senior year of high school, I knew all the tricks of the trade. I knew Everclear would get me where I wanted to go the fastest. I knew if I chewed gum during school right after drinking none of my teachers would know. I knew that ultimately even if I got caught, nothing that bad would really happen to me. The thought of having a drinking problem seemed impossible; no one is an alcoholic before they’re legally able to drink, I told myself. 

When I got to college, I grew even stronger in my belief that I didn’t have a problem. Despite often drinking more than everyone around me, I almost never threw up, hardly ever blacked out, and generally was never out of control. I later learned that my grandfather had a drinking problem; both he and my dad had ridiculously high tolerances. To this day my dad has to take double the dose of Tylenol when he has a headache. As time went on, I just drank more and more often. My last semester of college I drank every single day, often till I blacked out. I was hungover or drunk 90% of the time. If a friend asked me to come over, I would pour a mixed drink into my water bottle so I could drink on the drive over to their place. I’d go home between classes and take a few shots while I was there. Since it was college, no one questioned that I would do things like not eat all day so that I could get fucked up faster, or that I would get drunk and get in screaming matches I would never remember. We used to go to a thing called “beer towers” at a local bar, which was essentially a tower of 8.5 beers for $2.50. It started out drinking one each, but then it became 2-3 towers per person every time we went. This was the type of thing we would do every single day.

When I graduated, the habit followed me. I’d often sit in my room at my moms house, drinking because I was so depressed. There was one time I woke up on my floor surrounded by my own vomit, with no memory of driving my moms company car home the night before. I moved to a new city, thinking that it would make me happy. At my new job, the drinking culture was like college again. There a a beer fridge that was stocked, and every Friday at 4:30 we all started chugging brews. We frequently had happy hours paid for by the boss, and it wasn’t uncommon for me to have 4 or 5 drinks before heading home to drink whatever was in my fridge. I started leaving on my lunch break to get wine and pour it into a soda cup, or stealing beers from the fridge and drinking them in the bathroom. I’d often keep a bottle of Everclear at my house; towards the end, I couldn’t even taste the alcohol in my drinks anymore. 

Fast forward to my birthday this year. I started to realize that I didn’t even know who I was anymore. I had gained a lot of weight, I had lost my job due to drinking, and I was close to losing my best friend for constantly picking drunk fights with him. I was depressed, I didn’t believe in myself, and I felt sick almost every single day from being so hungover all the time. I was lucky enough to find a new job, but I knew I had to change something about the way I was living. My only way out for close to 11 years was drinking. Whether I was happy, sad, cooking, watching tv, anything, I needed to drink. Sometimes I got so drunk I thought how much better it would all be if I just killed myself. My emotions would get so overwhelming that I couldn’t take it, so I had to have a drink to make everything go away. 

I had to walk away from it all. I told all my friends that I wasn’t going to drink anymore. Since then I have relapsed a couple of times. But now here I am, 3 months sober and counting. All those voices that told me my whole life I wasn’t good enough have started to fade. The self doubt I always thought would be there forever is mostly gone.I have never been so proud of the person I am. I truly love myself and my journey. I know it’s not over. Sitting and watching baseball without a cold beer feels wrong. I miss being able to share a whiskey with my dad. But the calm, the peace, and self love I have found is 100% worth it. I get up early to go to the gym; something I was never capable of before. I wake up feeling good. I’m not constantly puking and damaging my teeth. I stopped losing my ID, money, etc. I feel free from a substance that I thought would control me for the rest of my life. I never ever believed I would get to where I am today. So if you’re struggling, take it from me; it can be done. IWNDWYT.",152,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9069401025772095}"

It’s been an interesting and positive transition for sure. At the beginning of the year i kept telling myself that I needed to slow down. After a couple blackout events in 2018, I scared myself and family pretty good. I was always the friend that everyone could count on for a good time and it was catching up to me - physically, mentally, and financially. 

At first, I was just going to cut back. But then, my doctor put me on a medication (accutane) in which you *cannot* drink on, so it was cut and dry, that from that point i could not drink for the duration of the treatment. I emptied all of the alcohol from my apartment and didn’t look back. Then COVID hit shortly after. Friends wanted me to join for zoom happy hours, which I would, but was the only sober one. There was ridicule, but then they understood that I couldn’t cause of my medication. 

Fast forward 6 months and now they’re asking me when I’ll be able to drink again, and I keep telling them that version of me died during quarantine. Some don’t believe me. Some do. But if feels great knowing that i was able to pull this off, albeit I knew I had to remain sober or have the doctor scold me and take me off the pills that have cleared my skin up. 

I’m glad I quit when I did, I can’t imagine what I would have done during this quarantine.

So I stopped drinking 2 months ago. I’ve always drank as a way to loosen up / kill social anxiety, but just got sick of the hangovers and excessive anxiety that came the day after drinking. 
Anyway the whole not drinking thing has been going well. I feel better day to day and have hung out with friends and family and had a good time the past few months...but I went to a wedding this week and MAN it was a struggle. Just couldn’t relax. Was really in my head about being quiet / how I was coming off/ just very anxious....and it was just not an enjoyable experience. Granted I was there for almost 12 hours, which is a marathon but it’s making me question if it’s worth it to be sober and miserable at these events. 

On a positive note, I’m not hungover today. Old me would’ve gotten drunk / possibly hammered and be hurting today, so that’s good. 

But I’m just really down today and was all day yesterday because of my “performance” at the wedding. I thought I had this figured out and I clearly don’t. Just sick of the struggle. Feels like even when I try to do the right thing (stay sober, see a therapist for anxiety), it just is always a struggle.

I am doing absolutely great outside the fact that I’m drinking, great job, great hobbies, great partner, but my body is starting to tell me “that’s enough”.

I am hundred percent sure that it’s a matter of time. I will be honest. I feel bored when not drinking. I have a lot to do - cycling, videography, photography, playing computer games, I love reading, love films, I even have a podcast, yet I feel bored, when I am not drinking outside work. I do all those things either hangover or the next day after being hangover - the only gap of soberness that I have. The next day I feel that I need to go out again, go find “adventures” go get shitwasted and have “deep” talks with my friends. I know that I can do that sober, but I don’t let myself relax when I am.

During the week I was getting excited, but now it’s here I’m thinking: bleh.  Maybe it’s because I woke up early after yet another night of not sleeping well.

The next state over from us where our happy place beach is located has “banned” us unless we get a Covid test, and we are generally unwelcome there, and I cannot afford to have my tires slashed because of my car’s license plate. Hubby has resumed golfing at sunrise on Saturdays. We’ve not vacationed since last September, and it wasn’t even a full week off.

Then went home and decided to treat myself to a pizza (instead of beer) but my favorite pizza shop wasnt delivering tonight! But I didnt give in, I ordered from a different shop, still didn't drink.

Also felt bad because I had plans with friends to go out tonight, but ended up canceling just because I feel like shit physically and also mentally from this draining day/date last night. 

But all in all, its day 15, and I didnt drink, and IWNDWYT. Thanks for letting me rant. Tomorrows a new day!

Edit: also feel I should clarify I live in China where were done social distancing and everything's open for the most part so it's completely fine to go out on dates and gatherings.

Every day feels like it’s sucking just a little bit more life out of me.

I worked all night at the restaurant serving, closed up as manager. My boss only said one fucked up mean thing to me tonight, it was a success. A bachelor party brought in a blow up sex doll and that was pretty funny. I did my paperwork in the basement while everyone partied upstairs. Our state closes the bars at midnight now, all of the bars are closed by the time they get off. So they buy extra drinks to have after they finish their work. I don’t mind. I don’t partake but I enjoy the company I do get. 

I’ve been married a little over a month. Alcohol is ruining my marriage. Although I no longer drink, my husband does. I’ve asked him to cut back and it only seems to get worse. Because of this, I’ve told him if he comes home drunk again (third time this week now) he wouldn’t be able to stay at the house. 


Tonight he was supposed to leave the car at my work for me. We share a car, we both live super close to work. He had text me and told me that he left the car. 2:30 am rolls around and I’m saying goodnight to my drunk staff, head to the parking lot and behold, the car is missing. I thought it had gotten towed somehow or stolen. I’m calling my husband, he picks up on the fourth try. He’s been asleep, he’s drunk. 

He promises he dropped the car off. So the least drunk homie friend co worker drops me off at home, we have another co worker friend in the car. We pull up, and my car is out front. 

So not only did he drink when I asked him not to, he drove drunk again. I’ve told him I would leave if he drove drunk, but I haven’t left and he keeps doing it. It’s like some sick song and dance; he drinks, he drives, I yell, I cry. We do it again next week. 

We got into a huge fight. He swears I drove the car home, I call the friends to confirm I got dropped off. He called one of them a dick. Proceeds to tell me he came and got the car because I was taking too long. He left me stranded at work thinking our car was in the lot. Our neighborhood is kinda sketch at night, I’m a good 15 minute walk home into the sketchiest part. We live in the shittier part of the neighborhood because our neighborhood got gentrified thanks to HGTV. But our rent is cheap and our house is left alone by the scary streetwalkers. As a woman, I won’t walk home at night. 

I kicked him out for putting himself in danger, endangering me when he’s supposed to protect me, lying, and then being an asshole to me for being upset. 

Deep down, I know he isn’t like that. I know he’s sweet and wouldn’t want me to ever walk home alone at 2:30 in the morning. He’s intelligent and loyal, beautiful inside and out. But when he drinks, he’s every dickhole I’ve dealt with at work who I’m somewhat nice to for money. Every dick I’ve had to kick out of the bar. Every turd who tells me I didn’t pour enough alcohol in their shot, they want their money’s worth. 

I told him he had to go to rehab or we had to end our relationship. 

I hate alcohol more than I’ve hated anything. It’s taken everything from me, even when it doesn’t touch my lips. 

I had to get that off my chest before I fall asleep at 5 am. I am alone and sober, this is all very new to me.

When we finally got our day going around 10:30/11:00 my friends were so hungover and feeling like shit with hangiexty. Both commented on regretting staying out so late and drinking so much and also contemplated giving up alcohol themselves. So that made me feel extra good about my decision and hopefully that I influenced them in a positive way. We got some food and then went on the most beautiful hike and continued to the hot springs. They took that night off drinking and we were able to get another gorgeous hike in before heading home on Sunday. Thank you to those that commented with words of support. I love you guys. 


So some girlfriends and I decided to take a little weekend trip to a hot springs 7 hours away from home. We talked about going to the hot springs and doing some hiking and overall it just sounded like we were going to have a fun/healthy weekend away. Well right when we get into town (8:30) at night, I’m ready to check into our airb&b, have some tea and go to bed. Apparently I was the only one! My friends wanted to get drinks and food, I went along for one drink and just had water but decided not to join for the next. One friend tried to pressure me and guilted me a little for not hanging out. But I was firm and went home, I ended up going to the grocery store and I splurged on snacks and sparkling water. It’s now almost midnight and they are still out. I’m so thankful I left when I did and I’m thankful I chose to have the evening I wanted even if it was alone. I’m realizing that sober me wants different things than drinking me did and it’s ok that I’ve changed, I don’t have to be the person I was before. I like this version and thus night I’m having better than my old reality. Plus Covid! The bar is the last place I want to be right now. I’m so glad I have this sober community to hear about my night and support me when my real life friends are currently doing their own thing. Have a great weekend everyone!
Oh! And I’m going to get up early tomorrow and go for a run while my friends probably sleep off a hangover. Yay for sobriety!",7,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9948669672012329}"

But this is about freeeeeedoooom!! We had a BBQ tonight and I got to see a lot of close friends. Most were drinking but not super heavily. One was visiting and we used to be big partners together. It was rad hanging out and not missing a beat, minus his one slip of offering me a beer but we laughed it off. 

I told stories from jail, my friends caught me up on their lives, we had a fire, and I never once felt the need to drink or that I was missing out on anything.

After everyone left, one of my roommates was reeeaaally tuned. He wasn't puking or being a menace, just stumbly nonsensical drunk but in a harmless kinda funny way. My other roommate and I helped him to bed and cleaned up a bit. It was the perfect reminder that drinking is what makes you miss out on the good times.

I drank on average a liter of liquor every day for 3 years. Since the age of 14 I was always into partying but it finally became a problem when I pre-gamed my 21st birthday...for 6 months. At 20 I was drinking half a bottle of liquor a day, just a bad habit at this point but within months it spiraled down into a deep hole like it always does. So for 3 years I drank. I woke up and drank. I went on a break at work I drank. I'm running errands I'm drinking. Always drunk basically 24/7. Towards the end of my binge I wasn't eating and all of my calories were coming from vodka. I had tremors, shakes, sweats, itches, nightmares, hallucinations, vomiting, bloody stool, abdominal pains, jaundice, weird stuff like being really jumpy and being debilitated by loud noises, a huge bloody liver and my stomach blew up like a balloon. As far as my health is concerned, I think my only saving grace, the only reason I'm okay today is because I'm young.

The real struggle was dealing with the addiction. I was in this drinking mindset for so long the hole I had dug was very very deep. What worked for me was learning a few things that helped me CHANGE MY MIND. My brain has a finite amount of energy. At the beginning I'm going to have to spend a good amount of that on will power to pull myself out of this hole I've dug; this cycle I've been in. That's going to suck A LOT and I'm going to have to man up for that part. But I can't use pure will power forever, that would be exhausting. I need enough energy to go about my days and to live my life. So what do I do? Once I get past those initial tough days, I have to work on ALTERING MY SUBCONSCIOUS. I have to take away the WANT. I start realizing that I don't actually want to drink I'm just addicted. Every time I think about raising that bottle to my mouth remember why I don't want it. I MAKE A LIST. Not a list on why drinking is bad, not a list of alcohol statistics, but specific pinpoint reasons why I personally and honestly don't want to drink. I literally write down a list and every time the thought enters my head, I have a whole list of me saying to myself, ""hey dummy, remember you don't actually WANT to"".

I AM IN CONTROL. I went to AA during my detox month and the only lie I ever told in there was that I'll see them next week. It is absolutely possible to drink enough that it alters your brain and you're now at a point of no return. That point being ""always an alcoholic"" or actually physically being unable to have just one. I can't have control over alcohol but I can control my craving for it by altering my subconscious. I know I can't have just one but I also know that that's okay because I don't WANT one. Once I convince my stupid addicted brain that I truly don't want one, it alleviates that fear of not being able to have one. I'm well aware of this thing called alcoholism, trust me, I'm well aware. But when I refuse that drink my friend offers me it's not because I am unable to have it, it is because i truly honestly don't want it. That is my control.",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9958897233009338}"

I must remember this when the sneaky voice comes, which it will do in time, and tries to convince me to have that first drink. I am not someone who can just have one or two drinks.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the  internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Short back story. 36 now, almost 37.  Started smoking when I was 16, stopped regularly smoking probably when I was 25.  Even then I went through a pack, sometimes two a week though when I drank (which was every week).    I eventually ""cut back"" to just black & milds which probably weren't much better... they just carried less of a stigma and kept certain people in my life off my back.

Anyways, when I stopped drinking late last year, that also meant smoking was gone too.  Now, sometimes when I start to daydream about drinking or something... I catch myself almost thinking ""I could drink 2 beers, get that initial buzz and then go out and smoke"".  It's less about the beers, and more about the smoking.  I'm not sure if that makes any sense... like I don't want to smoke without the buzz beer provides, but I want to have the beer so I can want to smoke.  It's just fucking with me right now, well actually the last 7 months lol.  

My best guess is my body is still craving the nicotine, but mentally I have no desire to smoke anything sober.

BEER CAN BINGO 
Getting a half rack or full case, guzzling the beers down and littering your countertops with empties. Losing your fresh beer in the mix and having to pick them up and shake them to try to locate your new one. 

BAR CONVERSATIONS 
Yeah, sometimes it’s nice to become besties with strangers in the bathroom (I’m a woman, yes we do this) but honestly, I’m pretty happy I don’t have to listen to my village “Karen” drunk describe to me in detail for the 500th time how her husband left her because she has a drinking problem which “she doesn’t have” (she does), cause he “thinks” she smokes cigs (she does), and because she gambles too much (she REALLY does). 

PRINCIPLED STANCES 
You guys ever get so drunk and SO mad? Of course you do. And when it happens you are UTTERLY convinced you are 100% justified, in no way shape or form over reacting, and...you are correct. I’ve woken up on the couch after a drunken argument with texts in my phone to my husband (which I never recall sending) that usually say something to the effect of, “You’re not my husband anymore” and “we should break up”. (To my credit he and I are sober now but both abuse alcohol) 

DESTRUCTION
I’m reallllllly happy I don’t need to worry about replacing door frames or dry wall repair. Not to toot my own dry wall knife but I’ve gotten pretty skilled at fixing holes in the wall. I’m also looking forward to owning a matching set of dishes that aren’t suspiciously lacking a plate or bowl here and there. (This is from drunkenly dropping dishes, don’t worry people, I’m not hurling ceramics at my family or spouse) 

EMBARRASSMENT

OK. Now I’m going to get REAL. This is my most embarrassing drunk story. And it’s BAD. Thankfully I can articulate it in such a way that I’m sure I can capture some laughs...

A few months ago, these monks from Tibet came to my city and were essentially on display or something at a local museum. I caught wind of this whilst enjoying whisky with my husband at our favorite watering hole probably too early in the day (11am, ya know, when normal people drink). I could NOT contain my excitement. Because I’m so “worldly” right? I mean come on! You don’t need an alcohol abuse problem to appreciate being in the presence of M O N K S! SO! I pounded what was likely my 4th 7&7 DOUBLE, cashed out, grabbed my husband and we made our way to the museum. 

I stumble out of the taxi, smash those museum doors open (think Wild West saloon doors), make eye contact with someone who was probably a volunteer and all I said was , “I heard there’s monks here!!! Where??!!!” She motions for me to lower my voice (apparently as your blood alcohol content rises your hearing ability lowers and your voice gets louder..?) and she says “Yes, the monks are upstairs, please be respectful and don’t interrupt what they’re doing” 

I charge past her like I just bought the museum, and I could hear my husband close behind me: basically repeating my exact entrance, I hear her tell him to be quieter and to be respectful as well. He was as intoxicated as I was. He was right on my tail when I finally get up to the next floor. 

That’s when I see them. Bonafide monks, no shit, straight from Tibet. There were a handful of other people there observing them. Granted, I’ve spent exactly 0 hours with monks so when I saw them my ignorant and HIGHLY intoxicated brain thought they were on some kind of intermission or break. It occurred to me I didn’t even know what the hell people were “observing” anyway. And through my drunken eyes, these monks (who I could barely see because they were standing in front of this giant window with the sun shining in behind them) looked like they were playing POOL!!!! And by the way, I LOVE POOL! Or billiards, whatever you call it wherever you live. 

Guys, I don’t mind telling you I was SO excited to run over there and say, “I got winner!”. 

The next 6 seconds were blurry, ridiculous, almost surreal...and preposterously embarrassing. I stumble toward what are arguably the most disciplined and peaceful people on earth, high on the fact that I’m certain I’m about to play pool with *ahem* MONKS FROM TIBET, aaaaand precisely three sheets to the wind...when it happens...

Just as “I got winner” is about to leave my lips, I TRIP.....and my body goes heaving toward these gentleman who are NOT playing pool. 

My dudes...these monks, they were building SAND MANDALAS. And they’d been working on this one for the entire week!!!!!! I tripped, go crashing into not just them but into the table where their sand mandala was on display!!!

As I’m falling I suddenly realized “nope, this isn’t billiards Samantha you’ve fucked this up real bad”, two monks wave their hands at me and say only “no no no no no” my husband is yelling in the background “HONEYYYYY!!!!!” And he’s laughing, and just like that, I hit the side of the display table and my purse slid across their gorgeous creation and ruined over half of it! 

Everyone else in there looked at me mortified, I stood up, mumbled “I’m so sorry”...and stumbled/ran out of there in under 20 seconds with my husband laughing at me and people shaking their heads at me disapprovingly. 

There you have it. I won’t miss any of that. The lesson here, you probably will never get to play billiards with monks, and if you “think” you will, trust me...that’s probably not what’s happening.",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9622982740402222}"

Decide what you want. Make a list. Gather your tools. Focus on preparing ingredients that, by themselves, are not all that exciting, but extremely important as building blocks.


Combine all ingredients, cook gently, without hurrying, so they become blended—depending on each other to bring out their best—but still remaining familiar and recognizable.

Literally two hours later, when I was on my way from job 1 to job 2, I was getting into my car with my lunch packed in my bag, and the hot sauce I had packed exploded everywhere, so I had to clean everything up and wound up being \~5 minutes late to work (which went unnoticed, but still. not fun.)

it was just little thing after little thing today - my cat had an accident right before I left for work this morning that I had to clean up, I had to reschedule a bunch of appointments right after confirming for one of the doctors, I got into an argument with my parents (who I live with) about the aforementioned cat accident -- by the time six pm rolled around, I was ready to curl up into a ball and cry. it was the first time since going sober seven months ago that I really found myself going *damn*, *i could use a drink after today.*

but instead of driving straight home, plopping in front of the tv and crying myself to sleep though, I got changed, drove to the wildlife trails by my house, and went for a three mile run. and then my best friend called me and we caught up for twenty minutes while I sat in the car. and by the time I walked through the door and sat down to eat dinner, I didn't feel like I needed that drink anymore.

I am 28 and I would say I've averaged spending 1200 to 1500 a month on alcohol for the past 10 years.. it's absolutely terrifying to think about and it just racks my brain knowing that I have blown a down payment on a house, big trips to places where I could have had interesting experiences and met people and shared memories. I wasted all that money, the prime of my adulthood and countless good relationships just to get drunk and waste away. 

One day sober is practically a weeks worth of groceries. It's 2/3rd of my phone bill or my internet bill. If I stop drinking all my actual living expenses are covered by my booze expenses, with more to spare. 

If I go low and say 1000 a month on alcohol, 10years x 12 months x 1000 a month, that's 120,000$. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

Even on the weekends, most times will be 5-6 drinks over the course of a day, and I end the day buzzed or drunk, but no major negatives outside of not sleeping well and a little headache the next morning. 

However, other times I go overboard, become extremely intoxicated, blackout or barely remember the last hours of the night, and from speaking with others am completely incoherent. This probably happens every 10 or 20 times, with which my schedule is around once every month or two.

The problem is, I can’t predict when that happens. Last time, the plan was to have a few beers and hang out (socially distant of course), but I ended up blacking out and not even remembering the second half of the day. 

I think this is due to a few reasons. If I’m drinking over the course of the day, I continue drinking at a slow, but consistent pace. That means if I get beers in the afternoon, and hang out for 2 hours, I might have 3, no big deal. If I hang out 4 hours, that’s 6, and 6 hours, that’s 9. To compound that, the more drinks I have, the more likely I am to want to continue. 

I’m reaching out with health professionals to see how I can address this. Ideally I’d like to work on how my brain responds to alcohol, but in the short term I just plan on not having anything to drink this weekend.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9983446598052979}"

I have multiple addiction problems and I am struggling with invasive thoughts about drugs every single day. It’s obsessive and really annoying, hurtful. 

I wish I could be able to use substances in a moderate and spiritual way. But I am so far from that now, there is no turning back and no other options but to be sober. The thought of being sober is an empowering one tho. I’ve never felt like I could get attached to something the same way I am attached to using drugs, and the idea of being part of the sober community really woke something up in me. 

I have not been taking anything else than occasional weed for months now, but I feel like I’m still using because I am constantly thinking about it. I drink red bull everyday, trying to convince myself it is stronger than it is. 

Every time I managed to cut a substance from my life, it’s been the outcome of a long process that lead to a firm decision. I never looked back and did not struggle so bad with it. Now that I don’t really use anything anymore, the feeling of emptiness is savage, it’s real and it hurts a lot. I am not struggling with any particular substance, I’m struggling with the idea of not using. I love the sober community but I hate being stuck with myself everyday. 

I wish I would love myself and be a better person. I have to get out of my head and lead my life with a positive attitude.

I posted quite a while ago about quitting and I think this time is finally it. Today marks one week and I have no desire to drink. Last time I made it this far it was so much harder and I wasn't confident I could do it. Told myself I could ""feel the waters"" but gave myself the option to drink if I conviced myself it was okay. I didn't tell my fiance last time I wanted to quit, just told him I was cutting back. Of course we know how that went. 
I ended up drinking most days, but not every single day like before. I could feel myself losing interest in it and kept asking myself ""why am I drinking? I don't even want it.""

I told him a week ago I needed to stop. And I was just honest with him that I feel like I have a problem and I was tired of all of the negative effects I consistently had. He wasn't sure about my cutting myself off completely right away, but I know that's what I need to do. My body doesn't deserve the torture anymore. 

So here I am a week in. My anxiety and panic are through the roof but I don't have a desire to drink because I truly don't want it. We're preparing to move across the country and that has been my biggest stressor, but to be able to wake up early in the morning to make calls and get things together each day has been a great motivator to stay away.

This sub has been such a great motivation and really shows me all of the good of a life without alcohol. I don't think I would have stopped seeing alcohol as my good thing without all of you.

In the dream, I had a sip of beer, just one sip. You know how dreams can just fast-forward, well right after that first sip I was crouched next to my fridge absolutely draining a gigantic boxed beer. Those don’t even exist, and I was more of a wino but the ritual was the same. Empty my glass in 3 seconds, press the pressure button, refill, drain. All those old drinking anxieties came back instantly, am I drunk enough? Do I have enough to last the night? I even started feeling drunk at times. 

I woke up 10 minutes ago, still sober, a little freaked out but ok. Today I am 7 months sober and I’m proud of myself, but I know how easy it is to fall back into those old habits. Those drinking anxieties are still there, buried but ever present. Like Professor Moody would say: Constant vigilance!

I enjoy reading stories of people who overcame their addictions, and I try to lend a supportive comment here and there.  

On March 13th, 2020 I decided I was going to quit drinking.  I had tried a lot of times before but I was getting better and better at it.  I used to be able to do a week stretch without drinking, then it became two weeks, and soon I was putting away a good month plus without booze.  On March 13th it ""stuck"" and I didn't drink for 143 days, almost five months!  It was my longest stretch of abstinence from alcohol in nearly 10 years.

Well about a week and a half ago I got an ""out of the blue"" craving and decided to have a few beers.  Over the last 10 days nothing crazy has happened but I have drank about four or five nights, a couple of those nights having a bit more than I wanted to.  I'm not going to beat myself up about this, but it has proven to be a learning experience.  

Some observations from my brief return to drinking:

Drinking really ruins my sleep.
I feel lethargic during the day.
It increases my anxiety considerably.
I really don't enjoy it.
It's no longer fun.


I also learned I need to be on the look out for potential triggers, and be mindful during potential cravings, reminding myself why I am quitting and that I have the power to get through the craving.  I think I got very confident the last time that I was ""truly done"" and when I had a strong craving I was totally taken by surprise.  This time I will be diligent in terms of preparing for one of those moments.  I will remember my daughter and how I need to be present for her.  I will remember how horrible my sleep and anxiety become when I drink.  I will remember that alcohol is a false friend, and it's always caused me more trouble than it's worth.  I will remember I am stronger than a craving and I never have to give in, and I won't give in.  I will also remember this important piece of info: 

I always regret drinking the following day, and I have NEVER regretted not drinking.

So, starting now I am recommitting myself to sobriety.  No excuses, no ""one more times"".  I'm done with alcohol.  I feel great that I was able to go nearly five months sober, because it proves to me that I can do it again, and use this brief experiment as a reminder that alcohol no longer serves a purpose.  I enjoy feeling clear headed, in control of myself and my emotions and not reliant on any substance.  I enjoy being able to spend more time with my daughter because I am not feeling the effects of the previous night.  I really like being sober.  I enjoy that level of self agency and trust in myself. 

So, thanks for all the support guys and I'm looking forward to picking up where I left off, sober, happy, confident, and clear headed.  That's the man I am and deserve to be.",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9865891933441162}"

I would have been in a pool yesterday at the Mandalay... and today would have been the first full day of music and celebration. Instead, I'm thousands of miles away, in the humid swelter of August in Philly.

Last year, I was drinking. I drank a couple beers that first day, at the pool party, and felt terrible afterwards... the combination of 100+F degree days and desert sun kicked my butt. Fortunately, I found the water fountains (sparkling and still!) and did my best to recover from the dehydrating effects of the beer and climate.

 I had another beer towards the end of the trip, at the Heart Attack Grill (yes, I got paddled, lol) and one slushy boozy drink while wandering the hotel complexes. All in all, a very light drinking week for me, considering my average routine back then.

This year, I was excited to experience everything without the baggage of alcohol slowing me down. This adventure is the highlight of my entire year, and helps me keep my mind off of the tragedy of losing my best friend, late in August, to a drunk driver. Living my life to the fullest is one way I honor her memory. She would have loved to go to this festival.

I only binge on some occasions, mainly social, but I regularly drink at home. Beer is my poison and in the last 3-4 years I've only had a few instances of sobriety longer than a day or two. I suppose I don't drink too much or get too drunk, but I do drink almost every day. 

I've done two 30-day periods off alcohol, then came back to square one. Since then it was hard to find a reason to stop. Now I feel that my marriage, health and work has been suffering from my almost constant semi-hangover state. I mainly drink in the evenings, so the mornings are hard. It's hard to find motivation and energy for work, hard to push for new things and grow in any meaningful way when I'm constantly tired, overweight and disorganized. 

I wish to reduce my meaningless drinking during the week - drinking in front of the TV or while playing games - while still drinking at social occasions. This might be a little too much for me at this point, going to parties and gatherings sober, while most of my friends drink the same way I do.

So, while not a complete recovery, it will be a major step for me - finding new energy for stuff that matters and having the time and motivation to grow and evolve.

My two main concerns are boredom and keeping my resolve while my wife looks at me closely ;) 

I do get bored in the evenings and beer has a wonderful way of making mundane stuff exciting. So finding new ways to approach the little everyday things will be crucial. I know I have to exchange the alcohol-induced high for a smaller, natural high, the pure joy of doing something interesting. That's my number one challenge - keep myself busy without the booze.

As for my wife, I'm afraid she might not be very helpful since she sees my drinking in an entirely different perspective. There might be some involuntary egoism hidden somewhere, which is understandable. But I'm not sure how to deal with my fails and hiccups. If I fail to stay sober, or say resume drinking on the day after a party (hair of the dog and all that), I'm sure she will point it out. I don't know if her being impatient and commenting on my mistakes will be productive towards my recovery. On the other hand - I'm also not sure if her patting me on the back will help me much, since she does not see alcohol the way I see it, nor has she experienced alcoholism in any way, aside from being my wife ;)

So, I appreciate all your thoughts and ideas about how to go about keeping myself busy in the hours which I associate with drinking and how to include - or not include - my wife in the process. Many thanks in advance!",6,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.618643045425415}"

Thanks to all the posters and lurkers here. I get a great deal from SD and I'm grateful to you all. You make sobriety seem sane and normal. Ta.

A quick tale:
This week my close pal asked if I was free as she'd had some horrible news. No one had died. I could meet her in the afternoon and feared the worst. It was indeed some very shocking news that affects her marriage immediately and deeply and possibly irreprarably.

Last year I would have poured drink down her and me until we were yelling, laughing and crying into the night.

This year we got food, she had a few g&t's and I kept to the softs. I took the next day off work, and that night researched a day trip outside of town to do a little river swimming and take her out of herself a little.

And we did it! We set off early and had an adventurous day. It won't fix her extremely difficult situation or the ordeal ahead, but it was fun and loving despite everything and beat the crap out of a horrible hangover on top of an awful situation.

(Oh, and because sobriety saves me money, I could even make this all my treat instead of being the broke friend.)

So thanks again, SD.

I haven't  'outed' myself as a wannabe-abstainer to my friends. They know I have dry spells but I can't talk about it in any depth. 

I'm struggling with euphoric recall. I've found with binge-drinking, that the second, maybe third drink in, induces a high akin to other drugs. It doesn't last long and you spend the rest of the night trying to maintain or re-induce it. And that's the origin of every regretful action in my adult life.

I'll be spending this weekend with my dear university friends. It will be one of the first big tests of this 'attempt.' Some of my worst en-bloc blackouts have happened around these people. I had always felt like we were all binge drinkers, and while I think this is the case for a handful of the others, it may have been a projection/justification of my own issue. 

I'm wrestling with two thoughts. I'm hinging my abstinence on my ego: an idea of myself as an older woman with an enjoyable life (and okay skin), who stopped drinking at 26, and poured the shame, guilt and pain into the gutter with the drink. Those same alcohol-induced emotions that have made me suicidal. Sometimes, the thought of who I am and what I've done under the influence has made me want to die, long after the drinking episode. 

And somehow it's not quite enough to stop the craving. I want the euphoria. I'm only 26! I still have a good 2 years of this lifestyle left - why am I curtailing it, when life is short and it can feel so good, and it's not like I'm an ""alcoholic"" anyway?! Leave the fact that I've blacked out so many times, vomited in my sleep, probably had alcohol poisoning, embarrassed myself, had ill-advised sex, wrecked potential friendships, probably wrecked my last relationship. Everyone does those things, I need to let myself off the hook!

I live in a city with great nightlife. I miss the raves, the warehouses, feeling like I'm floating off, like I'm pretty; those moments with my boyfriend that I know I couldn't have sober. I'm missing the feeling that absolutely anything could happen tonight because I'm conveniently ignoring that those things are often terrible.

The ego thing works. So does the idea that I can't say, 'at least I haven't done x terrible thing.' I've blacked out so many times. If we are what we've done, I don't know who I am. I don't want to linger on that too much. There's the fear that I could do the bad things I've done AGAIN without a thought or even a memory. I have things and people to lose. There's the fear of more brain damage. My memory is so much better these days. I'm exercising. I've picked up my violin after 8 years. I'm not aggravating my already fragile mental health with one of the worst drugs on the market. 

Even if I can't guarantee tomorrow night, I'm saying 'not today, Satan' this evening.

2020-08-14 03:47:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i9hsku/my_day_1_was_easy_and_hard/,My day 1 was easy and hard.,"Well I'm in bed at 2 AM after my first day sober. I'm 34 and live at home with my parents for mental health reasons. It was easy in the way I didn't get a DUI and I'm not in detox... But it was hard too.

So first thing in the morning I got dressed in a long sleeve button down shirt from target, nice jeans. I went out and told my parents, I'm dressed up for my first day sober! They encouraged me.

I had a lot of ""me time"" today. I went for a mile walk through the trees and went near the pond in the woods. While on my walk i talked to my sister on the phone with my ear buds. I took a rinse off shower to wash away the sweat.

I only had about 5 hours of sleep the night before, I was up most the night watching YouTube videos about early sobriety and hearing success stories. One woman was 3 years without cigarettes and 1 year sober. This will be me in a year if I can stay sober. Her story really gave me hope. I tried taking a nap 3 different times but I was wide awake. Boldly sober.

I went grocery shopping and came home with $37 worth of junk food. LoL. Candy, chocolate, cheese curds, potato chips, soda, cold brew coffee, etc. Having the junk food was definitely a ""me time"" moment.

I beat one mission in Doom (2016) for PlayStation 4, and I had just as much fun, if not more fun than when I was doing it drunk a few days ago.

After about 4 PM I started to realize how much free time I had, and called my sister to ask her advice on a movie to watch. And I said to her how much free time I had because drinking usually took up so much time! She said, you drink so fast though. And I corrected her about how I used to sip ""one drink"" of liquor over 10 minutes. Over and over. And I told her, just being drunk takes up time as well.

Well I ended up watching half of the movie Doom Annihilation on Netflix, because it's the game I've been playing haha.

I went to bed at 10, but didn't fall asleep. I feel like my first day sober must have triggered my mania, but my medication keeps that at a somewhat manageable level. It's just that I can go without sleep sometimes.

After 1 AM I heard my Mom struggling with her resume. So I got up, clear headed, and helped her print her resume and showed her how Google docs worked. So that was one good thing I was able to do today for others. Just two days ago when I was a drunk I had yelled at my Mom, ""I did you a fucking favor"" taking the dog out and how she should be so grateful. Wow how my priorities and attitude has changed in just the first day!

This isn't my first time going sober. But this time I'm determined, and I wanted to share my day 1 with y'all.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9425864219665527}"

We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

*Not a liar, anymore.*

As a small child, I lived in a little town in the middle of the  Mojave Desert. This is where I remember my first addictions taking root.  They were lying and sugar. I often used the former to cover up my LOVE  for the later.

I broke into my piggy bank, which was supposed to go into my savings  account a couple times a year, and took money. My sister (age 7) and I  (age 5) made our way to Eddie’s Market and loaded up on penny candy -  enough for the whole neighborhood, really. (If you’re reading this and  you don’t know what penny candy is, ask your dad, if he doesn’t know,  ask your grandpa.)

When asked about the missing money, the candy wrappers or the  chocolate on my chin, I lied. I wish this was the only thing I ever lied  about, but these lies just set the course for decades of deception.  Most of the lies were about my family. I wanted to cover up the  differences between what it was like at my house, and what I earnestly  believed it was like at my friends’ houses. My mom had severe mental  illness at a time when most people had seen “One Flew Over the Coo Coo’s  Nest” and that was all they knew about people who went into psychiatric hospitals. I thought lies were my friends. Until I was about 14, I used  them in spades to present a picture of my family that did not  approximate reality. 

Later, the lies I told were to myself, about my drinking. I lied so  long that I forgot the truth. “I must not have a problem, since I hold  down a high-pressure job” is just one example. When I started reading  first-hand accounts from other soberists, it freed me to find the truth and become soulmates or at least acquaintances with it.

One of my goals now, is to be truthful, all the time, about  everything!!! I’m practicing telling the truth. It’s taking some work  for me. What I’m learning is that the truth doesn’t need an egregious  amount of detail - it can just be, ""I'm okay, but not great"", “I don’t  drink”, or “I’m well acquainted with mental illness, it runs in my  family"". 

How’s the truth treating you these days?

I did make it thru another day though, and for that I’m grateful.

2020-08-13 19:17:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i9angs/not_an_alcoholic/,“Not an alcoholic”,"This is my first post here. I’m a long time lurker. To start of, I don’t consider myself an alcoholic. I’ve read it many times before here. I don’t drink until I pass out, or do it every day. What do I do? I drink medicinally. I wired myself to drink whenever I’ve unexplained psycho-somatic problems in the evening. The reasoning? It doesn’t make it better, but at least it is a little more fun. 

Except that it isn’t, not anymore. Drinking in the evening became a habit for me, it might be only one (craft) beer. Still, my body doesn’t feel ok _without_ the alcohol, and the “hangover” of one beer already influences my day. Not only that. I just had one beer after not-drinking since saturday: hot-flashes, nausea, while “intoxicated”. Why do I do it? It is poison, and I can’t stand it well, but because I _can_ drink moderately I don’t stop. Sometimes it feels better than it feels now. 

I feel like a bad gambler: this time it I’ll be just what I needed. The reality is, only 1/10 times that is true. At the moment, I don’t have the heart to stop completely. I’ve always had a strong reaction to alcohol, and I was cautious with it. I’d love to read, devoured books, and with one beer I couldn’t concentrate as well and the joy would go away. In those times, I only drank in company and knowing I didn’t have to do anything afterwards. But it has been 2,5 years since I’ve been able to read a book properly (due to my psycho-somatic issues, which started then), and the external motivation to not drink has diminished to “not gaining weight”; which means every cheat-day is a drinking day. 

When I think about stopping drinking, I get confronted with the emptiness of my life that once was full. I didn’t drink because I had a purpose. I drink because what the hell. Stopping is confrontational. It is admitting to myself that I need again, to look for a different purpose, how difficult that may be. I’m not ready now. This was my rant. Maybe I’ll be ready another day. Thanks for bearing with me.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9878796935081482}"

I’m not used to writing so much content in this type of format.  And I’m on a day 1 reset which is making thinking and remembering tough.  I’ve lurked around this sub before and always find inspiration in the stories and support.

I’m 31 now and have been drinking since I was 17.  In high school my friends and I were the typical partiers who raided our parents’ liquor cabinets and found older friends who didn’t care about buying us booze.  Not going to lie, I loved it.  Still do honestly, except it’s causing(caused) so many problems i can’t take it anymore.

I went to a community college for a couple of semesters before transferring to a four-year college.  I told my friends and family I wanted to be a doctor but what it turned out I wanted to do was waste my dad’s money and booze life away.  I couldn’t hack it with my bad habits and had to return home.  

I met my longest relationship (4 years) just before this in college.  We were really into each other when I left for home so we visited each other whenever we could.  Eventually we moved in together.  Towards the end my substance issues became too much for her and she had some personal issues of her own which made the relationship unworkable.

I went to work for the family business after college.  It’s an aerospace manufacturing company.  The hours are long, and almost everyone in that industry has some sort of abuse issue going on.   Drugs, bars, middle aged dudes regularly patronizing strip clubs is the norm.  

Fast forward a little bit and I got a OWI and wrecked my car in 2014.  One of the worst experiences of my life.  It was hard to even admit to myself what I’d done.  I even lied to my mom when she picked me up later at the hospital.  Despite being obviously wasted.  It wasn’t until the next day I could admit what happened.

Because of some delays in the court system, I actually wasn’t charged until late 2016.  They gave me a year of probation where I was required to call-in for daily drug tests along with the usual classes, community service, and fines.   

And it turned out 2017 was the best year of my adult life.  I was so scared of being thrown in jail for violating my probation I actually stayed sober and complied.  The first month was tough, but I became so bored after 30 days I fell into positive habits naturally.  I would wake up and meditate every morning, then workout.  I started working more hours and being more reliable at the shop.  I went from 220lbs down to 166lbs in 7 months.  My relationships with family improved.  I was strong and proud of myself.  I remember that feeling now 3 years later and it makes me cry.  A girl from old high school class messaged me on FB and we hit it off.  

Well after my probation ended, things started slipping again in 2018.  Things ended with the girl because of her own substance problems at the time.  And to make a long story short, I’m in a tough spot now in 2020 like most of us are.  I have a roof over my head because of family, but no paying job.  And I’ve neglected all of my serious family/friend relationships to the point where they are really concerned about me but also over my shit.  And I’ve contracted some embarrassing health conditions because of my reckless habits while drinking.

My shit is binge drinking.  I’m good for a few days, then I go off the rails like I did this last weekend and into this week.  Cheap vodka before bed, then cheap vodka the next day to ease the withdrawal symptoms.  This has turned me into a selfish, lying asshole who no one can depend on.  I poured the vodka out last night.  My life may not be great right now but i have to break the cycle.

-a sense of empowerment that I do not need alcohol 
-enjoy my usual activities just as much (if not more) sober
-deepened relationships 
-daily exercise 
-steady mood (no extreme highs and lows)
-a clear mind!

TBH at first quitting felt like a punishment and not fair. Why can others drink and I can’t?! 
Well, I tried and failed at moderation. That’s why.

She couldn't really tell me how it applies to me the boyfriend of the alcoholic.

Here is the list [https://www.ocalanon.org/12-steps-traditions/](https://www.ocalanon.org/12-steps-traditions/)

I've had a very religious upbringing and don't believe in a higher power.   I thoroughly understand the spiritual need in all humans and how god can mean different things to different people.   My girlfriend is agnostic.  6 of the 12 steps say God or him.   Am I supposed to believe in a greater power or admit to god about what?   Or is the 12 steps for my alcoholic girlfriend who does not believe in god?

Step 1 admit we are powerless over alcohol.   Ok that makes sense to a recovering addict to admit they are powerless.  Good first step but what about me?   Am I supposed to admit that my girlfriend is powerless?   I already understand that.

Step 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 is all about admitting to god so I guess my girlfriend can admit that to nature or mountains or something else but I don't see who I am admitting what to?   I don't get it.

Step 8 list all of the people harmed.   Well that's me, I am the harmed one so another step that I don't understand.   Actually she self harmed herself.  Her drinking never really harmed anyone else.  She will have to work through that step.

So I am going down the list with the Al Anon sponsor person who is not an alcoholic and she says that she is only on Step 11?   I'm like huh and she says I need to concentrate on step 1 and the rest will come over time.   I'm so confused how the 12 step program is supposed to apply to the non addict.

2020-08-13 15:23:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i96ehk/lessons_from_my_first_year_sober/,Lessons from my first year sober,"Hi all - been lurking on here for about a year and a half now and I've recently realized that if we all lurk there won't be much content. I recently hit 1 year and wanted to share some of my thoughts and what helped me overcome drinking.

**Background**

My wake up call wasn't crashing my car, losing my job, or ending up in jail (although to be fair, avoiding these was probably more due to luck than anything). It was a random Saturday morning at 6:30 and my then 1 year old son had woken up excited to start the day. It was my day to wake up with him (while my wife kept sleeping) and my hangover was rough- but not out of the ordinary. As I put him down on the carpet I laid down in the couch to stop the room from spinning. Incapacitated by nausea and headaches I quietly laid there while he toddled over to hand me toys to play with.

Eventually I realized we (I) needed fresh air, so we headed down to the bagel shop to get some breakfast and sit in a nearby park where he could run off some energy. I sat on a park bench looking down at my egg sandwich, too disgusted to eat and in that moment it struck me- this should have been an amazing morning. An early, clear morning where the sun is starting to warm the air right before it gets too busy with people. I should have been sliding down the slide with my kid, or at the very least giving him some much deserved attention but I couldn't. All my focus was on not barfing in the shrub next to me.

I decided I needed to revaluate my drinking not for me, but because my kid deserved better. My hangover wasn't the result of some big night out with friends, or celebrating antying in particular. It was because I sat on the couch, watched BoJack Horseman and drank half a bottle of whiskey. What a lame reason for a hangover.

""Fine,"" I thought ""I can't do this all the time, but I can do it some of the time."" So I set off on a bizzare plan of moderation. I can still drink, I'll just do it less often. What followed was a strange situation where I would constantly evaluate whether this event was worth spending my ""drinking night"" on. With this perverse set of rules in place, if I decided to drink, I'd go waaaaay overboard. Casual Sunday BBQs would be me almost blacking out, while my friends are enjoying some beers.

Alright, take 2. I'll drink as frequently as I want, but I won't go past 3 drinks. Anyone on this sub that's tried this knows it's a total disaster. The amount of willpower to pull back after 3 drinks is just absurd. Having this argument with yourself isn't worth the marginal buzz you get after 3 drinks. And really, who wants 3 drinks anyway? 3 drinks is like if you show up to a concert of your favorite band and leave after the first song. It's like having 1 spoonful of an ice cream sundae. 3 drinks was just enough to say ""hey, this is how much of a good time you could be having."" fuck. that. Drinking no drinks is infinitely better than 3 drinks.

So I gave it up. At first I just figured, ""I'll quit drinking for a week and see."" A week turned into 2 weeks, a month, 3 months, a year. I wanted to highlight some quick points that I found helpful or worked for me:

**It gets easier**

In the early days I was having conditioned responses that gave me cravings to drink. Home from work, outside grilling, weekend dinner- these are learned habits and they always amped up my cravings. Recognizing these were conditioned habits helped. I want to be better than a rat getting a pellet when I hear a bell. The cravings will fade, it will get easier.

**Go easy on yourself**

I was using all my willpower on not drinking. Because of that I didn't beat myself up if I ate too much dessert, or plunked in front of the TV instead of going to the gym. I was prioritizing not drinking and if it came at the cost of a clean diet I was okay with that. You're drawing down on a finite resource, be gentle on yourself.

**Have a reason that's bigger than you**

One of the only reasons I've been able to stave off drinking for this long is because the reason for not drinking are not selfish. I have no problem breaking a promise to myself, but knowing my kid deserves better helps keep me on track.

**Your friends are trying to help... probably**

I didn't have a very supportive friend network. My friends drink, a lot. But I don't think they were trying to sabotage me, I think they saw me stressed out (because I was exerting all my willpower to overcome an addiction). They know how relaxed I get drinking (I'm a tightly wound person). I think their intentions were good, but their execution was off.

**Read other's struggle**

People on here are at different points in their journey and it's been an incredible resource to draw from. I am inspired by people with many days under their belt talking about how it was the best decision they've ever made. I'm reminded where I came from reading about those who are struggling with early days of quitting. Thank you everyone for sharing your stories and being a part of this community.

I felt a strong urge to grab ""just a few you deserve it, a couple drinks won't hurt"" and as I was going to grab some Mikes Hard Lemonades one of the workers comes around and says ""Its 10 pm now and I'm about to lock it up, if you're grabbing something I'd do it quick"". He kind of put me on the spot and I just stared at the drinks I was about to grab for a second and realized it wasn't worth it. I wasn't about to throw away another night /morning again. I told him ""No that's alright I'll grab something else"" and opted for a cherry slushie and left. As I was leaving I almost felt like crying but was relieved at the same time because I was so close to buying myself a drink and caving again but I didn't. If it hadn't been for that worker who spoke to me I might have bought those drinks. I might be hungover and hating myself right now but I'm not and I'm happy to have gotten through another night alcohol free.

Each day, I write whatever day it is in the circle (eg the 13th) and tell myself “today I’m committing to not drinking just for today, August 13th.”

The next day, if I stayed sober, I shade in the circle for that day as a way to physically signal my accomplishment of staying sober.

I posted a little video of how I do it below.

It’s simple but I’ve found it’s been really helpful for keeping me focused just on my commitment for that day and giving me a small way to celebrate my achievement each morning.

I've had a lot of 'firsts' in my illustrious drinking career. Initially, I could say I'd never puked from drinking. Then came my first puking experience. And then it became a commonplace, if not frequent, occurrence.

Then I could say I'd never had a blackout. Then came my first blackout when I had to be carried passed out of a party. Then I drank more and more til I blacked out once a week or more. Then, it took less and less but I blacked out more and more.

Then I could say I'd never woken up drunk. Then came the first of that. Then I could say I'd never gotten in legal trouble. Then came the first time for that, closely followed by the second, and then the third.

Then I could say I'd never hurt myself while drunk. Then came a massive concussion that changed that. Then at least I could say I'd never soiled myself while drunk. Well, you know how that one goes.

Then I thought at least I could say I'd never gone into withdrawals. Then it became about as commonplace as my frequent blackouts. Then I could say I'd never had a seizure. Then I could say I'd never had to take a drink to get going in the morning. Then I could say I'd never lost a job, or a relationship.

By now, I've had a 'first' for them all. And then seconds and thirds and by now, hundredths. I fear that the only 'first' I've got left is drinking myself to death. But I don't think that one's followed by second.

If I keep at it, all of the firsts and seconds will turn into one final 'last'. And that'll be that.

Sleeping like a baby at night. Beginning to make peace with my past and opening myself up to God and the lessons/blessings he brings me day after day. Begin my mornings with several prayers and up to 30 min of meditation in silence.

Days 90-100: Beginning to see/experience the promises of AA. My relationships with people begin to improve, my emotional maturity begins to show more and more. Attending meetings daily, sometimes two a day, still working through the steps (step 7), and still doing my morning prayer/meditation ritual.

I do all the right things before bed, no screens for multiple hours, no bright lights in the house, hot shower, exercise early in the day... I get 8 or 9 hours in the bed, should be well rested but I'm fatigued and have brain fog during the day pretty severely. 

This fatigue has gone hand in hand with my alcoholism over the last 8 years or so, but I'm noticing now that I'm sober it seems like it's tied to my sleep..
I guess alcoholism obviously fucked with my sleep over the years. Sorry for incoherent rambling, I'm tired lol. Can anyone  give me some hope? I've read that sleep is the last thing to fall into place for recovering alcoholics, which is fine because I'm in this for the long haul.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975765347480774}"

I wanted to share my journey over the past year. I went to my first AA meeting almost exactly a year ago after lurking here and struggling to get sober on my own for 2.5 years or so. During the past year I've had 64 days sober and 82 days sober, with some shorter stretches and quite a few lapses and relapses along the way. Each time, I learn something from my ""failures"" and try not to repeat the same mistakes. I'm coming up on one month sober again, and was reminded that I shouldn't compare my recovery to anyone else's, but focus on who I am today vs yesterday.

I decided to go back through my photos and see where I was in August 2019, and it honestly surprised me:

[August 2019 vs August 2020](https://i.imgur.com/GEv4OXz.jpg)

 I've lost 40 pounds, my face isn't constantly dripping sweat everywhere, and I just feel so much better physically and emotionally. My anxiety and depression are essentially gone, my sleep is good, my marriage is healing, and I can be fully present with my kids. 

Thought I'd share here for anyone else who might be struggling. You don't have to recover perfect. Don't beat yourself up. Progress, not perfection! Keep learning, keep fighting, keep in touch with your fellow recovering friends.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one  thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

\--------------------------

My couches are older. They are made of fake leather, and really ought  to be replaced. On the underside of the cushions is big strip of Velcro  (hook and loop) that keeps them from sliding, but every once in a  while, my spouse will pull one of them up to move it into a better  position. The sound of the Velcro separating sends my young dog, Compass, into a snarling, barking frenzy every damn time. It doesn’t  matter where he is in the house, he hears it and comes running with fur flying and teeth bared. He loses it! 

The sound is a trigger for him. 

There isn’t a thing I can do to stop the reaction, but I can aid him  in the aftermath. To help him recover, we put the cushion back in place,  pet him, and talk gently to him in an attempt to reassure. I never act  like it didn’t happen or that he’s being rotten. He’s not, he’s just  reacting in a way that is natural for him. *(The couch is a predator?)* 

I have tried to remain aware of my triggers. What do I do when I’m  triggered? I acknowledge and I remove the source or remove myself. Then I  tell myself that the feeling is temporary and will pass. Sometimes I  need to do more than that, but often these measures are enough. I don’t  feel shame or guilt. I just try to calm myself, and move beyond the  feelings, which I now know are temporary. 

BTW, quitting hasn’t been easy for me. In fact, many, many days, it’s  been $%#@ing hard. And as many of you well know, maintaining sobriety  is no “Malibu getaway” where we all drink smoothies, do yoga and feel dandy all the time, either. 

But my hope is that by treating ourselves gently, when feeling what comes naturally to an alcohol addicted person, we can retrain our brains. I ask you to join me in having faith in our sober time and some slow methodical training.

There was a solid 12 minute window where I delivered my best, most charming sales pitch to my husband. And I got him to agree to engage in my delusion. 

We agreed that, one last hurrah before summer ends would be okay. 

One farewell. An ode to alcohol. One last night sipping whisky drinks on our back porch looking out at our 5 acre apple orchard, while the sun set and our dog chased deer. We would blast music and throw bedroom eyes at each other. Just one last night of drinking before I quit smoking on the 15th, and we put the summer to bed. I wanted to do it proper. 

We finished up at my office and both excitedly made our way to the liquor store. I didn’t even arrive there before I felt guilty. I felt like I let myself down. 

My husband and my initial laughter and excitement melted away in the car. We went from enthusiastically laughing and trying to contain our excitement to, almost simultaneously flashing back to all the terrible nights we have had. The damage we’ve done. The gambling at the bar. Being irresponsible with money. The hangovers. The puking. Skipping meals only to eat late at night and then eating shitty food all the next day while beached on the couch. 

We didn’t go to the liquor store. We didn’t drink. We held hands tightly on our way back to our home tonight. Still sat on our back porch watching our dog play in the orchard with the deer. Still got to see that beautiful sun set.... Still enjoyed blasting music. But we will remember it all, no fights, no puke....no looming hangover. We just shared a beautiful evening holding our heads high and refocused on why we’re doing this. We exchanged proud fist bumps and are happy to finish the day sober. 

Sometimes, it’s just riding that 12 minute craving out. Yep. It was hard but I am not going to give in. Hang in there. This group is so meaningful. Thank you.

I went out with some work colleagues, to a bar for the first time since I quit drinking and smoking.

I was so terrified I'd crack and drink, I felt like it was inevitable. But once I decided I just.. wasn't going to drink, it became a lot easier. A coworker of mine who knows I've quit was super supportive and bought us both some cokes and it was super easy. It was nice to be present and engaged, and not pissed by dinner

During that dinner there was a government announcement that covid was back in the country, and we were perhaps going back into various phases of lockdown, which scared the shit out of me, I thought for a second about a calm down beer (I was trashed for the whole of lockdown to 'get through it'), but what good would that do?? 

Then the next day I got my wisdom teeth out, I'm an anxious mess and terrified of dentists... But I just did it. I didn't call anyone crying about it the day before, or beg anyone to come with me for emotional support, or cry at the dentist beforehand. Granted I was shaking so much during the procedure that the nurse literally had to pin my head down, but I didn't make a saga out of the affair.
Doc says ""now you can't drink alcohol for two days, okay?""
It was awesome to really mean it when I said ""sure, no problem""

Then later on, i'm in bed chilling, and we have a fucking earthquake. Not a major one, but this trifecta of unfortunate/scary things would have sent me over the edge a few short months ago. I'd be three bottles of wine deep, posting embarrasing things online or using someone for sex to take my mind off things. Waking up under cars. Annoying my friends and worrying my mother. Considering myself 'strong' for not being affected hahaha.

But she had a dark side. A side that rubbed off on me. She turned me against people I cared about, controlling me and making me do things I would never do before. She turned me mean and spiteful. She pushed me down a spiral. 

It’s hard to leave the one you love, but it must be done. 

Oh, with me she had her way.

I’m only 12 days sober but that’s the longest I’ve made it in so long. 

I’ve been drinking more than I should for years now but it really ramped up in the last couple of years where I could easily drink 2 bottles of wine a night or more if I let myself. An average night was a bottle and a half though and that was every night for a long time. I couldn’t even remember my last alcohol free day. 

I was so sick of hangovers, the anxiety and hating myself the next day. Like many other people, every morning I would make myself a promise not to drink that night. And then it became, okay I will drink but it’s only to taper because I was so scared of withdrawals by this point. But I just could not taper, I was dreaming of my next drink before I’d even finished the one I was on. 

I kept telling myself I didn’t need to see a doctor, I can do this myself but in reality I couldn’t. I needed support. I finally went a few weeks ago because I started having lower back pain and feared for my organs. Turns out I have a completely unrelated health issue that was not caused by drinking too much (and I’m now on the mend from that too) but that’s the push I needed to finally see a doctor. I was terrified but I also felt ready. My doctor was amazing. No judgements, no dismissing anything I was feeling. And as a bonus, all my bloodwork came back fine. My liver is fine, as are my kidneys (which is the area I was feeling the pain) and I wasn’t really deficient in anything besides Vitamin D. 

We worked together to come up with a plan to help me stop drinking. I was given diazepam to help with any withdrawal symptoms and then I had a phone appointment with the doctor a few days later to check up on me. I had very minor withdrawal symptoms. I did take my first dose of diazepam before I really felt anything because I was so stressed about withdrawals so I don’t know if that helped but I barely had to take any after that, all I felt was some anxiety and a little shaky. I also started Naltrexone once I was done with the withdrawals but so far have no desire to try TSM. 

I’m now seeing a psychologist (who’s also awesome) who specialises in addiction because my doctor was correct in saying that there’s no point in getting me to stop drinking, if we aren’t going to treat why I drink in the first place. And the reason I drank was to numb any negative feelings I was experiencing (which is silly considering alcohol is a depressant but addiction isn’t often logical). 

So it’s been a bit of a roller coaster of emotions these last couple of weeks. Mornings I find easy because I never really was a day drinker, but I’m often really low in the evenings. I haven’t even really craved a drink since I put the bottle down for the final time, but I’m missing having something to look forward to every night. Right now I’m just trying to keep myself busy, drinking a lot of flavoured sparkling water and reminding myself how much better I feel already. There have been so many positives to not drinking in just my short time of sobriety. 

I don’t really know why I wrote this, I guess because this was something I needed to read when I was looking at getting help but was way too terrified to talk to a doctor because I didn’t know what to expect. But asking for help honestly saved my life because I would have just kept it to myself, pretending I had this under control and that I could do this all by myself. But I couldn’t. And that’s okay.

I was mortified in the morning when I woke up bruised and cuts on my face as I started to remember the previous evening and what i put my son through. I woke him up to apologise and to tell him I was finished with alcohol. He smiled broadly with a look of hope in his eyes. I haven't touched a drop since then and I feel amazing. The first week was awful (bad withdrawls) but my son and i are so much closer now that I'm sober. I pray that I continue to feel this positive and have lots of hope for the future.

And I would have assumed that those two weeks would have been absolutely miserable if I did. Instead, I have had the exact opposite experience. These are the things that I've noticed over the past two weeks:

* I'm sleeping better than ever--no more waking up at 3 or 4 in the morning a sweaty, nervous wreck. My body doesn't itch so badly that I can't fall asleep. I wake up in the morning feeling refreshed and ready to spend the day being active and productive instead of suffering with a hangover and cursing myself for drinking to excess the night before.
* My body feels *so* much better. My skin used to be dry and itchy, my face was red, I had mysterious bruises on my legs and arms, my digestive system was fucked up. Within days of quitting booze, my skin began clearing up and the redness on my face dissipated. I was actually remembering to moisturize at night and in the morning because I wasn't drunk or hungover. My digestive system was fucked for the first four days or so, and I was seriously worried that it would never improve, but with regular probiotics the issues started clearing up. No more mystery bruises because I'm not drunkenly slamming into shit! 
* My mood has improved. I have depression, anxiety, and PTSD, and self-medicating was a huge reason that I drank. I spent so long thinking that alcohol would help me numb the pain, but it was doing the exact opposite. I've  started talking to a therapist again and began medication which has helped a lot. I still struggle with mental health issues but I am feeling so much better now that I'm not consuming a depressant multiple times a week. 
* I don't need alcohol to enjoy myself. I can go on walks, hang out with my pets, spend time with my partner, listen to music, go hiking, and watch movies without being drunk. In fact, I actually enjoy all of those things way more without feeling 'off' because I've been drinking. I've been having honest, open conversations with my family (not necessarily about drinking) and I don't feel the need to be drunk when I do. I've started making art and music again with the spare time I have from not drinking or recovering from drinking. Life feels way better without numbing out my feelings. 
* I don't miss drinking that much. I still get cravings, but I'm learning to 'run the tape forward' and realize that one drink too often leads to more, which leads to binging and massive mistakes and hangovers. I don't need it. Alcohol has never been my friend and it's time to let it go.

1) Sobriety required me to make and keep  a promise to myself. 18 months ago I made a promise to myself that this time, my 20th, 30th, 40th day one, that my sobriety was the most important thing and I was going to protect it at all costs. The making and keeping of that promise took work but has helped me along the way. 

2) It gets easier but it’s not always easy. I’ve had 6 months of “this is great! I don’t even miss alcohol” followed by weeks of white knuckling and reminding myself of that promise I made. It is a lot easier the longer I go but there are days I still hear a song that makes me want to drink, see a friend that reminds me of my old life, or catch sight of a crowded patio (even during a pandemic 🙄) and crave a beer. 

3) Not all of my friends were supportive. Just before my 6 month sober date, I was telling an old friend that I was tempted to drink again and she told me to drink. Hearing that showed me she didn’t really have my back and we’re not friends anymore. 

4) Sobriety has improved every area of my life. I took years to finally commit.  The main reason was because I thought alcohol was the gatekeeper to my happiness. I thought, like so many, that without alcohol I would never date, never have sex, never go out with friends, and never have fun. Although it’s changed a lot of these things (I don’t randomly hook up with people anymore) sobriety has also improved all of these things (I meet people I have a connection with and move at a normal pace). I’ve never felt more confident, never held better conversations, and never felt more secure in all of my decisions than I do now. 

5) I understand my worth. This may sound cheesy to some but it’s true. Not putting poison into my body has made me sit back and wonder why I ever did. Why didn’t I think I was interesting enough without it? Why didn’t I think I could hold conversations or have fun? Why did I feel, deep down, unloveable? It makes me sad to look back at how little I valued my worth or my body. I’m so proud to be here to remind all of you that YOU are all worthy of love and happiness and you don’t need alcohol to get it.

* I was anxious, lethargic, stressed, ""too busy,"" and full of shame and imposter syndrome at work
* I was afraid to make eye contact with my neighbors - afraid they just saw that drunk girl trying to mow her lawn again, coming back with another six pack, looking like hell checking the mail. I am a homeowner and part of my excitement was to really be part of a neighborhood - I was just embarrassed with myself. 
* I was self-absorbed, a poor listener, a poor partner, and had started to lose contact with friends
* I was losing my sex drive almost completely
* I saw pictures of myself in a bathing suit that shocked me, and my hair has felt like straw for over ten years - without dying or straightening it. I took no pride in how I looked at all, I hated my face and had just given up
* The food I wanted to eat was all bread or cheese
* I wasn't making time for the things I say I love to do - like hiking, kayaking, or camping - partly because if a park didn't allow alcohol I wouldn't go, and partly because...
* I wasn't planning long-term. I would say I wanted to do things out loud, but not make concrete steps, not act at the right time. Just no sense of initiative
* I experienced little joy in moving my body. Workouts were a chore that left me frustrated, and I felt fatigued just moving around in daily life
* Chronic insomnia - some of which I've had since a child - that would leave me with 5-6 hours of sleep a night or ""benders"" of 3 weeks of shitty sleep
* A disorganized house, an overgrown lawn, pets that could use more care, and no sense of pride in my home - adding to these shame spirals. 
* My dad is an alcoholic who hasn't had a drink in 35 years. My mom is an alcoholic who is everything I am afraid to become. She is close-minded, racist, fearful, anxious, defensive, and cuts me down to my core when she drinks. She has so much potential to be a good person, but alcohol has made her small. She will be angry with me when she finds out I am not drinking, since she knows I never drank like her, but my sense of self is already stronger.  


**How I'm Doing on Day 12** 

* When I am reminded of someone, I text them to let them know instead of letting the thought pass and missing contact with them for months or years. I take the initiative to check on my friends and ask them how they are doing. 
* I am starting to sleep better. Even on a bad night, I have plenty of energy and am up before my alarm every day.
* My lawn (of weeds!) is mowed, my plants are thriving. I have been so much more observant about them (and the clouds, and birds... etc.) and looking for and finding new growth. My dogs are trained and walked, my aquarium water tested regularly, my birds are spoiled rotten and I'm thinking of building them an outdoor aviary for mild weather. I can't wait to ditch my lawn completely and plant flowers everywhere once the weather cools down...
* Meaning I have long term plans now! Loads of them! And I'm using my budgeting app to make sure I have the resources to put them in action
* I lost 4 lbs! Not counting calories or keto or anything, but just not having 2-6 high ABV beers a day and craving better foods. I also have more time, energy, and interest towards cooking (which is not my favorite). I went from eating bagels and cream cheese and pasta every day to today's menu - scrambled eggs for breakfast, Halo Top ice cream to survive a Zoom call, baked tofu fajitas for lunch, and edamame lemon chicken pasta for dinner. I bought green tea mochis instead of Ben & Jerry's. 
* Great sex with my kind, supportive partner :)
* I went kayaking last week - I was the one to research and plan a new route, reach out to a (sober) friend, and I felt so competent and happy strapping my boat on my car by myself after floating in crystal clear water and a hard up river paddle. 
* Yoga or strength training almost every day - and the days I don't are only because my body needs rest. I look forward to it. 
* SO MUCH READING! I'm on my fifth book! 
* This is not my first rodeo and because I was kind of miserably moderating, I got to skip the gross lethargic sugar fiend stage from the first time I quit and go straight to where I am now. It is, however, 2020 and there is a lot of sadness. I don't feel the kind of manic feeling I got from my first month of sobriety in January 2019, because there is a lot of external stressors. I'm just glad a hangover isn't one.

This is my first post here so I'll keep it relatively short - I was a binge drinker for many years - It wouldn't be a rarity to knock back 20 or so double vodkas on a night out.  I started out in my teens with just a few drinks on the weekend with friends which snowballed in to drinking a lot - sometimes on my own easily putting away 1/2 litres of vodka in a sitting or 30/40 shots on a night out with mixed drinks. Over the years I started to feel distanced from my emotions, the fun had stopped it just became a routine. My anxiety/OCD got worse and I became depersonalised. I'm fairly sure alcohol played a part in this as it happened on my 30th birthday night out for the first time (while drunk).  


I never really bought in to the idea that I was dependent on booze, even when the hangovers became crushing - days spent in bed with the lights off became an accepted part of my routine and my hand shaking violently as I spilt coffee granules all over the desk in the morning was normal to me. I think in part the UK culture of getting smashed on the weekends was an easy way for me to overlook that I had a problem. I was drinking partly due to bereavement related grief and in all honesty because I liked the borrowed confidence it gave me. I've been going through depersonalisation for around a year and a half now which has been a tough ride. I'm curious to hear if any of you have experienced dissociation from alcohol/alcohol withdrawal? Or even just how you're doing now that you're booze free?

Its taken me a lot of full blown relapses to find what my definitive pattern is. That doesn't mean it won't change in the future, but I have something to look out for. It was key to me to find what situations were compromising and dangerous to me, but I've made a lot of progress in that regard.

My pattern, as I've come to see it anyway, is that having a couple of beverages one night will put me in a danger zone. As soon as I drink to the point where I have a hangover the next day, it's over and I'm out of control. Because I hate hangovers, and that will start me drinking in the morning when I wake up. As soon as I've had a single drink to help me with a hangover, im in full on relapse with no way to stop myself without putside intervention. 

This last time, however, I had a couple of beers at night for three days in a row. Luckily, my time with recovery and finding myself helped me to identify that I was playing with fire while wearing gasoline. Today, I stopped. Got back on my antabuse (for me, a sort of outside intervention or kill switch) without going back to my full on relapse. 

Im proud of myself, because I didn't push myself into the hell that is relapse for me. So today, despite my hiccups, I continue my sobriety time by celebrating three months without relapse. This certainly isn't how everybody counts their sober time, but its how I do.

I'm experiencing a weird lack of craving that I never had for alcohol or tobacco. I started smoking weed regularly before I started cigarettes or drinking much. At this point, it's been years since I've touched either cigarettes or alcohol but I still smoke weed almost daily. I don't really like it but it hasn't bothered me enough to put any serious effort into quitting. I did stop smoking shatter since that just got me so stoned that I'd be up too late and not get good sleep.

Recently I've been incredibly busy; I'm in virtual meetings and writing plans or doing research all day, then I have an hour or 2 to play with the kids (if there isn't a bunch of housework to do), next we have dinner and I put the kids to bed. After that I've just been exhausted. 

I usually sit in bed for a bit and do an online language class and respond to a few work emails. Then I pack a bowl and read something trashy before going to sleep. Several times in the past few weeks I've gotten as far as having a pipe full of weed sitting next to me and I'm just too exhausted to get around to smoking it. 

I'm not sure what to make of this. The idea that I could be engaging in any sort of addictive behavior and just not get around to doing it seems completely alien to me.

I was worried they’d end up seeing how much I drink etc and was surprised how easy it was to reduce my drinking at first: I lost 14 of the 70lbs I’ve put on in the past five years and was feeling great.

As lockdown continued I started drinking more and more on weekends, and ended up staying up later than my parents to down some gin or vodka or whatever. A few weeks ago restrictions got lifted and I’ve returned to work and my flat in the week, heading back to parents house for the weekend. I’ve really been struggling with drinking when I’m back on my own and it’s been getting worse every week.

My anxiety has been through the roof and I had a massive panic attack on Monday, got the train back telling myself I wouldn’t drink, and by the time I was at my flat I had 70cl of vodka in my bag that I drank in a few hours. Even in that state I knew something was wrong and I ended up writing out a surprisingly coherent account of what I felt like, which I sent to my GP the next morning.

Today’s my first ever day one and I’m committing myself to recovering as best as I can. I hope this is my first and last day one but going to take it one day at a time and have a catch up with my GP in 28 days to see how I’m getting on with everything. I hope by posting on here I’m making a good, definitive commitment to stopping drinking.

My question to you all is: how do you tell people you’re not drinking if you don’t know them that well / don’t want to go into all the detail? I’ve hidden it pretty well from (some) of the people in my life and I’m not sure I’m ready to tell them all.

Basically everything about me feels physically better, except for one noticeable thing that is missing. My bowel movements.

I thought that my re-found love of coffee would help trigger that issue, but it hasn’t. I’m starting to feel a little concerned that I’ve really only gone about twice with very small results. I was wildly used to drinking and having stomach problems, so things would come out... quickly.

I’m trying to avoid a laxative. I used a detox tea once but I was in pain from the cramps it was causing me. One of the main reasons I quit drinking has been because of the way it’s affected my digestive system. My stomach lining was clearly taking a beating nearly every time a drank, which caused my anxiety. Gut pain and anxiety are a couple of old friends.

I’ve been eating fiber, drinking coffee, all the works with no results.

I finally got so disgusted with myself that, 100 days ago, I got off the couch realizing what a raging dickhead I was after admonishing my two year old for a trifle. I strapped on my shoes and went for a lumbering, drunken, and painful “jog” around the neighborhood. I had been in counseling for a few months and while I was making some progress unpacking how I got there, I had yet to have that “aha!” moment. This was it.  Since then, it’s been different. 

I started running again. I’ve lost 31 lbs (14.1kg). I feel better than I have in years. I have more energy, more patience, and more capacity overall in every conceivable way. I am more creative. I am more positive. I am more enthusiastic. My relationships with my wife and child have improved dramatically as I returned to a better and better version of myself. I am more gracious, more attentive, and more present. I even receive gifts better. I am smarter and able to better connect ideas. I am a better golfer. I started reading again, which got me to start writing again. Daily meditation not only became feasible; but effective again. My diet normalized after so long of averaging about 1,000 empty calories due to booze each day. I got a physical last week and my cholesterol, blood pressure, and liver markers all fell to healthy levels. My blood triglycerides decreased by 80%! 

I sleep like a baby these days. The clarity of my dreams has even improved. My short-term memory has returned. I am a better friend. I am more responsive both at work and at home. My productivity increased dramatically. I got promoted a couple weeks ago. The craziest thing has been while it seems the rest of the world burns, my own little world has vastly improved. I know the war isn’t over and won’t ever be over. I know that vigilance is the key. I used to read some of these posts when people talked about things going well after they quit and think how can I get to that? Well, while it’s easier said than done, it turns out that if you want to do something, all you have to do is do it. Get additional help if you need to, but ultimately this is about helping yourself. I had to remember that I was worth it. Remember that you are too.

I’ve been lurking for a while because I’ve been working on getting sober for, well, years. I put together days and weeks a lot, some months here and there. Then six months. Then a year. That was - what? - a year an a half ago? Since then I’ve drank pretty much every day with a few decent stints of sobriety in there - once as long as four months. 

....And here I am. On day 1... again. 

I’m a 44WM. Well employed professional. Married to a good woman. We have two fine, fine, fine boys. We are financially secure and healthy, though I have always struggled with anxiety and depression. Nice house. Reasonably handsome and fit. Good family.

And this is my shit. I can’t stop drinking. I have everything a man could want.... except I also have a drinking problem. 

I started drinking when I was 12. The mysticism of the drink runs deep with me and with my family. It was off to the races after that. High school binge drinking; college-aged daily drinking. Then only a sixer here and there when I could afford it. As I got more money, I got more booze. And it really doesn’t get more exciting than that. I’ve done some seriously dangerous shit when I was drunk. It’s a miracle that I’m not dead or in jail. That sounds like a Merle Haggard lyric, probably is - but it sure as hell isn’t as fun as the songs. The movies or songs or novels or all of that crap make seductive overtures about alcohol, but it is all a lie. My unstellar and foolish biography is boring - and the drink makes for the sad parts - nothing funny or tragic or thrilling. 

All of it is, as far as I can tell, unremarkable. It seems like a lot of people with this problem have the same stories - various bottoms with various what-seemed-like-fun-at-the time causes that all boil down to alcohol. 

It’s shocking to me how prosaic it all is among us. All the same. Sure, there are individual differences..... but they are all variations on a theme. 

It simply isn’t fun anymore. 

It is fucked up that I like to get fucked up. And when I’m fucked up, I do fucked up stuff. 

And I’m quitting today

I have done some googling on this and I'm not really finding anything conclusive.

I am an introverted person and drinking pushed me to try to be extroverted. Or to phrase it differently, I drank to numb negative emotions, which allowed me to get outside of my dungeon, so to speak.

In the last 6 months, I have had to re-learn how to socialize in a healthy way and not use booze as a crutch. This is not an easy thing and I suspect that's the case for a decent amount of people here.

Do extroverts struggle with this as well? If so, I'm guessing it's not nerves from socializing necessarily, is it more because of the habitual nature of drinking / socializing at the bar after work? I am also guessing there is some level of boredom that extroverts feel when going from the social scene to staying home because you don't drink anymore, which means finding other social activities to take its place?

We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**Keeping too many plates spinning.**

If you have ever been to a circus and witnessed 2 or 3 clowns keeping  a dozen or more plates spinning on the top of poles, then you know that  this expression is worth its weight in imagery gold. The harried clowns  run from pole to pole working to keep the plates going, until  eventually, the struggle to keep-up overwhelms them and the plates come  down and crash into a million pieces. 

What does the brain do when asked to handle too many difficult or  stressful situations? It seeks relief. In children, the relief might be  in arms of a parent or just a big lusty cry followed by a long nap. In  teens, in might be in the arms of a first love or racing around town  with the windows down and the music up. For way too long, I sought  relief in alcohol. 

The “reason box” included EVERYTHING. I held nothing back as a reason  to drink. The good, drink. The bad, drink. The horrendous, drink. The  joy that brought me to tears, drink. On many occasions, it was keeping  too many plates in motion.

If you’re sober or preparing your mind to attempt sobriety for the  1st or 1000th time and you’re keeping all the plates spinning, I hope  you will find your release valves. Some of mine are brisk hikes, hot  baths, music, sweets, guided meditation, and spoken and unspoken prayer.  

What are your release valves?

A very close friend passed away last week.  His funeral was Saturday.  I missed the funeral because I was on a 3 day bender leading up to that day which ended Sat at around 9pm after drinking a whole bottle of vodka, and a 6 pack of beer that morning/afternoon.  I threw up in my mom’s kitchen.  Then said insane, hurtful mean things to her.  She’s been nothing short of amazing my whole life.  I feel ashamed and humiliated and sick.  This is not how a man behaves.  It’s how an angry child does.  I’ve been drinking pretty heavily since I was 17.  I stopped last year for “sober October” but really was still sneaking drinks when my friends weren’t around.  I’m done.  My Sunday involved a panic attack from hell where I honestly thought this was it and I was dying and needed to go to the emergency room.  And I’m no stranger to panic attacks.  I’ve always glamorized drinking.  It’s never once helped in my life.  I guess I always wanted life to turn out a certain way and every little time something doesn’t go my way I numb myself instead of learning to love the truth and my real self and the real world.  
I know harder times of cravings will come.  Almost thought about getting some beer today.  Shame.  Instead I went and ran my useless ass off until all I could think about was wanting to stop running.  I have to acknowledge I have a sick mind and body and need to heal and can’t listen to myself.  Slowly learning, but this has to be it.  
I’ve lost so many people close to me from drinking and keep losing more.  Lovers, friends, family.  It’s time to live in the moment or I’m going to end up never living at all.

We don’t live near each other. Every time I visit my parents and “home” (where I grew up, and where he now lives again), the highlight of my trip is seeing him. He always acts very “friend-zone” with me. Won’t flirt back but does give me really good hugs.

I think the longest I’ve ever gone is 4 months, which actually was very recent (March through June). I felt super amazing, and then I started slipping. 

I have a problem with binge drinking. It’s a pattern for me - I can go a decent amount of time without it and not even want it. 

But then I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner. And a beer or two the next day. Then it will turn into a whole six pack a night later. And then two bottles of wine the next night... so on and so forth. 

I don’t black out all the time, but in my binge drunken stupor I’ve said and done some real stupid shit. I’ve also pushed a few close people away from me, though luckily most of them forgave me, but I refuse to keep making an ass out of myself. Because I know if I continue on this path, they’re going to be done with it. I know I would. 

And the hangovers are just awful. The ones where you have the worst anxiety that ruins you for two days. It always takes me at least two days to feel “normal” again. Sometimes three. And I waste a bunch of time feeling sorry for myself. 

Bottom line is, I’m tired of this BS cycle. I celebrated my 30th birthday this year, and I’m just done. That’s why I took a sabbatical from it in recent months, but I let this dumpster fire of current events get to me. 

As much as everything sucks right now, it sucks even worse when you feel like shit and do dumb shit because of alcohol. It’s not even worth it, no matter how bad everything is/seems.

it was so bad that my sister considered calling the cops on me before my grandmother came over to calm me down and put me to bed. some of the things i said disturbed me. i have severe o.c.d. that gives me very violent angry thoughts on the daily, and it all came out. i drank almost three quarters of a 750 millilitre bottle of vodka within two hours and it hit me all at once.

i've discussed this with my older sister, who also struggles with alcoholism and wants to stop, and we've agreed to help each other not drink. it was a breaking point for both of us and i'm completely fucking done with it. i've never had such a disturbing breakdown that it actually made me want to quit.

i'm going for getting completely off of alcohol first, then getting off of tobacco, then weed. i need to clean my act up and get better and i feel ready to do it. if i can last *one* week without alcohol - which i haven't done in many months - i will be able to get past it. i have to.

Leading up to this point I had 3-4 different periods were I wasn’t drinking, usually ranging from 30-60 days. I eventually gave up and started drinking again after these stints and quickly went back to drinking every single day. 

My life never fell apart and I was keeping it together drinking, but I had damaged relationships over the years and was deeply unhappy. 

Early on I came here every day. I also drank a ridiculous amount of sparkling water. Ice cream too. I’d get home from work, try and stay busy reading, exercising, and doing things around the house. Then I’d have an embarrassing amount of ice cream and force myself to go to bed. The first few weeks there wasn’t much sleep and I was thinking about drinking a lot. 

Then it started to get better. I had reached this point before, so I knew it was coming, but this time I committed to sticking with it indefinitely. A lot of people will say one day at a time and that annoyed me a first, but it works. Thinking about never drinking again is depressing. It still is, honestly. Not drinking today is an easier pill to swallow. I’ve never woken up and wished I drank the night before - something else I read here in the beginning numerous times that turned out to be true.

My life isn’t perfect and I’m not the happiest guy in the world, but it’s loads better in every measurable way. I’m healthier. I feel better mentally. I sleep better. Work is better. My finances. Everything, mostly. The only thing that isn’t better is my social life. Lots of people I drank with disappeared. I feel lonely, but I’m committed to trying to find new friends in year 3.

I go for months without any, but then...","I feel that I have a different sort of issue. Maybe not, perhaps someone can give me advice. Let me tell you a bit about my story.

I am 32 now. I started drinking in high school, more in college, and then I continued on an off hard partying for awhile after that. I never saw myself as having a problem, but I also didn’t care. 

Then about 8 years ago I was charged with a DUI. It was a blessing in disguise. I decided to revolutionize the way I thought about alcohol, and I stopped drinking for many months. It was really no problem. I had loved binge drinking, but I never really had cravings, so it wasn’t all that hard. 

I had also read Jason Vale’s book called “How to Kick the Drink Easily” and it helped SO much. Like many of the other books mentioned here, it really helps erase our brainwashing into believing that alcohol is so wonderful. 

Anyway, in the years since then, I have stopped drinking for a couple years at a time, or else months at a time. And I LOVE not drinking. I love having energy, mental clarity, and everything else good that comes with sobriety. That’s why I’m able to quit for long periods of time without much thought about it. 

But that, I suppose, is also the problem. I forget about how bad alcohol can really be, so I forget why I stopped and then I start again. And I don’t always get in trouble. I do, of course, sometimes, but not every time. I have blacked out, lost things, embarrassed myself, woken up in places I didn’t recognize... etc., and usually that’s enough to remind me that life is better without alcohol.

But damn it, WHY do I always forget how much and then drink again? I’m so frustrated with myself. I only ever drink maximum twice a month now anyway, but sometimes I do something really stupid and I forget.

So, as is my MO, on Sunday I went to a party with some friends and got VERY drunk. And I had been in such a good mood before that and I couldn’t even tell you the last time I had had anything to drink prior to Sunday. But anyway, I got pretty drunk and I must have dropped my phone or did something  weird to it by accident, because there were some text messages to my boss. Nothing bad, but just a bunch of coherent letters in a row like I had hit my phone a weird way. Still. Mortifying to me. Of course. 

I am so ashamed. And I still feel the horrible hangover effect two days later. I wish I had an easier time committing to not drinking. I feel like my relationship with alcohol is just weird.

My friends and family do NOT think I have a problem. They shrug off my usual mishaps as no big deal. They know me as the friend who is mostly sober anyway. When I tell them that I’m worried about my drinking they think it’s not that bad.

I suppose perhaps it’s partially because we live in this culture that accepts alcohol mishaps as part of life. I don’t know. But I hate it. It’s quite a bit harder when you don’t feel supported because people don’t think you have a problem. No one ever pressures me to drink or even cares that much, but they definitely don’t think it’s a big deal.

But anyway. I KNOW I am at least a problem drinker, if not alcoholic. That should be enough. Alcohol is extremely negative to me. Honestly never worth it. And I know how much more beautiful life it without it. 

I guess I just have to try to keep remembering.

I am so deflated at this point and really need some guidance.  I am so ugly crying right now because I do not have a clue what to do next, as I want to get off this train so desperately.

I had so many wonderful responses.  I really need an Outpatient detox, as I cannot take any time off of work right now, due to so many conflicting mandated COVID-19 requirements in my state that I am responsible for and other deadlines, as I am Financial Controller for my organization.

So I did make an appointment and went to my GP today and she told me that what I needed to do was ween off of alcohol.  I told her that THAT was a problem because I tried and it does NOT work for me.  REALLY?? I asked her if there was any medication they could prescribe me that would assist with the withdrawals at home because that was what I was afraid of due to my current intake and she told me NO.  She said they do not handle that in their office as that is not their specialization, but recommended an Outpatient program, FCCR, that she said worked with people where they only check in once a day and they assist individuals with alcohol addiction ween off alcohol.  Fine, I thought, so I called the contact number she gave me and guess what.....they do NOT have any locations that deal with alcohol detoxification. They deal with Opioid addiction. I am so depressed...don't know what to do, thus the ugly crying right now.....I feel so hopeless.

So I set to Google to look for outpatient programs in my area.  I came across one where you check in over the course of 3-4 days in my city; however, they administer Phenobarbital along with other medications and I REALLY did not like this approach.   Phenobarbital.....really??? Is that the safest course of action?

I am not trying to be ridiculous but honestly made an effort to try to find a safe way to detox from alcohol considering my current intake amount going through my primary care physician; however, I guess I need to dig deeper.  Any suggestions for being able to medically withdraw at home??

Everyone's suggestions, support, and advice are greatly appreciated and I don't know where I would turn if not for this subreddit.

Thank you so much in advance!!

I didn't realize it at the time but I was pretty much starving my body when my drinking was at its worst. I've always had a lighter appetite than most of my peers but when I was drinking, I was lucky if I could get a meal in me everyday. I would spend the first half of the day unable to eat because I was nauseous from the hangover and I would start drinking in the second half, lose my appetite and eventually skip dinner most nights. My body managed to keep going solely on the calories I was getting from alcohol and nutrients from occasional multi vitamins. 

It's pretty mind blowing looking back at my alcoholic self with a sober lens. Every time I think of it, I wordlessly apologize to my body for what I put it through and thank it for keeping me alive long enough to get myself out of the funk.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9410322308540344}"

One of the more notable ways is all of the time that I've regained; time I used to spend drinking & recovering from drinking. Hangovers used to eat up at least my morning, and more often than not a good chunk of the next day. Now, sober, I mostly wake up early in the morning to surf or go for a walk, or take my paddle board (I live on a river) up to a nearby coffee shop. Once in awhile, however, I'll have a day which is identical to a hangover day, minus the hangover. 

Today, for example; I woke up with an earache, probably water trapped from last night's surf sesh. I decided to go back to bed, to see if it would clear up on its own by the time I woke up again. It didn't, so I'm mildly uncomfortable. I putzed around the house in my underwear, ate a little snack, put on the office and browsed reddit for awhile. I made my way into the shower, thinking that would jump start me into doing something productive on my day off. Nope, wound up taking a nap on my couch. In the afternoon I took a walk to a sandwich shop and got a junky sandwich and some chips and chocolate chip cookies, which I brought home and devoured in front of the TV. Then came another nap. I woke up from that nap, and immediately moved to my bed to take another one. Now, it's after 6 pm. All I've really done today is eat, shower, sleep and watch TV. It is pretty much exactly what I would do on hangover days. I feel a little guilty, but the guilt is abated somewhat knowing that my sleepiness is a product of being go-go-go for the last week, and not from staying up until 4 am drinking my face off. 

Does anyone else indulge in these kinds of days once in awhile? Just, do-nothing, it's-a-success-because-I-didn't-drink days? I try to avoid the down time because that's what gets my gears turning. Boredom is definitely a trigger for my drinking, and when I'm home alone twiddling my thumbs my mind tends to wander towards the package store below my apartment with all the fancy and delicious craft beers. But sometimes my body and mind just feel like they need a do-nothing-day.",25,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9828963875770569}"

I know deep down I don't want them, and my stomach feels like a bottomless pit of anxiety because I know its too easy to pick up a few drinks for the evening. 

I won't today though. Just today I will stay sober, because I choose to. I dont know what tommotow will bring, but today I will drive right home and deal with my emotions, fears, and anxieties completely sober.

One year since a night of horrible decisions and actions. One year since I last drank. One year without alcohol, and damn what a year it has been.

I got married, we moved to Colorado, we bought a house! I've new hobbies; Axe throwing, DnD, giving Warhammer 40K a try, back into disc golf. I've lost, and kept off, a surprising amount of weight (32lbs and counting), and look better than I have in years.

But most importantly, I'm someone my wife can be proud of, and I've learned to actually love myself for who I am.

I couldn't have done this without the support of my wife, my friends, my family, and the inspiration that is found here every day. Thank you, thank you all.

2020-08-11 15:48:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i7yocb/why_i_fell_in_love_with_every_reset/,Why I fell in love with every reset.,"Four years ago, I was on the fence about quitting drinking. It was an idea I had toyed with, but something I wasn't necessarily ready to 'let go' of. After all, alcohol was the central part of my social identity. It's how I 'made new friends' and had new experiences. I could melt away my social anxiety and be the confident person I had inside me without all the anxiety. How else would I make new friends and have 'fun' without drinking?



But as I got older, and post-college, those drinking days and nights turned into a darkness that I didn't expect. Sure I could quickly attend my classes and make it through college with a hangover. After all, American college is mostly a vacation -- we are paying someone to learn. Now we can do that for free on YouTube. Life experience far outweighs anything I learned in a college classroom. 



The impact on my health, relationships, and finances began to take a toll. The anxiety eventually got worse, and every doctor I spoke with wanted to just prescribe anti-anxiety meds, which created a death-loop. Between the alcohol and the meds, I was never 'sober' enough to actually feel anything going on in my life - I always wanted to be completely numb to it all. The bottle became a way for me to escape my overwhelming feelings, run from what I was really thinking, or pretend I didn't care about a recent break-up. 



I thought that I was the life of the party, that it gave me more confidence, and that picking up bar tabs was some sort of rite-of-passage to fostering friendships. 



Over the next four years, I did months without drinking, but boredom would creep in. What exactly do people do when they don't drink? Boredom was always my biggest trigger. I always felt like I had to get out and 'do something' or fit in by meeting up with a group of people to take that Instagram photo for some outside validation. All those things felt great at the moment, but I always came back to my empty apartment. I didn't know how to be alone with myself. I knew that the nights that I spent drinking alone, that in fact, I was lonely this entire time because I was never actually with myself. Just because I was surrounded by a ton of people in a crowded bar, didn't mean that I was actually with anyone. Sure, I knew a lot of people, and the bartenders knew my drink order -- and we had that silent manipulation of free drinks and bigger tips. But those people didn't actually know anything about me. In fact, I realized I never really knew anything about me either.



Quitting drinking was more than just stopping a relationship with alcohol -- it was really about gaining a relationship with myself. Something I never had before. I realized that every time I tried to string days, weeks, and then months together sober, it was a victory. A victory from separating myself from the old me, and beginning the learn about the new me. The 'me' that I wanted to show up in this world as. The 'me' I never really knew before. That's what every reset taught me -- even though I went back to drinking, it didn't make me a 'bad' person. I didn't 'give up' because I still came to the same conclusion that alcohol was not something I wanted. 



And each time I went back, I learned something new. A new path was carved in my mind and in my life. Maybe some relationships ended. Perhaps other ones blossomed. Maybe I lost a job but eventually gained a better one. Maybe I gained weight and then learned more skills and perseverance to get back into the gym and stick to a better diet. There was never a loss in a reset, only a gain of another vast array of knowledge -- through experience. 



Reading other people's stories is motiving, but living it tells a story to yourself because you feel what it's like. You know what it's like. You know what the crippling hangovers and anxiety feel like, and those feelings are the ones that help you realize what you truly want when you begin to think about diving back into the bottle. 



Ultimately, what quitting drinking lead to is learning how to love me. To not expect others or alcohol to fill the void that was created inside of me. I was the only one that could fill my tank. And I learned how. Being sober was the first step in that chain of events. 



I'm grateful for every day I have of enhanced clarity, introspection, and time away from alcohol. I don't know if this reset will be the last and final one, all I know is that I'm not drinking today, and we will see what tomorrow brings.



TL;DR - keep going - no matter how many days you have in a row

I think one of the reasons I started drinking was because I was lonely. I moved a lot for work and school so I never had a home for long, and therefore not many people to hang out with. Alcohol filled that hole. Took me a long time to realize how much it affected my life and happiness, so I finally kicked it.

First time on this sub, after reading other people’s experiences for about the last 9 (!) years. Apologies in advance for the long post. I (30 F) have had a drinking problem since my first drink at 15. In hindsight, I started drinking due to childhood trauma and crippling social anxiety. Unfortunately, I humiliated myself numerous times due to drinking in my teen years and early adulthood leading to more trauma as a result of drinking; and the cycle continued. I could not be in a social setting without booze, despite the consequences (hospitalization, severe alcohol poisoning several times, lost friendships and damaged relationships, mental health episodes, worst of all - damaged reputation, lost dignity and self worth). I beat myself up a lot - but the reality is alcohol feels impossible to get away from and I did not grow up knowing anyone who is sober so abstaining completely never felt like an option. I also did not have much of a backbone, so easily succumbed to peer pressure which I am shocked still exists at my age. 

Where I am at today - substantially sober for the past 3 years (a few slip ups but nothing catastrophic) but have been diagnosed with OCD - which makes a lot of sense. I know drinking is not for me and I look back at the past in disbelief at how much alcohol screwed up my life. Today I live in a lot of shame and also fear over blackouts. I would run away from friends and had many nights where large chunks are missing. My OCD fills in the blanks with the worst possible outcomes. 

I have moved home and am surrounded by old friends who like to drink but don’t have a problem - and I am going through a period of ‘why me?’. Even attending 12 step meetings I feel alone sometimes as my drinking was always a public spectacle and that adds another layer of shame.

I've got a neighbor who was a great drinking buddy. Before my life changed for the better by adding a wife and step kids, this guy and I would wave eachother over sometimes several nights a week to listen to music and shoot the shit while also shooting whiskey. 

I've been tapering off for a couple of years now, (unsuccessfully regulating) but a few months back my wife and I ventured across the street for a couple of beers and burgers with our neighbors on a Friday night. I'd had a beer (I promised wife only two before we left the house) when my drinking buddy got propositioned with some crown royal, and he began drinking it. We laughed about all the nights in the past that we were hammered together. I turned down shots more than once, telling him and everyone else that I wasn't ""opening that box tonight"", but promised we'd get sloshed again soon.

I’ve known for quite a while, and stop from time to time to keep things in check. I’m not a terrible drunk, and I’m not abusive or anything like that and I typically only drink beer. But I realize I consume more than I should and I’d be a better husband and father if I just cut it out completely. Edit to clarify, it’s clear that there is a problem because of how hard it is to just not drink anything.

That’s where things get tough right now. Nearly 3 months ago my wife told me she is unhappy and needed a change. The last weeks have been hell mentally and emotionally. I’ve posted a few times in the divorce sub for support. You can read the background if you want. So we have been living together in this awkward tense sad environment for nearly 3 months. She is getting an apartment in September. We have kids, 2 and 4.

I know that alcohol is my coping mechanism. And I am coping extremely poorly through this situation. I didn’t eat for weeks, lost about 20 pounds. I’m back eating going to the gym and staying fairly healthy. But mentally and emotionally I’m a wreck.

My whole world has been torn apart and I feel Like I’ve lost my identity. Practically 0 support network locally. I know I’m making the situation worse by drinking. Hurting any chance of saving the marriage, potentially losing time with my kids if things continue to go south, etc.

I had a friend, let’s call him Jim, whom I met in my early university years. He was a close friend for a time and we used to have a lot of fun together. We had the same messed up sense of humour and used to enjoy hanging out with our buddies, sober or not.

Jim was a few years older than I and as I was just starting to discover my propensity for binge drinking, Jim had already moved onto harder stuff like pills. I tried to help him but I had little understanding of addiction, not believing that I had a problem myself (and mine was truly in its early stages and had caused little to no dysfunction).

When I was finally drowning in my cups, Jim and I had largely lost touch but I knew he had moved onto street drugs and had fallen pretty far.

When I sobered up a few years ago, I thought of Jim and reached out. Found out he had been arrested for possession. He was trying to get sober but was dealing with some heavy demons, including intense homicidal urges. I left it at that.

Yesterday, reflecting on some things, I remembered Jim and decided to see what he was up to. I couldn’t find him on any social networks so I did a google search. Nothing other than his arrest from years ago.

Then I found a court document that mentioned his name. It was during the trial of someone who had sold him drugs that contributed to an overdose and caused his death.

He died with cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, other things, and an antidepressant in his system a year ago. Suicide? I don’t know. Maybe. It’s possible.

I cried today for the first time in a while. Not for losing my friend, but for the fact that I got out and he didn’t. I stopped and my terminal was sobriety. His was death. He was in so much pain. I can’t help but think that the end of his life may have been a kindness however I don’t believe that death is the answer.

Jim died at 29 years old. A steady alcoholic may die around 45-55 from health causes if not sooner from other causes. If you’re like me and Jim, where you end up in so much pain that you progress rapidly into advanced alcoholism and then drugs (which I eventually did too - pills for me, but I was close to starting street drugs), then you know the risks.

Stopping drinking is hard. The way we feel can seem evil and horrid therefore the drink is appealing. Learn to accept yourself and your situation, and then do something to improve it. Don’t end up like Jim. I am committed today to not drinking or using drugs. I suppose what I will say is:

That moment of love, connection and experience (<-Rick and Morty joke there). 

I see people post about not knowing how to have fun without drinking, but here’s the thing:  You most likely didn’t drink when you were in junior high, and you still had a lot of fun and you were really cool.  In fact, you reflect on those childhood moments with a sense of wonder at your freedom.  That freedom is still there.  You can still watch a scary movie and pop popcorn and have a belly laugh in the kitchen.  Or dance around your bedroom and try on all your clothes and hacky sack.

But I guess it never hurts to share your story and I really appreciate you listening. 

I don’t have the vocabulary to describe what this past year has been like. It’s simply beyond me. So bear with me as I stumble across my words and try my best to express my gratitude, love and respect for my little brother and my sobriety. 

I was 18 months sober from alcohol when my little brother took his life last August. He was 29 and I was 31. We were best friends, completely inseparable and just about as close as two people could get. He was over 3 years clean and sober, a much harder path than mine, one that was consumed with heavy drugs, darkness and mental illness. Which came first, the drugs or the mental illness? I don’t think we will ever know. He was a genius and brilliant writer but was on a mission to get to his darkest place in order to create art. This ended up ruining his brain. He was much further up the ladder than I was, he had the longest fall. But he chose to leave this earth completely clean from everything. He never went back to drugs or alcohol, essentially paving the way for the rest of my sober life. 

I’m telling this story because it is one of hope and deep gratitude. I had to make a very conscious choice when he died, I could live or die by drinking or not. My choice was not to drink. That is my choice every single day. It makes me physically ill to think about how I would have processed his suicide as a crazy practicing alcoholic, in fact, I’m certain I wouldn’t be alive if it weren’t for the fact that I quit drinking when I did. Talk about a dreadful thought...it actually terrifies me to think about what would’ve happened after his death if I was still drinking. 

He was always the most important person in my life, my “twin” as we often joked that we were the same person. And although he could barely make it every single day, he kept holding on and gave me 18 months of togetherness, he showed me his soul and I bravely showed him mine. He courageously taught me all about kindness and love, always letting me know in the end not to worry, that everything would be ok. And we were sober, together. 

It’s so insane how quickly life can change and how much we are able to learn without alcohol in our lives. He and I used to joke about a book that my mom had displayed on one of the bookshelves called “Gratitude and Trust.” We used to assume she put it where we could see it and we’d howl about it.  Now, I look at that title every single day and my reaction is completely different. I see the word gratitude and I immediately fall to my knees with an overwhelming amount of just feeling grateful that I ever knew him. Even if it was for only 29 years, thank God, thank the universe, thank you spirit guides for giving me the gift of him for any period of time. That then flows into the thought about my sobriety. Like WOW, am I so grateful to be sober. Quitting drinking simply saved my life. I was the most black and white person when I was a practicing alcoholic, I thought, oh my God, if I quit drinking my life will be over. Little did I know it would actually begin the day I decided I’d never drink again. 

I will not drink with you today. Even in the worst, most horrific times, we can make a choice not to drink. If I can live through this sober, you can too.

I came in to find water pouring out of the light switch on the wall and from the light above the shower.  I shut the power off to the bathroom and because it was midnight just secured things the best I could.  Saturday AM, I emailed the unit owner and contacted my home warranty place.  Around the same time, I started getting a massive headache and severe tooth pain from a wisdom tooth.  The warranty place and I have drastically different definitions of the word emergency, so no plumber until Monday morning at the earliest; mind you, water is still pouring in unabated this entire time.  

Sunday evening, the tooth pain has become a throbbing coil of hot iron in mouth - I've run out of aspirin at this point  and the bathroom situation is just getting worse by the minute.  At that point, my thoughts turn to vodka.  I KNOW, that after a couple drinks, the pain in my mouth will be gone and the disaster in my bathroom will not seem so bad.  This is not drinking for enjoyment, it's drinking to cope - that is my jam and I know it works.  

Instead I throw on a video game, a glass of iced tea - the coolness helps abate the pain slightly - and turn in early tossing and turning to try and find a position where my mouth hurts less and I'm not smelling the dank interior wall smell wafting from my bathroom.  

Monday, my next door neighbor sends a building wide email this his bathroom has been getting flooded as well, so I alert them to mine.  The unit owner above me is out of town but states no one is living in her place, so the building management company (with owner's permission) breaks into the unit, finds the tenant, the broken toilet and FINALLY stops the water pouring into my bathroom.  

End result, bathroom somewhat destroyed but the building has agreed to repair my damages and not bill me, the tooth pain is finally fading, and I made it through an extremely shitty weekend sober.  It's not a bomb going off in a port - I'm not oblivious to the big picture - but man, I really wanted that drink Sunday night...

I am suspicious that people are just lying about sobriety in the same way that married people lie about how great married life is, as an attempt to make themselves feel better.

I was reading an article about people in recovery who try drinking again. One person wrote “I don’t want to wipe myself out, get drunk, bury my feelings, I would simply like to enjoy the meal compliment of good wine, or unwind with my peers.”

What is this guy talking about? Who the fuck wants to enjoy a meal with a nice compliment of wine? The whole point is to get as drunk as possible and bury those feelings way down. To have that feeling of...god, it’s like freedom and invigoration. As in, look how far I can push things, and how wild the world seems when you’ve got drink in you. Come on now, let’s go, let’s get into it. THAT’S the point. Instead of this dreary life of restraint and dullness. 

Are these people just in complete denial when they say they don’t want that? To me this is like someone saying, I don’t want to have sex with a supermodel who has a rockin body with big tits, curvy ass, and a gorgeous face. Instead, I would rather have some drab woman with no curves and a plain face. What gives? 

Was your life so completely fucked that when you got some crappy job and a crappy apartment, you considered that a major improvement in life? If so, why did I ever listen to anybody in recovery? 

People in recovery meetings, which I haven’t attended in over 2 years, are a peculiar combination of dimwitted narcissism and neurotic. They sort of remind of a dog that is eyeing another dog and itching for a fight, and would haul off in a moment if they weren’t being held back with a leash. They have that type of frantic, primitive energy to them. Also, they seem to believe that repression is strength, and where before they prided themselves on how much they could drink and how crazy they were, now they pride themselves on how much they don’t drink and how mild mannered they are. Two sides of the same featureless coin. These are some of the most unattractive people I’ve ever met, personality and affect wise.

Don’t tell me to work the steps. I don’t need AA to stay sober. I’m just wondering if there’s anyone else brave enough to join me in saying, “you know, this seems an awful lot like a bunch of lame has-beens who are telling tall tales about how wonderful sobriety is because they’re steeped in denial about how dull they all are.”",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.990418016910553}"

We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Soren Kierkegaard said, “It is perfectly true as philosophers say,  that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other  proposition, that it must lived forwards.”

I’m going to reword it to say, “It is perfectly true as Soberists  say, that our drinking can only be understood when we’re looking back on  it with sober eyes, all the while, we must carry-on living life looking  forward.” 

As a Soberist, I have not yet come close to understanding why I  drank, nor why I allowed alcohol to make an insidious creep into my  daily living until it was in charge, and I was clearly - not! Today, I  am deeply thankful that I had the presence of mind to collect a few  tools that led me to my day one. 

My tools:

* An article in which Jaime Lee Curtis describes her addiction, being  “caught red-handed”, getting treatment, and her fierce desire to protect  her sobriety, which includes hosting lots of on-set AA meetings and her  attendance at meetings where she didn’t even speak the language. 
* A friend on Facebook that was “out” about her sobriety, a relapse,  and her ongoing work to live a sober life. She’s a brave, cool woman  that I admire simply because she outed herself, that in doing so, she  might help even one person. (Also, she’s gorgeous and she shaves her  head, and that’s just fucking cool.) 
* Samples of books about sobriety on my Kindle app, too many too list.  I did buy some of them and many I know I will read eventually. 
* Some simple self-conducted research about Ethanol that made me aware that on a molecular level, I was drinking something, *daily and in too great of volume*,  that is in automobile fuel, and has many industrial uses. All of which,  I might add, came with warnings about wearing proper PPE, adequate  ventilation, etc. For some reason, the part I clung to was a warning  about accidental consumption by a human baby or a puppy. 
* This sub. I stumbled upon this sub, and I borrowed your strength.  You all completed my “starter” toolkit.  You see, my heart was willing, but the flesh was addicted. I was OH SO  keenly aware that I could promise myself something grand at 3am, and by  3pm, the promise was forgotten and I was counting down the minutes to  6pm when I could swing into the grocery store for yet another bottle of  wine, 6pk of beer, etc. 

What is the best thing in your tool belt?

2020-08-10 22:32:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i7je08/book_movie_tuesday/,Book & Movie Tuesday,"Hey there everyone! Happy Tuesday! 

As always, looking forward to hearing about what you're reading and watching and listening to. 

I just want to mention podcasts this week. Podcasts as they relate to sobriety are on my mind recently. I know there are a lot of great ones that are dedicated specifically to sobriety, but honestly I do not listen to those that much anymore. Mercifully, the daily agony of wanting a drink is simply no longer a fact of my life and I don't feel the need for that sort of constant reassurance and camaraderie that I did in the first 18 months. But in the early days I spent a LOT of very therapeutic time with *Recovery Elevator*, lemme tell ya. 

So I wanted to mention just a few that happen to have sober hosts even though they are not explicitly about sobriety. 

The first is Dax Shepherd's *Armchair Expert*. If you are acquainted with Dax at all, you know he's very open about his sobriety and his journey through AA and the steps and he is one of the coolest, most out-and-proud soberists (thanks /u/beebeax for giving me a cool new term to steal!) out there. The podcast is celebrity interviews and sobriety doesn't always come up, but I'm always excited when it does. 

Then there's *The Daily Zeitgeist*. This one never (or extremely rarely) gets into sobriety. One of the 2 hosts, in fact, is a partier so much that it's kind of part of his personal brand, mostly with weed but he loves his drinks too. But the other host, Jack O'Brien, is sober. He never brings it up but if someone asks him about what his favorite cocktail is or something like that, he unabashedly just says he's sober and leaves it at that-- nbd. This kind of thrills me because he's a young (well he's young to my old-ass mind anyway), hip podcaster and he just happens to be sober and it doesn't make him any less cool or funny than the ""partying"" cohost, you know? Every time his sobriety happens to come up on the podcast, I wish so hard I could reach through my car radio and high 5 him. 

And then finally, the one that got me thinking for this post: *WTF* with Marc Maron. I've listened to this show off and on for about 10 years now, often dropping out for long periods because there are too many good podcasts and there's too little time for them all but I always check for an especially good guest now and then and go back and listen. But now that I'm spending 2 hours a day in my car commuting, I have plenty of time for all the podcasts I love, and I've spent a lot of time with Maron. 

Maron is sober. It's not a splashy celebrity sobriety like Dax Shepherd's or Robert Downey Junior's or anything. For want of a better term, we might call him a ""high bottom"". But he had his struggles and he's done the work and he's a model soberist, IMO. 

2020 is a shitty year for all of us. If you are having a wonderful year, please let us all know. It would be so great to hear that, I swear! But for most of us, it's objectively just shitty. But for Marc Maron, it's been especially hard. He lost his girlfriend a few months ago and a beloved pet a few weeks ago. Through it all, he's sober. He has mentioned several times that drugs and alcohol don't even seriously tempt him as a palliative. He's just feeling it. All of it. And he hit 21 years sober on Sunday. He makes me proud to be part of the sober community. 21 years-- we're all right behind ya, Marc.

It got worse and worse over the years, but never too bad. This year my wife and I decided to get a divorce. When she moved out I had nobody to keep me in check. It got bad. 

For the last 3 or so months I had essentially been consistently drunk. I’d wake up in the morning with a hangover so I’d swig (more guzzle) some vodka. A little “hair of the dog.” An hour or so later I’d do it again, then it’s like why not another.

It wasn’t like that the full 3 months, but it quickly progressed into that. Friday morning I polished off a bottle and took a hard look in the mirror. I decided to stop. I had 2 days of really uncomfortable detox. I think I’m better now, but I’ll still probably get night sweats while trying to sleep. 

I hit rock bottom, so the stopping isn’t hard. I don’t want to drink anymore. Hard stop. I have 3 beers leftover in my fridge and they haven’t tempted me really at all. I thought about throwing them out, but if a friend comes by it’s nice to be able to offer a beer. 

What is hard is that I was using alcohol so heavily these past months to fight off depression. My head is clear now and I need to figure out my life alone after being with someone for 8 years. It doesn’t make me want to drink, though. Just makes me sad.

Since the shut down and lock down my drinking has only gotten worse. Where did all that time go? Into the bottom of a bottle, that’s where. One drunken, black out, wasted night after another. What do I have to show for this time “off?” Just a deeper hole dug into alcoholism. 

I’m so pissed at myself. I’m so tired of this. But I keep fucking doing it. I keep forgetting my why, or ignoring my why. I want to stop on one hand, and not on another. All my triggers are on high alert and I ignore them, willfully and ignorantly both, and fall further into my drink. 

My mental health is shit. Total shit. The depression after a day of drinking lasts quite a while. And it’s awful. My physical status is pretty crap too. No surprise, I haven’t been taking care of myself very well. Substituting food for booze and then binging.

I’m in jeopardy of losing my job(s) for call outs and poor performance. I know I’m a shit employee hungover, I barely made it through today. I’m letting myself down and my boss(es) down. 

I have a loving and supportive family. I’ve lost a dear friend and confidant due to the drink. But I just shy away from them. I feel isolated, with Covid and because of my drinking. It’s become a solitary endeavour that I tend to avoid/escape social situations for. These people aren’t going to be around for forever and I’m squandering it for a drink. That makes me feel pretty shit too. Or if I do see them I’m likely hungover and just want to get home to go back to bed. I feel so alone. And yet I’ve created my own isolated island. 

What kind of life is this? What’s the point? It’s a never ending cycle of day ones and blackout nights. I’ll maybe string together a few days, and feel SOOOO much better, but then the booze beckons. And despite my knowing it’s shit and will make everything shit, I keep going back.

Two years ago I was down and out, fired from my job, 80k in credit card debt, living at home with my parents and just didn’t care about anything. 

Enough was enough! 

I put the bottle down and started to slowly work myself back. 

Fast forward and I now have my own l successful business, almost debt free, moved out on my own, managed to get a GF and am grateful for the life I have and did have.

Recently have dealt with a break up of said GF...sober...shit was hard but I thank god that I was not drinking for this because it would have been bad and started an endless cycle of guilt, self hate, pity and depression. 

The one thing I learned in 2 years is that things good things and bad things happen in life, but without alcohol I can actually handle life head on now, regardless of what happens

Not sure if anyone remembers me, but I came here a drunken mess a while ago and leaned deeply on you to help me get my shit together. I did, so here’s my “Hi, I’m Dr. Cactus, and I’m an alcoholic.” I’m back again for advice. 

Last Wednesday at about 10pm, I get a call from my brother. He’d been in a wreck near my house and needed me to come quick. He was crying and distraught, I panicked and went to the scene. He ran into a cop car that was stopped to signal road work ahead. He was drunk. He blew a .17, the legal limit is .08. 

He was taken to the jail and released on his own recognizance. I took him to my house and let him stay the weekend. As a former drunk, I totally get the feelings of self doubt after you’ve done something stupid. 

However, in all my stupid things, I never got a DWI. Not that I probably didn’t deserve one a few times, but it’s not something I’ve had to deal with.

He’s admitted that he socially drinks too much. Thinks he’s ready to quit. Hasn’t imbibed since he’s been at my house. I think he’s freaked out enough that at least for now, he’s straightened up. 

Aside from how can I support him, what type of punishment is he looking at? I’m worried for him. I don’t know what to even expect, but I know I’ll stand by him. As far as brothers go, he’s a gem. A good person with a kind heart.

Alcoholism doesn't run in my family as far as I know. Dad would always have a case of Bud Light in the garage and Mom would always have a bottle of wine in the fridge but they never got out of control. I've only seen my Dad get drunk twice. Only took four Bud Lights (what a fucking lightweight.) My family was very traditional and conservative, but every family has a black sheep. I'm the black sheep. Despite going out of my way to be as edgy as possible all the damn time I was a good kid. I got good grades and I was a loyal member of my high school's drama club, which kept me off the streets and gave me a relatively wholesome friend group.

But for some reason my parents thought I was doing drugs. Starting my junior year, my parents (usually my mom, but sometimes Dad would help) would start searching my room for ""contraband"" whenever they felt like it. That kind of shit really fucked with me. 

A couple of years later I moved an hour and a half away from my hometown for college. The first night of orientation week I got high for the first time with some stoner kids that lived in the same dorm as me. I liked the feeling. If I could do it all over again I'd have just kept it at weed. But instead I would take whatever I could get my idiot hands on. By the time Winter Break rolled around I had experimented with acid, shrooms, painkillers, cocaine, and heroin. Luckily, drugs like that are expensive and I lacked the necessary funds to form a habit on anything. 

When I got back from break one of my drug buddies invited me into his dorm and took two gallon jugs of what looked like really shitty apple juice out of his closet. He and his brother had made their own hard cider over break and he wanted me to be the guinea pig. I drank four pints of it and got wasted for the first time. Honestly, if it wasn't for the fact that I was only 19 I would have become a drunk right away. I liked how it made me feel. The drugs made me reclusive but when I was drunk I had no problem socializing. 

The next two years drinking was an occasional treat, but when I managed to get an older friend to get me some forties or a pint of whisky or something I would always go overboard. When I finally turned 21 I remember my first thought was ""now shit's gonna start getting intense."" I was right about that. 

Now that I could buy alcohol for myself I started drinking literally any chance I got, no matter what time it was. I had moved in with a few buddies that I did improv with, so I didn't have to worry about sneaking booze past dorm security. My two roommates also liked to party, so they didn't have too much of a problem with my drinking at first. But I was the biggest boozehound of the three of us. Here are some highlights: 
1. I once passed out while heating up some frozen fish filets and almost burned the apartment down. 
2. I almost went out like Jimi Hendrix. Twice. Then proceeded to drink the next day. 
3. I bounced at least two rent checks because of buying booze before they cleared, meaning my roommates had to cover my share. 
4. I stumbled home drunk one night and left the door open. My roommate's dog got out. The dog was found but my friend never forgave me. I don't blame him.
5. Have any of you ever drank so much that you sleepwalk? I did several times. I would go to sleep in my bed then wake up in another room with my roommates either glaring or laughing at me. 
6. Threw up in a bush outside my friend's apartment. They got fined because of it. 
7. I would go to work drunk constantly. My boss was one of those edgy tattooed Wine-Mom types so she didn't care as long as shit got done and nobody complained. The customers did care, though. I never made much tip money. In hindsight it was probably because I was a drunk dude with a nine-inch high mohawk and a bunch of shitty tattoos that wasn't necessarily the friendliest bartender/laundry attendant. 
8. I got arrested for stumbling through a construction site while taking my usual shortcut home from the bar. I got off with community service and a fine. 

Around this time, my mom passed away from cancer. She had been sick a very long time but for some reason my family didn't tell me until she had been sick for five months. This started the switch from drinking to have fun to drinking so I wouldn't feel shit. This was also when I went from drinking two or three times a week to drinking every day. 

During my last year of college, I had a long distance relationship going with this chick I met on Tumblr. I was in Ohio and she lived in Oregon, so it wasn't like I could just hop in my Ford Escort and visit her on weekends. I had never really had a girlfriend at that point (probably because I was wasted all the time) and the distance really fucked with both of us. I was fucking smitten, though. All I could think about was finishing school and then packing my shit up to go out west to be with her. The funny thing about finishing school, though? It's kinda sorta impossible to pass when your blood is mostly malt liquor all the time. I only needed to pass one math class to get my diploma but I was so drunk that my grades were shit on everything. So I had no choice but to retake it the next semester. I broke the news to my girlfriend that I'd have to stay in Ohio another semester to retake math. Two days later she broke up with me. Through text. While I was working. A week before our anniversary. After I ordered her some flowers from a courier service. Have you ever had to call a flower courier service to cancel an order? It sucks. When they figure out why you're canceling you can hear their voice shift to that pitying tone. Anyway, I was devastated and drank even more to cope with the pain. Then I found out from one of her friends (who called to check on me, which was nice of her, I suppose) that she had been cheating on me with one of their neighbors for months. The dude wore nonscrip Ray Bans and played in an ironic adult kickball league. That REALLY fucking killed me. That got me started on drinking the second I woke up. 

Even though I would be absolutely plowed by noon, I somehow got my diploma. Using the money I had saved up from work, I decided to move to a random state where I didn't know anybody to start over. I moved in with my dad for a month and then moved to Oklahoma, a state I had never even thought about. Since I was in a new state where I didn't know anybody, I was bored and needed to make friends. So the drinking continued. No jobs that had anything to do with my degree were hiring, so I got a job in the kitchen at Raising Cane's. 

Raising Cane's is by far the worst fucking job I have ever had. With three exceptions, I disliked everybody I worked with. The stress from the job combined with being hungover every day led to me being the least popular guy in the kitchen. But I got shit done, so I didn't get fired even though I definitely deserved it. I would usually work 8-4, then go straight to the bar. At the bar, I would have four or five pints of shitty domestic beer and two or three shots of liquor (usually Wild Turkey 101 or well vodka if times were tough). Then I would go home, force-feed some gas station garbage into my system, and drink whatever I had at home til I passed out. Then I'd wake up, barely make it to work on time, and do it all over again. 

After a year or so of this, I started noticing red spots in my shit and I would vomit every morning. I figured it was just all the shitty food. My face started to get puffy and a paunch started to form on my gut. But I kept drinking. My situation was starting to look pretty hopeless, so I didn't give a fuck. 

Then one day I woke up in my bathtub after another night at the bar. I had no memory of anything the night before, including how I got home. My head felt like it was going to split in half and my gut felt like I had eaten a bunch of gravel or something. I immediately vomited and left the bathroom. My clothes, wallet, and keys were strewn about the floor, and apparently I had pissed  in my trash can. Then a thought came to my head: ""fuck this. I'm done."" 

I bought a sizeable amount of weed from an acquaintance to help me through the physical symptoms. If I wasn't at work, I was at home smoking my way through the DT's. Now that I didn't have booze clouding my judgment and had weed making me more introspective, I tried to think of what to do with my life. I didn't get sweaty and shaky during the first month, but I did have several anxiety attacks hit me out of nowhere. During a particularly bad one, my cat curled up in my lap. I thought about how much I loved her and how much I liked animals in general. Then it came to me. What if I tried to go to school to help animals? Sure, there was no way I'd want to go back to be a DVM, but the local community college had a vet tech program. Why not give that a try? So I called my dad and told him about what was going on and about my idea. He was skeptical, but seemed glad that I was turning myself around. Fast forward to this past January. I passed all my gen ed requirements even though they were way out of my academic comfort zone and got accepted into the program. Then I got hit by that fucking car and fell off the wagon. 

Now here I am. Back on the wagon for 17 hours and counting. I have my first class a week from Tuesday. I'm excited but I won't lie to you, I'm scared. I have a full course load. What if this relapse fucked whatever good brain chemistry that helped me pass all of my prereq classes? I can't fuck this up. Being a vet tech is the only career idea I could see myself being happy doing. I made it this far, though. Maybe I'll be ok. But it'll be stressful. And when I get stressed the booze cravings usually resurface. Hopefully I can keep it together.

A follow up to my original/intro post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ho5ks5/finally_joined_after_years_of_lurking_could_use/).  Sorry for the long post... again... TL/DR at bottom. 

I feel like I'm starting to lose steam. Here I am coming up to 33 days without a drop of alcohol and the reasons why not to drink are getting thinner. I re-read my original post to try to remind myself but it didn't quite have the effect I was hoping for, so posting to see if anyone had advice on how to keep going. 

**I've had a few wins over the last month:**  
- lost 2 lbs so far, i'd like that to be higher but I've replaced alcohol completely with sugary beverages pretty well every night. It's better than Rum, but without that I'd likely be down another 5 or more.  
- got through the initial withdrawal symptoms, which were much more mild this time likely due to the 11 day break in late June  
- went to my parents and **resisted** drinking despite being offered mixed drinks 4 times and wine 3 times with dinner.  This one is pretty big, my parents have a literal bar in their house and hundreds of bottles of wine, with a very open 'help yourself to anything' environment. [Pic here of just the spirits](https://imgur.com/a/nUtRvCF) (the cupboards are full too, those are just the prettier bottles). There's more there than it looks like, I was trying to sneak the photo so it's at an awkward angle.   
- according to my app I've saved $512, though the average I use for that is pre-COVID so likely would have been higher. 

I read This Naked Mind in the first couple weeks, and have been reading posts here daily. I've tried to discuss some of the principles of it with my wife, but she outright disagree's with a lot of it (the biggest one being that if someone is drinking too much, it is a character flaw/genetic/just that person, not the alcohol itself that is addictive). That basically boiled down to it's my fault I drank so much (fair to a point) and am/was basically just too weak that I couldn't just have one drink. In her mind, everyone else we know who drinks has no problem (that we know of) and therefore will never have a problem. I tried to point out that it's a slope, as the book suggests, it just depends how far down a person is on it. I tried to explain that according to the book, over the years most people who continue to drink will do so in greater quantities as time passes. She once again disagreed (despite me naming examples in our lives). The final thing that she disagreed with was the portrayal of alcohol in entertainment and social media. Since COVID especially it seems every other social media post I see is a joke about over drinking. My wife suggested I should get off social media if that's all I'm seeing, because she isn't seeing any of it.  Perhaps I'm hyper sensitive to it because it's top of mind so it sticks out where she just scrolls past. Though she is trying to be supportive, I feel like disagreeing about these things isn't helping me and we have more than once gone to bed angry/not talking because of an earlier conversation about it.

Not sure where to go from here, I feel like my willpower is getting fatigued and my brain is starting to say ""hey why not, it's not that bad"" despite knowing that alcohol is poison and we can't be friends. 

**TL/DR** \- small wins in a month of sobriety, but disagreeing with my wife on some alcohol related principles as well as willpower fatigue makes me feel like I should just give up.

I’ve felt fortunately great the whole time... no horrible come down for being a daily drinker. My stomach hasn’t felt so wonderful since when I had a two week break a few months back. 

I thought I’d be less tired and feel more clear-headed. But I have been tired and am still trying to feel not completely disassociated (I’ve always seemed to have a problem with disassociation, having one medication I used to be on making it 10x worse. I almost wonder if that’s why I always feel this way to this date. It was an anxiety med that did not work for me. I haven’t been on meds for over half a year now). 

The only time I feel truly in myself is when I’m walking, hiking, or am into a conversation/show. But sometimes I’ll look around and just feel, not here? Always assumed it was the alcohol because it would give me bad vertigo.

Anyway. I feel a lot better, but have been so tempted for one drink. But I know one drink for me means two drinks. Actually three. Wait just one more.


That said, I’m moving along and batting temptation away. I’m almost at a week, and that thought makes me feel excited.

Sometimes I think about the fact that two weeks is really the longest break I ever had since I was 21. That always made me feel awful. But, then I think about my friends and family and truly don’t think any of them can say the same. Maybe they didn’t drink as hard or as much as I have, but I don’t know if any of them can say they didn’t drink for a full two weeks. It’s kind of a shame how society is out here, in this state’s culture. 

Sorry for the bummer post. I suppose this is my down day! But I’m gonna make myself proud.

I was passed out.

I'd like to admit that I was reading this book called 'The Naked Mind' while I'd been drinking for the few days before the day I had my last drink. I do recommend it for others in the same boat. 

It's been a month. There's two cans of beer lying in my fridge that I haven't even glanced at since the day. The thought of going through that dreaded hangover again makes me sick.
Hoping to be able to take this further, one day at a time and be back here in 11 months marking my 1 year. 

This sub has been really helpful. I'd read stories here and be envious of people marking their small victories. I can finally be a part of that. My sleep is better, I can make plans and actually be energetic and 'present' during those plans. I can go on evening drives. I can respond to calls at 11 pm. I can respect myself more.

I am beginning to rebuild the trust that I broke with myself.

Yesterday I spent my evening throwing a frisbee with a couple of friends in a park next to a lake with the sound of thunder in the distance and the wind in my face. It's a memory I'll never forget. A kind I haven't made in years now.

I know there's going to be more struggles. I am not in the clear yet. There's still miles to go before I am truly free.

Quitting is easy for the first week or 2. But after that I feel that 1 drink couldn't hurt me. And then i'lll go down the rabbit hole again.
What can I do to get over that. I wanna embrace a life of sobriety and I really feel that that is right for me. But after a few weeks it gets a drag and I get cravings. That's my down fall. I've been a reddit browser on this forum for months but I have accepted that I need help.

This week I had a different experience.

This past week, however, I decided that I wouldn’t buy any alcohol. So for six days I didn’t have any alcohol and then yesterday I was at my parents house for dinner and decided to have a few glasses of wine. I didn’t feel guilty about it, and it didn’t feel at odds with my goals - i also wasn’t even excited for it, but just decided to have a few drinks.  I only had three glasses of wine which may be a lot for some people but definitely isn’t for me, and this morning I woke up with a massive headache that I’m still nursing right now. But despite that, I weirdly don’t feel guilty or shameful because I actually feel a certain clarity. Having woken up this past week without any headaches(I sometimes blame it on my allergies because I do have allergies but seems like this is a bigger culprit) or even the slightest hint of a headache made me realize how much better it is not to drink. I have just been eating Luigi’s Italian ice anytime I want to drink because it’s only 100 calories And it’s so sweet that usually one is just enough for me. I sometimes go for two, but again compared to how many calories it is to throw back several alcoholic drinks, that’s nothing. So I’ll still nurse this headache and I absolutely hate it, but it’s just kind of nice to realize that it is possible to find life without drinking to be better. I’m not in the honeymoon phase when people say oh I just love it my life is so much better but I am starting to notice the difference and I’m really liking that.  

One last thing I noticed the other day when I was listening to the book: she made a comment that when she decided to have one drink she realized the siding to drink at all with a decision for four, five, or six drinks and not just for one, so she would ask herself am I willing to drink that many at this point in time. I love that because I’m trying to get fit for my wedding and I certainly don’t want to be adding hundreds of additional liquid calories so it’s just another motivator.

I cannot explain the feelings I am currently experiencing. I've only spoken to a few people about my ""problem"" with alcohol. I was never a ""bad"" drinker until I was put on medication for my anxiety and depression. But I never connected the two until now.

I experienced a lot of negative things involving alcohol while I was growing up and watching my parents drink to excess and swore I would never do that. 

And then I turned around and did that. And I ruined a lot of really good things. 

Being on medication for my anxiety and depression helped with my symptoms, but the urge to drink and drink and drink until I couldn't fucking function was something I couldn't control. I didn't want to be like that. I didn't want to make impulsive decisions and make an idiot out of myself. But drinking was literally all I thought about. It was consuming every single fucking thought I had. I fought it many, many times. I have ""gotten sober"" many, many times. But I still took my medication like I was ""supposed to."" 

It was making everything worse. 

I haven't taken my meds in weeks. And I haven't had the overwhelming urge to drink since. And I couldn't figure out why. I thought, ""There's no way that an alcoholic can all of a sudden just decide that they didn't feel the need to drink anymore. That doesn't make sense."" But I didn't know what the fuck was happening. I'm convinced it was the medication I was on. 

I am sad and angry and confused because the pills that were supposed to be helping me were harming me. I don't want to make it seem like I am placing blame elsewhere because I still made choices, but sometimes, other things are at work. 

This is difficult to share. But if someone else is having issues like this and you don't know why, look into it. Don't just white knuckle it; do some fucking research, for the love of God. And don't let these fucking doctors just shell out prescriptions for shit you haven't investigated. Go to fucking therapy, don't eat like shit, make sure you're surrounded by good people, fucking get off your ass once a day, anything. And once you've tried that, if you're still not okay, THEN look into medications. 

Don't get me wrong, meds help a lot of people. I'm not discounting that. But sometimes, they can do more harm than good, and I wanted to share my story and my findings on the off chance someone else is out there trying to make the puzzle pieces fit together. 

If you've read all of this, kudos. This was a long ass post. Hope it helps someone. ✌🏻

I don’t think I was an alcoholic before. I did have a few problematic nights and days from drinking over the years though. One of the reasons I wanted to stop drinking is that things just started to all feel the same, with meaningless weekends focused on drinking. I wanted to work toward getting back to a point in my life where “having fun” doesn’t have to mean getting drunk, and get back to that childhood-like whimsy I guess. Most of my friends now know that I stopped drinking, and seem to be okay with it. All of my friends drink, and I’m fine with hanging out with them at a get together and just bringing my own sparkling waters as a substitute. I still like to have a good and silly time with them, so I’m not sure if that’s a bad thing and it’s just being a “dry drunk” at the moment.

I wanted to drink and to munch on food and shoot the shit on a patio in the Chicago summer. I haven’t done it once this entire summer.

I got pretty tipsy. I told one of my bartenders that I was on my 101st day without booze, so we decided together that we won’t have the usual Jameson shots together.

Had a binge drinking problem since my mid-teens, through college and am now 35 years old with wife and 2 kids.

Had my fair share of run-ins with the law, but luckily never convicted of anything (or never caught in a bad enough situation).  Plenty of relationships ruined.

My first real attempt to stop was in 2016, made it 90 days (with AA) then went on a beach trip and got hammered.  Since then, it has been dozens of badge resets, dozens of fights until mothers day this year when I really messed up and go wasted that morning.  I've tried TSM and Nal several times, failing miserably every-time.

What has worked this time:  I saw my PCP and told him what I wanted to do. He prescribed Campral and I take that everyday.  I started seeing a counselor that was 100% covered by my insurance.  I started going back to AA, talked to my old sponsor, found some new people to talk to and participated in the zoom AA meetings.  I'm not following the program right now, but will join a meeting every now and then just to see what the Group Of Drunks is up to.

What else has helped me: Coming out to my parents, brothers and in-laws about what exactly was going on.  It also helped my wife as she felt trapped by my alcoholism.  She was embarrassed and ashamed to bring it up to her family.  Our outward appearance of our family and marriage was much different than our inward.  I'm so grateful we decided to air our dirty laundry (though we didn't share every detail of our marriage or even every detail of the problems).  I have 100% support from both my family and my in-laws and am very grateful for this.  I know not everyone is as fortunate.

I don't go out of my way to tell people I'm not drinking, and I still have some social hurdles to get over when it comes to close friends, but this Covid pandemic gave me two choices, drink myself out of my marriage and family, or get my shit together.  I started on the wrong path, but now am on the right one.

Like my previous attempts, I'm currently living off of sparkling water, Waterloo to be specific.   I also will have the occasional Heineken 0.0 and THC edible.   Would my AA friends that I interact with approve?  Probably not, but it's working for me right now, and having a Heineken 0.0 after mowing the lawn in the scorching heat of Austin really does something for me, though I wish it had more carbonation like a Topo Chico.

I've had an on again / off again relationship with alcohol my entire adult life, but when my son was diagnosed with cancer 3 years ago that changed to just ""on"" (he's a survivor thankfully and is two years cancer free!). I drink socially, but also at home by myself. It's never just one or two even though that's what I say I will do. It's 4, or 5, or 8. Almost nightly. I'm self aware enough to recognize that this is not okay behavior, but the alcohol has a firm grip on my brain. 

I've made a couple half assed attempts to go sober in the last few months, but they always have a caveat on the end of ""and then I'll drink only on Fridays"" or ""if I can make it all week I can have a glass of wine on the weekend"". Which then leads directly into the exact same daily cycle. 

I hate that I go to the store every other day and buy another case of beer. I hate that I get panicked if the box of wine in the fridge is almost empty. I hate that I wake up in the morning with the same realization that I, once again, drank more than I said I would. I hate that I'm an alcoholic.

I'm better than this.

One of my dreams involved me waking up the morning after an apparently serious and long bender. In my dream I wasn't drunk, but I couldn't remember anything for several weeks prior. I had missed commitments, no memory of even making them, and the people I made commitments to were obviously disappointed in/embarrassed of me. I felt completely ashamed and disgusted. I felt I betrayed who I am and let down those that love me.

It sucked to wake up after that, as I was still in a bit of daze and the feelings carried over for a bit. But I'm awake, I can remember the last several nights easily, and I know I'm still sober. I'm still sober and I feel fucking great.

Dreams suck sometimes, but all in all they're just dreams. They can be stark reminders of why we don't drink anymore. I don't like using dreams but I appreciate the lesson they remind me of.

I had a couple of small beers over the early evening, and then once the cooking was finished, cracked a bottle of wine. That disappeared all too quickly, and before I knew it, when trying to be funny, I made the most appallingly misogynistic and just-not-funny remark about a woman who my friends know of, but haven't actually met. It was totally out of character for me, and even I was shocked by what I said - I can only guess what my friends are now thinking about me. It was a classic case of the booze talking, except it's made me question why the booze would choose to say that, and did it simply reveal a nasty streak I didn't know I had. I didn't have another drink after that.

But, I didn't; I stayed and talked to my partner. It was hard","Edit: This is a big post. I hope that's okay. I'm not necessarily expecting it to be read much. This is more for me.

I have a nontraditional relationship. My girlfriend is engaged to another man. We all live together. Tomorrow/today if you're Easter Standard Time is my 11 month anniversary with her. She and her fiancé have been together six years. I was married before. I'm very recently officially divorced, but the divorce began almost a year ago, a month before I began dating my current partner. I'm polyamorous, and it is practiced consensually. My last relationship, obviously, didn't work out so well. I was with my ex for eight years. There was a lot of times that I turned to drinking to relax/destress, and eventually it turned more regular. My ex warned me multiple times I was getting worse and worse. The men in my family ( on my father's side) are historically alcoholics. I've been worried about it.

Apparently, though, I had thrown that worry to the wind a while ago. I used alcohol to cope, a lot. There were a lot of issues between my ex and me. We didn't get a divorce over my drinking. But there were still times I was told that I need to cut back. I didn't stop for a while yet, though. There were a few times that I got completely ripped. I always regretted it. It always caused a problem in my current relationship because I was letting my drunk brain drive my emotions, which even still are all over the place.

It started Friday night. We were having a good night. Game night with friends. But things didn't end as well as the rest of the night. Something happened, and I got really depressed. And then angry. And I woke up Saturday still angry. Throughout the day my mood was like a rollercoaster. Eventually, I broke down and told my partner what was going on. But it took a few times. I told her part of it, about me being upset, but not the details of what made me angry. That was later in the night. After I told her, things got worse for a while...

This morning was really hard. My partner was stuck in a way. And so was I. Her fiancé had work, so he was gone for this. Her fiancé and her had a very rough night Saturday, too. There came a point where I asked my partner if it was even helping, me being there. I had tried interacting with her earlier, and it didn't elicit much response. And that made me upset. I found out soon after that I was being selfish. But I was asking for assurance that I shouldn't have needed. But when my partner told me it wasn't going to impact her one way or the other if I was there, it was like I had gotten punched in the gut.

We were sitting on our couch, which is kinda big. It has an L attachment, and has three big cushions, too. We were pretty far from each other, and I just kind of sat there for a few minutes. I got up and got my backpack filled with stuff for the day and almost left. I was planning to come back. But I had no idea when. I don't remember what time it was. But early. Maybe 11:30/12p EST. I was planning to be gone for hours. My partner's fiancé wouldn't be back from work for another 4~ish hours. And I would be giving them time to talk and have space.

Right before I left, though, my partner had started asking me what was going on. I broke almost immediately and told her that it shouldn't matter. I was a bit harsh at the start. I didn't insult her or anything. I was just very deliberate with what I said. Eventually, she asked me not to go. After a little, she said I should just go, and left to go to her bedroom. I eventually  joined her, and this was where my victory was.

I was going to leave. And, if I left, I don't know if I would have been able to keep myself from driving to a bar. But, I stayed, and eventually my partner and I talked a little. We started reading stories to each other. Scary stories. It was nice. I never got to do that before with anyone, read scary stories. Anyway, though. I know that I've rambled a lot. I listened to an entire album while writing this. This was the hardest day I had not drinking, and I wasn't even near alcohol. My partner and her fiancé drink. And that's fine. I even make them drinks at times. Those days aren't really hard, though. I am fine right now being around it. Besides, I like that my partner likes the usual drink I make for her. 

I'm coming up on three months soon for not drinking. This isn't the first time I've tried reducing my intake. It is my first time going this long with no alcohol. And I'm working to stick with it. I know that this will be very hard. I know that there's going to be roadblocks, and honestly most likely a few resets in the future. But, right now, I'm hopeful. I pushed through today, and it was way better than drinking ever would be. And I won't be hungover tomorrow for work.

Often, I’ll drink more, or try to spread them out on a Saturday, or drink early so I can sober up before bed, or make excuses why I need that little escape before the week starts. Sometimes, like tonight, the sobering up begins right before bed and keeps me up, throwing off my schedule and goals for the week. I’ll likely be sleepy and anxious tomorrow, if not hungover. But I’ll drink some coffee and buckle down like I always do and do a good job.

So is it a huge problem? No. But am I missing out on good sleep, early mornings, and all the other health benefits I get whenever I take time off from drinking? Almost definitely.

I’m just sick of this self-feeding cycle and want to know if it’s time to pull the plug and quit for good. Like, drinking, not life. Life is fucking awesome.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8446369171142578}"

We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Order, wisdom and peace…

Did you ever do a dot-to-dot as a kid? I found those exercises so  satisfying. In my little kid brain, seeking out and quickly finding the  next number, so the lines could connect and form a picture, satisfied my  need for **order**. 

Not thinking so much about where this **wisdom** came  from, but more about how I needed it so badly that my addicted brain  ached. I collected these pearls right here on r/SD when I was in my very  earliest days of sobriety. They still apply, and I’m still a pearl  collector. 

&#x200B;

* If you cannot have one, have none.
* You will never regret not drinking.
* Alcohol lies to you in your own voice. (*I named her Norma*.) 
* Alcohol is to anxiety what saltwater is to thirst. 

**Peace**. Some call it serenity. I like that word too,  but I grew up on peace. “The peace that passes all understanding”, that  is the peace I seek. I see glimmers of it every day. I see it in others,  and I admire and yearn for it. 

As a soberist, I see order, wisdom, and peace everywhere.  I don’t  believe that I am seeking the neat and tidy dot-to-dot order anymore or a  linear healing of my addiction. Instead, I am looking for small  fragments of evidence that demonstrate personal growth or progress.  IWNDWYT

2020-08-10 00:40:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i6yd20/just_hit_one_week/,⭐ JUST HIT ONE WEEK ⭐,"Hi guys! So I've been lurking here for a while now. Like, a *while*-while. After over 3 years of drinking every single night, I just wanted to make my first post here saying that TONIGHT MARKS ONE WEEK SOBER FOR ME. 


Damn.. I don't even know where to begin. I honestly didn't know if I'd ever be the one making a post in this community. I know a week doesn't sound like much, but for someone that literally did not, would not, felt-like-I-*could*-not go a SINGLE night without drinking. For me, a week is huge. For me, a week feels like a monumental accomplishment. 


About 6 months ago, I began coming to terms with my alcoholism. I decided I needed to ""slow down"", and practice moderation. I went 4 days without drinking, and ""rewarded"" myself with a few beers that night. Next day, I went without, and the very next night, I was back on every. single. night again. 


Over the past month or so, I realized and truly came to terms with a lot. Firstly, that moderation obviously doesn't work for me. That my body was tired, and weak all the time. That I've been gaining weight, and my skin looks like shit. That I used to be very smart and energetic, whereas now my brain felt like it was constantly in a fog, and full of mush. That I was spending so, so much money. That I was fucking miserable and had lost the ability to feel anything resembling true joy. That if I wasn't drunk, I wasn't laughing or smiling. That *everything* came second to drinking. Myself, my relationships, my personal responsibilities. Everything. 


So I decided to give abstinence a shot. Here I am, a week later, and I already feel like a completely new person. It's been incredibly difficult. Last night being the most difficult of all, as I was in an environment surrounded by alcohol of all types. I said no, both to others, and to myself about a million times. Faught with that attractive voice in my head, saying just one wouldn't hurt anything. That others were doing it, and it couldn't possibly be that big of a deal. Et cetera. I won that battle. I got home feeling like a million dollars. I woke up today, in my own bed, with so much pride in myself, and zero shame or regrets. 


So, yeah. If you were to have asked me, even a month ago, if I could imagine myself doing something like that? Even for just *one* night, I probably would have fucking laughed, or said ""I could, but I don't want to"". 


I just don't want it anymore. I'm over it. I'm happier this way, and it's only been a week. I cant wait to see what the future holds. If I go the rest of my life without another drop, so be it.. but right now, I'm just focused on today. And what a beautiful day it is.

We don't really go to breweries very often, so I brought a la croix in case the joint didn't have n/a options. My boyfriend pointed out that there was a blackberry seltzer I might like, so I ordered it, had 2 gulps and realized something was off. It was subtle, but was shortly after informed that it was in fact a hard seltzer (it was in a solo cup, so no label). I was so upset, and handed the rest of my drink to my boyfriend. I should have looked at the drink menu for myself. Up until now, I haven't had a drip of alcohol in 9 months, and then this dumb, truly accidental drink happened. After handing off the rest of my drink to my partner, I immediately went to the car to grab my mango la croix. Honestly,  thank god I remembered to bring it. 

Even though it was only 2 gulps of alcohol, I felt lightheaded almost immediately. And I didn't like it. I felt out of control; like I had no agency. I actually prefer to have sober conversations now. The weird feeling went away shortly after I started drinking water, but there was no denying that my little addiction gremlin was very much there, deep down inside me. I'm so glad I was able to resist the gremlin by just pushing the drink off on my boyfriend. 

I think I feel the need to make this ""confession"" because I've been doing so well. I've been really strict with my sobriety, and that's what's been keeping me on track. This slip kind of feels like a setback, even though I know it's not. If anything,  it's a learning moment. I'm strong, and accidents happen. I just need to pay better attention next time.

It was really important for me to realize that nothing was wrong with me. I am not flawed or broken or weak, I just have a brain. A brain, with enough exposure to alcohol, will change. It will change in ways that make stopping drinking very hard. My brain would try to play all kinds of tricks on me to get me to drink because it was now programmed to function with alcohol, and operating under the assumption that alcohol would always be present. This has nothing to do with character. This is neurology.

Alcohol is a drug, insidious and addictive like any other. Yet we, as a society, blame the drinker and not the drink, because so many people seem to be able to control it. So why can't some of us? Anyone, with enough exposure to alcohol WILL become addicted. As a child, you did not require alcohol to have fun or feel good. You were not addicted to alcohol before you drank, or the first time you drank (probably), it likely took many years and you had no idea it was happening because EVERYONE drinks. Or perhaps you suspected something was wrong, but hesitated to examine your relationship with alcohol because doing so is taboo in our alcophlic drinking culture.

The good news is... your brain can and will return to balance when alcohol exposure stops. Stopping has been hard for all of us, and that is why we are all here to support each other in this journey.

Be gentle with yourself. Being here, examining your drinking, and being honest with yourself about how it affects your life, are the first steps to a new path.

I've tried and tried to quit for years, but always come back to it.  I guess I am the epitome of the ""functioning alcoholic.""  I work full 8-12 hour days 5-7 days a week and still somehow manage to finish at least half of a 750ml bottle of whiskey every night.  I used to think that I wasn't an alcoholic because I didn't get withdrawal symptoms, but that is no longer the case.  The older I get the more I see the negative effects of my problem.  I have regular panic attacks, cold sweats, tremors etc. every day that I go without regular drinking.  I'm so done with being jealous of ""normal people"" who can go about their day without feeling like they need to drink to have fun.  I used to be that kind of person.  No idea what happened...

I got better, going from sometimes 6 or 7 days a week for a short time to once every 2 weeks. I thought I was winning, and to an extent I was, but I was winning most of the battles but still losing the war.

When I drank, it was like I was making up for lost time. My mind felt like it was getting a treat for going 2 weeks without. So not only was my tolerance lower, but I was drinking more on that one day, sometimes blacking out. I didn't hit anyone, drive, or do anything illegal, but my family would be watching. Not only that, but my doctor put me on medication recently,  and it really reacts with alcohol.

So today I'm quitting. Period. No more fake rewards, no more ""special occasions"". I'm committing to quit for my family, and also for myself.

Some lessons I've learned that I hope will help others:

Alcohol is, obviously, a depressant. If you already have a problem with depression or anxiety, alcohol will make it worse. Even only drinking every 14 days or so, I would be depressed and overly anxious for 2 or 3 days after that last drink.

Alcohol will steal your time. Not only will you lose the day or night you drank, but probably also the next day as you recover, or your production is slowed.

Once you get the reputation of being a drunk, you just have to accept that some people will see you that way until you prove to them that you are not. There is a difference between a drunk and an alcoholic. A drunk is a person who drinks. An alcoholic is a person with addiction problems with alcohol, whether they drank yesterday or 10 years ago.

Alcohol is everywhere. It is ingrained into our culture. It's at the grocery store, the gas station, the restaurant, the neighbors house, your friend's wedding reception, at the ball game, even at a little kid's birthday party. Starting out, I will have to avoid the places I can until my resolve builds.

Here are some things that help me.

Drinking kombucha helps me, and homemade cucumber lime water. Non alcoholic spritzers are great. I drink these when my body craves the carbs or sugar from the drinks I used to drink.

A routine. I've been laid off a while, and the lack of a routine just invites the urge to drink. I've had to set a bedtime and fill the hours of the day with hobbies, housework, and family time like games. I also help my other family members by helping work on boats, cars, and mowing the grass.

I've had to push the glamour images alcohol sells to us out of my mind and confront the ugly truth. I won't be the cool guy by the pool, yelling at a group of beautiful people to toss me a beer and be the life of the party. I will be the guy who chugs his beer too fast, makes situations awkward, and probably be taken off the next party list.

Finally, I have to be honest with myself. Even when I drink responsibly, it still makes me feel bad for days afterward. Sure, that six pack was nice, but I woke up in the middle of the night because of the alcohol. I slept in late. I can't wait until the sun goes down so I can go back to sleep. Thinking this way has helped me not drink a lot of days when I would have.

I haven't connected with you all in a while. I just wanted to check in and say I AM STILL SOBER! I'll have 4 years of continuous sobriety on the 27th of August. This year has been without a doubt the most challenging year of my life. I'm stuck in Mexico at the moment (due to Corona). My depression and mental illness came roaring back into my life with a vengeance. I'm away from my family and friends. I'm navigating the mental health system in another country. On top of that, I just got married. Um no one told me it would be this challenging! I don't know if others can relate but my control issues have been tested with my marriage! It has been an interesting time to be a newlywed - I am grateful I actually like my husband.

I have this huge list of shit that is exhausting. I recently came off of an SSRI which was one of the most physically arduous experiences of my life (after withdrawal from alcohol). Another joy of new meds? Vomiting. Oh vomiting for days.

I'm depressed, I'm sad, I feel hopeless (not always, but often), I'm anxious and I'm afraid. But guess fucking what? I haven't taken a drink.

The more time I have, the longer I am away from my last drink. The longer I'm away from my last drink? The closer I am to my next one. I have to remember that pain does NOT equal suffering. I'm hanging in. I've thought of a drink and I don't feel guilty. I'm reminded that of course I'm going to want to drink! I'm' an alcoholic. But amazingly enough, I haven't picked up and put that poison into my body. I have learnt that time does not equal shit. It is one day, sometimes one moment at a time. Getting sober doesn't guarantee  butterflies and rainbows, and I guess its a reminder to remain humble.

If you are struggling? That is ok. I've been standing on the precipice of I don't know what, but I keep hearing the message ""HANG ON"". Wait. This too shall pass. Its been pretty consistent pain since March, but fuck if I'm not proud that I'm staying sober.

Sorry for the ramble. No matter what, I will not drink today.

I've known how bad my habit has been for a few years now and have constantly tried to cut back (not completely stop). I've told myself that I'd only drink socially but then it'd turn into drinking alone with the excuse of ""only one,"" in turn ending up drinking a liter of cheap rum until I fall asleep. I'm so ashamed and embarrassed for the things I've done because of alcohol. The months spent drinking straight morning through night and drunk driving myself everywhere to play off acting sober. The sneaking of bottles in and out of the house to hide the extent of my problem. Keeping clear liquor in a water bottle beside me at all times so that the withdrawals don't begin. I don't ever want to be at this point again. Along with my alcoholism I've struggled to begin to medicate my bipolar disorder. Countless times I've lied about the extent of my drinking to psychiatrists so that I can begin medication only to stop taking it within the month because it's not working. I had an appointment with a new psychiatrist two days ago and finally decided to stop lying both to the psychiatrist and myself and do what it takes to begin this journey. When she told me I'd need to stop drinking if I want to begin the meds I didn't immediately process that she meant indefinitely. After the phone call, I made the decision that this was it. I'm quitting for good this time. No more social drinking. No more one drink a week. It was my birthday a few days before this decision and there was a few drinks worth of tequila in the house. Instead of pouring it down the drain I decided that this would be my last day of drinking and my boyfriend made me final margaritas. I wanted my last few drinks to be enjoyable but I instead cried for the loss of my long, toxic friend the majority of the remainder of the day. I am still embarrassed by the fact that the thought of letting drinking go gave me this much of an emotional response. This is extremely hard admitting this problem to the world, as I am not a person to ever post any of my thoughts or opinions on social media.

Things were going surprisingly well in my life even with the drinking, but I felt that if I didn’t get it under control I could lose it all. I came clean about my secretive drinking with my wife and committed to stop. That was 2016, I stayed sober until last summer. Last summer I was traveling pretty frequently for work, from the U.S. to France and Germany. I was with coworkers and decided to enjoy some foreign beers with my dinners for a few nights. It quickly spiraled from there. I was buying beers at the local store to bring back to my hotel, and drinking several each night at dinner. I told myself it was just while I was traveling, and that I would stop as soon as I got home. Nope. I found myself secretly drinking again, almost nightly. It’s unbelievable how quickly I had lost control, and how much shame I felt for undoing all the years of sobriety. After about 2 weeks it became too much. In a drunken state I came clean to my wife, again. I explained to her why I drink and how it makes me feel, including some reasons that I never told her before regarding my previous time in the military. We agreed that this time I would see a counselor, there was something deeper inside of me that I needed help with before I could handle sobriety on my own. A year later and here I am, still sober and better than I was during my last attempt. Having someone to talk to about my past was something I never thought I could do, but it turns out it was one of the best choices I have ever made. I spent time working on my problems, some time working on myself (lost 40 lbs, got healthy) and did a lot of thinking about my drinking problems. I would be lying if I said I never think about drinking, but I can honestly say that I really hope that I never decide to take another drink again, and that I’m strong enough to resist temptation in the future. So that’s my story - sorry for the length, just wanted to get this out.

I drank because I hated myself and my life, I sobered up because I was giving myself one last chance, one last chance to see if I was really worth it for myself, if it didn’t work, I was fully committed to the thought of drinking myself to death, because by then I would know I had tried everything I could and if I didn’t make it, then it would just be my fate to be an useless alcoholic that deserved to die (those are my thoughts regarding myself and myself only, not anyone else).

On the months I’ve been sober I’ve been trying to figure out who I am sober. I had to move out at the beginning of the pandemic because my father is extremely abusive and I saw things getting physical in the next few months, so I prioritized my well-being and my sanity over my mothers, for the first time in my life, and moved out. I got a great job not long after, sheer luck I guess, something in my field and where I can work from home. I adopted a dog and she’s beautiful. I am learning, little by little, how to take care of myself and how to see my own worth.

And in the midst of all of this, today, of all days (it’s father’s day in my country), I realized: I’m finally living for myself.

And it’s better that I’ve ever thought it would be. So don’t give up on improving yourself, being sober is only the first step, it’s not always the cure. You may be exhausted from trying so much, I know, but please believe me when I say: it’s even better than what you are thinking. Freedom is a surreal thing, we all deserve it, we all deserve to be happy. We can’t change our past, but the things we make from now on will also be unchangeable and they can be good things if we work for it. 

For all of you out there trying, I know you are exhausted, but please take a moment to see the strength you have for trying so much to stop, you can do this. For those starting, you already took the first step, you can do this too. And for those like me that already achieved it, I guess we’ll always be scared of falling of the wagon, but this fear does not control my life anymore, I’m free, and I hope you are too.

I'm close to giving up.","About 6 weeks ago I was admitted to a mental hospital for suicidal intent. Because I had alcohol in my system I was admitted as a dual patient and went through detox. 


When I was released from the hospital and sent home I gave a friend all my alcohol and weed and accessories so that I would not be tempted. 


This week I have wanted to relapse but none of my friends will sell me weed or bring me alcohol (I am unable to drive right now). I am feeling very angry with them for not helping me out. I even went to my neighbor's house last night and asked for a couple of hits and he talked me out of it, asking me if I really wanted to piss away a month of sobriety. (side note: I have nothing against weed, but for me it leads me to other stuff...) 


I am feeling trapped and angry because I feel like my sobriety is forced and that I have no agency. I don't want to be suicidal again, but life is hard and a part of me wants to just drink and die and get it over with.

My friends and family make it extremely difficult to stop drinking as almost everything everyone does revolves around it in someway or another. You want to go to dinner? There’s drinks. You want to come over and play card games? There’s drinks. Same thing with movies and video games, the list keeps going but I can’t think of a time in the last 5-6 years that someone wanted to do something and it didn’t have alcohol involved.

I never post in here but figured I'd give it a try to get feedback from people who are in no way connected to me. 

I'm F29 almost 30.

I've been attempting to get sober on and off for about two years now. The longest I've gone has been two months. I separated and then divorced my ex about 2 years ago and have been living on my own. He has been quick to move on and is now remarried with a baby on the way. He has been less than pleasant during this entire divorce situation.

Since my divorce, my drinking has escalated and this past week after vowing I am not going to drink, I've had two run ins that I'm not proud of. Monday while not having my child, I decided to drink and went on a bit of a bender. I started talking to this guy I used to sleep with and he invited me over. Of course, I arrived there driving drunk.

Yesterday however, I drank probably more than I should, got in a car to meet up with a guy I never met and have sex. I drove home plastered, drove over a curb, cracked my phone and I dont know how and I guess apparently punched something I have no recollection punching judging by broken skin on my knuckles. On my drive home, I get a text from my ex saying my son is getting a baby brother. This doesn't make it any better.

All I know is I need help and am not really sure where to turn half the time. I can make friends but feel alone and constantly have this void to fill. I really hope last night was my last time ever drinking, if not for me than for my son.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.998613715171814}"

Last year I tried to quit so many times I lost count - resetting my badge, resetting the apps on my phone, rolling over in bed all sweaty and ruined, aching all over, cringing, beating myself up, calling in sick to work etc...... you've probably heard it all before!
I tried to take my own life, and continued drinking after this when it didn't work. I was spiralling further and further down without even realising it. 
Lockdown hit in March in the UK, and I was drinking **every single day**. A quick run to the shops for a pack of 4 cans. Deliveroo some cans to the house. Get some more. Lets buy some vodka, what else is there to do? Oh no, the pubs are shutting, lets get out while we can and drink as much as humanly possible!
After, I bought some ketamine. I was going to start using ketamine by myself to try to quit drinking. At least that's what I told myself. But secretly, that beaten and traumatised voice in my head that told me to continually drink was the one in charge, telling me to get increasingly intoxicated. I needed to stand up to this voice. 

My girlfriend caught me ket-handed, and said she was leaving. I couldn't take it anymore, she was the only bit of support I had. My family are all broken up and living in different parts of the country, I never see them or my friends. I am isolated and helpless without her. I immediately flush the ketamine away, and get some air by going for a bike ride. I sit on a hill and chug a can of pilsener like it's medicine. 

The next day is the day before my birthday - my friends have ordered me a mini keg of beer to celebrate since we're all isolating. Delicious, great, with 5 liters of fresh beer I am unstoppable, the whole thing is gone before the end of the day. I'm impressed and exhausted, and secretly drinking vodka and gin when my girlfriend sleeps. I stay up past 2am browsing various pornographic material, playing videogames, drinking and drinking and curling inward.

Enough was enough. I called the doctor and I told her what had happened. They finally listened to me and we had a long conversation. I'd been seeing my doctor since I attempted suicide, and had been slowly working towards quitting drinking, becoming a better person, improving my health. It was not successful, my motivation was constantly sapped by my vicious cycle. 
When I first visited the doctor, we spoke about treatments for anxiety and depression, which I have been living with since a young age. My mother and my grandmother both suffer terribly from depression and bpd. I wanted to try everything other than medicine first, since I knew the negative impacts it can have. And I had finally given up on everything else. I just wasn't strong enough to quit on my own.

I was prescribed sertraline at 50mg a day for 2 weeks, then 100mg a day after this. I was told to keep alcohol consumption down, or if possible, to completely quit.
With the help of my girlfriend, I managed to deal with the first week or so of awful side effects, and maintained my sobriety for almost 2 months.
During these 2 months, everything changed. I became a happier person, a much better individual. I started cycling, I started reading again, I began to write more music than before. I was previously so concerned with self-image and being a tortured artist that I had forgotten how to even make art, and considered it dangerous to quit drinking, since my creative side would suffer. But it was the opposite!

I dabbled again after a big argument with my girlfriend - I went to the lovely beer shop I used to go to, I got the beer I used to love and cherish, and I sat upon the hill in the park where I used to go and drink when I wanted to escape.
I cycled back home, and the few days after I had a total of 5 beers. 
I didn't care anymore for the alcohol. The taste and the smell were divisive, but how it made me feel was unbelievable. My head was *pounding*, I couldn't think clearly and straight - I realised **this habit** is what was keeping me from becoming the best possible human I could be. 

I drank 2 beers at a BBQ with my friends, and woke up the next morning completely finished with alcohol. 
I have officially been completely clean and sober now for 41 days, and I aim to stay this way for the rest of my life. 

Everything has changed for the better, and I can finally see the bright future that lies ahead for me and my partner. 

It was the most psychologically difficult battle I have had so far in my life, and completely sympathise with those who are struggling to quit or even moderate their drinking. I am grateful to everyone who has provided kind words on this sub before when I attempted sobriety, and failed.

These two vices having been left behind I am now very level headed, emotionally I have matured a massive amount, I met who I feel is my soulmate and live with her now. I am immensely dedicated to photography, world improvement and helping others however I can. Although I was terrified before quitting, I'm so grateful for my sobriety every single day. I can't believe how much my life has changed. The coolest part is I can now use my time sober to help others.

I’ve been lurking here for years.  Years.  I have known my consumption has been a problem for quite some time.   I’ve never hit a rock bottom, never had any friends or family question my drinking, (maybe my sister, kinda, and my husband pointed out I was drinking more than he was).  
 But lots of personal effects, avoiding going places I couldn’t drink, taking extra alcohol with me, hiding empties, starting my day with alcohol, and not just Baileys in my coffee or a mimosa.  I travel for work, and the airport cocktails added $75 dollars to every trip at least (not expendable).  I joined a wine delivery at the start of a pandemic in case we couldn’t go out.  Everything an alcoholic does.  Prioritizing the booze.     

Also, I have truly gained 100 lbs in 5 years of daily drinking.   Not a good look for me.  And I turned 50 in March 

I am on day 12.  CBD has helped a little, my sleep is still shit.  This is the longest I’ve gone without a drink since at least 2009.  I hope I can stay sober.  

Functional alcoholism is the devil, because there have been no societal consequences to my actions, I’m just that fun person, good mom to four now adults, my husband thinks I’m great.

Alcohol started out as a crutch for socialising and has become a habit that dominates my life. Not necessarily in terms of drinking volume but rather the mental toll it exacts through daily cravings. And I've had so many excruciatingly embarrassing episodes as a result of getting smashed over the years. 

I've tried stopping in the past but three weeks is probably my record. I generally struggle to overcome this feeling that having a cold hoppy beer with friends, or a glass of wine with my dad or a G&T at the end of a hard week of work is what makes life worth living! Too often a couple leads to a few more and a eventually a heap of regret. 

These days I have young kids so drink a lot less, but 2-3 beers is enough to leave me fuzzy headed, irritable, distracted, the next day. It undoubtedly makes me a worse parent and husband and I've reached the point where I've had enough. So much regret, so much potential squandered, such a toll on my physical health and the lives of others.

I'm not going to drink today, and hopefully tomorrow and the next. I'm determined to make this work and become a next level dad, husband and human being.

I’m feeling a mess and just need to get this out somewhere where people listen and care about me. 

The times I slipped we’re always in part related to my marriage. I quit 12/24/19 and had a good run until March, right when things started shutting down in my area and we were confronted with a situation where my spouse would have to be the primary caregiver of our children, one with special needs, while I worked crazy hours from home. He was not prepared, not that anyone was, but he didn’t keep it together and things became very tense very quickly. 

He’s been working on his own mental heath over the last two years and was recently formally diagnosed in June with something that makes a lot of sense and from my perspective could be the way back up but he’s more pessimistic and processing the diagnosis in his own way. Just before the diagnosis he had a real breakdown, and went on a tirade about how much he hated his life, and everything in it. And so in June, I drank again. I pretty quickly right set myself knowing escaping wasn’t going to solve anything and if the frequency and intensity of the breakdowns were going to continue, I needed to be prepared and levelheaded for my kids. 

All this means the kids and I walk on eggshells and I’ve had to hire someone who is on the same page as us with lockdown philosophy, to help with homework, etc. so he can cope with more responsibility that comes with no school for the kids and the dynamic of us all being home. 

The hope was I’d be able to focus on work as the single source of income for our family in unknown times. I’ve always been the primary breadwinner and I’m very well paid so it makes sense, but I’m spending so much time doing things he should be that I’m working odd hours to stay ahead. It’s unsustainable in an already faced paced job  

Just before Covid I thought we were heading towards him going back to work, for structure and something to do, because the kids would be in school full time  but now we don’t know when that will happen. 

Yesterday he went on another angry, hurtful rant. Told me I’m unlikable and I’m always there so he never misses me. Buddy, we’re under lockdown. And I spend all my time in my office. I left with the kids. We have family nearby and I planned to stay the night while they were away for the weekend. I wanted to drink while the kids swam. I smiled and played and held back tears. I still want to drink this morning. I know it won’t help. 

I’m just in shock. I’m committed to not drinking and I think I can stay the course. I’ll come back every day to commit. But I’m terrified of what could come next for our family. I don’t know if I can keep supporting him only to have him lash out at us, at me, with now predictable regularity. I thought things would improve, and they do for a few days at a time, with new meds, a new plan. But the sudden swings, which happen all the time even if not total blow outs, keep me on edge. 

I don’t know how to get full time care for my kids so I can work in this environment and my child with SN does add some complexity there. Then the idea of uprooting them from the only house they’ve known. Ugh. It’s all so overwhelming. I know I can’t solve it all at once but I don’t even know where to start so I started typing.

(Despite the medical term, she is not literally in a coma; she has remained conscious, but confused, non-communicative, and very weak.) Mid-afternoon yesterday, she seemed to take a turn for the worse, and the hospital called my father in law to get permission to intubate her (he is her medical proxy). They said he should come to the hospital as soon as possible. He called my husband, and we rushed to meet him outside the hospital. At first, the hospital wasn't going to allow my husband in, but his father argued that he needed him there to help him understand what the doctor was saying, so they both sat with my husband's grandmother to await further developments. I stayed outside and texted back and forth with my husband to help him stay calm through the waiting. 

I was going to describe the situation in more detail, but I suppose no one really wants to read all of that. Long story short, my husband's grandmother's condition is very frightening to witness, but she is expected to pull through. By the time my husband and his father left the hospital, the doctors had deescalated her condition. After the first three hours, I went home to take care of our cats (you would have thought that no one had been around to feed them for days, judging by how they acted when I came in the door!). I made sure that there was warm comfort food ready for my husband when he finally came home. I am so grateful that I was sober throughout this ordeal. If I had been drinking, I would have added to the crisis. Sober, I was able to offer comfort and take care of the little practical details so that my husband could focus on his grandmother.

2020-08-09 07:47:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i6i142/now_or_never_time/,Now or never time.,"Well I'm going to begin by just saying it, I am a filthy shameful alcoholic. That’s not to say that I think all alcoholics are filthy and shameful but when I'm on the booze that’s exactly what I think of myself and I'm going to change it. 

A bit of background about myself; I had a pretty normal life growing up, my parents were decent enough and there was never a time I didn’t have what I need, although obviously there were times when I wanted things and didn’t get them but I guess that’s the same with all children, I know it is with my mine! I always had a bit of a thing about doing everything to excess, if my mates would smoke 2 cigarettes I would aim to smoke 4, if my mates wanted a cheese burger id want to have 2, I would always take any drug I could get my hands on and would also go as far as I possibly could with them as well and if I'm being completely honest, that way of thinking has stayed with me throughout my adult life and at 39 years old, I can’t really see it changing anytime soon. I am an all or nothing type person in every single aspect of my life and I've tried all so now its time for nothing. 

I have lost so much through my quest for excess, my physical health is starting to suffer, my mental health has suffered for a long time, I've lost no end of friends, I've lost relationships, I've been through a divorce that whilst would have happened anyway, was so much worse than it needed to be. My business although still up and running has taken a massive hit in the last year, pretty much all down to my drinking and if it wasn’t for the people around me I would have lost that as well. People have lost trust in me, people have stopped contacting me but worst of all, the people that have hung around are all worried about me and quite frankly I think its time I stop with the selfishness and actually do what needs to be done, if not for myself then for them. 

Excluding booze and my vape, I’m drug free now and have been for a long time, years in fact but alcohol has always been in my life, I used to view it as my little helper but it isn’t helping me anymore, its going to kill me if I don't stop. Who knows, it might even be too late but I'm going to give my brain and body at least a fighting chance. I've tried cutting down and it doesn’t work for me, I've tried proper taper programs and the end result is always the same; I end up drinking more and more each time I cut down and then start drinking again. I think the only way I'm going to be able to do it is to quit cold turkey so that’s what I'm going to do. 

I will always be an all or nothing type person, I have came to terms with that so I'm going to choose all for the good stuff and nothing for the stuff that will ultimately be my demise. I just keep thinking if I have built a semi successful business and raised three amazing child with booze, I'm sure I could achieve a lot more without it.

Lovely, I know. I just love how he seems to forget. At 3 AM our doorbell rings! I shake him out of his drunkin coma. I said "" there’s someone at our door!!"" He comes in and says, did you call the cops? ( he’s had the cops here 3x in the the last 3 year’s. One hit and run, he was drunk, the other one because he locked me out and the last because my family was scared and did a well check) all of those times, he never answered the door, same this morning. 3 cop cars out front of our house. He said to me “don’t move, stay here and do not answer the door!!!” Of course he can’t find our gun because he probably hid it in a drunkin paranoid state! What went through my head…1. Did I hit someone 4 weeks ago when I was drunk? 2. Did someone report me driving reckless? 3. Did I remove all unopened alcohol from my car? It was so nice to know that I’ve been sober 22 days,y’all!!! It was such a relief!!! So much peace soared through me!! Then, I asked him "" did you go anywhere last night?"" “Did you drive?” I went to the garage to check his car. All was ok. I’m not sure why the cops were here.

Lots of different factors. It was a perfect storm of anxieties, loneliness, and depression. For the first time in recent memory I thought about numbing myself with alcohol. And I could totally see how it would go...about 1.5 beers in, I would have begun castigating myself, and then stubbornly barreled ahead to drink all the beers. I could see waking up Friday morning, feeling shite, resetting my counter, and feeling even lower. I reflected on my current challenges and considered the fact that I have endured much more awful periods than what I faced in that moment. And I knew that no matter what happened, I had within myself sufficient strength and resilience to overcome my circumstances. But the critical question was, did I even want to bother?

I decided to walk down to the corner store, intending to buy some iced tea and snacks. En route, I thought about how easily I could instead pickup a case of beer. And then I just walked past the beer, headed home, and relished my junk food treats. And despite the temptation of despair looming at the cusp of my soul, I decided to go to bed and just see how things looked in the morning. (Spoiler: I survived.)

This is a fairly dull story when contrasted with the dramatic tales of defeat and victory shared every day within this community. But it was immensely significant for me because for so many years I trod round the same circuit in my mind until the rut I wore through constant repetition became an inescapable prison. But it turns out there was a backdoor and somehow I found my way out.

Thank you all for being here, for your constancy, and for your nonjudgmental support. I might’ve made my escape all on my own, but somehow I doubt it.

As for me, I had a great week. I strapped on the old Heart Rate Monitor and used it to constrain me to Zone 2. Endurance is a funny thing. If you want to run faster, you first must run slower. It was an exercise (ha. Hahaha.) in patience to run so much slower than I’m capable of and often having to stop to walk in order to get my heart rate back down. But, I know patience now will pay dividends in the fall when the heat and humidity break. Then, I plan on falling on my half and full prs like a falcon picking off a rabbit 😈.   

How about you all? Where did you come from, where did you go? How are your various fitness plans and challenges and goals going? I am actually doing my long run today - heck yes 6 am long run down by the shore - so I may be slow in getting back. Happy Sunday everyone!

To distract myself from my inner ""sober clock"" and to slim down I have done 8:12 dieting. Now my skin is clear and my waist har shrunk 4 cm. For me fasting and sobriety has gone hand in hand - I have to have the discipline to stick to green tea and water for some periods of time, and my fasting time is the same as my wine time used to be. So in my brain it goes ""Oh I can't drink anyway because I am fasting."" Which makes sense to me for some reason. It is not for everyone but for my system-loving brain it has worked. Next step is exercising on a regular basis - I am always dreading working out. I used to be way more athletic and being confronted with my own shortcomings is something I find difficult. The self hate and not obsessing over my thighs rubbing together or worrying about the size of my arms. Stupid I know, but it takes time to get out of this thought pattern that has been there for sooo many years.

We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

From so far off, I can see a giant crowd of little lights all moving  in one direction, the lights are so tiny, but collectively they are  fiercely bright. They move along at a slow and steady pace. There must  be thousands. 

A pilgrimage.

Going somewhere so beautiful.

The middle of the pack isn’t as swollen with lights, but it is bright. I see pausing, and then moving forward. Slow and steady. 

Toward the the end of the line of lights, the crowd is thin, and the  light is not so bright, in places there are small gaps, but it holds  steady. A fine golden strand, the light is more fragile. 

As I approach the line, I am walking my first steps in near darkness, and I feel afraid. I worry that I will have to walk alone, with no companions. 

I’m terrified that I am not enough. Not ready. An imposter. Not welcome. 

I can see her back. She has a steady gate, and as if listening for my  steps, she slows her steps, stops, and turns her head toward me, and I  can see her warm smile illuminated by the small flickering candle she  carries. She has been expecting me.

She ever so gently reaches her candle toward my outstretched hands and lights my little candle. 

I have a tiny fragile light now. My steps are no longer in the dark.  I’m one of them. I am accepted. I can see the path and take my first  steps in the light that I guard. I feel the smallest twinge forming in  my chest. Hope. It’s unfamiliar but it warms my soul in a way I didn’t  even know was missing. 

That day, my Day 1, I promised myself and everyone moving in light,  that I would listen for the steps and the ragged breath of the one who  will walk up behind me, addicted and afraid but brave and ready to seek  the light.

I believe the last time that I posted on here, I was going through a very dark and rough period in my life. I even saw a saved draft from a year ago where I was going to post how I hadn’t had alcohol in about 10 days or something but I never posted it. I had very few people to turn to and the people that I did turn to I always felt like I was disappointing deeply since I always relapsed. Today, I think I can safely say that I am in a much better place. I still have a long way to go but, I have progressed greatly. The last time that I took a sip of alcohol was in February of this year. I took another sip of wine a few days ago. I recently left a job that was mentally draining and it’s been a challenge. Thankfully I found a new job but the past two and a half weeks weren’t pleasant. I deal with really bad anxiety and some depression so that’s another battle in itself. But anyway, of course, with a new bottle of white wine being in the apartment(bought to make shrimp scampi with), I thought a glass won’t hurt. I took a sip and revolted. It was absolutely disgusting. And this wasn’t even a full sip you guys. This was like a teaspoon before I felt like I was going to throw up. It literally tasted like poison. So I wonder. HOW? How was I able to drink 2 full bottles of wine a day PLUS various amounts of liquor like tequila and vodka? I must have been in serious SERIOUS PAIN. And I was. I was in this storm of pain that just kept sucking me in. And the liquor was my savior, my comfort. It was the one thing that I thought would make me happy. But it never did. It was slowly killing me. It’s no joke and it will always break its promises. I am thankful I was able to stop without it doing more damage.

- no cravings at all - I stuck with la croix and ice cream each day. Woke up feeling awesome and full of energy for huge beach days playing with my kids. 

- saw another dad and granddad on the beach with kids before noon with beers in their hands.  Half ass playing with the kids because they only had one free hand. They did this for 3 hours. That would have been me no doubt in past years. So happy it’s not me now.  Present with my kids and I don’t have to numb my brain before noon.

Before covid, it finally seemed like I was going to have more friends again since was in a younger workplace. But since it, just not the same way to connect. So I’ve been lonely. At first not but as this drags on, definitely. 

Way I drink is primarily “just” bad impact on my health and habits. I don’t really embarrass myself, no DUI’s and don’t drive drunk etc.

When I do drink more, I’m functional because don’r drink during job or anything and it doesn’t impact my responsibilities. 

I used to embarrass myself more and I guess last night kind of did on a phone call. Not too bad but I was just more emotional than I otherwise would have been and some thoughts about my family that I have been suppressing just kind if surfaced. (was talking with another family member).

I’m hungover today and nauseous. Not feeling great. To be honest, I might drink the last 6 beers I have in the fridge so I stop feeling yuck. I know, I know. 

I’m just drinking too much lately and it’s giving me anxiety about my health. I’m tired of being overweight too. It’s a vicious cycle. I feel bad about these things and then drink the pain away and then feel bad again etc

Now almost two weeks later I don't have any desire to have any alcohol.

I'm a 33M and have been drinking since college, probably around 20. Every Friday, every Saturday, towards the later years, you could reliably throw in Thurdays as well. In college, it was just the usually party stuff, drinking beers, playing drinking games and always to excess. But I was having a blast.

My friends graduated earlier than I did and moved away (I stayed a year longer to turn a minor into a 2nd major.) I started to become lonely and depressed, drinking more often and in greater quantities. Instead of beer, I'd started to buy cheap bottles of wine and down them (more bang for your buck, right?). After I graduated, I was offered a promotion at my retail job as a low level manager. I moved back closer to home where the job was located. I still felt isolated and alone, although I really wasn't. 

So I spiral further down, I start buying fifths of vodka. I'd drink as much as I possibly could until I passed out, regardless of when I had to work the next day. Eventually, I was caught at work and forced to breathalyze. I think I blew something like .16 at noon. I was put on short-term disability and forced into outpatient. Of course I didn't want to stop at that point, so I didn't take anything out of it. I drank the entire time.

And for the next 9 or so years, I'd start buying handles at a time (MUCH more bang for your buck!). This time, though, I'd be careful to count my drinks. Sixteen hours till next shift? 16 shots it is (maybe an extra one for good luck). I'd be going through 2-3 handles a week. My vacations consisted of 4-5 days of a constant binge, followed by 2 days of puking, shakes, what-have-you, and back to work we go! Every single time.

I had last weekend off. For some reason, I decided to go super-extra-heavy. Fri into Sat into Sunday and much of Sunday afternoon. When Monday rolled around, I was sicker than I had ever felt. I was useless at work. Constantly running to the bathroom to throw up, not keeping even water down. Tuesday was more of the same (it is the worst feeling in the world to be so thirsty and have such dry mouth, but you can't even keep water down). I went to urgent care and they gave me an IV and some meds, which helped immensely. I decided that this was enough. I'm so tired of it. It's not fun, it's not enjoyable, its just a routine I've been stuck in for over 10 years.

Wednesday was my first sober night in a very long time and it was surprisingly not that difficult. Neither was Thursday night, or last night. I'm working mornings for the next several days and it feels amazing to be able to wake up without the haze, and the grogginess, and the hangover. My 8 hour shift didn't feel like 15.

Anyways, this ended up being longer than I was expecting, but I hope to be around here for a while!",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984588623046875}"

I'm a binge drinker alcoholic and addict. Two years ago today I sat in my first AA meeting hung over, broke, and broken. As a binge drinker I had the ability to go days or even a month without alcohol, but whenever something good or bad happened in life, I had to have all the beers and shots. Some cocaine was nice too because I could drink even longer. 

It was suggested that I get a sponsor so that's what I did. We worked the steps rigorously and I took commitments at meetings. Thanks to the fellowship of AA and working my ass off, the desire to drink left. 

All my life I run into constant obstacles. A job or working out will go nicely for a while, and then some negative event happens and crushes the momentum. Most recently I moved to Arizona for a job. I was finally going to be able to work full time and have an opportunity to pay off debt. Then Covid-19 hit. Since March I've been furloughed, and I'm unable to access any unemployment benefit because I was denied online and I can't get trough on the phone to appeal. All the unemployment offices were forced to be closed so I can't go in person either. I haven't been to regular meetings, but I do try to keep in touch with my sponsor whose now in another state. I enrolled in online school but I'm having trouble concentrating. I've been seeing a counselor and this week I'll get tested for adult ADD. My diet has been horrible since March and I'm struggling mentally a bit. Also, my roommate got fed up and decided to cancel our lease and move out of state to get back with an ex girlfriend. I now have 45 days to move out with no job and no income. 

It's a struggle to construct this post but, I can't help but wonder just how awful things could really be right now if I had chosen to relapse. I've put back on a few pounds, but I'm sure it would be double if I was still drinking. My finances are horrible, but at least I'm not spending $300 a week at a bar. I have an opportunity to potentially diagnose a problem that I suspect has been affecting me for decades. I used to have horrid anxiety but in spite of everything going on, it's very minimal now. Alcohol always made that worse. 

Many recovered alcoholics talk about a pink cloud type feeling and I can say that I have not yet experienced that. A life filled with neglect has left me a tough hole to dig out of. Thanks to the fellowship of AA and forums like these, things aren't so bad. I'm having a really tough time right now, but the miracle is...I'm okay with it. That's a small victory, but it's perhaps a bigger victory than I can comprehend right now. 

At some point I could really use a break. I'm certain that it will only come if I'm sober. So once again I'll be over here in this lonely, empty apartment, not drinking with you today. In the immortal words of Leroy nnJenkins, ""At least I've got chicken!"". Someone please pass the hot sauce.

BUT, Thursday night my friends had a wine tasting night, and I declined by stating I had to work late which wasn’t a total lie, but don’t even care if it was. Woke up happy and refreshed on Friday to messages of how hungover everyone was. God, I was so thankful it wasn’t me. Maybe the first time I felt sick just thinking about a hangover. Spent the entire day cleaning out our garage and prepping for a garage sale with my kiddos. Superb use of time.

Friday night my husband went to play poker with friends. Didn’t come home until 3am and we had to be up at 5 to finish garage sale stuff. Again, I was so thankful it wasn’t me, and watching him try to pretend like all was cool was pretty entertaining in my own head. As a nice, understanding wife, lol, (he doesn’t get to hang with the guys much), I finally sent him inside to get some rest once all was set up. 

I am working hard to retrain my brain. The addicted brain always wants to drink, but my logical brain is turning disgusted by it. I haven’t been perfect yet, but I’m working on it and feel my brain is heading in the right direction and it feels so damn good.

I'm fairly new to Reddit, and extremely new to this particular sub. In fact, I just glanced over the newest posts 15 minutes ago and felt like this was my type of hangaround.

I'm turning 40 in a few weeks, and I want to start a new chapter in my life. Not that I've had a terrible 40 years thus far, in fact it's been overall quite good, but I want the next 40 years to really mean something. That is probably as cliché as it gets, but then again, everything seems to be cliché these days.. heh

I personally feel like I need a specific important date to quit drinking. ""I'll quit on New Years Day, January 1st."" Or nowadays, ""I'll quit when I turn 40"". Why do I feel the need to make it such an 'official' day? It can't only be for me to keep pushing it forward all the time?

I have been drinking too much these past 5-10 years. I've gone a few months without alcohol for a few times during this time, and soooo many of the perfect sober nights/mornings (""I'm a totally new man!!"") here and there, but other than that, it's just been way too much.

I find myself browsing a lot of these forums and thinking to myself ""Well at least I don't drink as much as that guy"".. I'm guessing I'm not alone with that? I don't know why I do that, when I know that I drink too much, no matter how much it is.

I find myself Googling every little symptom I have when I feel like I may have alcoholic neuropathy, liver damage, etc etc. The problem is, I KNOW what I am doing to myself drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, but why doesn't that tell my brain to stop?

I'm a self-entrepreneur with a successful company. I love my job. I pretty much make my own schedule, so alcohol has never really interfered with my work, technically speaking. But I also know that I would have soooo much more time for work-related things if I didn't some days make it a priority to start drinking at 10 a.m. and then schedule my work-related meetings for the next day instead. And, obviously, more time for hobbies and family.

I'm an expert at quitting cold turkey. Believe you me, I have done it a thousand times. But to be honest, aside from perhaps loosening the tension on a first date, I don't REALLY care for the effects of alcohol anymore? Unfortunately, that seems to be easier to write in words than it is to make my brain comprehend.

It just dawned on me that I have started all of these paragraphs (and most sentences) with 'I', so I apologize for making this very self-centered.

The idea of going to rehab has been in the back of my mind for a long time. After relapsing a few weeks ago and drinking yet again last night, it's all I can think about this morning. I know I would benefit in many ways beyond just staying sober.

But I have no idea where to start or what to do first. I'd need time off from my job, but I don't even know how to go about doing that. My job requires me to drive, and while I'm glad to say I never went to work under the influence or drank while on the job, there is obviously a stigma there. How could I admit to my boss that I have a drinking problem without being under suspicion of having driven drunk?

Maybe I should research local rehab places first and see what services they offer. Then I can at least have an idea of how much time I'd need off. I also have no idea how payment would work. I do have health insurance though, and I realize the folks at the rehab center would certainly be able to assist me in figuring that out ...

Today is my girlfriends birthday and I managed to scramble together a birthday breakfast, with a present from me and a drawing i made with the kids (1, 3). But she found the receipt for the birthday stuff and it included a bottle of wine that should not have been on there. Because i don't drink. I promised. I promised her just the weekend before, like i had done many times before, and after that I attended my first (ish) aa meeting.

Day to day life was a lot for the last two years. We had our second child with the first one just being 20 months old. I started my own business, that did not work out exactly well the first two years (it does now). It gave me a lot of highs, but also lows. I didn't know how to manage. I drank too much. I've always drank a lot, but now it became way to much. I'm not a big talker, I keep my problems to myself even when explicitly asked. It's led me into trouble before, in my studies, work, and my personal life.

Drinking this  much made me passive about everything. My personal life, my home, could not enjoy my free time. It was either work, of working towards a drink. I neglected my partner, my home, my hobbies. Almost everything that defined me as a person. I was able to be an ok dad but I should have done so much better.

The last 7 months I pretended to have quit completely. But i just shrank my intake to 5% of the original daily bulk and kept on doing it once every one or two weeks. One bottle of white wine, no more, no less. It takes the edge off, and I thought it was a way of getting by. I get nervous a lot, the wine helps me tone it down. I've done so for most of my adult life. And I thought that with this bi-weekly escape I could manage, and weaved into my normal workweek. I can work at home whenever I like, so it was not much trouble. I did it in secret. She had her suspicions though, and rightfully so. I even managed to convince her we could have a nice summer evening and have a beer or wine together in the yard. We did that once, it was the best Sunday evening this whole year. But after that I managed to screw it up in a matter of days.

I've been asked to leave. We told the kids daddy had to sleep over at work for a few days. They were very sad because daddy is supposed to be home every day of the weekend. I've been asked not to return before having a plan to recover. She's had it with me, and she's right. I've done a lot of hurt.

I cant believe it has come this far. I cant believe how much of this stuff is controlling my mind. I cant believe I was asked to leave home and leave my girlfriend and two small children behind. I cant believe the lengths and effort I undertook to keep this going, very well knowing the jig would up at some point. The jig is up now. I cant believe how much i've hurt the mother of my children. I never meant to become this person. All of this energy I put into not being exposed, all the while I should have been working on being a better person. Instead I Lied about it. That's the worst part of it.

I'm at my parents place now. They feel for me but might not be aware of the consequences of my actions. Meanwhile I need to seek help. I talked to psychologists in the last few months a about a slew of different subjects that might be part of all of this. But I dismissed the one thing I knew deep down. There might be problems that were causing the abuse, but it works the other way around just as much or more. I should have known better.

First thing Monday is to seek the professional help i've needed for so long. There is a waiting period for any option thats out there, i don't know how to work through that yet. At least ill be attending the meetings, start working out again, and maintain a good work/private-time ratio. I need to work on my rest, regularity, and cleanliness. Thats the plan.

I need to make this up to my partner. It's going to take a lot of time, regaining trust. I hope she lets me after all thats happened. I really don't want my family to break up.

It’s my day for Saturday Share! My story feels so long and painful and not one I ever share. I tried to keep things concise and somewhat linear. It all takes place over the course of 10 years or so from 22 to 32 (where I am now).  

**Trigger warning**: mentions of loss and abortion.  

 I have always been a binge drinker. It started in college as a fun way to loosen up and make new friends. I’d never been good at making friends. Shortly after my 21st birthday, though, I ended up getting unexpectedly and unhappily pregnant followed by a fully expected abortion. This isn’t a “how I overcame trauma solo” story and I’ll mention it only to say it is probably the why of why I drink the way I do and I am really rather lucky to be alive all things considered.   

After graduation, I began to unravel as the realities of life had set in. I couldn’t afford my student loans and the interest rates were insane. I was coping poorly with grief and shame. I was exhausted and overworked and under a lot of stress as a pastry cook. Hiding that I’m drinking from my boyfriend at the time had become just normal. He wasn’t a drinker so to me, I needed to drink on the sly since he wasn’t going to join me for a drink anyway. I ended up breaking off the relationship at 4 years. Despite talks of getting married I felt under so much pressure to BE something for someone. All I wanted to be was drunk and I’d rather do that alone, thank you.  I felt like a dog wandering off to die alone.     

I moved to Florida, mostly to get away from my home town, mostly because I had no other plans. I was not asked back for another season at the restaurant, probably because I was a pretty marginal cook anyway so why not? I had a friend from college who could get me a waitressing job and I secured a tiny cheap apartment nearby. I barely made ends meet and often “had” to choose between alcohol or food. Which, when you really think about it, is an easy decision to make. When has food let you forget how much you hate yourself?  

I used to actually say to myself, while mixing a fourth or fifth drink that “hey, at least I’m not cutting, right?”. As if self harming only comes in the form of a razor blade and you couldn’t possibly do a different kind of cutting with a bottle opener. While I think a lot of people drink to forget, I drank to remember. There was a mystery in the depths of my mind that I was desperate to solve. I was the grizzled alcoholic detective pouring over old case files with a glass of scotch after everyone else had gone home.  If it weren’t for the abortion, would we still be together? How much of this is my fault? I ruined three different peoples’ lives. These were the puzzles I would try to make sense of while getting black out drunk alone. Just me, a bottle of tequila, a pack of marbs, and Black by Pearl Jam. Pain is as addicting as anything else, and I think that’s what my real issue is. I love to hurt.  

Somehow, despite putting myself in a series of dangerous situations, I managed to survive my early and mid 20s. I should have died in Florida choking to death on my own vomit or in a alcohol fueled car accident but I always managed to scrape by. After I ran out of money, I moved back home and my drinking continued to become more of an apparent problem. But I still had this “well I mean obviously I drink a ton lol look what I’m dealing with.” (or NOT dealing with rather) mentality. The ALCOHOL was never the issue, the depression, ptsd, grief, shame, a paranoia about getting pregnant again which was sliding into compulsive behavior, that was clearly the problem.   

Finally, after a night drinking heavily and fighting with my sister I had the wake up call I needed - my drinking was becoming a problem and my whatever you want to call it - ptsd whatever - was going to kill me. It was only a matter of when. I went swimming that night, at a pond near my parents house called Deep Pond. Stripped naked (of course.) and waded in just at sunrise. It was pouring out but very warm. For the first time in years the hurricane of rage, grief, and sadness had quieted. I had slipped into its eye. I bobbed there, still able to touch, my eyes just above the water line, the rain drumming the surface and my head, the water as warm as my body temperature. I felt so at peace. I was just about to push off and swim out when it hit me like a cold slap of water: you do that and you’re dead. They’ll have to drag the lake for your body. Your sister will always live knowing she was the last to see you alive. I almost did anyway. I was never consciously suicidal but I guess that’s as close as I got. But that thought lasted seconds. I scrambled out of the water suddenly terrified, like a dear scenting a predator i realized I was in very serious trouble. Death was only another few feet out into the water. Right next to me, really.   

I vowed to work on my coping mechanisms. I began tracking how much I was drinking. I didn’t really TRY and quit for years still but I’d “take time off” and pat myself on the back for a week here or a few days there. The Age of Moderation has begun and  would last another 5 or so years. I also began to work on my emotional baggage. Which did, despite not quitting my method of self harm, actually work and return results. I learned to forgive myself by forgiving those who had hurt me. The dad who said women like me deserve the death penalty. A mom who simply pretends it didn’t happen. A good friend who had called me inherently evil. My ex’s douche friend who called me lazy and a whore. I needed to bring these words to light and let them go because they were rotting inside me like dead bodies at the bottom of a swamp.   

And slowly, but surely, I stumbled through to my late 20s like a near drowned swimmer climbing up on to the shore at last. A guy Id had casual sex with years prior had become a friend and then a love interest. I moved to his city. He helped me change careers. I went from making minimum wage working two jobs to twice that then twice that again in a terrifying new career. Finally, my student loans had become manageable. We got engaged. We got married. We bought a house. AT is 30.   

And yet ... and yet, I still drank like I did in Florida. Though I’d quit smoking marbs years ago and didn’t drink alone listening to Black I did still binge drink. And I became mean. I’d always been a mean drunk. I figured it was the ptsd! Of course it is. Or the student loans. Any idea what a kick in the cunt it is to go to college to follow your dreams only to realize your dreams cost 100k at 12% interest and you cannot, in point of fact, actually afford to follow them? Of course I drank heavily. Drank heavily because of the stress. Was a mean drunk because of the trauma. QED, friends. Each Rock Bottom id think “I hate this shit”. Yet I’d drink again 4 or 5 days later. I went on this way for years. Crashing jagged rock bottoms and paper cut indignities I could write whole chapters on - Chapter 22: The East La Incident and the Mystery of the Missing Shower Rod  - and so on. The theme of that sordid little book is I drink too much and I’m a shitty, combative, verbally abusive, nasty drunk when I do and the people who bear the brunt of it deserve it the least. 

Waking up Christmas morning in 2019 after yet another black out rock bottom binge that seemed to come out of no where, I knew I was done. I had to be.   I heard the disgust in his voice and the loathing that would bloom into hate in time. Who did I think I was? That I should just assume he should put up with my shit so, what, I could have a few glasses of wine at the Christmas party? I had become the type of spouse I’d  encourage a close friend to leave. I figured I had another 5, maybe 10 years before I finally drove him off.  

In my mind, if I KNOW what the problem is and I KNOW how to fix it and I don’t even TRY... well then I deserve the outcomes I get. We may split up for any number of reasons, all of which I’d accept (while pushing us to go through therapy and save our marriage if possible) but I don’t accept that it may end due to my drinking. If ALL I have to do is order a soda water at a restaurant instead of a glass of wine, my god, I’ll do it happily and easily. I refuse to go back to a Hell where I ruminate on how many lives I ruined.    

I do want to continue to work on myself. Not to find out why I become some monster of a woman when I drink - like in math sometimes, the answer may be that there is no answer. I’m done wasting time trying to fix it so I could “just have a few”.  But I think there’s still recovery work left yet to do. I’m worried if I don’t find the answers I may never really heal but I’m at peace with the idea there may be no answer. All I know is I finally feel stable and whole. Alcohol was and will always be a method of self harm and today I’m almost 8 months clean.   

Be good this weekend, and don’t forget ! Tomorrow’s shape up Sunday I want to see 👏 you 👏 there 👏

That being said, I have settled down on even that in the last few years. It's a battle though everytime I do drink. The urge to just consume all the alcohol is overwhelming at times. I thought I had things under control. The thing is ""under control"" still isn't very good. I spent all of yesterday hungover in bed, accomplishing nothing, feeling like absolute trash. I had to wonder, were the drinks I had the day before even worth it? Did they really add that much to the day? Just hung out with good friends, talked and joked. Would I not have had just as good a time without the alcohol? I have frequented this sub before when things were really bad for me, and made it a decent stretch before thinking I could just drink socially again. I don't think that's good for me either though. I would love to not associate a good time with drinking, bc it really isn't. So I'm back here again, hoping to find inspiration and support. I want to live a healthy fulfilled life without alcohol.

The last two months I've gone downhill again. Really disappointed in myself and want to do so much better.,"Okay, this seems like a very busy subreddit so hopefully my message won't get lost.

I'm 23M and have been a student at university for the past 6 years (currently finishing my last degree). During the first years of college, I was a heavy drinker but always in the context of going out: when I didn't go out, I didn't drink. 

Then around 3 years ago, it got pretty bad. I went on an exchange semester abroad and, looking back, I was just drunk a lot of the time. I went out like 4 to 5 times a week, always drinking. After going back home (beginning 2018), my drinking got worse due to some personal problems I had been having, especially with my family. I went to therapy and I must say that it did help. Late 2018 I started drinking less and I managed to control my alcohol consumption until I broke up with my boyfriend in the summer of 2019, when I started drinking more again. I went to a few music festivals that summer, but I barely remember them because I was so drunk all the time. 

Then last September I started a new degree which was pretty intensive so I managed to cut down on my drinking (although smoking a lot of pot). Then this year, I cut down on pot as well and didn't really drink a lot, especially not during lockdown. I had also started a new relationship with someone who didn't drink a lot and it really helped me to appreciate not drinking. 

Unfortunately, I got dumped about 2 months ago and since then I've been drinking more. It's not that I drink so often, per se, but I just notice that I enjoy it much more than before, it really makes me feel good. Whenever I drink, I can't wait for the sedated feeling to take over. Therefore, it's very difficult to stop after one glass. I'm generally okay not drinking, but whenever I've had one glass, I can't wait for the next to feel the buzz. The problem is that my friends are all heavy drinkers (among other things, I just drink and smoke pot occasionally) and that does make it difficult. I'm really worried about myself because I felt I was doing much better. My father is also a heavy drinker and our relationship is definitely strained because of that so I have an image of what I definitely do not want to become.

If anyone has any advice/tips/experience regarding my situation it would be most appreciated. I just want to get back on track with the healthy drinking but it's very difficult and I do feel ashamed about it.

My husband jokingly said ""Back on the wagon again?"" and I replied, ""yes, even one glass of wine triggers a migraine."" and moved on.

 I suspect that most people achieve sobriety through multiple attempts. I also think that sobriety is not all or nothing, ie many (but not all) people will maintain days/weeks/years of sobriety, with some intervening drinking. If your goal is not to drink at all (that is my goal), then go for it every day.

I started drinking when I was 16 years old with my brothers. We would go to parties and play video games while drinking. 

In college I played a lot of video games and drank with my friends when we would play together. After graduating I got seasonal jobs that often times were out of state and I didn’t know anyone so of course my mind always went to I guess I could drink and play video games. 

Later I met my current girlfriend who is amazingly supportive but hates my excessive drinking as I have been drinking around 12 beers every 2 to 3 days now and am 29 years old. She always says just stop doing it but it’s not that easy for me.

I find drinking does 3 things for me. It makes video games more fun when I’m bored, makes me feel good during the drinking, and makes me forget all my worries and troubles in life.

However I always feel guilty the next day because my girlfriend is mad. Plus my chest hurts sometimes and am always tired.

In recent years, this has been my most triggering emotion.  It's that feeling when, after adjusting the patio umbrella for the umpteenth time, a big gust comes along and knocks it over, spraying sand all over the freshly-cut watermelon...

If this were a movie (maybe a scene in a Miyazaki production), everyone would run down to the sea to rinse off the watermelon before gorging on it.  They would run after the umbrella as it pinwheeled along the beach, falling in the sand, yelling and laughing.  Reality isn't always so picturesque or diverting, however.  In reality, I'm alone, putting away groceries or something, thinking about all the things I need to get done today.

Yet, it's curious; even thinking about the ease and enjoyment in that invented scene brings a smile to my body.  The anger washes over and away.  It might come back -- the wind usually does, on a windy day -- but eventually it will settle down.  I think I even read somewhere that being blown around makes  plants and trees root down further, find a stronger foothold in the earth...

Crawled into my bed and waited for it to pass. I wanted to see if I could moderately drink. And it seems like I can. But the weird thing is, now I don’t even want to. Drinking even just two pints brought back all the anxiety, the fear, the guilt that I used to feel when I was drinking. That’s not what I want anymore and that’s not who I am anymore.

Before the shutdown, I could pretend to drink socially (they didn’t know about the extra drinking that went in afterwards). But now I have this reputation as one of the social drinkers, and I feel super awkward to explain that I don’t drink at all now.

We have whiskey tasting on Fridays one or twice a month. It’s a good way to be social and to get the real story about people and projects. I should say here that watching people drink is not a trigger with me; quite the opposite. It’s quite the JOMO feeling. I would have no problem not drinking while others are drinking.

I also don’t want to make anybody feel bad or act like I’m some god who is telling people not to drink. My ex-manager who hired me is a great person and she drinks like a fish, and I don’t want to offend her or anybody else. 

I like the get-togethers, but I need some nice way of saying that I don’t drink anymore. I’m not close with these people, they are workmates, but somebody told me 30 years ago “business is all about relationships” and how right he was. I don’t want to overshare but just let them know in a casual and not weird or awkward way.

Any suggestions? 

Edit: I Slacked somebody who I’m fairly close with at the virtual happy hour and told him I was “on the wagon” for a couple of months. First, he’d never heard of that term, so I had to explain it to him. He then asked me “do you mean you quit drinking “ and “it never looked to me like you had a problem”. I...well I let the slack die an unnatural death. So attempt #1: awkward!

First, I would like to commend this group on its genuine no-bullshit, no dogma insights, positivity, and effective strategies I've been happy to leech off of for the past year, in between ""moderation"" spells. One of my major issues being anxiety and crippling panic attacks, so it is good to know in black and white from my addicted and recovering peers that not every last ache, pain, yellow spot, or world-record high blood pressure reading will cause a certain instant death. I had thought for a while merely knowing that and ""keeping it under control"" would be enough. 

Well, here I humbly stand, after injuring my liver to some extent yet again, admitting yeah, that hasn't worked. 

I am 34. Single, no kids, severe ADD, occasional social anxiety with a heavy dose of liquor-fueled panic attacks that have proudly made me an epic embarrassment to be around thousands of times since 2008. 

And I do absolutely, to several near death experiences do we part, insanely love ethyl alcohol. I love the taste. I love the buzz. I love the culture. I love how much easier people get along in every drinking scene imaginable. I love whisky. I love vodka. I love absinthe with a passion. I even love gin. My entire world is alcohol, nightlife, fast cars, chicks, and rock n roll. It is literally in my blood. What a mysterious, thrilling and lucrative affair this has been. Except for the part where my love is constantly on a mission to kill me.

I had my first drink in an abandoned ski cabin in the woods of Northern New England one snowy night as a shy, virginal, soft-spoken 19 year old. It was a swig of Black Velvet. My life has never been the same since. A world that wanted less than 0 to do with me suddenly opened itself in ways I'd never imagined. In weeks I went from someone my college dorm hallmates literally locked their doors to get away from to someone --inviting them-- to the sickest underground parties on campus, which I'd often DJ myself, to over 300 guests. People I didn't remember meeting shouted my name out from a distance like we were besties, often several times a day. This warm, fuzzy, socially acceptable substance transformed me into a fucking rock star. Except for when it didn't - literally the only thing these hangers-on and groupies cared about was access, and having a cool custom pad I created to rest our drunk asses. When break happened I heard from no one. I thought of these people as family. I was crushed.

Nevertheless, the boozing went on. I hit the job market. Started making ok money at 21. Never enough to be stable but just enough to be stupid. Stayed pretty ok this way for my run-n-gun 16 Redbull vodka a night friends and I my whole early and mid-20s; we were my mid-size Atlantic coast city's bar-smashing wrecking crew. We were young, we had money, we gave exactly zero fucks but we spent heavily, worked our asses off during the day, and tipped like rap stars at night. 

On the surface, all was well. Deep down, I was falling far too in love with my persona of being the crazy blackout guy. I loved hearing about the crazy shit I had said to some bouncer the night before, or waking up with some cop's MagLite in my kitchen then having the whole ordeal read back to me the next day. Never got bad hangovers, never missed work, winning awards, getting promotions, life was fucking good. Except, I was a major asshole. My friends drifted away. At 27, I was virtually friendless and unemployable, and blacking out every day on my own out of habit. 

Then my life changed. I passed out standing up at my friend's brithday party after we went to concert. I think we killed 5 or 6 bottles in our group of 3. I am probably 155 soaking wet. I am told my eyes rolled into the back of my head,and had it not been for my one friend at the time having arms the size of my legs to smack me back awake with I would have probably died of alcohol poisoning that night. I was hungover for 3 days straight that time and ended up hallucinating myself falling through the pavement I was walking across, and my eyes turned yellow.

Worried I'd done brain damage or was about to die, I went to a hospital for a checkup, the very first of dozens of times this has now happened. That was in 2012. I was 27. Lucky for me (or unlucky, addict's perspective), no permanent damage. Great, let's go party! A few weeks more. Happens again. 

Now I'm scared shitless. My best friend's uncle had died the same week after -his- 30 year plus struggle from a stroke caused by alcholism. He was a young, funny, cool guy. Gone. 

Immediately I knew it was time to give it up. First time in AA. Found a cool group but wasn't ready. Tapered, stopped being blacked out, got too scared of withdrawals to fully quit. Tried a few more AA groups, Smart Recovery, nothing stuck. Kept drinking, but it was OK because, no more blackouts. Sure. 

2014, 2 years later, shit starts turning yellow again. No longer do I blackout but still haven't had a sober night in 5 years. Moved up to a cozy corporate gig in a bigger, cooler city, but couldn't connect with anyone personally and was super lonely despite having ""made it"". 

Made it 3 years before fucking that up for various reasons, but at least the great health insurance meant my sore liver could get DXed and ultrasounded. AST/ALTs off the charts. Both over 300. Doc saying you have weeks more of this or you'll need a transplant, or just quit. 

Finally did an outpatient detox, sucked down benzos for 5 days and got clean. Stayed that way a couple months, but the first sober time of my adult life was the most boring experience ever. The sheer emptiness of the the newfound time ate my ADD brain alive. 

My coping mechanisms were 0 and none of my interests social, so I went back. Finally enough was enough. Early 2015 I started a post-rehab group with my company's blessing should my doctor recommend rehab. He didn't, so I didn't. I did lose the job, but found a cool group therapy and ok-ish individual therapy. Vibed great with my first but he abruptly passed me off to a partner before we dug deep. But, finally sober, panic attacks went away, and things got better.

Long story short, 2 years sober from that. Came to hate that city but after a year sober there, saved enough from not drinking to get a place in NYC, where I had dreamed of living for 10 years but never had my shit together enough to actually do. Finally I did it. Got into my dream place. Started hanging out in the music and arts scene and found ways to make a several careers at once out of it. Finally working my dream job. But, quite lonely in some ways, finding it increasingly inconvenient to be the one non-drinking bore at every social event. 

Naturally amidst the grip of this scene I stay sober one full year, probably turning down enough shots and sniffles to pilot Captain Morgan's ship to Bogota and back, and I decide fuck it, I want my fun back. I can do this carefully. I beat this by choice, because it wasn't fun any more. Well now sobriety wasn't fun any more. Right? Right. Worked so great last time. 

This was 2017. My strategy went ok for a few months, but, finally women are dating my degenerate ass - sadly, the crazy alcoholic addict type. Craziest one in any given bar, to the point I earn a reputation for it.  And I am all about it. Again, the functioning boozebag. This sets off a hell of a lot of fun, but, empty relationships wasting my time and getting onto a scary path. In them, we drive each other to drink more, beyond my new comfort zone. In between them, compulsively driving myself further down, the last of which going for a year but turning toxic and costing me business opportunities and what little stability I could muster. I was worried, and scared enough to take days-weeks off sometimes, but still, found ways to be sucked back in. 

All 3 years back off the wagon, it's been binge-purge binge-purge with the occasional moderate night mixed in, mostly with bad results. Especially with COVID, things have gotten really real. Stress, the shutdown of bars and meeting places, the loss of every industry I have my multiple careers in swaying in and out of dead, and quarantining religiously given my prior liver issues, alcohol-induced high blood pressure I've had since 27, and asthma I've had for life has meant every bottle I intend to casually sip just gets destroyed. 

Cinco de Mayo produced my worst withdrawals and panic attacks, ever. I was awake for 5 days straight unable to sleep a wink. Probably the closest I've been to going crazy. Had my heart pound so hard it caused low-grade fever. Had a come-to-Jesus moment and realized *why* I was continuing to do this - because I'm a born addict, as I've always known, but now realizing a therapist's observation I discarded 6 years ago was dead-on - my whole being is ruled by toxic shame. I am fundamentally ashamed of who I am, and everything and everyone I chase is a cheap attempt to patch it up. 

One month I stay sober. And it's wonderful. I breathe easy. I sleep great. My friends show me love. No more anxiety. Life is great. Then I get called to a side-gig cross-country. Fuck it, I think to myself. Make a few extra bucks, get outta COVID hell NYC, do my first-ever cross country roadtrip. Fun times. Stay sober the whole way to my destination, where an old music buddy of mine happens to live. Thinking nothing of it, he shows me around town. Had a great trip.

What is it about our crazy affliction that keeps us dragging ourselves back??

I'm a big boy, I can have a casual glass or 2 with a buddy and live, right? Oh boy. 4 bottles. 3 days. Vicious panic attacks requiring valium to come down. Finally I learn new breathing techniques for the panic attacks to semi-mitigate them. So I thought, envisioning phantom heart attacks, organ failures, strokes and other fun physical ailments subconscious pineal-induced attacks can fool you into thinking you're suffering. 

By now NYC is back semi-reopened. Again the social drinker, carefully, now with extra social distancing. But still, keeping a side bottle or 2 most days at home, because I can casually sip, right? 

Well, 2 more Hunter S. Thompson-worthy binges and here I lay at home exiled from planned meetings with people I haven't seen in months because my withdrawals again are bad enough I can't function. I've been running a temp of 99.0. My liver symptoms of dull pain in my side, shitting out black or hardly at all, and yellow spots all over are back, and my heart rate was up yet again, although less than the steady 140 from the May binge. That combined with a bug bite (or weird blood clot) on my left leg has me stuck here in Fuckedville yet again.

The good news is, the temp lowered since earlier, and I had my final drink 2 days ago. And for the first time, I dumped the last of it today  

All this novel to say, enough. 

Today I claim the commitment to myself, and this time, to someone who really deserves to see me beat this - my 83 year old adoptive mother, who has been in mostly terrible health this whole year and a good part of the last 15 years, watching this whole booze saga closer than anyone else, and not once saying an unkind word to me about my time as a fuckup or failed attempts to get it under control. I can think of no greater gift to give her than to finally conquer this demon while she is still here and honor her legacy by sticking with it. 

I have no idea how this will go or what help and strategies I'm gonna need for it to stick this time, but I know one thing - I'd rather be the son she raised and loves with all her heart for her final days than continue being someone she and many more just have to deal with until I tragically waste away.

No idea who needs to see this or if anyone ever will, but I am grateful for what I have found in this community so far and if any part of my evil circus ride of doom can help anyone in any way, here we have it.

I do hope I manage this better than my many other times, and the information and encouragement I've drawn from the success stories and positive posts  even amongst those whose suffering is far beyond mine is a good start. 

The lasting sobriety and, more importantly, happiness shown by people who have had transplants, hospital stays and been on death's door and come back again tells me firmly, there is a better life ahead.

I’ve order 12 of them off amazon last night when I got home! 

I got back at midnight, drank a cup of water and went straight to sleep. I woke up at 8.30 naturally, no hangover and ready to meet my friend for a hike, and I’m driving us.

Usually I am the drunkest at the party, and I end up not remembering part of the night... but this time, I was the sober one. Everyone around me was drinking heavily and I felt perfectly fine sitting with my La Croix at the table. (They all know I don't drink anymore, know not to offer me anything, and know to stop me if I reached for something, but I don't get the temptations to grab a bottle when I see one so I am fine with them having it out).

Usually, I feel like alcohol would make me more fun, more likable, more outgoing. But this time I realized that I am already all of those things and that if I really wanted to have my own fun, all I had to do was be myself and not care how everyone else took it. As cheesy as that sounds, I did, and I had a BLAST.

I can't wait to wake up tomorrow not hungover, listening to my friends complain about headaches and thirst and anxiety that I won't have. I'll wake up refreshed and proud.

This is a really big step for me so I'm super proud of myself. Might seem like a tiny milestone but it feels like I broke a barrier within myself tonight and I can't wait to keep it up.

We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn't:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

US—Night/Early Morning

Europe—Morning

Asia and Australia—Evening/Night

Returning to silence - not the absence of sound but the absence of noise. What the psychologist Dr Thema calls ""sacred pause."" I love the sounds of a dog's paws on the floor, or the tiny sleep-barks they do during a thrilling dream they're having. The sound of pencil on paper. The clicks and groans of my body, even. 

 Thank you for letting me host this week, sweet friends. I will not drink with you today, with gratitude and love.

I think I just need an outlet and to really get this down in writing with other eyes on it. 


I've been sober for nearly a week after drinking too much the past couple months. I've gone months, I've gone weeks sober and when I fall it's not always a bad binge but it can be. Very very much so. 


It's been like this throughout my 20s. For a multitude of reasons I used it as a crutch, as an excuse and as a way to dull  myself or temporarily enhance myself or avoid the world. 


But why? 
Really.. Why dull yourself? When regardless of who you are, you have so much to offer. No more toxic thoughts. 


And some enhancement.. Yeah right. Temporary, risky, and easily backfires constantly. What kind of enhancement causes such destruction. 


It might not cause destruction that one time, or that next time, then you think yeah this is fine - I'm good, I got this. I'm in control. But it's a trick. And like a trickster it twists everything and then whammy - nope. 


I'm worried about the health implications of those actions  and I'm worried about the friendships I've untethered. 


I'm almost 30. I know that's still young, but by now my organs aren't and they've earned a break. 

I've been changing my diet, and I'm putting in the work to get my confidence back. To have confidence again without the poison. 


I can tell my organs are mad at me, and they should be. I'm just scared and I really hope they can heal. 
Sorry liver, sorry kidneys, I mean it <3

I am married, maintain a good relationship with my wife, take care of work still. Not one of those 'is 7 beers a week too much' guys, I'm a 150 lb guy and pound 12+ beers every night, including tonight, for the past many months, every night. I can't sleep without it. 

Every morning I wake up and say that I'm not going to drink any more, fight through the day, then once the sun goes down need that sweet relief and wake up hung over once again. 

At this point I am legitimately scared to quit out of fear of withdrawals. When I plan a sober night I end up drinking to reduce anxiety then over do it again, or even over do it to 15+ beers. 

For the most part, I still function during the day, maintain relationships and work. In pain, nonetheless.

A little over two weeks ago my wife found my stash of vodka I had hidden in my office. I was getting drunk every day (sometimes starting as early as 7:00 am on the weekends), putting away a handle of vodka every three or four days. My digestive system was a mess, I was always tired, and I felt like the only thing that could keep me going was another shot. I was a mess, and the worst thing was that I KNEW what I was doing to myself and that I needed to stop. I’d wake up at 3am every night to chug three or four glasses of water and think to myself “why the hell can’t I just stop?”

After my wife found everything, I made a promise to cut alcohol out completely. I was terrified of going through the detox phase again; the anxiety, insomnia, excessive sweating, smelling like an old distillery no matter how much I showered, but I gritted my teeth and prepared myself for the worst. But after that first 48 hours sober, I was...I guess through the worst of it? I don’t know how I got that lucky, I had been drinking like that for about 2 years, but I’m not gonna complain.

After a little over two weeks, I feel incredible. I wake up feeling rested, I have more energy, and I’ve lost three pounds even though every meal looks like the last one you eat before going to fat camp (Five Guys Burgers are the bomb by the way).

If you’re lurking wondering what’s on the other side of sobriety, it’s worth it 100%. I had been stuck in this never ending cycle of being drunk all day, waking up with shame and regret every night and wondering how long my liver will hold out before throwing in the towel, to being free and clear. I realize now that there is absolutely nothing good that will come to me in those bottles, and I’m happy to be me again.

This leads to me buying only high alcohol content beer and wine (a full box of wine will be gone in 2 nights) I spend the next day trying to recover from drinking and will sleep through a whole afternoon just so I know I'll be able to stay up and drink. I never drink socially because I know it won't be enough so stopped socializing because getting drunk became a priority. If I don't have work the next day and don't have to wake up at 4 AM I count down until 6 in the evening (because apparently that's when my brain says I'm allowed to drink). This is not a healthy relationship with alcohol and I'm sure the deeper I dug the more things I could come up with. I guess I'm posting this more to remind myself why I'm not drinking tonight and even though I feel sad and lost it's not worth continuing this cycle I have been on for so long just to shut up my own mind for a night or 2.",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994151592254639}"

It's made me realize how bad alcohol is for the body, and that my own relationship with alcohol isn't good.

I used to smoke a lot of weed, but then that started giving me anxiety so I switched to alcohol, between the two I really haven't lived a totally sober life since I was about 14 (I'm 29 now). So I gotta learn other ways to occupy my time.

I hope it's OK if I share a little bit after just joining (I didn't see anything in the guidelines against it?!). 

I'm not a daily drinker, or even a weekly drinker. I don't usually crave a drink, but when I'm feeling like it, I'll go out with friends to grab a drink or bring a bottle of wine home. My problem doesn't stem from drinking all the time, but from having no ""off switch"" when I do drink. Sometimes I can make the responsible decision to stop, but more often when I don't overdo it, it's because the alcohol ran out (what a bummer!). 

I went out last night with the intention of not drinking with a couple of girlfriends for our girl's night, but as is often the case, that went out the window as soon as I sat down. We had a few drinks, and had some fun, and then decided to head back. Before we made it all of the way home, we saw another cute place and stopped there as well. Here is where it starts getting fuzzy. I drank most of 2 bottles of champagne there, and that's where I started losing time. 

I vaguely remember taking a rose from the restaurant, a wine stopper, and coming onto my friend, who I have never felt attracted to in any way. Also, I just found lotion in my purse that I'm pretty sure was in the restaurant bathroom. Thankfully, my klepto side restricts itself and drunk me doesn't steal from my friends (I don't think so anyway), which is a plus? 

Simply put, I became another person, and not one that I would ever want to be friends with if I was someone else. 

This morning I had to apologize to the friend I came onto, profusely, and I'm extremely grateful that she, and my other girlfriend, are able to just laugh last night off. I however, cannot. And how can I, when this is just another entry onto a long list of ""Shit I Regret the Day After Drinking""?

I've been incredibly lucky to have never been arrested, assaulted, robbed, in any car accidents, or killed because of my drinking. I have lost friends, made a complete ass out of myself on more occasions than I can count, and nursed many, many hangovers, also more than I can count. I've also stopped drinking successfully for nearly a year, 2 years, and several months in a row 3 or 4 times now. 

From all of this, I've learned that I'm not meant to be a drinker, but I struggle with it every time someone invites me out, and I'm afraid to tell people when I do stop drinking because I don't have many friends, and I'm afraid they'll stop inviting me out. Not to be mean, but to be kind and to try to help me. 

So, here I am, hiding out in my room with my blackout curtains pulled, nursing the tail end of yet another hangover, and all I can say is that I hope this is finally it. I hope that I have hit rock bottom again, for the last time, because I don't know how much longer I can keep getting lucky. I don't know how long my girlfriends will keep laughing off another drunken night, or how long my husband will keep forgiving me for not coming home because I drank too much. Mostly, I just don't know how I can keep living with myself like this. 

I'm not a 12 steps kind of person, I quit cold turkey and had no issues with it with drugs and smoking (I've been clean for 12 ish years now), but something about alcohol is just so attractive that it's hard to completely stay away from. It doesn't help that it's so pervasive in everything we do, and society in general. I would welcome advice from anyone else who has had a similar experience.

The book recommendations, the suggestion to start drinking non-alcoholic seltzers, and knowing I'm not alone in my internal struggle with alcohol have all been indescribably helpful for me. I don't think I would have gotten 33 days sober from alcohol without this sub. This is the longest I've gone without a drink of alcohol since I was 19. Thank you all. 

I'm only 25, but I've been problematically drinking for years. I had my first drink at 16, got regular access to hard liquor at 19, and drank heavily for years. It was classic self-medicating, I had an undiagnosed learning disorder misdiagnosed as depression (which antidepressants obviously weren't helping). I slowed down a lot when I discovered pot at 22, but it eventually just led to getting cross-faded every night. I still use pot, but I'm completely broke for the next two weeks and almost out so I'm gonna be completely sober soon. But that's a discussion for somewhere else. 

I never had a ""rock bottom"" like I've seen others express on this sub. I've had embarrassing experiences for sure, like my sister picking me up from my friends bachelorette party drunkenly sobbing, or barfing in the McDonald's parking lot in front of strangers after a night of heavy drinking. But I kept drinking through them, so they must not be a rock bottom. I wasn't drinking enough to physically withdraw apparently, I just struggled to fall asleep for the first few days. 

I don't really have anyone in my life that I can share this aspect of my life with. My partner is staying sober with me (we live together and were getting drunk nightly together) but his strategy is to just not think about it. When I told him we hit a month sober, he basically blinked and said ""Huh, ok."" That just-don't-think-about-it strategy doesn't really work for me. My lizard brain still intrusively tells me a few times a week that I deserve a drink for how long I've been sober, that I can probably control it this time, and that a four-pack of my favorite alcoholic cider is a small amount in the long run. How much could four cans really set me back? I know the answer, but my lizard brain sure likes to argue.
I told my mom, at least. She was married to my abusive and alcoholic ex-stepdad for a while, so she was happy to hear about my sobriety. (I don't mean to imply alcoholic=abusive here, it's just how I refer to him specifically.) You-know-what has isolated me from my friends and the rest of my family, so I haven't told anyone else.

Well, happy news: I think in many aspects, I've picked up my AF journey right where I left it!

Quick backstory: I did quit drinking for a time (one year), pick up back drinking (another year, over which I quit and returned several times) and now I'm stopped again (a few weeks ago) and I feel SO STRONG. Just 3 weeks ago I was at such a terrible place, hating myself, wondering why I couldn't learn a lesson I'd learned a thousand times, and feeling terrified of quitting and going through the whole process again. But now.... I feel more DONE with alcohol than ever. I felt this way immediately, but I wanted to get a few weeks under my belt before reporting back.

That first time around, after many months of quitting I wondered ""Is this really necessary? Maybe you've taken a long enough break? Wouldn't just drinking socially be ok?"" So on and so forth. I feel 1000% over it now... BTDT (been there, drank that!) and have no more curiosity about this drug, or desire to try to fit it into my life when its shown me time and time again that it doesn't deserve a place. I don't outwardly say ""I'll never drink again!"" but honestly I can't imagine ever having another. 

No, it's not all sunshine and rainbows, and some days life is only just SLIGHTLY better on this side of the bottle, but it is ALWAYS better. I think I needed that year of trying (and failing) at moderating, additional research if you will, to really, really know my truth.

I just wanted to share this because you hear a lot of stories about how, if you return to drinking, you pick up right where you left off, no matter how long it's been, and I certainly experienced that. Everything seemed perfect at first (I'm cured! I'm successfully moderating!) and then slowly but surely that sneaky bitch crept on in and I found myself drinking bottles of wine alone on the couch. However... I've been so pleasantly surprised at round 2 (ding, ding!) that I feel like I'm continuing my AF journey right where I left it. I have trips planned, even an all-inclusive wedding in Cancun (does it get any more boozy than that?!), and I have zero FOMO. I don't feel sorry for myself, I don't picture myself by the pool, not being able to enjoy numbing and sedation with everyone else. I'm going to be at my best, fearless and fierce, unapologetically me. It feels SO. GOOD. 

We are all on our own journey, so I just want to encourage anyone struggling that as long as you are here, reading this, evaluating your drinking, and being honest with yourself about its impact on your life, there is hope. A few weeks ago I simply was not ready, despite desperately wanting to be ready. And then one day: bam. Dunzo. 

This community has been such an important part of my progress and I can't thank you all enough for your kindness and support.

Yesterday was probably the most challenging since I decided to quit again. Anyway, here's my story. A little background first.

I really don't like my mother in law. She's selfish, narcissistic and manipulative. My father in law enables this behavior and they drive me nuts. In the last few years I've never spent any time with them without being at least a little buzzed. I would bring vodka I had poured into a bottle of cranberry juice (half juice and half vodka so it wasn't super obvious) and drink it on the way there. And I'd often take a shot or 2  before we left. I would get annoyed when the buzz inevitably wore off while I was there and continue to drink when I got home. If they visited us, I would drink secretly the whole time they were here. I would find reasons to go into the basement to sneak shots often. I never did anything embarrassing, so I convinced myself that I was just doing what I needed to do to get through the visits. I kept a buzz, but never got 'drunk'. No one ever said anything so I kept justifying that I didn't have a problem. Lies. All lies.

So yesterday they came to visit. The first time since I quit, and the first time since March because of the pandemic. I managed to not drink! I actually even filled up small bottles of vodka and stashed them in places I could easily sneak if I wanted (I haven't told my husband and he still drinks, so we have alcohol in the house). And I resisted! I ate waaaaaayyyy too many peanut m&ms. But I didn't drink! I am so proud of myself. I'm a bit disappointed that I went so out of my way to 'plan' for the sneaking, but I'm convinced I will be able to stay on track now.

A few years back I had a job that I hated, a boyfriend who didn't like me, and a serious drinking problem. I would get home from work, sometimes at 2 am, drink until I passed out, wake up for work hungover and reeking of booze, and rinse and repeat. I got a new job that I liked, but continued drinking every night. On the weekend, I'd wake up late in the afternoon, probably still drunk, and continue drinking. I was not happy in my life, and I used alcohol to numb myself to it. 

I got a new boyfriend, and in the beginning he'd drink with me. Then he started cutting back , then quit drinking with me, but I kept drinking. Every night. And then the fights started, fights where I said terrible things I didn't mean and couldn't remember the next day. There came a point where I had to choose between him and the alcohol. So I quit drinking, but I didn't do it for me.

After a while I started again, but just the weekends, and no vodka. Just hard cider or seltzers. He travelled often though, and while he was gone I'd drink heavily and more often than not I'd text him something stupid and we'd fight again. 

He hasn't traveled in a while, but we've been more lax about alcohol. At first it was always on the weekend. He'd play games and have 1-2 drinks, and I'd get completely wasted, not eat, and be sick for the whole weekend. Then it slipped into a random Tuesday. Then maybe Tuesday and Thursday. I could feel myself falling into the old pattern. 

We broke up, amicably, about a month ago, simply realizing that what we wanted out of life was too different. We don't see eye to eye on a lot of things, and since we've been quarantining together since March those things became very apparent. We are still very good friends, and are planning to continue to hang out in the future. I'm looking forward to being his friend. I was not a very good girlfriend. 

Since we broke up I've had the worst anxiety about living on my own again. Was I going to go back to drinking every night, calling out sick for work once a month because I was too hungover? I was terrified. 

And then I realized I don't have to be!! I've known the answer for a long time, I just didn't want to face it. I'm going to live sober, 100%.

Once I came to face myself the anxiety lifted. I don't have the desire to drink anymore. It's never brought me an ounce of happiness. It might not be easy all the time, but this time I'm doing it for me, because I want to, and that makes all the difference. 

I'm so excited for the future. I have a great job that I want to excel at. I have so many projects I want to do to make my house a place I want to live in for a long time. I discovered I can draw digital art on my tablet, and I want to keep practicing. I can't wait! I've also started taking care of my mental health, and am trying to learn to love myself better. 

Tomorrow is my first sober birthday in a decade, if not longer. I'll be 31, and I've wasted so much of the last 10 years being drunk. My ex (now best friend) wants to spoil me and take me for coffee and buy me takeout from wherever I want. When I told him I was quitting drinking for good he was so supportive. We might not be a couple any longer, but we love each very much.

Today is 5 months sober for me. I’m beyond grateful to this sub and Annie Grace and for the strength to somehow make the decision not to drink and actually keep it. 

Also, last night I ran with some neighbors that were in a weekly run club that we put together about 4 years ago. We took a break last winter and yesterday was the first time we got back together. The club used to meet at a brewery and then finish there, where I’d have 2-3 craft beers and maybe would buy a bottle of wine on the way home, resulting in a Friday morning that felt cloudy and anxious and gross. Last night we just met up on our street, ran 5K, and went to a local bar where they have outdoor seating. The bartender is known for his creative mixed drinks and when I, ordering last, asked if he had a recommendation for something NA, he paused for a second and then said, “I’ll make you something.” He made me a delicious tart drink with loads of fresh mint that was SO refreshing that my neighbors were interested in getting one too! I had to say “well - this one doesn’t have booze.” And so I was outed. And it was FINE. People react similarly to how you react to your own news. I shared how happy I am now, and how great I feel. Really it doesn’t matter what anyone thinks, but sharing this news in a group that was heavily rooted in drinking and feeling good about it felt great. Having an option of something just as (if not more) delicious to drink felt amazing. Im realizing the fears that kept me from making this decision long ago were unfounded.

After many, MANY bad nights of losing money I just got so fed up and disgusted with myself that I said I can’t do this anymore.

It was that simple. I just decided I can’t and I won’t.  Alcohol is a different beast.  It’s everywhere. Every time I see people drink in a movie, on tv, dancing having fun.  

They don’t show you the insanely dumb and repetitive conversations you have with other drunk people.  The hand shaking before you have that first morning beer.  The dead eyed stare of totally not listening or comprehending what the fuck this person is saying because you want a god damn martini, NOW.  

The constant shitting. Oh my god. Making excuses to not talk to people on the phone because you’re so drunk you couldn’t even act sober for money.  Running low on alcohol and getting nervous.  Being so drunk you couldn’t even start the car if you wanted to.  

My old neighbor was an alcoholic.  I remember being sober around him when he had a party at his house and I was just looking around at how stupid , frustrating, and loud the conversations going on were.  

The constant lies he would say, as I started to feel more and more like him.  One night he pulled out this wad of cash and told me to get him some liquor.  I had been drinking and there was no way I was going to drive.  He was absolutely trashed and he’s huge, so it’s not like taking a very drunk mans keys would have worked out.

He sped to the liquor store, which is just around the corner. Bought like 24 beers and a god damn huge thing of Jaeger.  He was red faced and sweaty as he poured an entire huge glass of it and just slammed it down.  I instantly felt afraid because that was like 8 shots in that glass.

I was thinking even as drunk as I was at the time, is this the end game?  He can barely stand, he’s red as hell, he’s playing the same songs over and over and he’s so sweaty .

I had never brought it up with him before but I just straight up asked him if he drinks alone. Drinks during the day. Sneaks drinks when people aren’t around.  He said no no no and I know nobody who can slam  an entire glass of liquor like that is a fucking liar.

What I saw was my future.  This wasn’t a party, alcoholics will drink with Satan as long as he has booze.  This wasn’t happy go lucky beers with the guys like you see in a movie.  What I saw in him, others must see in me.  

I felt betrayed, that he lied right to my face.  As he slammed more and more, he finally, FINALLY, had reached a level of drunk where he could open up that yeah he might have a bit of a problem.

Alcoholics are liars, they only care about one thing, and I thought this was my friend, but I was just an empty vessel to drink with and listen to his same god damn rambling stories.  

I’m 32. I’ve struggled with alcohol for a few years now, off and on.  The other day I fell off the wagon and bought 3 huge bottles of champagne to share with my girlfriend.  This was after we had already been drinking.

I remember just wanting her to leave ; just go back home so I can drink by myself, how I “really” drink and feel safe from prying eyes and judgment.  That’s when I realized that I’m reaching a dangerous level of asshole drunk.

I completed my first sober week (from everything) two weeks ago, even after being tempted with my favorite booze at the lake with dear friends. It was my first sober week in probably...8 years (mid-20s). 

It felt amazing, like my soul was returning. I used to write a lot, and I have stopped over the past year. During this time, I've been drinking everyday. But, that first week, my desire to write and artistically express myself returned! Typically it would have been viewed as a burden. 

I initially set out Fridays as my day to enjoy alcohol. The first Friday came, and... I didn't enjoy the feeling of being in*toxic*ated. I had no regrets breaking sobriety, but it was eye opening. And I drank too much. And hardly had any sleep. 

The following week (this week), cravings for alcohol came! I hadn't really experienced them the first week. I avoided them but I broke sobriety late Thursday evening into Friday morning (in my mind: it's 12AM! FRIDAY!), and this leads me to right now. 11AM. Work in 5 hours. Not sleepy. Drank until 6AM. Already hungover. Feel like shit. Anxious. 

So, I think...this means, I'm going to give up alcohol 100%. The past two times I've drank have set me back. And it will continue to happen. No more. . .

Luckily I had been cutting back before I chose to stop completely. By cutting back I mean, one bottle of wine a night or one day without drinking for a couple of weeks, before a 2 bottle night and choosing to stop for my own benefit. I’ve been drinking rather heavily for 10 years and it’s time for me to grow up and enjoy my 30s as my happiest and healthiest decade.

For some reason though, when my alarm went off, I feel so much more tired than usual. This happened yesterday, I felt tired as I woke up and also had a bit of a crash mid day.

Not feeling sick, just kind of exhausted. I’m assuming my body is working hard to heal up again and it’s taking some energy out of me.

Does he feel the crosshairs 
upon him still? 
An invitation to fire at will.
Modern life a bitter pill?
Stuck in the throat,
like a silent scream.
A nightmare end 
to the childhood dream. 

I watch the fella, 
from a distance. 
The all too familiar, 
shambolic gait. 
He studies the floor, 
stooped & downcast. 
His trembling hands, 
stuffed deep, 
into a well worn Barbour jacket,
with it's greasy, moleskin pockets.

Clearly once big & proud, 
he's now trying to shrink. 
Wants desperately to be ignored.
But - 
he needs another draft, 
of the bitter bile of vile regret.
 
Only the 'offy' 
will help him forget. 
Only in the dark, 
with the curtains tight, 
as he chokes back, 
his thinly promised oblivion,
can he turn another 
unwelcome day, 
into that queesy dream. 
Of the long gone velvet night.
Re-live the fight, 
push away the fright, 
turn up the volume
on the screaming emptiness, 
of his lonely home made hell.

Walking down the hall to piss. (uniformed young men, in frames on the wall seem to mock him). 
He catches sight 
of the stranger in the mirror 
& halts. 
Staring...
into the blood shot, 
weary, 
too old eyes. 
The mask disappears, 
no more disguise. 
He grips the frame, 
in despair. 
He gulps for air 
and starts to quietly cry...
dropping slowly to the floor, 
to curl up fetal 
& wait for the end.

Eventually, 
he dreams 
& sees bloodied bayonets, 
as far as the eye can see. 
A broken child, 
he charges onto the points - gleefully! 
Feeling no pain, he howls..
in the ecstasy of victory 
& release, 
blood pounding the temples, 
he's free at last.
Free! 
Scorched & purged, 
in the fire 
of sacrificial redemption.
Delighted. 
Smothering the grenade, 
that childhood tossed his way. 
Soak up the explosion 
& be the sacrifice, 
be the lamb, 
be the fattened offering 
for the prodigals..

..'till morning 
when - surrounded - 
by empty tins & bottles 
(arranged in all round defence)
He rises with an anguished sigh.
& with trembling hands, 
once more, 
he unlocks the door 
& steps over the start line...
Once more into the breach. 
His tortured mind, 
responding, 
like Pavlov's soldier, 
to a faintly heard 
& distant bugle call.

Pale blue eyes, 
watered with old 
& new tears. 
Squinting, 
into the cold, 
relentless, 
winter sunlight.
Treading that familiar, 
well worn path.
To the door, 
of promised oblivion. 
Again.

A mumbled, 
fumbled exchange. 
Purchase made. 
He exits.
He shuffles home. 
Forgotten & alone.

I've been browsing this subreddit for a while and I decided that now was the time to finally make a post.

Long story short, my drinking didn't begin to become a real problem until my mother passed due to a 7 year battle with lung cancer in November 2017. Ever since then, my alcohol consumption has gradually increased. However, most of my drinking was happening every Friday and Saturday night as my way to unwind from the work week. 

Well it truly got out of hand after I became unemployed in August of last year. I began drinking more and more during the week, until I was finishing a 1.75L bottle of whiskey every 4-5 days. I would have a stretch of like 2 or 3 days every once in a while when I would abstain from drinking simply because my body felt like absolute shit. But, lo and behold, I would eventually return to the liquor store and the process would begin anew. Quarantine certainly didn't help, as I was even more bored and worried about employment. 

Anyways, a few days ago, I had enough. I was tired of feeling like crap everyday. I was tired of my sleep schedule being completely fucked, waking up at 3 in the afternoon and sleeping restlessly every night. 

I am now 8 days sober!!! This is the longest I have gone in at least a year without a drink and I feel great. 

I used to cook all the time, whether it's chicken, steak, an omelette, etc. While I was drinking so much I just didn't bother and ate HORRIBLY. I've now been more motivated to eat healthier food and cook more fresh meals for myself. I even woke up today at 7,  sauteed some mushrooms and onions, and made an omelette! I bought some fresh salmon fillets yesterday and am planning on pan searing them tonight for dinner. 

Well this turned into a longer post than I initially intended. The main point is that I'm feeling amazing! I have more energy, am enjoying things like cooking again, and am excited about being the old me again. IWNDWYT!!!",4,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9550684690475464}"

2020-08-07 10:59:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i5fc6k/2_years_sober/,2 YEARS Sober! :),"I just realized (hard to believe if you are a daily drinker) that I passed 2 years sober a week or so back.

2 years ago, I was a daily drinker.  I was hating my life.  Swearing to myself every morning while in the shower that I wouldn't drink that night after work.  Then like clockwork, at 5pm I would mindlessly head to the store and pick up beer.  I felt like shit on a daily basis.  I ""Solved"" my problems each night by drinking alone while watching whatever sports were on TV that night.  I don't remember what changed in my mindset, but I wanted to take control of my life.  I didn't want to be remembered by people as a drunk.  I was making stupid decisions, I was hurting the people I love by being absent most of the time.  I was slowly killing myself.

So how did I stop drinking?  The first step for me was a strong desire to want to stop.   That step took a while because even though I wanted to stop... I just couldn't.  I really enjoyed drinking.  I couldn't work up the courage to just STOP.  I thought my friends would judge me.  How could I deal with work functions that were based around free drinks?  I ran countless scenarios though my head on what life would be like without alcohol.  I always come to the conclusion that it was impossible to get it out of my life.My life revolved around drinking.  I didn't realize at the time, but that was the addictive voice talking.  The addictive voice always has a reason why removing alcohol from your life is a bad idea.    I read some motivational stuff on the internet and statements like this stuck out to me  ""If not now, when?""  ""Today is the first day of the rest of your life.""  ""You can't change the past and the future won't be how you envision it.  The only thing you can control is the NOW, this moment.""  So I decided, today was the day.  It was going to suck... but if not today, when?

The second step, I went on to amazon and ordered a self help book ([Allen Carr's - Easy Way to Stop Drinking without Willpower](https://www.amazon.ca/Allen-Carrs-Drinking-Without-Willpower-ebook/dp/B07G15XHQW/ref=sr_1_2?crid=C3UZ0TPVPGAY&dchild=1&keywords=allen+carr%27s+easy+way+to+stop+drinking&qid=1596809250&sprefix=allen+car%2Caps%2C156&sr=8-2)).  When I received the book, I read it over the next couple days.  It also comes with some hypnotherapy CD that I listened to as well AFTER reading the book, like the instructions state.

Since then, I have had ZERO desire to drink.  In fact, at times I have to refrain from speaking about alcohol in an attempt to not sound preachy.   The book just made so much sense to me.  Alcohol was providing NOTHING in my life, it was only taking.

The third step was surrounding myself with positivity.  This was really tough because due to drinking a lot of the people and things in my life were based around negativity.  Misery LOVES company.  So I really made a solid attempt at looking at the brightside of life.  This helped relieve stress and gave me some optimism...life wasn't so bad.  My problems weren't as big as I thought they were... I also cut out people who were a negative influence on my life.

Fourth step.. set goals!  I needed something to strive for, something to work towards.   Something I could rely on when tempted to drink.  Drinking wasn't helping me accomplish anything.  All drinking did was take time away from me.

A couple years earlier I started getting into backcountry camping/hiking and mountain climbing.  So I set a goal to climb Kilimanjaro (the highest mountain in Africa) before my 40th birthday.    So I had to do it before August 2020.   Long story short... I successfully summited Mount Kilimanjaro on Feb 24th, 2020.

So am I cured?  Doubtful.  I believe this is a life long struggle... My body will never forget.  If somehow I  drink I am susceptible to falling back into old habits.  But nobody forces alcohol down your throat, only you can do that... so for now I think I am safe.   However, there was a time when I was close to 3 years sober in my late 20's and fell back into my ways when a good friend got married.  I felt I could have ""a couple beers"" to celebrate his special occasion.  I then didn't drink for about a month after the wedding... then didn't drink for 2 weeks... then another week, then only on the weekend... then before I knew it I was back to daily drinking within a couple months.  I continued to drink everyday for the next decade.

I don't think about drinking every waking moment anymore.  In fact I can go days without thinking about it now.  I continue to come to this subreddit as a reminder of where I came from.  I try to support others who were in a similar hopeless situation as me.   It does get better, but you have to really want it.  It is HARD.  I climbed a 6000m (20 000ft) mountain... and that was easier than quitting drinking.  If you do ""fail"" and drink again... just get back on that horse and try again.  Learn from your mistake.  Analyse why you are drinking, learn what your triggers are and how to prevent them.  Just don't give up!

The parallel never occurred to me until I began my response. While I am no wordsmith, maybe this experience will resonate with others:

To use a little bit of a word picture, I'll tell you a *very* true personal story to make a point. Years ago, my son wanted a kayak. I made a deal with him that if he saved his money, enough for one end of it, I would pay for the other end :) - it was a 2 person kayak. We bought it and pretty much immediately went to a large river that happens to be near where we live - it was the 1st day of January and freezing outside. (Not ""Finland freezing"" but still very cold.) The water was frigid! And the river was especially high because of recent heavy rains. If you have never been in such conditions, that high volume of water moves with overwhelming and absolute power. It has no grace at all. To make a long story short, because of a bonehead move I made in my total inexperience a few minutes after we launched, the kayak flipped.

While we had life jackets on, we both also had high rubber boots to be able to get in the boat without getting our feet wet. (Another terrible choice.) Those boots filled with water and became like lead weights. My son was probably 10 at the time. Thankfully, we both were able to grab the kayak to help us stay together and afloat. He was terrified.

I looked down river and saw a log jam was in our path. These create something called hydraulics. The water colliding with the wall of debris basically forces and holds you down. It would have been certain death.

I told my son that he needed to trust me. I told him that I was going to grab him, swim toward the shore and was going to push him onto the bank. I also told him no matter what happened not to go back in the water. With that, I grabbed him under his arms and swam as hard as I could toward the bank.

There was a clearing and I pushed him up onto the bank with all my might and he successfully cleared the water and scrambled away from the edge. Luckily his boots had come off but I was not as fortunate.

I was unable to get out also because the force I used to ensure he was on the bank pushed myself away from the bank and was continuing to be swept down river. I had enough time to repeat to him ""no matter what happens, do not get near the water!""

I was exhausted from the absolute effort I made to ensure my son was safe. I could see that the current was moving me back toward the center of the river but after a couple of breaths, I began to swim as I hard as I could to get to the shore before I got to the log jam. I could hear the churning of the water colliding and swirling downward against this wall of debris. It was terrifying.

I ultimately was able to get to the bank and out of the water a few hundred yards down river from my son. I remember staggering toward him through the briers and brush. I grabbed him up in my arms and found a place for us to lay down so I could keep him warm.

A few minutes later I heard a faint shout from the other side of the river. A deer hunter in an orange vest had seen the whole thing and told us he called the local rescue team. About 40 minutes later we heard a boat struggling to come up river to where we were.

Why did I share this? I had never thought of the parallel until thinking about your situation. I then realized our experience with alcohol is like this for many of us:

That raging river is alcohol and the vast majority who go into that river, ultimately tip their boats and are swept along the currents (we are no longer in our boats in control of where we go.) Not everyone recognizes the dangers of the hydraulic ahead that is going to take us under and keep us under. 

Some of us though are presented with the unique opportunity to save ourselves from that fate and are able to get to the shore (to become sober). But, in order for us to stay safe, we have to stay out of the river.

You two are safely on shore and you have each other to cling to. You both have your lives and you both have the opportunity to decide not to risk getting lost in the river again. (Think of how many people have made it to shore and for whatever reason felt like they had become strong and wise to the currents and jumped back in, never being able to get to the shore again.)

TL;DR  Allen Carr's 'Stop Drinking Now' book has been revolutionary for me.  It's re-programmed my brain so that I see alcohol as an actual, physical threat - like a tiger lurking in the bushes - rather than as something pleasurable.  I can no longer think of alcohol in the same way again.

So, a bit of context...I've been battling with drink for 30 years - over half my life.  I've had two significant previous periods when I managed to stop drinking: 4 months about 15 years ago, and then a whole year, two years ago.  Ultimately where I failed on both occasions was in not having shifted my mindset because I thought that by not drinking I was giving something up, something valuable and worth having.  This created a feeling of denying myself, no matter how much I pretended I wasn't.  And while it was great not drinking during those two periods of abstinence I was also a bit miserable because deep down I felt like I was denying myself.  I probably also beat myself up a bit for not being able to enjoy a casual drink like 'normal' people.  Almost inevitably I went back to it, telling myself that I was in control.  Yet another lie...

Anyway, I recently ordered some beer as part of a supermarket delivery.  However what I wanted wasn't in stock so they replaced it with alcohol free beer instead.  My first reaction was annoyance but some part of my brain quickly decided to capitalize on this and take it as a sign to do something.  So, I'd been listening to the This Naked Mind audio book and Annie Grace mentions Allen Carr in the credits so I decided to read Stop Drinking Now...and...Wow.  

I loved his approach to the topic.  How he led me step by step down a path, slowly leading me out of the addiction maze.  It has completely changed how I feel about alcohol - not how I think - how I feel, and that I think is the magic of the book because emotions will almost always overpower reason, especially when those emotions are augmented by withdrawal symptoms and a belief that alcohol is part of my identity.  My experience is that the end result is exactly as Mr Carr promised at the start of the book, that stopping drinking (NB: not giving up) will be easy if you follow the instructions in the book.

Now you may be skeptical and I understand if you are because it's only been a couple of weeks.  I'm a little skeptical myself because there's a little voice at the back of my mind warning me against making this post because it's a clear case of pride coming before a fall.  All I can tell you is that this feels very different to the last time I stopped drinking.  It has been like stepping through the sliding doors into a world where I am not a drinker.  It feels great to be free.  Although, I do now have to face up to the aspects of my character and life that encouraged my drinking in the first place, but still better that than hiding from them.  There is no way I could have reached this place without Allen Carr showing me the way.

 I've got just a couple of disclaimers.  The writing style may put some people off.  I didn't have an issue with it mainly because it didn't bother me, but I also knew it was written in that way for a purpose.  Secondly, I threw myself into the book.  I was totally committed to doing what he said.  I also took my time reading it so that I had time to absorb the words fully.  I suspect that the book will only work if you suspend your disbelief while reading it.

I wanted to thank everybody on this sub for supporting me over the last six months. This is my journey, and I'm putting in the work... But, I could not have done it without all of you on SD supporting me everyday,  chatting with me and making me laugh every day.

I was lucky enough to find this sub only a couple of days after I quit drinking. Early on I listened and learned and hung on every day. Now I try to offer up as much support as I can. I still have my bad days and a couple of triggers, but it certainly is much easier as time goes by.

Thank you friends!

I have posted before a few times about milestones and time and time again, I return to drinking thinking, ""One occasionally will not hurt"". One social drink turns into several that night and the thought to keep it going at home. Then that turns into days of drinking every evening after work to calm down. That kills all motivation and productivity for months. 

So today, I hit 30 days sober for the last time (hope I updated my badge correctly) and that 30 number will just keep getting larger and larger.

I also checked my Quitzilla app and as of today, I am 30 days sober, 66 days NO social media (that's right, NONE. outside reddit), and 1600 days no smoking.

I know I should only worry about myself and keeping up with the joneses is a miserable way to life but I can't help but feel a bit down when I compare myself to some of my peers at my age. I spent my twenties battling depression, boozing really hard, losing relationships, friendships, and just not taking life seriously.

I expected the opposite honestly.,"So im pretty close with my sister, we have some crazy similar thoughts at times, usually almost at the exact same time like we are in n each others heads. When i stopped drinking, i didnt tell anyone. It was very much a me thing. I did it for me. And honestly i couldnt give a shit if anyone liked or disliked my decision. 

My sister is very much a drinker. And very much one of those people who wants everyone else to have a good time as well. She can be a bit pushy at times. 

My mom isnt much of a drinker, but has dealt with my dad who was a bad alcoholic. Hes long since quit after she gave him an ultimatum. 

But i was hanging out with my sister the second night night from when i stopped drinking and she instantly noticed that i didnt have a drink. She offered me some of her liquor, which i turned down. Which brought up the topic that i had quit drinking. She seemed kinda weirded out at first. But let it go. I told her my reasons and we got on with our night. Then of course her being my sister she started pestering and joking to me about not drinking. Even offering me a shot later in the night, i think she just forgot or was testing me idk.

From the outside looking in, it sounds like she was just being an absolute asshole to me. But our relationship is very much jokingly assholish with each other. 

Anyways after that night she didnt really pester me or bring it up anymore. I also avoided almost all interaction with anyone for a week because i was just a loose cannon and work was not helping and didnt want to say something i didnt mean out of anger. Luckily she understood.

Probly a week and a half after quitting we hung out again. She watched me play Last Of Us because i hadnt played it yet and she had been begging me to play it for the past couple years. One of her friends made a surprise visit. They joined in and watched me play. Then out of nowhere she said to her friend ""my brother quit drinking and smoking because hes superman"".

There was no joking in her voice, it was sincere. Made me smile.

Then couple days later we hung out again and i had reached down for my soda. She thought i had an alcoholic beverage. After i reasurred her she said "" boy i was about to slap you"".

Made me feel good haha. 

Meanwhile my mom seems to not give a shit and instead cuts me off after asking me why i quit to try and justify why she isnt going to quit smoking. Tried to pull the alcohol withdrawal card for cigarettes, saying if she quits she could die. At that point i just left.  Clearly you only want to talk about yourself even though you asked about me. 

In a way it kinda sounded like she was trying to one up me. Idk.

But i fully expected my mom to be fully supportive seeing how she's lived through alcoholism. But instead she was just dismissive. Kinda pissed me off tbh, but whatever. 

But my sister is on board and i didnt not expect that at all.

I'm at 7 days since my last drink after a hard wake-up call that told me I can't treat this lightly. After struggling through the first few days with the ""just onesies"" and the ""do I really have to stop forevers"" I feel my head is clearer and the thoughts of guilt and shame are further in the back of my mind. 

FYI: I'm currently in one of the great beer capitals of the world for the next few months (let's just say they're good at starting wars but not finishing them) living with my SO. Where I'm from (let's just say it's cold and has 1 A for every consonant in the name), alcohol is fairly expensive and decently hard to come by comparatively, albeit you can still buy beer and wine in corner stores where I live but it's not the norm. Anyway, I'm walking through a grocery store here, amazed at all the low prices (could also be my lack of Euro conversion skills) and I come across the booze aisle. When I say aisle I mean it takes up like 1/5 of the store, also there's little bottles of brandy and vodka at the register, radlers in the dairy section next to the chocolate milk, tall cans in the produce aisle, etc. 

So I'm fixin' to drink me something cold cuz my pasty white ass is sweating bullets in this heat, and I'm noticing that for the same price of an Iced Tea I can grab a cold radler (only 2.5% alcohol!) or for a Euro more I could be enjoying my bike ride around the city with a Jack and Coke in a can. Maybe I should drop 2€ and grab 3 assorted tall cans of the local brews, it's a cultural experience right!? Then I see the 750ml of Jim Beam bourbon for 8€ and my mind is blown. How is this legal!? 

All I was seeing was the low price of getting a buzz on, but then I started to think about the cost. Sure I could decide to enter the liquid amusement park for only a small admission fee, but what's gonna happen after I finish that first beer? Maybe nothing, but it's a distinct possibility that I may get locked in the hall of mirrors, and that's not possible with Iced Tea. So, all that to say: never confuse the price with the cost.

Im not doing any 12 step program but have a good chunk of friends who are in the same boat as me so i talk to them about sobriety stuff. I consider myself blessed because my country had a full-on lockdown which I worked through (I'm a mental health assistant). All that is over now and its been ok. But I've since left that job and gone back to uni. My old workmates have organized a goodbye party in my name so i feel really stink saying no. I don't think i can get out of it. Its at a bar and its become apparent its just an excuse for a piss up. I do want to see them again but I'm feeling really uneasy about going to a bar (the last time i went to one was the last night i drank 8 months ago). As I've accepted myself going I'm noticing I'm not accepting the possibility i might pick up. Im just worried ill have a 'fuck it' moment and just order a drink. 

I honestly thought i was a bit stronger than this but that was both arrogant and naive. Has anyone been in this position before?",4,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9927155375480652}"

Thankfully there is no temptation of going anywhere with friends because I live in Oregon and everything is still pretty much closed. I don’t even even feel any temptation. 

I am just so ashamed for lying to my boyfriend and my work. I didn’t even tell him I missed work today and tomorrow because I called out for two days. He thinks I’m going to work while I just awkwardly sit at home having a two day hangover. I miss money because of my stupid addiction to feeling relief. 

I just literally hate myself right now, I’m disgusted with myself, I know I can do better than this and I’m determined because I’ve gone almost a year last year without drinking.

I was stopped by local officers wearing only a t-shirt with no belongings, staggering alone down the middle of the street in downtown...
Officer: “Have you been drinking tonight?”
BOM (Blackout Me): “ALOT”

Let me give you some context…I am 26 years old, I just graduated college with a BFA in Design. I work for several organizations most notably a nonprofit teen center to help underrepresented and underprivileged youth in my area. I have been there for nearly 7 months and I work as a creative intern at the moment, mostly focusing on programming, social media, and event planning. I also work part-time for the library on campus where I digitize archived documents for future online viewing and referencing. I love my work, I take pride in what I create, and I’ve loved my life since graduating college. (Even though every 2020 grad understands how awful this year was to graduates of every kind, just a giant middle finger to any student that achieved something academically this past spring.)

How did I end up alone on the street at 2 a.m. being accosted by police?

I’ve had a drinking problem for nearly my entire life. It all started at the age of 14 when a strange older boy dropped me and a girlfriend of mine off a handle of cheap, low-grade vodka to share and enjoy while my mom was out. I sat on the trampoline in my backyard and chugged nearly 1/4 of the bottle in my first “sip”. That first encounter should have been the sign that this liquid was not my friend BUT oh no, I’m too stubborn for that. This first evening of binge drinking ended up with my devastated mother hovering over my nearly dead hypothermic body in a hospital bed. The paramedics cut through my (probably fugly) teenage attire to revive me after I had gone unconscious. I woke up to my bio father’s face…which if you have daddy issues, you know is never a good sign. People were worried. I should have been worried.

I drank fairly heavily for the remainder of high school and even into my early college days.
I started to drink often and excessively about a year or so ago. But this year has felt different. Some of the things my drinking has caused really helped to shine a big, fat spotlight on the reflection glaring back at me each time I picked up a bottle or ordered a cocktail.

My Warning Signs:

1. I scared my teenage brother into having a friend pick him up from my house after he returned home with me from my 26th birthday packed full of river floating and sangria sipping.

2. I returned home with a tinder date and nearly broke my back on a barstool. I still have a deep scar to remind me on the small of my back.

3. I lost my keys and got locked out of my apartment. My best friend had to find me via my location sharing and save me from god only knows what.

4. I ordered an uber and got lost in my brothers apartment complex. He finally found me in the grass somewhere. I then cried for hours on his couch about his newborn son’s wellbeing.

5. I threw up all over myself and my ex-boyfriends bed then passed out for him to clean it up.

6. I threw up all over myself and my current boyfriends bed then passed out for him to clean it up.

AND

7. I got arrested.

That Monday evening I had gone to dinner with my mom and some girlfriends. It was pretty lowkey, we shared a few beers and margaritas over dinner. I left with a friend and continued to drink wine and beer until my boyfriend picked me up. I was fairly intoxicated at this point and talked him into scootering to a local bar to share a drink with me. We got into a fight at the bar and I stormed off. I ended up crying to two random people smoking outside of their apartment for awhile until my boyfriend finally found me and asked me to leave with him. I refused.

The man I was crying to took me up into his apartment…at this point I was blacked out. Somehow I ended up with no clothes on and apparently tried to jump off of his roof. With a failed attempt he secured a t-shirt on me and I returned to my favorite defense mechanism…FLIGHT. I ran and ran and ran until I was too far for him to catch me. I was half way to my house when cops found me on the side of the road. I remember bits and pieces of that interaction but I didn’t fully return until they had me booked and I was sitting in the cold, dirty jail cell. I called them racists, bastards, assholes, pigs and almost broke both of my hands on the metal door locking me in that square room with no windows. I watched a girl sit on the ground and rub her breakfast (oatmeal) into her hair and face. I talked with another girl about how she ended up there. I cried, I threw up, I cried some more. I wished harm on all the officers sitting happily outside of those doors, mocking all of us at notably one of our lowest points in life. I raged and slept and finally they let me out to do my paperwork, mug shot, and fingerprints. I sat waiting for about an hour until they gave me the 2 rings, 1 necklace, and 2 pairs of earrings that I was wearing when I entered the facility. Those were my only belongings. I didn’t know a single person…other than my ex-ex-ex-boyfriend’s phone number (and I was definitely not calling him). I grasped a piece of paper with another inmates contacts like “mema” and “dad”, as if a random stranger’s family and friends would help me in this situation. I didn’t know my mom’s number, my boyfriend’s number, my best friend’s number…no one. So I walked.

I walked bare foot in the heat for roughly 3 miles until I came across the first business. My hands were bruised, blistered, and bleeding. I had welts the size of tennis balls forming on the balls of each foot. I walked into the Mexican restaurant to ask for a cup of water and to use their phone…they refused. I asked a seated man if I could use his phone, he declined. After walking out, he followed me and asked if I needed help. I politely asked if he could drive me the rest of the way home which was about 3 minutes from this taco spot. He did and I thanked him. I sat outside of my apartment for about an hour waiting for anyone to come by. My landlords sister walked past and I told her about my situation. She immediately called the cops and let me into my apartment. I got inside and face-timed my boyfriend on my laptop. He was shocked. He had no idea and came right over.

No one knew where I was or if I was okay for 12+ hours. I was missing…I was lost…I was gone…and I wasn’t missed. That scares me more than anything.

After talking it over with the cop and piecing most of the night together, he left me with a contact and case number. I didn’t think I had been raped…but I didn’t know.

“I didn’t think I had been raped.”

I never want this to be a thought I have again. I’m done. I’m one week sober and I pray more than anything that it sticks this time. It has to.

I've tried to quit many times before and always refer to the date as a good indicator for my quit days. I like patterns, I like to start the first day of sobriety on set dates, the first of a month or a pattern in the date. 
07/07, 08/08...

It's probably an excuse to limit my quit days but each time I've been serious, I've always set my quit day to be a certain date, specifically if that date has a pattern to it. 
I recently held five days of no drinking as of the 1st, succumbed, drank and now starting again but I've already rationalised drinking today because the date is wrong for me, I'll start again tomorrow because it's the 08/08.

Does anyone else do this? It frustrates me that I NEED to have a pattern in the date to consider it as day one!!!  

I usually go 7-10 days each time and give in again. But mostly the issue is when I want to quit, I see a reason not to based on the date I quit. 

Tomorrow, I plan on my new day one based on the date alone... 

I do have OCD and I am sure this is a factor, it is frustrating to me to think, oh I could start my sobriety tomorrow but seen as it's the 23/07/2020, I won't... If it was the 07/07/2020 or 01/08/2020, I would...",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9967806339263916}"

2020-08-06 22:42:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i55snz/im_finally_ready/,I'm finally ready,"I am a female lawyer and when I was a young associate at a mega firm, a male partner came after me.  I tried to shut it down but was scared of losing my extremely coveted position.  I decided to flirt, but go no further, until he started sexting me and then took things physically way far.  It became an extremely abusive relationship.  I remember the first night he crossed the line buying a handle of vodka and just going wild.  I ended up losing that coveted position when management found out about the relationship.

That was 3 years ago.  A lot of other shit happened and I too often looked to alcohol.  It became necessary to sleep.  Necessary to have in the house ""just in case"" something bad happened.

When I was in the hospital a year ago a doctor said ""you have a little bit of fatty liver but no more than that average American.""  But I knew it was from alcohol--I eat very healthily.  I am 32.

It's a year later and I have not had any seriously traumatic things happen (2020 in general aside) since last year.  Actually, I've gotten a promotion at my job, my relationship is thriving, and my finances are great.  But I still felt like I needed that brief injection of happiness before bed.  (Doesn't help that I've always taken hours to be able to fall asleep.) 

Lately, I've been worried I'm having symptoms of liver issues.  My abdomen and stomach are always bloated (I am not overweight).  My stools are pale.  I drink water constantly but always feel dehydrated (which can indicate an electrolyte problem).  I'm a bit of a hypochondriac but I also realize these are symptoms of liver problems.  I'm terrified.

That fear made me decide that I am done.  No more alcohol to sleep--if I don't sleep I don't sleep.  No more alcohol for anxiety--that's what prescription medication is for.  People younger than me have had fatty liver disease, hepatitis, pancreatitis, and liver failure.  My body is worth more than that.  I owe my body more than that.

So, I will not drink with you today.  I would appreciate any encouraging words as I'm having a very hard time-- I'm not physically addicted (drank about 300 ml before bed) but mentally it's hard not to get that little bit of happiness before bed.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9865527749061584}"

Clearly, I was wrong!

If I try to learn a new skill or language they'll take every opportunity to scoff and call it pointless.

If I stop eating sweets they'll come home with every fast food treat under the sun and try to force me to have some

And now, while trying to quit drinking, they're poking and prodding at the reasons why and trying to justify why I shouldn't.

This sounds so silly, but once I rode the wave of cravings for drink, I then started to crave cheese (that Cheetos comment definitely got me going!) Then I pizza. - then oh gosh! I didn't realise I was so hungry! 
Garlic bread with cheese is now on the go and I'm relieved. I didn't realise that it wasn't ethanol I was craving, but the heavy carb load which I'm managing with eating healthier on the whole.

Severe withdrawals.,"And at a time like this... man I felt so guilty but I wore my mask and washed my hands and they seemed fine although I still apologised profusely to everyone I spoke to.

The build up to going there was by far the worst and most terrifying experience I have ever had in my life and I've made myself very, very ill from drugs and alcohol combined many times before but this was next level. I had my mum keeping me company and even the dog came up and was worried about me so he was a welcome distraction but I was just freaking out, I couldn't stop moving and shaking uncontrollably, it was like my brain was damaged and something was tickling me from the inside out. I actually thought I was having a stroke until my mum asked me about the drink. I had been drinking a lot, getting ill, then drinking a lot, then getting ill over the last 2 years and this time I ran out...

Waiting in the carpark to go in (only one person allowed in at a time) was horrible, just sat in the car struggling to breathe and hold it together, drifting in and out of consciousness with these weird waves of buzzing going through my brain. When I got in there the guy checked me over and gave me some diazepam and told me to call my doctor in the morning. (This was at 2am, by the way)

By the time I got back home it was even worse and throughout the whole thing I was convinced I was going to die but I had one diazepam and within half an hour I started to feel a lot better and then my mum left and I had the best night's sleep I'd had in years.

The next few days were pretty unpleasant but the diazepam definitely took the edge off, even if it did make me super dopey but it was a relief and I slept and slept. Now four days later it's really starting to ease off and I now have to ease off the diazepam which is okay because it just feels weird anyway, although it miraculously cured all of my mental health issues (at least while I'm on it). Shame it's such a dangerously addictive and potentially toxic drug in it's own right but at least it did the job. It is a desperate measure after all.

Now I feel confident in staying away from the booze for a very long time. This was obviously a huge wake up call for me and thankfully my family are behind me in my decision although I think they wanted me to quit a long time ago! Thanks for reading and I wish you all the best in your own recoveries. Believe it or not this is my second time going through this but the first time I didn't realise how dangerous it could be and did it at home alone. If you end up having a fit/seizure and you're alone, it can end your life right then and there so be careful and try to let someone know what you're going through as early on as possible.

Now I'm going to try to beat my 5 year record, I'm currently 4 days in but to be honest every single day of those 5 years was just one day at a time anyway so every single day is meaningful and something to be proud of. If you worry to much about the big things it will be the little things that trip you up. Sorry, I'm rambling.

In the past year I've been up and I've been down too, but I've been present and felt my emotions fully without numbing them. I'd like to think I'm a better mom, a better daughter, a better person, but I'm not. Drinking was a symptom of the problems in my life, not the root cause of them. (I realize this is not the same for many others out there.) Not all my flaws have been magically solved by choosing not to drink. But I don't question for a second that I made the right choice for myself.

This has been the hardest and easiest thing. It's hard because of the drinking culture we have here in my state. Bar culture is a huge thing here. Mommy wine culture is a big one too. Alcoholism permeates thru almost every family and thru the generations in some way. It's hard because of the way problem drinking is normalized. It's hard because quitting was like breaking up with a best friend, a crutch I was leaning on. It's hard because many view addiction as a choice and not the degenerative disease it really is.

But it's easy because I sleep like a freaking baby now and don't wake up at 3am every night with anxiety and negative thoughts rushing thru my head. It's easy because my eyes are clear and my skin looks so much healthier and hydrated. It's easy because I don't want to develop liver disease, or pancreatic cancer, or even my own premature death. It's easy because I'm a better example for my son, and I will be able to better educate him from my own experiences about how dangerous alcohol actually is and how cautious we all need to be if we choose to consume alcohol. It's easy because I made a commitment not only to stop one problem in my life, but I know I can do something difficult if I really want to. It's easy because I have resources to fall back on when the going gets tough. (Shout out to r/stopdrinking! You guys are amazing!) And it's easy because I have an amazing support system and people who need me too.

People who know me know I'm very private and I don't like to share...well...anything. Especially that I've quit drinking. A lot of that is rooted in shame, remorse, guilt, and stigma. But if you've read this far and my story even resonates in a tiny way with someone, to hell with it. You all can know my business. Something I want to do in this next year is make myself a resource for others trying to quit or trying to stay sober.

I've had a chronic case of hemorrhoids for the past 8 years. I never got it checked out because I was embarrassed and thought I'd need surgery to fix it. Since stopping, I have not flared up! It seems to be healing itself more every week!

I've experienced dandruff for the past 2 years. I tried different shampoos, conditioners, no change. I'm happy to say I've been free of dandruff since week 3!

Also over the past 2 years, I've noticed my hands and feet would become INSANELY pruny after being in the shower for just 15 minutes. A day at the pool would make them revolting to look at. I've been planning a trip to a dermatologist to get it looked at, but always put it off. This is the week that I noticed it no longer happens! My hands are no longer pruny after showers or dishes!

For the past 4 years, I'd been suffering from a bad case of gingivitis, to the point where my breathe would smell like literal shit 5 hours from brushing my teeth. I'd brush and floss twice a day and use mouth wash, but it would still come back. I have not bothered trying to date these past several years because I was so self-conscious about it.
This week, I've noticed I no longer have the poo smell. I only have bad breath after a cup of coffee, which is easily fixable! It's amazing!

I used to experience diarrhea almost daily! Now I get soft regular shits (which definitely helps the hemorrhoids).


I am ecstatic at how quickly my body is healing. I initially quit because my liver enzymes were high. My thought was to take a break for 6 months, develop a bunch of healthy habits, then learn to moderate; but now that seems absolutely stupid! Why would I want to ingest something that has such a negative impact on my health?

This is easily the best thing I've ever done for myself. A big thank you to this community for all the support. Love you all!

So, super long term lurker (min 4 years), this is my very first post.  First thing I wanted to say I don’t want to take anyone’s space.  I don’t have any intention of completely stopping drinking, I just know the amount I am consuming, I am going to die prematurely if I don’t cut back significantly.  So if this is only for stopping drinking completely I will gladly take down my post.

I wanted to see if anyone has had any long term success in cutting drinking back to a more manageable level?  My wife and I have always been very heavy drinkers.  We are responsible drinkers, in the regard of we both have very successful jobs, neither one of us has every had a DUI, we have a nice home we own in the suburbs, nice cars to drive, and multiple around the world vacations a year.  Over all it’s a pretty great life.

With that being said, particularly during quarantine our drinking has gotten to levels, which will lead to serious health problems.  If I am being honest, on our heaviest days, we will finish a 1.75/Liter of Vodka a night.  On an average night we probably consume 1.3/1.4 Liters a night.  On a light night I will consume 750/ML, Average night a liter of Vodka.  We got to Costco for all of our booze, we find ourselves buying Vodka, a case at a time.  Seriously why on earth, do two people (we do not have children) need to buy Vodka buy the case?  

We have been heavy drinkers since we first got together (about 8 years together married 5)  but when we first started dating we would drink a few nights a week. In the last few years, it is pretty much a nightly thing, with me drinking about 6-7 liters of Hard liquor a week.  (weekends, I treat myself to Jack and Coke and a 1.75 of that is gone in just Friday/Saturday night)

I estimate that I am consuming somewhere around 18,000 Calories a week from Drinking, which has lead to a huge weight gain.

My current plan is to switch to drinking only on the weekends.  The rules being, if I have work the next day, I do not drink.  I made it 4 days in a row last week, with out a drink and as I write this, I haven’t had a drink since Saturday.  After literally a liter a night for 6 weeks, 4-5 days with out a drink, makes me insanely proud.

So has anyone else been able to find success in cutting back?  I feel like I still enjoy alcohol, but I know the levels I am at now, will result in an early death.  Has anyone else regularly consumed similar amounts and been able to go back to “casual drinking”  or is this pretty much an all or nothing type of thing?

In an ideal world, we will only drink on the weekends, we have been able to do this for 2 weeks so far, just wanted to know if this is possible long term.

2020-08-06 12:35:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i4v247/an_introduction_very_long/,An introduction (very long 🙂),"Hello everyone my name is Lee. 
I have lurked here for a while & thought I should post as the community seems a fantastic place to be.
It's a very long story & I've compressed it as much as poss. 
Some background to myself.
I am 43 yrs old from the UK, have been drinking since about age of 15.

Over those yrs it has taken many different forms, it started off while still in school with drink in the evenings for a laugh with mates, then onto pubs.
It really started to take a hold around 18-19 yrs old when working with builders who drank at lunch break & after work till pub closing time daily & all wkend.

At 19 I was given opportunity to do what I wanted for a career to work in nursing with mental health.
I grew up in a pretty rough area so fights weren't unusual but the fighting dramatically increased when I started drinking.
I was arrested while working the job & training to be where I wanted I had just been given which obviously blew away that job & the career in one go. 

I didn't see it coming & between ages of 21 & 24 I became fully dependent on drink, I could not hold down a steady job just laboring here & there, was drinking 24/7 from early morning there was no stopping.

I did stop suddenly at 24 yrs old not knowing much about physical dependence at the time & after 3 days of being violently sick, unable to walk or move. 
I actually started to feel better, could walk move & eat but started to hallucinate all of a sudden & had 3 bad seizures before & while in hospital.

My drinking changed from daily to periods of sobriety the longest being 9 months while on disulfuram.
Was diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety disorder etc.

Got my life back on track (ish) was working any job & studying IT at the same time.
Became Microsoft mcp & numerous qualifications afterwards for Microsoft & IT CEH security qualifications.

I met my ex wife when I was 29 who is my soulmate, I destroyed that as well.
The drink went through phases of attempted self control that always got out of hand to complete benders that lasted weeks at a time.

The excuse was always to shut my mind off, to relax.

Set up my own IT consultancy business small time but profitable & allowed me to work flexible (around my drinking is what I'm saying) 

I had it all at the time but couldn't see it & took it all for granted. 
With alcohol I was abusive, violent & nasty. 
Criminal record is extensive but not one offence while sober.

In 2018 I was diagnosed with aspergers/asd because it became apparent our youngest son who has asd, I show the same traits.

In the end 2018 I lost my wife, my home, my children, my drinking had spiralled & became too much, I was unable to go longer than 3 days sober and weeks/months continuous drinking.

I was being found collapsed all over the place & anywhere in street.

I lost everything I held close. 

I spent a year homeless sleeping (collapsing) in parks, dropping down anywhere & being picked up & helped by kind strangers.

From there I got a place of my own, I worked at building trust to see my children & I have them regularly.
I have had alot of support over the yrs via counselling, cbt etc and the desire to be abstinent & free from alcohol completely is truly there.

Unfortunately I cannot seem to break a cycle that seems to keep happening between 4 and 11 wks of sobriety.

I have never been over 11 wks since I started drinking at 15 only with disulfuram. 

My drinking now is binges that last for avg 4 days every 4 to 8 wks and I can't seem to break this part of my addiction.

I am terribly shy, have minimal contact with people & very socially anxious.
That's one reasons for asd diagnosis & drinks wrecked my confidence.

I don't think this helps because the further into sobriety I get the lonelier I get.

I avoided aa not because I didn't think it would work but because I can't get myself in there with lots of people, I am ok one on one like counselling but groups I can't do it. 
I am hoping I can change this with getting involved here 🙂

I'm great at IT I aced all my exams with results that were top tier but my heart lies in what I wanted to do when I was young, helping people.

I would like to be a counsellor or help people that struggle as I have with addiction but I'm stuck in limbo unable to see it through because I'm struggling with binges myself. 

It's the 1st time I've engaged with anyone other than counsellors or friends & family.

I've just gone backwards from 30 days. 

I am so sorry its rambling & long & probably depressing reading, 
I'm not used to speaking out or sure what I'm supposed to say to introduce myself tbh
It's me 🤷‍♂️

If you got this far 🙂

Monday night, I'd bought a six back of booze. It's been a very long time since I'd wanted to drink so badly. I've been in an emotionally wrecked space for a couple weeks now, and the relief wasn't coming through the usual means like meetings and connecting with other alcoholics or even spirituality - none of which have ever failed before. I was distraught and just wanted to *stop* feeling so damn shitty. 

I sat with the booze for a while, a little amazed and a lot pissed off with every passing minute that I wasn't drinking it. I'd made the decision to drink. The last time I did that, there was no little grace period between getting it home and drinking it. The bottle had been open within minutes and I was drunk within the hour. But I just kept playing the tape forward and backward, thinking about the shit circumstances of a whole life of drinking and the hundreds of things that could go wrong if I start up again. 

Eventually, it came down to the same sentiment that I learned here over two years ago the first time I decided to stop, and the same sentiment I was told in my first meeting. It's just one day at a time. It was already ten p.m. by the time I'd bought the booze, and I figured there wouldn't be much fun in an hour or so of drinking before passing out, and that if I really needed to get back on with the drinking, I ought to do it with enough time in the day to really do some damage. The morning came and there were life things to tend to that would have been a hell of a lot more difficult to manage drunk, so I just got through each hour, an hour at a time. 

If you're one day sober or five hundred days sober or five years sober, it's really just one day of not drinking at a time. It isn't easy, but it's a simple concept. I'm extremely grateful for the simplicity of it today. All I have to do is not drink for today.",162,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9942041039466858}"

My drinking habits tended to be maybe two or three glasses of wine on a weeknight, just at home with my boyfriend, and if I was going out with friends I might have a bottle to myself. I’d only get hangovers after one of those seldom, “bigger” nights; maybe once or twice a month. 

About two weeks ago, I stopped drinking. There was no decision leading up to it, or reason for it, or thought process behind it. I just thought I’d stop for a week.

I miss the taste of red wine and the relaxation it brings, but it wasn’t really a big deal. I think the real test for me will be the next time a social engagement comes up.

I spent most of this year trying to get sober and I have 81 wonderful days to show for it. It's been hard work but so fulfilling. Wanted to share some stuff that's changed since day 1.

I lost 20lbs! This may be due more to working out and eating better, but that's definitely easier to do sober! Not drinking a whole 1200kcal in a night definitely helps too! I've been slacking on working out and eating better lately due to work, but I'm consciously making better food choices.

I got a job, and I've kept it! I haven't been late or called off. I actually picked up a short shift to help someone out today on my day off as well. I was never a morning person, now I wake up at 5 to work from 7-3 most days. I really like my new job and am told I'm doing very well at it!

I'm cleaning up the past. I'm in the process of making amends. It's a little scary, and hasn't been totally pleasant sometimes, but even the unpleasant amends have given me relief and closure. I'm healing from things I didn't know needed healing.

I'm more financially sound. I started a loan rehabilitation program for my defaulted loans. Hopefully that will start to build my credit up as well. I'm looking forward to saving money, building my credit, and being more financially independent.

I'm making friends! I've met some great people through AA and am getting invited to things more! I'm also spending more time with old friends who I've ignored due to my selfish drinking. My relationships with my family and partner are also getting much better.

The biggest change is how I've been handling bad things. When something bad happens, I rarely even think about drinking. My first thought now is to reach out to a sober person or do a meeting. I can pray and meditate on things. I can let myself feel emotion rather than wanting to numb it. I feel proud of myself when, after about an hour, I feel better and I didn't drink or use to get there. I still have stress and anxiety and fear, but I'm learning how to deal with it.

Sorry this ended up being long. Things can still be hard, but they are INFINITELY better than when I was drinking. I am grateful, for the first time in my life, of the things I have and the achievements I've made in these 81 days.

Sobriety is amazingly possible. If you're early days, you got this. I was there, it's scary, but it will get better. I never thought I'd stop drinking, and here I am!

I was on a date with a guy, we met for coffee first and then went to a bar and I had about 5 drinks. For some reason it has been much easier for me to abstain from alcohol when going out with groups of drinking friends than when it's a one on one date type thing. I have been trying to date people who dont drink which works great, when they actually dont, and we do other fun stuff. I think one mistake last night was when he asked do I drink i said not really, I'm not much of a drinker, rather than a hard no. So when he took me to the bar (which is really old so has tourist value other than just drinking) I ordered a glass of wine, intending to nurse it for the whole time we were there... well needless to say that didnt happen, although there was actually a bit of peer pressure involved from his part, I managed to make it last about an hour and a half but then I caved. 
I'm not feeling to great about myself at all now and dont really want to reset all my days 😭 should I reset them? Will that make me try harder when it comes to this point again?? 
Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with these situations in the future?
The thing is I actually liked this guy but because of his drinking I dont think it would be a great idea to see him again... although that's not quite how we left it last night. Another question actually, when he messages to meet up again, should I be honest and say I dont think it's a good idea because of the drinking or meet him and say I'm not drinking anymore or not meet him at all?
I feel like I was doing so well and this has thrown me a bit... I need more tools to deal with all the situations I will be in... sometimes I can be a bit of a people pleaser and can find it difficult to say no especially when I hadn't actually told the guy well I dont drink cus im an alcoholic, maybe I should start telling people this straight up when drinking comes up? Or maybe just saying I dont drink at all instead of 'not really' is enough...

I don't post on here probably as much as I should do, but I thought I'd talk about this today. I was getting changed after my gym workout this morning and I heard 2 guys talking about a friend of theirs who was still on lockdown and had managed to gain some weight during that time. Conversation went like this:

&nbsp; 


""Have you spoke to John at all this week?""

""Nah he's still on lockdown, just spending his time drinking all day.""

""Well he said it's only 3 cans or so a day so I guess it's not that bad.""

""Yeah, it's not like he's some kind of alchy down the park! Haha""

&nbsp; 

It's crazy how we a lot of people would brush this off as just having a few beers after work or something, I didn't say anything as it wasn't my place to do so but I just saw so much of how we as a country don't really think much of drinking multiple beers everyday!

Speaking of UK alcoholism my housemate has been in hospital for about 2 weeks now and it's pretty much guaranteed he's going to die. He's been pickling himself for years, I tried to give him support and advice on how to cut down/stop but he ignored it and now his daughter had to come pick up his clothes and take them up to the hospital.

And I’m feeling GOOD! 

There’s been a shift in my mentality I’ve noticed. I vividly remember looking down on people who didn’t drink. I thought their lives must be so boring. Now I look at drinkers, or look back at past self, and can’t help but think how boring it actually is. I drank alone on a couch every night. I did take the occasional trip or whatever, but the main event of all of those things was getting drunk. I really didn’t experience anything. Stay home, get drunk. Go out, get drunk. What a boring repetitive cycle. Not to mention I would avoid doing activities that didn’t go hand in hand with drinking. 

Now, when my coworkers and I discuss what we did over the weekend, and they mention how hammered they got, I’m not jealous. I get the odd craving. But I don’t want their life, or my old life. I’m happy with mine.

I started on the fifth of July. Nothing crazy happened that night, but for a long time coming I’ve known I needed to stop drinking. Last year, I went 16 days before deciding I could moderate and everything would be fine. It didn’t work. While overall I was drinking less days, I would binge on the days I did drink. Leading to blackouts, arguments, guilt, shame, regret, disappointment, depression, self loath…. This list can go on.

I stopped drinking  a few days before I started The 30 Day Alcohol Experiment by Annie Grace. I knew if I had a goal it would be easier for me. I was not expecting what a difference 30 some odd days would make. To commemorate my personal milestone, I wanted to write out all the changes and accomplishments I’ve experienced in the last month.

**Health**

* I’ve met my five mile distance goal every day but five days. Three of those days followed the fifth, I am always unmotivated after drinking. One day I was sick and another day was rainy. For the month of July I had a total of 174 miles compared to 136 miles in June and 137 in May.
* Overall, I am eating healthier (except a week on vacation). I am not eating junk food late at night or craving empty carbs the following days after drinking.
* It has been easier for me to stick to my intermittent fasting schedule. I no longer have to get my drinks in before a certain time and then inevitably go over my window before saying, “screw it”
* I wake up with energy (most days) and am more motivated to get and stay moving throughout the day.
* I’ve lost about 6 pounds in the last month alone. The weight began coming off much easier.
* My self loathing has lessened, by a lot. I still hear that negative voice occasionally, but it is so much easier to silence it now and not give it any power. With that, I don’t feel as depressed as I have over the past year. I knew alcohol was a downer. I just never correlated how much it affected my day to day mood.
* My nails are shiny.

**Appointments**

I did not realize one could schedule and fit so many various appointments into one month. When I was drinking, I would put off making appointments until they became dire (aka never). I don’t currently have insurance so the thought of paying out of pocket was daunting and not an expense I could afford.

* I set up a dentist appointment which led to three more visits… Gum disease is not easy to rid in one visit.
* Set up an eye appointment
* Went to the Secretary of State to get my learners permit (yeah… I am almost 30, but I have always lived places where I could hop on some sort of transportation)
* Not really an appointment but set up a camping trip.

**Friends and Family**

* I have kept Facetime chats with my friends. Before, I most likely would’ve blown them off because I wouldn’t be in the mood because I would most likely be too consumed with my self loathing.
* Mailed out postcards to my nieces and nephews while I was on vacation. Hell, I even got a package sent out to them as well and I didn’t sit on it for months before sending it.
* My relationship with my partner is improving once again.
* I was able to open up to my sister about giving up alcohol for thirty days. There is an age gap there and I left the state as she was getting older so we have never really bonded before.
* My mom has begun reading this Naked Mind and is beginning her own journey with evaluating her relationship with alcohol.

**Odds and Ends**

* Picked up reading again. I read three books and finished two audio books.
* I’ve been practicing wood burning again
* Made it on a 12 day family vacation without drinking.

**Books**

I forgot how much I loved to read. Reading became a thing of the past when I started to work longer hours and drink when I was off of work. This month, I have finished: The Sober Diaries, The 30 Day Alcohol Experiment, The Joy of Being Sober (audio), and We Are the Luckiest (audio). I’ve started but haven’t finished American Psycho, a book on infamous murders in my state, This Naked Mind, and Recovery: Freedom From Our Addictions.

This pas month has been the best month for me in a long time. The only thing that changed was I stopped drinking. I am still not ready to say that I will give up drinking forever, but I have set a new goal of 100 days and I will go from there.

Thank you Stop Drinking for being here for me this last month!

When I first started on this journey, one of my biggest worries (if not THE biggest worry) was not being able to hang around with my heavily-drinking, drug-taking friends anymore, and that eventually we would drift apart from each other. I am now a little surprised that not only there is no sign of this happening, on the contrary all of my friends have been really supportive of my decision.

But the most surprising thing of all for me: some of my friends have come to me, asking for advice to help them giving up alcohol themselves!

I believe that my previous persona of the crazy alcoholic is in such in stark contrast with my sober self, that anyone who knows me and sees me now just thinks ""if he has managed to hold up this long, then surely I will be able to"" (I know it hasn't been that long but it surely is a huge milestone for me and it looks like it for people around me).

I just wanted to put this out there for anyone that might have the same worry I had in the beginning: if you are part of a self-destructive alcoholic group, think about it as YOU being the change that will initiate a domino effect and better your friends lifes.

I was a heavy drinker, daily, for 20 years straight. Couple of beers and two bottles of wine a night. I used alcohol to hide my depression and anxiety. Tried to quit once or twice, but never lasted more than a month. 

Decided I'd had enough late last year and threw the last of the wine away on December 29. It was a rough few days, but nothing too extreme - headaches, super anxiety and a craving or two, but it eased. 

I don't have any family or any friends (my drinking drove them all away) so had to do it by myself. I live in a small country town, so AA and the like wasn't an option.

But I made it here. I'm still too scared to go to the doctor, fearing what they might find after two decades of abuse. But I still going.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn't:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

US—Night/Early Morning

Europe—Morning

Asia and Australia—Evening/Night

Happy Thursday, sobernauts.

 Does anybody else really geek out on advice columns? I've found them such interesting entertaining resources - especially Ask Sugar, Captain Awkward, and Ask Polly. And sometimes I catch myself treating them as my unofficial parents, too. 

A quote from a recent column that I'm writing out and hanging up as a reminder to myself. 

""It's crucial right now to ACTIVELY REMIND YOURSELF not to indulge dark thoughts or take on all of the world's problems and make them your personal responsibility every morning. You've got to be practical. Write down a plan. Resist the urge to spiral and obsess.""

I particularly struggle with taking on all of the world's problems. So here's one way I will be practical and care for myself today: no drinking! Freedom from alcohol is lovely and the loveliness grows exponentially.

Love

>[Our mind is like a blue sky. Clouds come and go. We tend to get caught up in the clouds and forget about the blue sky. -- Andy Puddicombe, Headspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0WYFXxhPGY)

It’s thunderstorm season here. Most afternoons dark clouds boil up and rain or hail pounds down. The storm may break in the late evening for a colorful sunset. Or the thunder may keep flashing well after dark. Skies will be clear and deep blue by the following morning.

Emotions were overwhelming when I first stopped drinking. Everything felt so intense, but it was anger that I struggled with the most.The slightest thing could set me off in an explosion. It was scary for people around me. It was scary for me--I felt so out of control.

One of the first things I learned from SD was the idea of emotions as clouds. They come and go. Some can be violent and destructive. Some weather patterns persist for weeks. But the nature of weather is to change; eventually to pass. The blue sky is always there. That image was extremely appropriate for my anger and other emotions. It was a lesson that stuck with me. It was my introduction to mindfulness, and primed me for trying meditation when other sobernauts said it helped them. Later I encountered the idea in Headspace, where today’s quote and animation are from.

I watched today’s thunderstorm and thought back to that imagery. I am extremely grateful for the skills that I learned from SD. I am extremely grateful for the skills I continue to learn.

I’ve seen it for what it was for a while now. 10 years of being a binge drinking followed by allowing myself to get comfortable drinking 1.5-2 bottles of wine a day, while on my own in lockdown, couldn’t really be more blatant.

I’ve had days where I was too hungover to drink, days where I drank to “not be hungover”, two weeks off, a couple days bordering 3 bottles. All over the board. 

But as I’m nearing my 24 hours for my first day toward  a goal of long-term sobriety, I am finding solace in the support I’m receiving from the family and friends I’ve told in my most serious outreach to-date (including with those who responded to my reach out post a few hours ago). I think this community will be my saving grace as I push through.

I am surrounded by family and friends who are all drinkers and I have felt uncomfortable having been the only one to admit my problem in the past. I’ve talked my my mom a couple times in the years (weakly) telling her how I think I have a problem and she’s always been supportive. But when I allowed
myself to drink again, making excuses as to how I overreacted because I’d been panicky during a hangover, and I’d feel guilty to having my parents looking at me like I was doing something wrong when I would drink in front of them again. It’s probably because I was doing something wrong.

I was happy when I finally told my best friend I have a problem and I seriously need to stop. And her words will stick with me, “We all have a problem, but you’re the one actually doing something about it.” 

I think that one line alone will make me feel less ashamed and more proud when I’m in family or friend situations, turning down drinks. I know my family and my friends over-drink, and I know I will be frustrated that I might be viewed as the only person with the problem and won’t be drinking (because I’m the one who’s actually admitted it), but I will also know I’m the person who’s doing something about mine. 

Here’s to my goal of long-term sobriety, Day 1.
I look forward to progressing with everyone’s support.

2020-08-05 19:48:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i4gqye/first_post_after_a_long_time_lurking/,First post after a long time lurking,"TL;DR: I am new and don't eat a lot of burgers. 

I have been a longtime lurker (a couple of years) and am 2.5 weeks into sobriety; was a heavy daily drinker.  I love reading people's stories here - because they are so incredibly relatable and inspiring - so I figured it's my turn to give back and tell mine.  I'm a successful corporate executive and mother of two school-aged kids who has somehow managed to continue to do all the things and do them well, while maintaining my secret shameful alcohol habit, and I am exhausted.  Something just had to give.  

I didn't really start drinking in earnest until my mid to late 20's. I was in a bad marriage, and discovered that with enough alcohol, 1. I could wipe my brain clean and not think about how terrible our relationship was and 2. I could fall asleep by 8pm and avoid a lot of contact with him. Despite that, I was highly functional, would get up at 5am every day to work out or run, and continued to grow my career. 
 
Eventually, my then husband and I divorced, and I wiped the slate clean - I  moved to a new city and got a new job.  I easily stopped drinking heavily (I was happy now, after all) and went to a single glass of red each night with dinner.  Met a new guy, got married and had a baby.  My marriage hit a big rough patch due to disagreements on parenting.  I started drinking more, but still not a concerning amount.  Got pregnant with #2, and when she was born, she was even worse than my first.  She would cry until she was purple in the face - all day and all night.  My husband is not a ""natural"", my kids wanted nothing to do with him as little ones, and his stress spilled over onto me on top of our other issues as I felt responsible for fostering a better relationship between dad and kids.  After #2, I started drinking nightly, a couple of glasses of wine or beer, still nothing major.  But it creeps up, right? My work was stressful (still overachieving and moving up at a rapid pace), and my (still very challenging) kids took every waking second of my time not at the office, and my husband was a stressball who didn't handle the noise and chaos of young kids well (still doesn't), so there was a high degree of tension at home.  

Alcohol was the only ""self-care"" I got - I could decompress from work and turn off my always firing brain, while still ""taking care of"" my kids (even if deep down I knew I wasn't fully present while drinking) and avoid my husband's stress stressing me out more.  The ultimate multi-tasking, right?  Even now, as I type this, I am walking on a treadmill and watching a TV show at the same time. If you can't create more hours in the day, just do lots of things at once!  I don't know how to turn off.  Alcohol helped me do that. 

My kids are now 9 and 7.  Over the past 7 years, my drinking has very slowly crept up.  In the past couple of years, I have repeatedly questioned whether I might have a problem.  I've also had the occasional embarrassing ""one too many, say too much"" moments, blackouts, and lots of 3am panic wakeups full of anxiety, self-hate, and false promises to cut back. Despite that, I couldn't imagine giving it up. During the pandemic, I finally got to the point where a bottle of wine plus a cocktail or two each night was the norm.  Then on weekends, I would day drink because its not like i can go anywhere and, hey, I earned it, right? So weekends would be at least double what weekdays would be.  

A few weeks ago, the strangest thing happened to me.  After a particularly indulgent long weekend, I woke up with an actual hangover (rare for me), and, for the millionth time, told myself that I needed to stop.  But somehow this time, I actually internalized the fact that my drinking was far more about chasing a buzz than actually having one, and that it just wasn't doing it for me anymore.  I wasn't even really enjoying it.  It was to serve the purpose of escaping, and it wasn't even doing that well enough anymore.  So I just stopped and more than that, I stopped wanting it, which is bizarre to me. So it's been 2.5 weeks, I had a few nights of sweating and restlessness but no other withdrawal.  I also read the book ""Drink"" (based on the recommendation of someone on this sub), which kind of solidified the point for me.  I'm terrified though- I'm scared that if I think about it too much, this magical shift will wear off and I will want it again.

This might sound stupid, but I keep telling myself that alcohol should be like a really good greasy burger - I crave one *maybe* once per year, if that, and I think the last time I actually gave into that craving was at least a few years ago (I am also pretty strict on my diet).

Finally had a serious conversation with her last week and explained how the cravings felt and how much they scared me and how even if I didn't tend to get really drunk it took way too much effort to hold back every single night. How I really need no alcohol in the house, how I don't even want to even have to *think* about alcohol anymore. She finally got it, and I'm relieved to have her on my side rather than offering me a beer with movie night.

This time around, I've equipped myself with tools to help aid my desire to retire from drinking. Part of it is daily journaling to help me reflect. 

Today's chapter was about tough love. Annie starts off the chapter saying people can find a reason to keep drinking `I would drink less if my life wasnt so stressful. Or if my husband hadn't left me, I wouldn't be drinking so much. Or if my kids were nicer to me ... Or maybe when my kids are out of the house` 


She continues the chapter hoping that the reader has learned to be mindful about their drinking habbit and to remember the reasons why they wanted to stop in the first place. She also reminds the reader not to punish themselves if they find themselves back where they started, but to take the lessons learned an begin to gain control again. 


I've really enjoyed reading this book. Annie does a great job of explaining the science behind drinking and what is happening chemically when I drink that first drink. She is nonjudgemental and understands that each of us have our own process we go through.


I have one chapter before I finish her 30 day experiment,  but since I am already past my initial 30 day goal I am extending it to 100 days. I like how I feel and I like the person I am becoming. I'm facing my concerns and racing mind and not dulling them with alcohol.

(Sorry it’s a bit long)

I’ve struggled with alcohol for a while now. I’ve been drinking a lot since I was 21 (am 30 now). Working from home by myself has made it worse than it’s ever been (as in, I can drink a lot more in one sitting than I’ve ever used to, I can drink during the day without anyone seeing, and I can drink daily).
I have horrible anxiety and I am positive that drinking is the core cause of that. I can spend a full 24 hours fighting off panic attacks just because I feel hungover and think I’m dying.
I took a two week break a few weeks back and I felt so good for those two weeks. Then, I went on a small backpacking trip and told myself (have a little mountain whiskey). After that, I allowed myself to believe “well, you already drank so you can start drinking again now.”
It just continues to lead into the same ole’ ordeal where I drink too much, feeling guilty, feel sick, and feel panicked. I know my family and SO want me to stop. I know I want to stop.
I drank last night before a friend came over to hang out and woke up embarrassed that she could probably tell I was drunk. I’m sick of feeling guilty and regretful for a few hours of “fun”. And the embarrassment of last night was sort of the reason why today I am trying to put an end to my drinking again. 
I have told those closest to me so that they know I won’t be drinking and can support me.
I know once it hits 10pm tonight it will have been 24 hours since I’ve drank. I think that will be enough to push me to continue to pursue another day, and then another, and another. I bought stickers to mark the dates that I didn’t have a drink (as a visual encouragement to continue) and wrote myself a note of why I don’t like drinking and why I shouldn’t, for times I feel tempted. 
I also bought a lot of fancy tea to drink in the place of alcohol when I find myself having a craving (pinkies up)!
So, here’s to starting on my road to sobriety. I hope to continue to find some inspiration and encouragement from this thread. I’ve read many relatable stories and feel happy to see how well so many of you are doing now.",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9758715033531189}"

Diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, and from what I'm reading, the prognosis isn't great. 33m","[Original post here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/gx9wix/waiting_for_important_medical_testsresults/)

Hello all! So I'm a little late with this update, but better late than never!

The first thing I want to offer is a glimmer of hope to those reading this going through a similar situation. It truly is a stressful anxiety-ridden nightmare. But don't give up!

Long story short, I was a daily drinker (in excess) for the better part of a decade+. A ""functional alcoholic"" as I liked to fool myself. It culminated in a 2 month bender plopping me in the ER at the end of May with liver function test results through the roof. 

AST: 319 (standard range: 0-37)

ALT: 241 (standard range: 6-45)

Not good. What *is* good however, it fueled the fire to get me sober. And I have been for over 2 months now! 

About 4 weeks after my alarming blood work (with 1 month sobriety under my belt) I got another blood test and had a liver ultrasound done.

I was absolutely shocked and SO relieved to find my liver had returned to normal function. [Image of some results here](https://i.imgur.com/wv2ZIel.png). The liver ultrasound showed that my suspected alcoholic hepatitis had reduced to fatty liver disease, and by maintaining a sober lifestyle I could likely repair/reverse the damage I had caused.

So please let this be a lesson that alcohol will eventually catch up with you. And to others who may be awaiting medical results, or fearful of the damage they are doing/have caused, quitting drinking can do astonishing things.",134,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981282353401184}"

The guy that was in the darkest place he’s ever been in his life barely 14 months ago.  The guy that had been problem drinking for over 25 years.  Me.  I’m sober.  For a whole damn year!

In this year, I’ve gotten to better know the young adult that I once was.  I’m trying to genuinely make positive changes in my life.  I’ve lost 25 pounds!   My family has developed a genuine interest in outdoor activities, like hiking, going to the river,  and walking our dogs.  I’ve knocked a ton of stuff off the to do list.   I’m picking up hobbies and interests again that aren’t centered around beer.  My days are no longer shortened by alcohol.  My hang-xiety is gone.  I can keep going, but I feel like I could fill an essay with the positive results I’ve experienced from not drinking.  

I wanted to thank this sub.  As long as I’ve been drinking, I’ve always known I’d probably have to quit.  I just didn’t want to face that.  The IWNDWYT slogan worked.   “Hey man, it’s just a day.  You got a day in you, right?”   I’d ask myself.  Then, I’d wake up the next day and visit SD and get inspired to stay sober the next day.  Even on my shittiest days, this place inspired me.  People encouraged me.   I can’t thank all of you enough.  

I honestly don’t know what my future holds.  Things look and feel pretty great, right now.  I’m about as happy as I can be, personally.  Even with the Rona trying it’s best to fuck with us.  I wanted to end my post with a short list of things I would never have said, 12 months ago:  I am happy today.  I am loved today.  I am a good dad today.  Im a good son today.

Long time lurker first time poster, alcohol has always been in my family and I ended up liking the feeling but following this sub and a bottle of tequila a week ago made me want to stop. I don’t think I’m ready to brave a badge yet but slowly getting there. :) 

Either way I just wanted to share a tip I came across yesterday when I felt that urge to drink, normally on weekdays I’ll drink beers but because I’ve been trying to cut back, I only had liquor and normally when I have liquor I have a hangover the next day, because 1 is never enough. As you guys know work and a hangover aren’t a good mix. 

What I used to do when I was younger was only drink up to 4 shots and immediately lay in bed so I’m prepped to sleep.

Now I wasn’t gonna do that because I needed to be at 100% the next day, so looking through my pantry I had a eureka moment when I found these tiny shot glasses that are, ironically, used to play a tic-tac-toe drinking game. What I ended up doing was taking 4 of those shots, which are only half a regular shot, so in essence I only took 2 shots but my brain and my body went to sleep feeling like I drank 4 shots.
I drank lots of water and today I’m still feeling great.

We worked together for a couple of years, and stayed in touch after that. My wife and I went to his housewarming. His wife and him came to the baby shower we had for our son. We were chatting last weekend, when I sent him a video of my son laughing (he's almost nine months old).

Feeling guilty about wanting to keep things casual but am committed to transparency, staying with the uncomfortable feelings, and not drinking.

&#x200B;

Having recently decided (for the second time in my life) to go without alcohol, and having ended several months back a relationship of two and a half years in large part because of the way binge cycles were affecting me emotionally, I have unsmartly started a thing with a neighbour who drinks (moderately, but consistently) as a way to cope with professional and emotional frustrations. This, and the fact that the new person seems to want more than I am able and willing to give, relationship-wise, is bringing up familiar feelings of guilt, remorse, and confusion. I am determined **not** to drink at these feelings but rather to let them teach me something about myself in relationship.

The good news is that the neighbour (we are both in our early 30s) and I have been communicating from the get-go about our wants and needs. After spending time together adventuring, it became clear that we were attracted to one another. We admitted that both of us have been missing affection and intimacy and agreed that we might be this for one another while maintaining our friendship. In retrospect, while it has been lovely so far, it seems deluded to believe that feelings wouldn't rapidly deepen and complications arise.

I should say that this person's drinking doesn't make me want to drink, and in fact it has clarified how even one drink can lead to personality changes if one is geared that way (which I am).  I would say seeing how they change after a drink even boosts my intention to live alcohol-free.

The other (rather foreseeable) complication is that I am suddenly again in contact with my ex, who I still love.  (The neighbour knows this, too.)  Even though I have been honest about where I am at, I feel callous and ready to blame myself if the neighbour shows signs of feeling hurt.

I'm fairly sure all of this would be meet the conditions to be considered patterns of co-dependency by any therapist who uses such frameworks. I know that these pattens are related to my history of drinking and the factors that undergird the desire to drink and escape. Hoping that this present sticky situation will ultimately shed some light on why it is I keep getting [knotted](http://www.oikos.org/knotsen1.htm) up.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.935206949710846}"

I thought it would be hard because I’ve always associated drinking with vacation, especially when looking out on the water after a day at the beach and also being around others who are drinking.

Vacation was awesome! Enjoyed early mornings with coffee overlooking the water. Had fun kayaking, walking and hanging on the beach during the day and then playing games with family and friends at night (socially distanced as much as possible). 

There was only one evening where I really wanted to cave and get a nice glass of Chardonnay to enjoy with a seafood dinner. Instead, I had some sparkling mineral water in a wine glass with a lime edge while my wife had her regular cocktail. Mine was very tasty and I felt rather fancy with the nice wine glass, so the craving faded pretty quickly. This was one of the best and most relaxing vacations I’ve had on a long time.

 I got sober in Phoenix, AZ back in 2016 and have experienced a lot of wonderful recovery out here but it's time for a change!

I got engaged last year to another addict in recovery but early in our engagement he relapsed in the middle of a move from Arizona to Georgia. He refused treatment and had no intentions of seeking sobriety again so we broke off the engagement and I moved back to Arizona.

The fellowship caught me when I was down on it and life has turned back around for the better. I don't plan on moving in the very near future but I think I would still really like to move to the south, excluding Georgia. My family is southern and I feel very drawn to the south.

My only hang up is that Arizona has such a solid recovery scene, especially for young people. And while I am willing to create the fellowship I desire wherever I end up, I do want to find somewhere that is somewhat comparable.

When you are not wasting mental and physical energy on drinking and being hungover, you can really focus it on areas of your life you want to improve. 

I am so much more present. When hungover I would obviously feel like crap physically but also it wrecked me mentally. I’d be anxiously focused on my physical symptoms, wondering if I’d done some damage to my liver, stomach, kidneys, etc. My mood would be low. I was unproductive or under par in a lot of aspects of my life due to this wasted time and energy. For what? So that I could feel entertained for a few hours at night while sitting and doing nothing!

First I just want to say this has been one of the most supportive communities I've ever seen, truly amazing. 

I'm a 28m who's been drinking since 17. Over the last year or two I've definitely hit a point where I've been drinking more than I want to, hangovers getting worse, etc. I always told myself I dont have a problem. I'm only drinking on weekends, I only do it with friends, I live in a big city where everyone drinks.

Blah blah blah, you all know the usual story. But if I'm being honest with myself, I definitely binged way too hard when I drank, would be several drinks ahead of my friends, would sneak an extra one or two before bed. Sure I have a nice job, good relationships with my friends and family, but drinking was definitely getting unhealthy for me, holding me back from my goals and ambitions, and I just plain wasnt enjoying it like I used to.

Anyways, I've been following everyones stories here for several months and it's so inspirational. I've seen myself in many of your posts and I've been planning to quit for months but I havent been able to, despite several attempts at ""moderation"" and straight up quitting.

But then 5 days ago i started reading the naked mind, and holy shit, what a book. I literally saw myself in her preface, talking about her 3am anxious wakeups. I know the feeling of not being able to sleep in, hungover, and anxious all too well. 

That book flipped my mindset upside down, in the 5 days I've been reading it (1 chapter left), I feel like I've honestly lost my urge to drink entirely. Its amazing  how she just changes your perspective on alcohol entirely.

Yesterday I went to a club/salsa party and today was my roommates birthday and we went on a big pub crawl. These are both normally events I wouldve drank for, but I honestly had no desire to, didnt drink a drop, and I had the most fun I've had out in a long time.

I’m sixty days in! Yay! Two months of not being a hungover mess fighting off withdrawal. But with the COVID soft-lockdown in the US and my state specifically, I just find myself having very little to occupy my time. My job is significantly fewer hours per day, and video games/TV/movies can only take up so much. Many people are finding outdoor stuff to do but I’m pretty much the opposite of outdoorsy (I genuinely don’t like nature settings and it’s hot out right now anyway) so I’m just dreadfully bored while also lacking the motivation to do anything. Just full-on anhedonia over here. Any advice would be appreciated. 

Now, the other one. I have been an anxiety patient on and off for my entire life. A huge part of that is sleep. I just don’t get sleepy because I think my brain and body just don’t wanna do it because of the anxiety. I hate being alone with my thoughts, and the bed is where that happens, plus I’m afraid of something bad happening while I’m asleep. So I used the booze for that as well. Now I’m going to sleep at 10am and “waking up” at 4 every day, and that’s only because I’m taking antihistamines to get drowsy. I’ve heard all the usual stuff: no screens, exercise, don’t do anything but sleep in the bedroom... they don’t work. Besides that, has anyone else had this issue and gotten through it? (And please don’t suggest smoking weed/CBD, that’s not helpful for me.)

I see a lot of advice that you need to replace your trigger times (mine are generally dinner-ish time) with something else - go for a walk, take a bath, etc. My excuse is that I have small kiddos and so leaving the house or leaving them alone is often not a possibility. Any suggestions on activities that I can do while I still supervise the kids?

I think I use alcohol to calm my brain and anxiety. Which I know alcohol just adds to the anxiety - of course when I'm hungover I don't exercise, or clean the house, or eat well. And then I'm anxious about it. I am in therapy and I am on medication. I just can't seem to relax when I have something on my to-do list.

All while reassuring my beautiful new wife that this would not happen. She caught me yesterday and it’s not good.

———

My now wife knew I had a problem with drinking. I’ve always been an “all or nothing” guy. I wouldn’t drink every day, but i would get blackout drunk when I would drink. I made the decision to get and stay sober on December 9 last year, right before the pandemic started to take off. It was definitely a challenge. I went to therapy, checked out some AA meetings, but mainly stayed on SD and I lived a wonderful, sober, happy, fulfilling life. On the 223rd day, the day of my wedding, I informed my new wife that I would have only a few beers. This was against the advice of my therapist as well.

So I did. I knew as soon as I took that first swing of IPA, that I would want to keep drinking. By the end of the night, I had drank 5 beers. I was sober by the end of the night as I had spaced them out. I had already lied to my newlywed wife and told her I only had 3.

The next day we had friends over for floating. God damn I wanted a beer. So I asked my wife, “hey babe, I did fine (almost) yesterday, so maybe I could have a few beers today?” She made me promise her that this wouldn’t turn into a “problem” when we got home. With my hands on a cold one, of course I promised her it wouldn’t. The day went on and I had a few too many, but was still alright by night.

We returned home, and the nights before we left for our honeymoon to Tahiti I think I drank.

After arriving in Tahiti, every day we were there we drank. She would ask me if I was alright drinking, and if this would escalate when I went back home. All during this time I made promises. These were all promises I intended to keep. I told her that I promised I would no longer drink when we went home. We had an amazing honeymoon and I had all the drinks I was never able to try previously. But the whole time I knew that I was enjoying the drinks too much. I would begin to look forward to them. By the time we left, we had finished all the alcohol we brought with us (mainly me), on top of all of our purchased and gifted drinks.

We came home and I stopped drinking... but only in front of her. We’ve been back about 4 days, and every night since I’ve just been downing hard liquor. Breaking all the promises I had made while we were having a good time. I never lied or broke promises to hurt my wife, I lied and broke promises so that I could continue to drink. 

Yesterday she caught me. And it was not good. There were talks of going back to my therapist, talks of annulling our marriage, her informing me that my first ever promise as a husband was broken, because I promised her that I would go to her if I was having issues with drinking. But I was selfish. I wasn’t “having issues”, I was just “wanting to drink”. The funny thing too is that these days since we’ve been back, I’ve been looking forward to stopping, and I was doing all the necessary sneaking and hiding bullshit so that I could officially “stop”. But she caught me. As fucked up as all of this is, I’m actually thankful. Because I was caught, I’m so deeply filled with regret and shame, that it’s more fuel for my sobriety. It solidifies my decision to truly be sober. I don’t want to break promises or lie. I want to be a great, sober husband. Sober-me never breaks promises or lies, but alcoholic-me does to continue to drink.

We already have this tarnish on our new, beautiful marriage, because of my actions. “Just a couple beers” for me on that beautiful day, turned into “slamming whiskey into the night” within a couple of weeks. I’m typing this as my wife sleeps, awaiting whatever consequences may come tomorrow. But regardless of what happens, I will not drink. That’s what got me here in the first place.

So, since I was about 17, I’ve been what most people, in our beer obsessed culture might call “a moderate social drinker who occasionally goes over the line”. I feel like in our society, it’s only socially acceptable to quit drinking if you have a serious problem, like drinking every single day for years on end. 

My problem with alcohol might not be as serious as many of yours, and I’m grateful that my journey into sobriety will be easier than many of yours. 

I’m 28 now and while most of my drinking has been confined to the weekend for the past decade. I feel it’s getting worse. 

When the lockdown started here in the UK for covid-19, I was furloughed from work, and obeying the stay at home order. That’s when it really started. I don’t know why, but I started hitting the vodka big time. Almost every night, and starting earlier and earlier as one evening rolled into the next. 

It felt at first like I was just relaxing while I was not at work. Summer was blooming, the air was warm, who doesn’t like a drink when the weather is that fine? It especially seemed like no big deal since I was still lifting weights nearly every day, and running seven miles every other day, regardless of how much I’d had the night before. 

After one particularly severe hangover I said,  “no more”. My intake was increasing and the mornings where getting worse. So I decided to take a few weeks off to reset my tolerance. No desire to quit at this point. 

That lasted maybe a week and a half or two weeks, and I went right back into the old habit. It was having to go back to work I think that saved me from a deeper abyss. 

Now I’m off work again and the drinking has leaked out of the weekend and become a near everyday affair again. I’ve missed piano lessons and rock climbing sessions due to being hungover. It’s making me miserable. The last straw was deeply hurting a close friend, when I said something horrible that I have no memory of. That was last Friday, Saturday was painful, writhing in guilt, anxiety and self deprecation. So I again said “no more, enough”. Then sunday came and I told myself, “surely I can have one or two, I don’t have to get drunk”. We all know how that goes. Monday was another day spent lying in regret. 
 
It’s Wednesday now so it’s two full days without a drink. I’m worried that I’ll be constantly told I’m a spoil-sport or a bore for not wanting to drink anymore. I’m physically in good condition, I exercise, and I think people will think I’m over reacting, because I don’t fit their view of what an alcoholic looks like. My house is clean most of the time, and I get to work on time. But it’s killing my spirit. It takes me away from my hobbies, and it’s turning me into a nasty person. Anyway I just found this sub and to everyone who is on the path, whether it’s day 1 for the thousandth time or day 1000 from the start, keep it up. Never lose hope.

And then I decided to sort of celebrate with a shandy (beer and lemonade) cause I was at a bar with a bunch of riding friends/folks, and I didn’t necessarily want it, but I felt weird if I asked for a pop or a water. Sort of embarrassed.

So I had it, and I didn’t suddenly turn into a full blown alcohol infused drunken fool. It took awhile. 

Sort of like a frog put into a pan of cold water and then the heat is turned on. (Is that even true? Someone check snopes). I was careful and would drink once a week, just beer. Then somehow it became 26oz of rum and a case of beer and maybe a couple of bottles of wine a week. Funny how that creeps up. 

So on this July 5th 2020, I woke up sick and tired and quit again, and it’s 30 some days I’ve been dry now. 44 years old now but at least I lost 8lbs and my BP is 130/85, shit man it takes longer to bounce back nowadays. Still bad sleeplessness but hopefully that gets in order. I’m enjoying clawing my way back.

Already had my dad try and gift me a 40oz bottle  of rum, “no thank you” Had to tell my best buddy “nope” to an-offered beer and just gave my cousin a near beer from my fridge “sorry, all I got” So I got some sober firsts out of the way.

And it actually hasn’t been that hard. The associated habitual shit is more the annoying thing, so I’m just going at that head on. I’ve even been in the booze store a few times because that’s actually where the good non-alc selection is and my wife likes a bottle of malbec once a week even though she often doesn’t even finish it and the last glass becomes vinegar. 

I’ve also decided that I owe no one an explanation why I quit. Why the hell do people think they should have the right to inquire? “Because I like not drinking alcohol” good enough.

But I did feel like buying a good bottle of tequila today, but only for a minute, “hey, why not celebrate your not drinking , with a DRINK!” I’m going camping with riding buddies, and that’s what we do.

Anyhow I fast forwarded the tape 4 years into the unknown future, and I’m really looking forward to being the myself who didn’t have that tequila . I’ve got my fake IPA’s and Heineken zeros all packed.

I just can't stop thinking about it. It's the mental addiction with which I struggle. I buy more than my wife knows about, hide consumption to avoid ""judgement"". Addiction is hard and deceiving...

I have a compulsion to have at least one drink a day. Things change but generally 1-6 drinks a day, starting about 3 or 5pm daily. Almost medicinal at this point. 

I am not on day one- and mentally I know I am some distance from getting to a week off the wagon. 

The problem is compounded externally: 

* Coronavirus and me being in the US
* I have two kids, age 2 and 7
* I am slightly introverted, hence after hours with kids (sober or not) I begin to feel socially drained and frustrated after a long day. Alcohol is a default outlet. 

Bodyweight, sex, intimacy, etc: these things are fine as-is for me. I am satisfied with appearance and fitness, etc. My confession is that alcohol is always on my mind.

That was delusional!

I am 47 and have spent most of my adult life either stoned or drunk. I am a functional alcoholic who is good at his job, but bad at relationships, either with my partners or friends and family. My depression causes me to withdraw and abuse alcohol so I don’t have to think about or deal with all the problems I have created. This has held me back from achieving my goals and led to my wife leaving me after 10 years. I tend to close up and wallow in self pity and negative thoughts and emotions. 

All of this started to change a year ago when I met the woman of my dreams. Ironically, she is a therapist. I realized that I truly and honestly wanted to change the course of my life. Over the course of a year I reduced the times I was getting high and drinking and started going to Therapy. I had some slip ups but nothing drastic. 

Last weekend, on our one year anniversary, I decided we should go to a friend’s birthday party. I knew there was going to be alcohol and cocaine being consumed there but thought I had it under control. I actually believed that I was just going to drink moderately and have a line or two just to boost my spirits. During the fourth week of being completely sober I started to feel slightly grey, not depressed, just a little dull. I was afraid! How could I be feeling this way if the trajectory my life was taking was so positive? I believe that’s why I decided to resort back to my old ways for one evening.

I had a few glasses of wine, felt too drunk, and decided a line of coke would get me back up. It did, but I neglected my girlfriend for most of the evening and I started to consume more. At one point I blacked out and my girlfriend told me what I did. That evening I continued to neglect her, and even suggested to her we have a three way with some girl from the party! This concept and me acting this way seems so foreign to me. 
I am a sensitive and compassionate person, even a bit shy.

My girlfriend was heartbroken and started flirting with some guy just to compensate for her sadness. I didn’t even realize she left the party. When I did, I rushed to her house and tried to talk to her. She screamed at me and threw me out. Two days later I bought the most beautiful bouquet I could find ,waited for her to come home from work, and we talked. She told me that she needed some distance to listen to her heart and if a relationship with me was going to do her more harm than good.

We love each other very much, and other than this slip up, and a few minor incidents, we always have a great time together. We make future plans and dream of growing old together. But she is afraid that I can’t change, even though it is her job to help people do just that. But I have changed so much! I am getting better all the time and have even begun to embrace my new clarity. Normally, I would have started drinking and getting high again just to dull the pain, but that is the furthest thing from my mind right now. I hope a breakup isn’t the final lesson I need to learn to strengthen my sobriety. 

It’s early in the morning where I am at and can’t sleep anymore. I woke up thinking of her and cried. I am going to go to her car and leave a flower on her windshield so that she sees it before she goes to work. I am going to fight for our relationship and am going to stay sober.

It was difficult at first, re-learning how to be bored without a beer was a challenge but I filled it with all that inspirational shit people say they want to do but never ""have time for"" like reading and exercise. Well let me tell you I sure has had hell had time a year ago, and still do now!

I don't want t make it seem like it was all sunshine and rainbows, but it was a necessary stepping stone, a catalyst, in a year of change. I quit smoking cigarettes, took up running and lost 50 pounds, spoke with a doctor about the depression I was drowning in drink, and I've begun the application process t attend graduate school. When I was still drinking and lurking, I'd read posts like this and marvel at how someone could change their life for the better all by taking that first step and commit to quitting. 

I didn't do AA or anything like that, just lurked here and became a devout fan of Sarah Hepola and her musings. Something else might work for you, but just thought I'd share.

She still hasn't drank since December 25th 2016. But, she's always had problems with pills too, I guess. As well as an eating disorder which segues into a disorder with working out too much.

Most recently she had a 20-day stay at a house to treat the eating disorder. She got out around two months ago,  and now has completely relapsed with the eating disorder. She supposed to eat ""X"" number of calories and she's only supposed to exercise 2 days a week, moderately, not high intensity or running. Between morning runs and afternoon workouts, she's already worked out eight times in August.

Like I said, she also told me she she relapsed on pills. She had been prescribed Naltrexone to help her with the alcohol and opioid addiction. This past week she has been crushing The Naltrexone along with Xanax and a couple other things and snorting them. She's just crumbling.

At 50 years old and 5'7"" she was a relatively healthy 125 pounds and was supposed to put on approx 8 more pounds. I think she's getting close to 105.

She's pushing her husband and three kids away because they won't let her ""look better"".

26 year old single male here. I have been drinking almost every friday and saturday for the last few years. I never have the urge to drink alone or on weekdays and i always drink with friends to party or socialize. On the weekdays i live pretty healthy. I am exercising 6 times a week, eating healthy and work a full time job.

In general i have a real hard time to just sit still and relax. I feel like i have to be stimulated in one way or another all the time and it really bothers me! It feels like i have to cram activities, hobbies, exercise and ""meaningful"" things into my day to not have that bad feeling creeping in on me. On the weekdays this is easier since i work a full time job. But even if i do a bunch of activities on the weekends i still feel the urge to go out drinking. If i force myself not to go out partying and drinking a weekend i end with this meaningless feeling. I have thought about getting into some new hobbie like hunting that is time consuming but it feels like i would just end up going out partying at the end of the day when the hunt is over. 

I have also noticed that when i drink. The alcohol doesnt hit me like it used to before. I dont get as happy when im drunk as i used to.

Maybe the drinking and partying isnt the problem. But maybe more a lack of meaning in everyday life and life in general.

I was extremely emotional, in tears and really unsure as to whether I actually wanted to do this, or just give up and pretend I wasn't suffering.

&#x200B;

Day 1 was 2 August, and by the end of that day, I was in hospital. I had an active esophageal bleed and was puking blood. Went to A&E, got admitted and had surgery that night. I had the 'large' active bleed banded, as well as 6 others that were close to going. I could have died from either sepsis or blood loss if I hadn't have gone in then.

&#x200B;

This is a result of drinking too much, vomiting too much and generally not looking after myself. I already knew I had an enlarged liver (which puts pressure on these veins), but had conned myself in to thinking I could manage 'a bit' of booze and be ok. I'd already done 30 AF and cut down my drinking significantly, but it had ramped up again in the last few weeks, and I was back to morning drinking.  


I've spent 2.5 days in hospital, hooked up to all number of tubes to try and get my blood levels stable (low hemoglobin, anemic, low potassium, high LFT numbers) and help me recover from having a number of tubes stuck down my throat. I've had x-rays, 4 hourly blood tests, a CT scan and an ultrasound, and thankfully, there is no scarring on my liver, but it is enlarged. I'm so thankful for this, as that can be fixed by actually looking after myself and not drinking.   


But today is a new day, and mornings are my worst time. I wake up to a quiet house and my mind just starts whirling, and my immediate thought is ""I'll have a drink to calm myself before I get on with my day"". But I can't do that anymore, I would be just killing myself. Literally.  


I'm beginning to create a new morning routine so I can start the day positively - cup of tea (mi chai today) on the balcony overlooking the water, plan out my day, don't get on social media early and keep myself focused and productive. I'm going to add in meditation or something like that as well.  


I'm feeling positive right now, so long may it continue.  


Does anyone else have a good morning routine?

2020-08-04 18:01:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i3stsr/a_success_and_then_a_stumble/,A Success And Then A Stumble,"Well, back to day one. Again! I’m stuck in this terrible sober for three, maybe four, days and then I’m back out. Those days are awesome! I honestly don’t know why I keep making excuses to drink. It’s like a switch flips in my mind and I’m just on this mindless course to find beer and drink a lot of it, even if I intellectually really don’t want to. It’s kind of a scary autopilot. Once the “decision” is made, nothing seems to stop me. 

I’ve tried the wait twenty minutes thing. Usually it’s a thought that happens hours before I drink. A bit of a debate at the beginning. Then it becomes a given later on. Seems like it’s failing me. I’ve tried getting out and doing something when it feels like I’m going to just go drink. Doesn’t seem to work. I just now have a reason a deserve a “reward.” I even tried running errands and waiting for a reply from work about a potential gig, and when those were done and I didn’t have any work, well, of course I bought beer to drink! It’s extremely frustrating. 

I wish it was more of a discussion. But, ironically, once this all kicks in, literally calling someone to have a discussion seems off the table. Don’t get it. I know trying to rationalize addiction is pointless but, I wish I could wrap my mind around it a bit more. 

I’ve really fucked up my employment lately so I’ve decided to not drink on work nights. We’ll see how long that lasts. It hasn’t been perfect so far. Now I’m working more, which means more sober nights right? But also more stress and being tired, which are huge triggers for me. And then when it’s a “weekend” night I just go all out because I don’t have anything to do tomorrow. I mean, I do, but nothing set in stone. So that plan kind of gets thrown out the window. 

Hungry and tired are two huge triggers. I KNOW this. I’ve struggled with disordered eating all my life and it feeds (ha) into it. I’m someone who fasts most of the day and then eats a big meal early afternoon and/or at night. So after work I’m hungry and tired. And I like to abuse myself and ignore it, which usually leads me to drinking. I try and stave off hunger, usually works for a while of the drinking time. But then that leads to a food binge. 

Then I sleep shit. I was so sweaty last night. Ick. Don’t get real rest. Wake up multiple times a night. Bargain with the clock as to when I have to wake up/how little time can I leave myself to actually get ready. Usually need a pick me up shower in the morn too. That is if I even get out of bed. If I didn’t have a social engagement I couldn’t blow off this AM I’d prob still be in bed wallowing. Feel just off and weird all day. My depression is high, as is my anxiety. Usually lasts a couple of days too. The worst.

Why do I keep doing this to myself?? I have so much more to give. So much life to live. And I’m pissing it away. For what? I don’t even know why I drink anymore. It was because of trauma and pain. I still suck at emotions and booze kind of helps. I mean, not really, but in a twisted sense. 

I actually prefer sitting down and treating myself to some good food and a nonalcoholic drink. I just keep flashing back to my college days where we’d go to this almost all you can eat Mexican place and I’d down diet Pepsis and just love life. I miss that joy of life. I see all these happy kids running around yelling and playing and I just wish I could have that joyful, playful nature back. I treated myself to a delicious burger and fries and a shake the other night and it was so much better than a beer! 

I know all this. I see all this. I think I may be getting closer. And then I just falter. And really want to say fuck it all and drink some more. Sigh. But IWNDWYT.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9978306889533997}"

Wtf is wrong with me?!,"I'm living with a heavy drinker (my husband), who is also suffering from severe depression and he's recently become extremely paranoid and somewhat delusional. It's been awful. I woke up this morning after only 4 hours of sleep with a headache, and my toddler was up and cranky as hell 2 hours later. I've made it through the day, and I'm about to head into the grocery store. On the way, I found myself thinking, maybe it would be okay to pick up a 6-pack of some fancy craft beer and just have 1 or 2. I imagined myself playing video games and straight chilling with a beer... Wtf?! I literally watched my husband become a different person because of alcohol a few nights ago and it it was terrifying. How can I even consider drinking again?

Of course, I KNOW I don't need the goddamn beer to relax and it's only going to make me feel like absolute shit when I inevitably wake up at 3am, bloated, sweaty, and anxious after having finished the whole fucking 6 pack and passing out. I quit drinking for a reason and this is it! When I start drinking, I don't stop and although I often turned to alcohol when I was stressed, it never solved anything.

1. Every day you start drinking at 8pm so by 11pm you get to how drunk you want to be.  So you make sure you have enough alcohol or have to get to the store before it closes on the way home while your family waits in the car.  You then ignore your family so you can drink fast enough (while trying to hide how much) then the next morning you wake up miserable and you hate yourself all day.

2. When you get home at 8 you go swimming in your pool with your daughter with a La Croix sitting on the edge.  After it gets dark everyone gets cleaned up and you watch a movie over popcorn and junk food.  You wake up the next morning early because you slept so well and the whole day don't have to feel guilty because you drink.

I was at the beach with my gf and three friends enjoying a bonfire when about 100 feet from us we heard 10+ gunshots ring out. Someone had unloaded an entire clip and hit two young men who were standing there. We immediately sprinted over, my friend who I love like a brother, lead the way. Everyone was in shock so we did our best to provide medical assistance to the victims. One took shots to the chest and was essentially bleeding out. We pressed towels and shirts into the wounds and did our best to keep them awake while we waited for cops and medics to arrive and take them away. Seemed like forever. Both were taken to the hospital for surgery. Last I heard they both survived but were seriously fucked up. Suspected gang initiation, victims were unaffiliated. Literally could have been us who got shot.  

Went on a pretty hard bender that night and for the rest of the weekend. I was already drinking but the incident changed the vibe of why. It went from being fun, to drinking heavily to numb the experience. On top of all this I'm also feeling sketchy about contracting covid. We were socially distanced in a small group before the shooting but there were 20+ people at the scene and were in close contact with victims, witnesses, officers, and medics. Lots of blood and bodily of fluids.

Anyways I recognized that binging is not going to help and is a very poor coping mechanism. I'm feeling depressed and really fucking angry and I know drinking will only exacerbate that. So, I'm going to abstain for a while. The first few days are always tough. Today is day 2. If you made it this far in the post, thank you.

2020-08-04 15:49:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i3qdbh/103_days/,103 Days,"On Sunday I celebrated the big 100. This isn't my first time reaching 100 days, but it is a the first time my life has undergone legitimate change. Because the truth is, everything is different, and here I am at 103 days, officially my personal best! *woo* 

When I ""gave up"" or quit drinking in the past, I had every single intention to return. It was love at first sip for me. It's been a love affair that has taken many things from me and left me stripped, broken, and lost many times. Each time I went back, the consequences grew. It's progressive, as you all know. Drinking doesn't get better over time, it gets worse. 

This time, I knew in my heart and soul I needed to make the change for real. I needed to stop or I was going to lose my life.... So I committed myself fully and completely to being sober, and I've been rewarded tenfold. Don't get me wrong, this has been the hardest journey. I've lost more people than I've gained. I've been met with malice, hate, judgement, and an extreme lack of trust. Some of which I deserved, most I did not. It's blown up my relationship with my parents, both of which are alcoholics. It's brought forth a lot of stuff, that's for damn sure. I knew this time, everything had to be different.... And boy is it ever. 

But sobriety has also given me my life back. It's deepened my connections with people who ignite my soul, I have actual hobbies that bring me so much joy, and I've rediscovered my appreciation and love for nature. 

I cannot successfully use drugs or alcohol. I cannot successfully moderate while using drugs or alcohol. This time, I did everything differently. Everything had to change and be different for me to have success, and I have put forth that effort daily because recovery is a daily task. It's part of my self care, and I'm so happy to do the work. Coming to this group has held me accountable, given me a safe place to connect with others much like myself, and brought me an incredible friendship (I'm looking at you u/SunshineyAF!❤️). 

Sobriety has broken my heart through the loss of my relationship with my parents. Yet, being sober is the best gift I could have ever given myself. I have a deep, unbridled appreciation for life like I did before my teenage years. I'm present, rational, more positive, considerate and mindful. I can appreciate the good to an extent I never could before, and weather the bad better than I ever could while I was using. I'd never trade my best day drunk for my worst day sober. Everything is better, bad day or not. Thank you for walking this path with me, Sobernaughts. You have taught me so much, especially in my early days of sobriety. I never could have done this without you, I'm so proud of all of you. But most importantly, I'm proud of myself for what seems like the first time in my life.

I am sure though that i have a drinking problem. I have quite a responsible job. I lead a team of 60 people and its so demanding that its active in my head literally 24/7. The only solution to stop it is to drink 10+ bottles of beer during weekdays so it turns off my brain and i can listen to music or play a game. Needless to say i wake up every morning feeling depressed and sick.
During weekends i meet up with friends and we drink excessively and do drugs like ketamine, mdma and cocaine. I need to do all those things to get my mind off work and have some fun.
I want to find a less demanding job but its so hard because i am always hungover and tired and i earn good money (that i need because im used to relatively high standards of housing, food etc). 
This needs to stop because im losing my girlfriend (6 years) and slowly sinking deeper and deeper. 
Thats why i joined this subreddit today in the hope i can realise what i know i need to do but never manage to.

My dreams were a little different last night. I walk up to the bar and order a beer. Right before I take a sip, I remember that I am living a sober life and that I am about to fuck it up. I put the beer down and walk away happily.

Even i i stopped i had problems with bloating and lots of burps.
But yesterday i was looking in the cabinets for some stumic acid medicine but was i found was even better amoxecllin antibiotica for my mother.
I took it and ooh man i feel like my body is healing no more pain when i eat bloating is far less i can see my abs come back a little.
I dont know if it is alocholic gastrites or a uclur but i feel so much better.
But im afraid now that if all the pain goes away and bloating i might go back to drinking.
Because i had a long time problems with my stomach over a year.
Anyway hope yall doing good if you have the same problems pain after eating low appetite all the time burning sensation go to the doctor and ask for antibiotics i went to the doctor but they said i need to take ultrasound and then the coronavuris hit.
So if this doesnt will fix it i will go.

1. I have more energy every day. I'm not always energetic but it's a more consistent energy because 75% of it isn't committed to knocking a hangover. 

2. My moods are more consistent. I've still had a few days where depression hits hard, and I'm sure I will continue to, but it's no longer overwhelming.

3. I drink an appropriate amount of water! Imagine that! My piss is no longer a deep orange and I don't almost pass out when I wake up to pee in the middle of the night. 

4. My financial stability is still not there but it's already becoming more manageable.

5. My anxiety is almost at a zero. I've never been an anxious person and I didn't realize how much hangovers were giving me every day.

6. I don't wake up wondering if I made a fool of myself. I don't have to check my phone for all the potential embarrassments. 

7. My skin is clearer! Not perfect but clearer!

8. I feel slimmer. I don't feel bloated every day which is awesome! Now just to give up frozen pizzas and ice cream. But hell. I'm getting sober. I'll eat whatever I want for a while!

9. My friends are super supportive and excited to see me succeed! 

10. It was easier than I thought to give it up. I haven't missed it all that much either. 

11. I still wake up and anxiously ask myself, ""Did you drink last night?"" I think I'll keep doing that for a while. I'm happy to report that the answer has been no every time. 

For anyone who thinks that they can't do it, you absolutely can. I also was addicted to cocaine for quite a while, especially over quarantine. I've been off of it for about 4 months? I didn't keep track of the date. I just want you to know that whatever your situation, you can make it better! It only took 11 days of sobriety to realize.

For starters: I am a 22 year old lady and have been sober since 7/27/20 after drinking pretty much everyday for the past year and a half with short breaks mixed in occasionally. 

On 7/27, I had 4 ciders and 5 beers, chain smoked cigarettes, and rambled off some mediocre philosophical life wonderings to my best friend on my back porch. I didn't do anything wild but I woke up with my usual drinking anxiety and decided I have really got to get real with myself. I have a drinking problem! I drink every day after work, sometimes its just 2 drinks but sometimes it is a whole bottle of wine or a 6 pack. It's likely that I will drink until all my resources are used up. I drink primarily alone (whilst chain smoking cigarettes on my back porch). The interesting thing that set off this introspective exploration was that most of the time when I would crack open a beer, I emotionally would not want to do it. This little voice in my head would be nagging me about drinking, all the while I sat merrily downing beer after beer.  

I drank a lot in my first year of college. I dropped out, moved into an apartment/got a job/started community college. I drank a fair amount with my older roommates at 19. I drank a lot during my 20th and 21st years. During 18, 19, and 20 I could go without drinking no problem because it was occasional enough and I was not of legal age to buy/go to bars. My 21st and 22nd years drinking became not so fun. I would drink too much and either blackout or wake up feeling like death, so during the past year or so I decided to cut out liquor and stick to beer/wine/ciders. This worked and I was able to moderate for a while, but I then learned it is a slippery slope. Moderation soon turned from 1 drink a night to 1/2 a bottle of wine, then to the full bottle plus more. Again, I will drink until my beverage resources were used up. 

I have decided to stop now before it is too late. To bring it all the way home, both my parents are alcoholics and it definitely runs in both lineages. My entire childhood was seeped in alcohol, my adolescence and teen years were too. My dad recovered when I was 12 (thank God). He was a 6-12 pack of Budweiser a day guy, had a couple DUIs and was not the best parent- though he was scarcely angry. Just numb. My mother is still a seriously angry, raging, conspiratorial, right wing religious fanatic alcoholic. I love her but damn, its hard to get past your mother telling you you're the devil's spawn and that you didn't come from her womb while she's piss drink and you're forced to stay with her because dad is in alcohol rehab. (12 was a tough year, lol). 

Since my dad recovered, it has been such a tear jerking experience getting to know who he really is. We have the same humour, the same philosophical observations about people and the world. He is such a truly special person, and I never would have known if he didn't stop drinking and we didn't heal our relationship. I went on family vacation this past week and I was able to talk to him about my new pursuit of sobriety, all my worries and anxieties about how drinking could destroy my life and was already causing me distress at 22. He advised to give it a break for 30 days, and re-evaluate then. Day by day.  The gratitude and love I feel for him is bringing tears to my eyes knowing I have a support like him. Jeez, this is getting sappy. One new thing I've noticed since I stopped drinking is that I could cry at the blink of an eye, lol. 

Anyways, I don't know what will happen in 30 days time in terms of my drinking. I do know that I'll be moved into a new apartment with some of my best friends, starting a new semester and pursuing my second associates degree in behavioral science, I will have my amazing partner by my side (who, after opening up to him about my drinking issues, decided he would not drink for now either <3 ) I have started therapy, and have an awesome new academic advisor to support me through school.

If you have also been a victim of abuse and are having to confront it in sobriety, please know you can always send me a message if you need to talk, but an internet stranger is no substitute for speaking with a professional. 

Last night, I was watching a show about serial killers with my boyfriend. We got to an episode where a convict was talking about how he was abused as a child. He kept bringing it up as he relayed stories about the different foster parents he lived with. When he got to one foster parent though, he gave a lot of detail regarding the specific incidents/acts and how he was feeling during them. 

At this specific part, I could feel my heart rate increase. As he kept talking, I started to feel nauseous, almost carsick. My chest and throat felt tight. Finally, I started to cry. I wasn’t tearing up like I normally do when watching something emotional. I was gasping for breath, shaking, and I got extremely hot. My boyfriend stopped the show and I had to get out of the room. I went outside to cool down and catch my breath. 

I truly believe my alcoholism progressed beyond my control upon coming to terms with how I was abused as a child. I had always known what happened, but it wasn’t until I was older that I could actually put a label on my experience and recognize that I was molested. After this, i started drinking every day to deal with the other, suppressed emotions that stemmed from this experience. Part of my success being sober has meant coming to terms with these emotions and learning how to forgive myself and my family. 

In those moments, while outside, it didn’t cross my mind to drink. Once I had caught my breath, my main focus was on identifying my feelings and allowing myself to feel them. I have felt uncomfortable before when people mentioned their own abuse, but have never broken down like this. My boyfriend came outside too and gave me a hug. I cried some more and let all of my emotions have a voice. 

It’s been years since I came to terms with what happened, but I don’t know if I’ve ever truly allowed myself to let go and express my emotions like that. I had always used alcohol to suppress my feelings. I wasn’t healing. This is truly the most intense I’ve felt about my experiences and I’m so happy that I was able to lean into the intensity instead of turning away. 

Anyway, I look forward to other experiences in sobriety that can allow me to grow and heal and practice dealing with my problems in a healthy way. Sometimes we all just need a good cry. IWNDWYT",10,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.6986002922058105}"

Just as I am trying to stop drinking, my sister- and brother-in-law are opening a wine shop.

I plan to open up to them about the reason I stopped drinking, but I am afraid of how they will react.

We were legitimately in love, and I know I was a good partner. I did everything for this girl. 

Since finding out yesterday, and to the time I’m writing this, I haven’t had a single drink. I want to so bad, but I honestly know where that road would lead and the thought of my emotions/depression/anxiety that would eventually hit, coupled with the breakup, basically scares the shit out of me. 

I’ve always been a heavy drinker since I was 19. I’m 32 now. This one hurts, but I think it’s going to be the one to keep me off it for the longest time I’ve ever gone, if not for good. I’m going to up my workouts, lower my run times, and use it as fuel.

\-Because I am fixated on alcohol and always drink the most out of everyone I am spending time with

\-Because I purchase additional alcohol, consume it secretly and hide it throughout the house.  I am tired of the shame of finding bottles and having to dispose of them

\-Because I am tired of waking up for work, having to vomit in the bathroom and then spend half the day hung over while trying to take care of patients at my job, or coming up with excuses for calling in sick

\-I am tired of causing nonsense arguments with my SO, sobbing for no reason or even verbalizing SI when I am blitzed and blaming it on being bipolar rather than being an alcoholic

\-I am sick of lying to my partner about my drunkenness, blaming it on the ""medicine"" for bipolar I'm taking rather than being truthful about drinking a 6 pack before meeting up with him

\- I'm tired of not knowing if my mood swings are due to mental illness or alcoholism and getting prescribed more and more medications while I continue to drink

\-Because I do not want to ruin my future.   I want a family one day and I can never do that with these awful alcoholic tendencies

Nightcaps to quell my anxiety and insomnia. Never worked, but I feared it’d be so much worse sober.

I’m 20 days alcohol free today. I was riding a nice high and I’ve since leveled out but I’m able to appreciate my progress. Tomorrow I have a really intense meeting that I have to lead. Old me would have been drunk right now to calm my nerves. Sober me is just going to do my best, with a clear head, for once.

We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn't:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

US—Night/Early Morning

Europe—Morning

Asia and Australia—Evening/Night

Yesterday was really stressful,"So I've officially been sober for a week, and I'm happy I resisted yesterday. My landlady was meant to come check my recently trashed apartment. I also gave away most of my furniture cause I'm moving out at the end of the month, so I just have piles of shit where furniture used to house it. Additionally I have a cat and that's not allowed in the apartment. I'd normally have a place for him to go but I don't have anyone I can ask anymore. I managed to sort everything out before she arrived, and I was relieved when it was over, everything was fine in the end. She didn't care about the cat and I pretended it was a temporary favor to a friend. My little brother then arrived from my home country for a few days. I see him a couple times a year. He doesn't know about anything so he suggested we go get a beer. I told him I'm taking a break from drinking (I never intend to drink again) but that I'd go with him and order something non alcoholic. He said sure sounds good. In the end I told him I was too tired, which was true, but am a bit relieved I didn't have to be in a bar yet. I'm confident it would be fine, I still have no urges yet, but I'm still trying to regulate my mood by myself. And after the way the day felt, it was nice to just eat ice cream in the bath and watch Netflix. On to getting 8 days under my belt I guess.

I felt lousy. I went and bought coffee and breakfast, hoping it would cure the nausea but I spent the entire day feeling dreadful. I rarely went into work hungover, not because I didn’t drink, but because I was so used to drinking every night I didn’t suffer hangovers. Usually by 2pm I’d be thinking about wine again, and planning my visit to the shop to buy a bottle or two for that evening. 

This was part of a years long battle, one that had gone on for so long and had been slipped into so slowly that I’m not entirely sure when it began. I was drained, guilt ridden, bloated, tired and riddled with anxiety. I felt like a failure for being unable to drink “normally” and for feeling the constant need to escape my life as a wife and mother.

Something clicked a year ago, though, and I decided the time had come for me to give up the cycle of drinking and regret. I battled through day one, feeling sick and tired, then posted on this sub (thank you u/amdetermined for cheering me on that day) and continued to visit and comment regularly. I kept going, and the higher I saw the number on my counter, the more determined I became that I would be posting on my anniversary to thank you all. I read the posts of other “1 yearers”, unable to truly imagine myself at that point, but giddy for the day it came.

Today marks 1 year since I stopped drinking, and my life has changed enormously since that day. We’ve moved house, I accepted I was using alcohol as a way of dealing with depression and anxiety and started taking medication to help me with that, I’ve become calmer, happier and realised that life isn’t always easy, but it’s easier sober. It’s not always been easy, and I still have thoughts of “just one drink can’t hurt”, but then I remember how unhappy I was, how quickly I would slip back into old routines, and how much I value my sobriety-it means more to me than almost everything in my life.

It’s not an exaggeration for me to say that I love each and every one of you for the efforts you are making to get well, to improve your health (mental and physical) and for being my family through this sometimes very lonely journey. Sobriety isn’t as prized in the UK (in fact it’s often frowned upon, in my experience) but you have cheered me own, consoled me, comforted me and made me feel less alone.

Being sober means we are showing the next generation that alcohol is not necessary to live a fun and exciting life and when we eat together as a family now, there are way less arguments...funny that... IWNDWYT

Thank you all from the bottom of my heart, you are the most awesome band of heroes I’ve ever met, so full of wisdom, love and grit!

I’ve posted this list once or twice before, but the keys are still the same. This is what keeps my boat floating:

* Step out of the shadows. Posting, commenting and being part of the community changed everything for me.

* Set a goal. One hour, one day, one week; this trip, that visit - and count your victories! Then you know you can do it the next time too.

* Moderation doesn´t work. I tried it for ten years, and it only made me miserable.

* HALT. When I crave, am I really hungry, angry, lonely, tired? Staying one step ahead with some water, fruit or a snack has helped me a lot.

* Play the tape forward. What happens if I take this drink? The next hour, the next day, the next week? For me, drinking is not just about one day of hangover - it is 40 days with that voice in my head.

* Learn your triggers. Want a drink? Take a step or two backwards and see what just happened. Then, try to avoid it. It takes time to create new patterns, but it works. Knowledge is bliss.

* Allow yourself to mourn the losses. For me it´s like a long and painful breakup with the love of my life. That is in addition to lost opportunities, growth, finances, relations, you name it.

* Discover new joys. I´ve always loved fresh roast, hand brewed coffee; now I love it even more, particularly with the sunrise through my window.

* Afraid to fall? My motorcycle teacher taught me that if you stare at an object in the road, you will hit it. Look where you´re going, not where you´re not going.

* Did you fall? Don´t despair. Get up. The failure isn´t in falling, it´s in not getting up again.

* Struggling with motivation? We all do. Go for resolution in stead. Motivation shifts, resolution stays.

* Impatient? Waiting for that spunk, clarity, weightloss, zen born again bliss peace of mind? It took time to get where you are. It will take time and work to become the person you want to be, too. But you know what? You are already on your way, and that´s your doing. You can do this.

* Stressed out? Inhale grace, exhale gratitude.

Convincing me that this is normal, and that it’s okay. That I’m  just bored and this will fill the time. It’s the bottle telling me, “it’s just a drink, there is nothing wrong with you. Just have a drink, you had a rough day”.  But when I don’t give in, or I don’t have any around, the thoughts consume me. The thoughts draw me in and it’s like a marathon in my mind.  The thoughts keep running through my mind until I’m exhausted, I’m tired, I’m distracted, I’m inpatient and i tell myself if I just have one drink Ill feel better. But I know I won’t just have one drink, and even I know this isn’t a lie that buries itself deep down, this lie rides along the surface and I acknowledge this lie as soon as I say it to give myself an easy way out. I tell myself “just one” because it makes me feel like I’ve accomplished something. It’s my white lie to myself that even I know is not true. 

So I have ‘just 1 drink’ and the 1 drink turns into more. And the ‘more’ turns into a racing heartbeat, regret, fear, restless sleep, and playing solitaire at 3 am because I need something to distract myself from the anxiety and disappointment because here I am again. 

Today was the day that I realized that the little
Voice in my head was not “just a drink to take the edge off” but a voice that that wants to lead me down this path and keep me here. It wants me to need it and find joy in it instead of facing and learning from the emotions I’m feeling. 

Today, I realized that voice telling me “just one drink” is not helping me, and it’s not normal. I do not want to accept that this destructive voice can control me and while I can’t change today, I can change tomorrow. And I will.

Once I started, I just kept drinking, couldn’t stop - I enjoyed it, but ultimately I was in a bad place. 
I never drank much during the week at all, occasional social but 99% was weekend evenings.

After a few years of the hangovers, too much cash spent, heightened anxiety over small things etc - I made the decision to quit for 100 days. 

I am on day 70 and thus far I’ve not come close to fail. I feel energised, I’m productive - life is better in every way. 

With just 30 days to go, I’ve decided I probably won’t have a drink on day 101 - or even 102. In fact who knows when I’ll drink again. 

BUT - it really bothers me that I seemingly am unable to go out and enjoy an occasional drink with friends on my birthday, or at Christmas, without the risk of falling back to the binge habit that ruined my weekends and start of the working week. 

Has anyone got experience with returning to occasional drinking having been a serial binger? 

Is it possible to create a life where you drink once every 2 months when the occasion merits? 

Is it worth the risk? 

Having taken a break to reset my toxic drinking habits, can I expect to ever have a healthy relationship with alcohol (low volume as an occasional treat)?

In my weekly health & wellbeing journal I like listing the positive changes I've made or the results of those changes I've seen throughout the week.

So I thought I'd share some with you!

1) The big one! No more waking up with excruciating stomach aches. 

For the past 3 months I've been waking up in agony from my drinking and spent my days mostly recovering and waiting to feel better.

2) I started exercising? I know, crazy. Exercise has been an alien activity to me for years where I was convinced with my busy office lifestyle, I simply had no time for it. (Had time to drink though, didn't I!)

It started off as just walking after work and then became waking up early in the morning to do pilates and yoga with meditation splashed I'm for good measure.

All of the above has been so important to me to reclaim my mental health.

I've struggled with crippling anxiety all my life and started to frizz out without the wine to dampen the symptoms.

So in desperation I turned to positive affirmations and meditation. My condition improved within days, it was incredibly confusing.

So right now when I feel overwhelmed or anxious, I turn to my new drug, squats and positive thinking!

3) Massive diet improvements.

So my logic in the past was, if I'm drinking 3000+ kcals extra a week, what's the point in eating well?

Sharing size bags of crisps in one sitting, whole party bags of sweets and chocolates with as much take out and sugary coffee as I wanted.

All gone!

My snacks became rice cakes and fruit and my drink of juice? Freshly brewed fruit tea, no sugar. Just dried strawberries, orange peel and rosehip.

I'm really proud of this change because I'm enjoying it. I feel like as I get older I refuse to accept I don't like sugary things anymore.

I'm still young so of course I like sugary cereal and coffees that could be mistaken for a cake. But I just hate it.

Through out this past month I've noticed a significant up spike in confidence and mental health. 

I'm handling negativity and bad news drastically better with a balanced approach. 

I got promoted at work and for the first time in my life have a truly big and important job. Which I could not have secured if I was still in my previous state. 

I've began cleaning my house regularly because I want to (weird). Which I know is making my family feel better too. 

I'm thriving. I care about myself. And I refuse to let go of any of this. 

Alcohol is a thief only capable of stealing your time and your strength.

The curse is that I cannot seem to get the DMV situation straight to save my life. My license reinstatement has been delayed by three months because of covid and bureaucratic incompetence - actual incompetence, despite my repeatedly grilling people IS THIS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING? only to have the next person on the chain sigh and deny me....again.

We drove five hours today to get to an office, and still I can't get my freedom back because they're not offering road tests. I'm paying a price for my mistake way beyond my penalties because of the pandemic. I have to move soon because my landlord is selling the house because he needs medical treatment and has no savings. I need to drive in a matter of weeks, and the wait for DMV appointments is months. I'm angry at the injustice, angry with the American government, angry at our limited access to medical care and mental health that might have helped me prevent crashing and burning in the first place, angry with every foolhardy arrogant person who thinks ""I'm fine! I don't need a mask!"".....so angry that all I wanted to do was fall apart and drink about it. Rob myself of tomorrow? Sure! What's a couple more wasted days?! The world is going up in flames, bring on the gasoline and let's party!

Instead, I asked for backup. I spoke before I snapped, and acknowledged my feelings before I acted on them.

So, like the loyal friend who watches the werewolf in chains in a locked room all night, armed with a baseball bat as the beast howls, my man sat with me and hated stuff and we glowered at the woes of the world until the witching hour passed. We're taking it a month at a time, a week at a time, a day at a time, an hour at a time. It feels right, if not good. It will get better.

Leave each other good sobriety recommendations! I'm going to return to plugging *Bojack Horseman* for those who enjoy animated shows. The first few seasons could be kind of triggering actually, I suppose, and are not as great as the later seasons but stay with it! The show really hits its stride in S3 and has a really great sobriety arc in the last few seasons. Also it's just really funny. Every time I hold my hand up to shield my face from the sun at the pool I think of old Bojack. It really made an impression. It was somehow something I could relate to a ton and at the same time a great escapist fantasy.

TL;DR just watch any *West Wing* scene wherein Leo explains alcoholism but imagine a cute 22 year old woman instead of a wrinkly old man lol

I’ve never been like a serious alcoholic. I drank infrequently, but my problem is how much I crave drunkenness. I went through a horrid breakup last year, and throughout it, I yearned to get drunk so I could give myself an excuse to call him, but fortunately, I set myself rules that I followed. I’m grateful that, as a devout Catholic, I have a religious prohibition against intentional drunkenness because that helped me. I’m proud to say I didn’t drink at all while I was grieving!

Anyway, brag aside :), a few weeks ago I had a small drink, and even though I was in a good mood, I almost went and bought a bottle to solo that evening. I forced myself to go home to my roommates fortunately, but that moment was a realization of a pattern of behavior: I don’t want one drink. I want a bunch. And even if one drink doesn’t *always* lead to a bunch, I can’t hope I’ll *always* have enough self control not to fall into a bunch. I have an addictive personality, and I have a real possibility of becoming an alcoholic if I’m not careful and mindful. 

So I decided that I needed to lay down a rule of 0 drinks, and I think that means I should probably never have alcohol again. If “only when you’re in a good mood” wasn’t enough to protect me from a desire to get drunk, then I can’t figure what would be. Better safe than sorry, right?

It’s pretty daunting though, and I guess this is where talking about it could help me. I’m really young, only 22, and to imagine the rest of my life never being drunk again is uncomfortable. I like to be drunk, and even though I’m perfectly content not to be drunk *today*,*never* is another story. I don’t even know why. I think, on reflection as I type this, that the fact that a life without being drunk makes me uncomfortable is a sign that a life without alcohol is a necessity. So I hope I maintain my motivation and that I can do this!!

I quickly put on 15 pounds over a 4 month period. A month ago I decided enough is enough and started moving back to the previous healthy lifestyle; no drinking and following intermittent fasting. This has helped drop 8 pounds and more importantly I no longer wake up the morning feeling sick/hungover /guilty.

Lots of drunken nights as a student and over the years but I always managed to function well as a parent,  spouse,  employee, daughter,  etc.(I never drank a drop while pregnant btw). I got into the daily drinking habit about 20 years ago and rarely went a night without 2 or 3 glasses of wine or a couple of tall IPAs. I was usually very careful though - e.g. I never kept booze in the house because once started I'll usually keep going until I'm hammered. I would also wait till 8pm to start drinking my 1/2 bottle (carton) of wine or 2 beers and would deliberately nurse them until after the liquor store closed at 10pm. Weekend nights out with friends became more of a problem though -  most of my friends are drinkers, but also great moms and completely functional in most other ways.   I could easily knock back two bottles of wine over the course of a night with them. 

I have anxiety (don't most of us drinkers) which results in the most horrendous hanxiety the day after a weekend drinking session. I spent last Sunday with the most HORRENDOUS hangxiety I've ever experienced. Literally shaking, nauseous, and freaking out mentally until around 3pm, worrying about the damage I've probably done to my body (I have health anxieties).  It was so bad that I haven't touched a drop since, 8 days ago. But I just hope I don't cave this weekend when I see my friends. Unfortunately my friends are huge triggers for me but I adore them. 

Anyone else quit mostly because of hanxiety? The thought of going through a day like that again is just horrific. But will I ever be able to socialize with my friends again without an alcoholic drink yet still have fun? I've tried to quit many a time and social events are such a struggle. All I can think about is how much I want a drink and how much I envy my friends being able to drink.

I'm definitely a functioning alcoholic, been struggling over the last 5 years probably more than earlier. Always a binge drinker since 19.

Am not on anything other than my anti depression meds I've been on for some 20 years and just went off cold turkey.

First time posting, not sure what to expect but just feeling the physical urge to drink something awful right now. This post is mostly just rambling crap in my brain in no real logical order.

I recently had my first pair of kids (twins, good God it's been hard) with my lovely lady of almost 6 years now. They're so happy and I love them to death. My partner is super supportive and I know she wants me to be happy. I'm mostly worried about my health and long term effects of my drinking habits over the last 14 years or so which I know is unhealthy. Having kids hands down has been the most difficult, taxing thing I've done. I'm so tired, always. My partner and I are both still working full time (from home for now) which in some ways has been great to watch them grow but man... It's been hard. 

I justify my drinking since I don't get angry or anything, just typically talk a bit more than normal then fall asleep. These Corona times has made it even easier to justify drinking since I don't have to go to the office. It's easy to just be hungover and have cameras off on a zoom meeting while working from home. 

I know it just takes one slip up and accident and I could wind up tripping and falling on the stairs with a kid, or something awful. I don't want some terrible rock bottom experience to be what makes me change my ways. 

I want to be sober for me. I want to be sober because I do better at work. I want to be sober because it will mean I will stick around longer for my family. My partner isn't making me be sober or anything but I know how much happier she would be if I could be more helpful on nights when the kids don't sleep, during the day since I won't feel so shitty etc.

The exeriment lasts 30 days and at the end you evaluate how you feel. I've been on and off the wagon more times than I care to count in this last year and a half. This time around, I've equipped myself with tools to help aid my desire to retire from drinking. Part of it is daily journaling to help me reflect. 


Today's topic was the addictive cycle of alcohol. Basically, when alcohol is drank, it releases endorphins. That giddy feeling lasts for maybe 30, then dynorphins (a chemical downer) are released. If a person drinks at the same time each day, then the brain will prerelease the dynorphins, which means it takes longer for your brain to get that feel good feeling.When your body is detoxing from alcohol it releases acetaldehyde, ""which is more toxic than alcohol itself"".


I enjoyed reading this chapter because it reiterates how toxic alcohol is. Before reading this book, I was blissfully unaware of all the chemical components going on in my body from drinking. 


Today is my 30th day alcohol free. Over all it has been fantastic. I'm not wallowing in self hatred, I'm more motivated and productive, and my moods have evened out. Not every day is amazing, but I plan to continue.

However, it's become a lot more than just stopping myself from pouring a glass (well, several) each night. I began to fill my time with small activities, reading, walking, cooking, etc. Initially this was just to fill the time to distract myself from the daily internal bargaining when my next drink would be, but these small mindful activities have given me the space the reflect on why I started in the first place. And the outcome was: I didn't like myself. I wanted to escape myself, my situation, my life...just escape from me. Sometimes I drank to hurt myself, I could feel the damage it was doing to my body the next day and I felt I deserved it.

I'm still working a lot out, but a lot of avenues for self reflection have opened up, and a lot of groundwork for a healthy and meaningful life and future has been made possible from not opening that bottle. Today I used some of the money I've saved to start a basic skin care routine to help me begin showing my body some of the love it has been sorely neglected of (with the added bonus of helping my skin after the years of damage). Even something small such as this is adding to my body and my life, and not taking away as the drink did.

I'm not sure how long I will be able to keep the urge to drink at bay, but if (or rather when) I faulter, I hope to have the love and compassion for myself to forgive myself, and the strength to get back to a healthy place.

And five years ago, I was incapable of thinking this way. I'd be consumed with anxiety and dread in the morning. Thinking about when I would be able to drink in the late afternoon. Planning my nightly ritual of trying to suck down eight or ten drinks, hoping I might get away with appearing like it was a more ""normal"" two or three.

And a long walk? In the summer? Forget about it. Holy ambulance, Batman, because we're talking about a heart attack (or if I'm lucky, the panic attack *thinking* I was having a heart attack) if I walked then, like I walk now. (yeah, I'll brag, I'm proud of the fact that I walk about 80km/wk)

I was someone that would schedule binge drinking around my schedule, so that I always got a full night of sleep. I was really clever about it. Eventually, I hit a point where I missing huge amounts of time in my memory because I was blacking out constantly. I'd be mad because I'd made a lot of progress in a video game, but couldn't remember any of it. Stuff like that.

Eventually, I woke up one morning on the basement floor covered in my own vomit. For whatever reason, that was it. I threw out all the alcohol, and that was that. That was in 2012, I think. 

What was hard for me wasn't staying sober, but learning how to live without booze, and how to have fun without booze. I just didn't know how to exist, and I know it was very hard on my wife. Later, I found evidence that she was thinking about leaving me. I couldn't bring myself to be upset with her. 

Eventually, things slowly started to improve.

A bit later, I found myself with generalized anxiety, and I was also diagnosed with bipolar. I'm in therapy and on meds, and happier than ever. 

I did relapse in 2018, for a couple months, but when I found myself slipping back into nightly solo binge drinking, I quit again.

What's tough for me, relative to other sober people, is that I don't have a horrific story and I didn't have huge cravings after I'd decided to quit. Yeah, I had to re-learn how to live, and that was hard, but I was able to just commit and do it, which makes feel like a fraud when I'm around or talking to other folks that needed to get sober.

Yeah, it's a lame first-world problem, but when it comes to relating to people in groups, I feel like a fraud. I never go to meetings, and never have, outside of being ordered to. I felt the same way when I was ordered to go to out-patient meetings for my bipolar. Everyone else there had some really tough story, whereas I'm just nuts. I don't know. I don't spend a lot of time trying to connect to or relate to people, but I can imagine it would be beneficial. I don't even keep track of sober dates. 

Again, I'm a fraud, but again, if I started drinking again tonight, I'd get out control with it, and my life would effectively be over. I don't even know why I'm posting this.

I never took my first sip of alcohol till I was 20. I just recently graduated college and moved back home with my parents because of covid. In college I drank and went out every weekend. I always just saw it as a pure social thing, but deep down I knew it was more than that. 

The only thing that was able to push me through my entire week in college was knowing that I’d get to drink and unwind on the weekend. It’s how I rewarded myself for doing assignments. It was my way of destressing. It’s the only way I know how to. I use alcohol to handle stress and my depression that I don’t talk to anyone about. I’m a really cheerful and bubbly person, but awfully sad inside. 

In quarantine, I moved back home 3hrs from all my friends. I’ve found myself drinking alone at home. I never drank alone prior to this. And it’s starting to worry me a lot. I don’t want to become dependent on the alcohol just so that I can feel okay. Or just so that I can numb all my problems. I don’t want this to get worse than it already is. 

My family social drinks a lot. But last night I took 11 shots at a 3 year olds bday party just because I’ve been really sad lately. I know therapy is what I need to handle my problems. I only came on this sub after someone called out drinkers in a popular post and someone linked this server. Reading that post made me feel like absolute shit about myself. 

I’m going to try to stop drinking. This is not healthy for me. This will be hard. But I don’t want to develop a dependency. I just don’t know where to start.

It’s been over a year since I threw up actually!!  A weird bench mark that only y’all would understand, but happy regardless! Telling one of closest friends and my grandma was the turning point with that. 

I’m so very very aware that my life and health are at stake. I’ve read books and listened to podcasts. I’ve made so many stupid and dangerous decisions while drunk. I drove into on coming traffic and onto a curb. My uncle was killed by a drink driver, so alllll throughout my teenage years and early twenties I HATED people who drank and drove. (I still hate it, but I try not to judge now) Yet there I was, realizing I was halfway on a parking lot curb immediately realizing I had become what I hated.

I’d always scatter my drinking with a few days to a week off here and there, but this year it’s been every night. Typically I’ll drink six of those 24oz coors lights in a sitting.

Anyways...I decided to do No Alcohol August for my health, as an exercise in self control, and to begin to remove drinking from my life. It’s the 3rd now, and I can honestly say that I don’t crave it aside from the occasional passing thought. BUT. Last night as I was about to fall asleep, I felt this “shock” in my chest and arms and jolted awake with this adrenaline feeling. Every single time I was about to fall asleep I would be jolted awake again. I got maybe an hour of sleep. Googled it and came up with “hypnic jerk”. Was curious if anyone else here has experienced this? Anyone know how long it’ll last?

It’s 6AM, my alarm is screaming at me and I feel like absolute garbage. I have to be at work in an hour and there’s no hope of getting there on time. This has been my reality almost everyday for the past three months. I’m 24 and just graduated college and since then I’ve been drinking nearly every day. I’ve struggled with alcohol in the past. I used to drink till I got drunk every night for about a year. I would wake up, take two pain pills(I know my liver must be dead) and be on my way and no one knew. This was three years ago and I’ve been battling with this behavior on and off ever since. I had a good three month streak of no drinking and taking depression medication and it was the best three months of my life. But then I got back into alcohol. Now with Covid, I’ve been able to get away with more and more drinking. It started out as half a pint of vodka after graduation and I’d fall asleep tipsy. Now I drink a whole pint every night and almost don’t feel drunk at all. It’s affecting my life and health drastically. My performance at work is sharply decreasing because I’m reeling from last nights drinking until lunch. My behavior towards others is getting worse and I hate to admit this but I’m driving while drunk too. I hate myself for doing that because I know how dangerous it is. I would never do that in the right mind but when I’m drunk I turn into an idiot. I’ve had enough. Ive had enough of the bullshit. It’s not fun anymore. It’s not cool anymore. It’s ridiculous and dangerous. If I live like this I’ll either kill someone else or myself in an accident or from my liver shutting down. I must stop. And I hope that if you’re college aged reading this and thinking you might have a problem, please take my advice: stop. The culture you’re in at this moment will only make it easier for you to rationalize drinking till you pass out. It doesn’t stop when you leave college. You carry that behavior on even when there is no one around you. I need help guys. I’m really struggling and I’m scared. But I want to beat this. I want to be sober for life.

It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

I used to do quite a bit of commuting and had a long driving commute, around two and a half hours in the car round trip, sometimes more. I got in the habit of stocking my car with a case of bottled water and packaged snacks like Larabars (I'm not even sure what the generic name for such things would be, nutritional bars? Fancy granola bars?)

I live in a city and sometimes come across people asking for help, usually with some sort of sign, at highway off ramps and busy intersections. I don't feel comfortable handing money over when I'm approached in public, and that's not a boundary that I have to cross. I'm an alcoholic, it's not like I'm passing judgement on what I think it ""should"" be spent on, it's just not something that I feel comfortable doing, and so I don't. But when I had them handy, I would pass a bottle of water and a snack through the window, and that generally seemed to be appreciated.

I no longer have a regular long commute, so I don't keep my car stocked, but I still drive, and I still sometimes come across people asking for help. This week I realized that I could still keep my car stocked with things to hand out even if I don't need them for myself, so I bought a case of water and some Mashed Together Fruit & Nut Bars to hand out. 

I have a lot more empathy for homelessness this time around in sobriety, largely because I realize that there's not a great deal of difference between people who are homeless and myself. Not everyone who has an addiction ends up homeless, and not everyone who is homeless has an addiction, but there is some overlap. Alcoholic drinking creates a lot of instability in people's lives and burns a lot of relationships down. 

I never experienced homelessness as a consequences of my drinking, but I know people who have, and I also know that if I ever decide to pick up drinking again, it's still a possible consequence that's waiting for me. It might take me five, ten, fifteen years to get there, but I can see how it could happen. Just because I was sorta able to hold it together in the past, doesn't mean that I would be able to sorta hold it together forever.

So I'm grateful for my sobriety, and I'm grateful for what I have in my life, a safe and comfortable place to live and people in my life who care about me and would feel comfortable having me stay with them and offering me help if I needed it. And I recognize that my drinking could have very easily ended up taking me down a different road. So I show my gratitude by being willing to share a little of what I have with those who are struggling.

Anyway, that's me for this week, sobernauts. How's everyone else doing, any AoK that you'd like to share?",24,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9938710927963257}"

It sort of just happens now, like an object in motion it stays that way.  Staying sober I thought would become easier in the 2nd year and for the most part it was, though with the way life has changed in 2020 I would've had lots of excuses to give it up.  Thing is, I don't want to.  I don't EVER want to drink again.  It seems like a simple thing but for me it is a big shift in my thought process.  Do I wish I could have something that would help me relax and escape in a short amount of time, sure.  But is it worth it?  It's fake and temporary.  Also it comes at a huge cost.  Time has given me peace inside my head.  My reward system is no longer polluted with goals of trying to find a quick fix in a bottle.  If I want to feel better I need to work for it.  Is that fair?  Is that just?  Doesn't matter, that's how life works especially as we age I'm observing.  So rather than ask myself why I can't relax unless I exercise first, or why I can't find peace without performing my responsibilities beforehand, just do.  Stay in motion, flow with the universe instead of trying to fight or escape it.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn't:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Is it possible to have kinda ptsd from the bad things you’ve done while blacked out/super drunk and cause you to not be able to drink liquor? 

I’m gonna try to not make this long but here’s a little back story that lead me to my question:

A year and a half ago I started drinking a lot heavier than before, especially after two deaths in the family. I started drinking every day, at first it was just a couple beers a day but eventually it got to be at least a 6 pack a day on weeknights. Weekends were another story because it involved way too much liquor and beer. 

Some friends started working at a bar so on Friday’s I’d drink hella beers with my coworkers after we get off, then I’d go to my friends bar. I’d stay there until closing and go to my friends to drink more. Sometimes I left the bar blacked out and I’d drive to my friends. It kills me to admit I’ve blacked out more times than I can remember. 

There were too many times I drove when I shouldn’t be driving. Too many times I blacked out. Too many times I threw up. Too many times I made an embarrassed myself. I regret all of the stupid choices I’ve made, it kills me inside to know how foolish I am in that state. 

Then quarantine started. And the bars closed and I stopped drinking with coworkers. 

Now out of nowhere I can’t even bring myself to drink liquor whatsoever. It’s like when I realized how stupid I’ve become something switched in my head and I can’t even hold down liquor. I can drink beer and wine but the thought of taking a shot or having a mixed drink makes me cringe and want to throw up. More than half the time when I try I do. 

So now I’m wondering, is it possible to have all these bad choices scare me into not being able drink liquor?",6,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992639422416687}"

I even had a antagonist work interaction, which used to be a more personal attack because we were friends (drinking fucked that up too, sigh. Losing important people in your life is really, really rough) but I’m staying true to my boundaries and not taking it upon myself emotionally (regardless if the friend part is salvageable or not, boundaries are good). WHAT! 

You know what I did instead? I ordered myself a burger (I haven’t gone grocery shopping in a while, plus tips are meant to be spent on food) with bacon, sautéed onions, and an egg. I even fell victim to their make it a meal marketing (this was a local shop by the way, not McDs) and added onion rings and...a strawberry shake! I haven’t had a good shake in years. And damn was it tasty, all of it really but the shake really hit home. 

Now my belly is fullll, I’m relaxing in bed (watching Top Chef, haha), ready for an early night since I have to get up early for work place number two tomorrow.

It feels obvious to me now and may have long been to some of you, so I apologize if I'm not saying anything new or helpful.

Last week I committed to quitting drinking and dipping (chewing tobacco) and became active here and at r/stopdipping. Things were going well at first, I had already been 4 days alcohol free and made it 24 hours without tobacco (not nicotine though, I had nicotine gum and pouches). And then, the weekend drew close. That little voice in my head convinced me to spend one more weekend with booze and Grizzly. ""One last time. Start over again in August, line it up with the start of the month. It makes more sense that way"", I lied to my self. So I complied. I sit here now with 3 cans of Grizzly Wintergreen pouches and halfway through a six pack for one reason. It's the reason I think a lot of us slip on commitments like this. Start a diet and fail. Start exercising and fail. Start to learn a new skill, start a new hobby, try to change yourself for the better and almost inevitably fail.

Because we allow ourselves to. Simple as that. Whatever the reason---fear, inconvenience, stubbornness, whatever. We slip, we fall off the wagon, we fade back into bad habits because we allow it. If someone held a gun to your head and said ""Don't drink today or else."", you probably wouldn't drink. At least as long as you had that barrel at your temple. I know I wouldn't. But why? Because in that situation the consequences are too dire and, more importantly, immediate. So, you make the decision not to drink, not to dip, not to eat sugar, not to whatever, because the consequences are too great. But it's not the consequences that are important here, it's the fact that you made the decision. No excuses, no mental gymnastics, no rationalizing continuing the habit, just action (or inaction in this case). When faced with immediate, catastrophic consequences, all of a sudden the discomfort of quitting doesn't seem so bad. The discomfort itself hasn't changed; it's the same whether you're doing it for your friends and family or to keep from getting shot. It's the fact that there's a lot less wiggle room for excuses with the gun than when you're safe at home on a Sunday night.

We slip because we allow ourselves to. Because we allow that tiny bit of room for excuses to convince us to fail yet again. Leave no room for excuses, make it a binary decision.

My depression and anxiety got better in the first 30 days and then got awful in the second month. Now I finally feel sane-ish again. 

My weight has not dropped an ounce , I’m still fat. I was really hoping to drop weight like I did 2 years ago when I stopped drinking. I haven’t even been eating as much ice cream as I did last time. But my face is less poofy. Not sure why I’m not losing weight (I used to drink multiple beers and a bottle of wine a day) 

My tummy issues cleared up within the first month. I don’t have diarrhea after every meal or snack now. I’m also not binge eating as much as I used to when I was drinking 

I have more patience and kindness when I’m sober 

I love hearing happy stories so tell me all the advantages you’ve noticed from being sober .

2020-08-02 19:51:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i2mi20/yesterday_i_failed_hard_but_im_so_glad_yall_exist/,"Yesterday, I failed hard. But I'm so glad y'all exist.","So recently I posted a comment all up my own ass about how my success with stopping drinking meant it was time for new challenges and I was gonna quit smoking and work out more and all that noise. And I dunno, maybe those were good goals but also I think I'm somewhat naive and really not realistic and being a tool...

I lasted two days, four hours without cigarettes. Read the self help books and had the positive mental attitude and was coping okay, except for some random mood swings and cravings. And then, after two days and four hours, I had the most severe panic attack I've had in a decade. It was intense, full body, long lasting, and none of my calming techniques helped. The meds I've been taking for a decade didn't help. I struggled hard for an hour, feeling like everything was falling apart around me, that not only was I not capable of improving my life, I wasn't capable of doing ordinary things like attend college or grocery shop, that I wasn't even able to survive being present, didn't even feel safe in my own home or my own skin...

I looked for help, online, through text counseling, anything I could think of. Took a hot bath. Tried to read. Tried to meditate. I couldn't eat, but my body wanted to shit out everything I've ever eaten and puke everything else. Eventually I felt so helpless, so terrorized by my own brain and body, so out of control that I thought, okay, I can either go sit on my driveway and smoke, or go back to the hospital. It was that bad.

I smoked two cigarettes and now I'm a smoker again. The panic attack stopped almost immediately. Cried a lot last night and eventually just felt utterly exhausted. Today, I've got that weird exhaustion still, my body's so fucking tired after dumping all that adrenaline and having all that stress.

But I didn't drink. Thought about it, a lot, but I didn't. Mostly because I can't drive to the liquor store while having a panic attack. Maybe that's a blessing, in a way - prevented myself from making that a real option.

So I failed at a thing yesterday, and I learned a thing. Don't take sobriety for granted, even when you feel secure. It's something you have to work for every day.

Don't get up your own ass like me and start thinking you're invulnerable. I'm not invulnerable. I know that now.

If you need mental health help, like me, then you need to talk to a pro before quitting a thing. I'll be talking to my psych before trying to quit smoking a second time. Be safe. Don't suffer. There's no pride to be had in reckless arrogance. Don't be dumb like me.

Lastly, thank God for this community. Last night, while desperately looking for resources to calm my mind, I spent a lot of time here reading your positivity. It's one of the few things that helped. I wish there was a community like this for quitting smoking, but there isn't. But without y'all, I'd still be drinking.

You've helped me through the hardest times  over the last seven months, and I need to humbly acknowledge that - I'm not hot shit capable of anything, I'm just one woman working hard, one woman whose strength exists because it's bolstered by all of you - a community of strength to turn to.

Thank you for being here.

I can never stop drinking once I start and I wish I could create a showreel of all the negative experiences alcohol has brought to my life. I’ve fallen down a flight of thirty stairs, has sexual experiences I didn’t want, got into a fight with my best friend & haven’t spoken to them in three years, etc. 

I have also used alcohol to cover up my social anxiety. I used to heavily drink before most of my university class presentations, dates and social events. 

Last year, I went to my ex-boyfriends Christmas party and it was the first time I was going to meet his friends. All of them were a lot older than me, super intelligent, qualified doctors, etc. Me, the nervous twenty year old fool wanted to make a good impression. I turned up blackout drunk. As soon as I arrived at the party this was really obvious as his friend got me a glass of water. Instead of putting it on the table when I’d had a few sips, my drunk blackout brain simply decided “we don’t want to hold that anymore!!” and I just released a full glass of water onto the floor like an absolute clown :/ 

Now, I see two paths ahead of me - the one where I continue on drinking and it gets progressively worse. The hangovers are already getting pretty horrible. The other path is where drinking and alcohol are no longer a part of my life.

The exeriment lasts 30 days and at the end you evaluate how you feel. I've been on and off the wagon more times than I care to count in this last year and a half. This time around, I've equipped myself with tools to help aid my desire to retire from drinking. Part of it is daily journaling to help me reflect. 


Today's chapter was about liberation and fixation when it come to alcohol. She talked about fixation being when you want to be offered a beer or keeping thinking about when you should have another one. Liberation being able to only take one beer and be done and have one beer and not thinking about the next one. 


Today's reflection question was to define what I would consider moderate drinking. Honestly, I didnt reflect on it more than knowing that moderation is not for me. I haven't been able to do it (for long) in years. It is easier for me to just abstain from alcohol all together, because when i do drink with the goal being moderation, I always end up fixating on the beer.

I’d figured that once that milestone passed, I would feel so much more confidence in my sobriety. I had some rough times leading up to that first year and I was ready to move forward! Well, lo and behold you can look back and see that the start of my second year wasn’t sunshine and rainbows either, but I just kept pushing forward. There were many times leading up to this moment right now that I wanted to relapse. There were times that I realized I needed to be more careful. Those times made me realize that I am responsible for my sobriety, no one else. My confidence grew as I realized I could take on people’s casual offers for drinks, telling them “No thanks, I don’t drink.” And finally, not having those words haunt me with memories of a past self, or make me envious of those offering. It was finally just a nonchalant statement, one that no one pried about anymore. So if you’re reading this, keep your head up, keep moving forward. When I struggle with thoughts of relapse, I always think about how I’d feel afterward, which is usually enough to scare me straight. If you’re struggling in early sobriety, I can offer the hope that it will get easier with time and my inbox is open if you need to chat. Remember why you started, then play the tape forward.

My roommates are always throwing shots back & asking me to drink with them. My other one comes over with other drugs and teases me about doing some with him. Always saying “remember when we used to just do drugs/drink.” “Come on do it with us!” It’s tempting, not going to lie. But frustrating because they know I’m trying to be good. I know they’re only teasing but I’m only beginning to build my resolve. I’m usually pretty weak and break down. Really, it’s just tough when it’s in front of you.

Thankfully, I’m almost out of here.

I’ve been stressed because I’m in the process of moving to another city & I haven’t found a place to move into yet. Normally I would turn to a bottle of wine or shots to ease my tensions and not give a fuck. I’m always stressed and anxious but now I don’t go to my normal outlet for these emotions.

I’ve been trying to exercise more and relax by watching a favorite show or turning to writing and reading. It’s doing the job, still get an inkling for some alcohol. 

But I’m keeping strong. I’ve gone this far and I remind myself how horrible I feel with it. And that I have a problem with it.

It feels better being sober. Again, more clarity. More time to do things. More money in my pocket! There’s more to life than drowning my troubles away with alcohol.

I had lost my trust in faith to be an anchor for me and mind was whirling. The only thing that would stabilize it (so it felt) were those first couple of drinks. But it wouldn’t stop there, then the guilt causing behavior, then the emotional hangover and guilt...the cycle repeats. So one hungover guilt filled afternoon, as I was filled with desperation and considering what it would be like to jump off my balcony (36th floor) a voice came in my into my head that said, “ just meditate.”  Wtf was that? So I started even before I quit drinking. Every morning. Day 1 = 1 minute, day2 = 2min. Etc. until up to day 60. Somewhere In there I quit drinking and entered AA, for additional support. I’ve backed off to 30 min a day after a few months, but the practice remains my anchor even more so than AA. And gotten me through this COVID pause in AA  meetings. I highly recommend “Mind Illuminated”. 
   While quitting there were wild swings in emotion. The terrors if quitting seem so real and justified. I remember thoughts such as:
— my life will suck now, because all the fun is gone
— I will lose all my friends
— I will be half the man I was 
—-I am a loser cuz I can’t do what most of my peers can do

Etc etc

It took a while but daily meditation , just by focusing on my breath, stabilized my mind enough to know and deeply feel the truth that those thoughts are all mind-developed lies caused by the addiction. It all meshed very well with much of what AA teaches. AA and meditation work well together. But meditation is my anchor.

This has been one of the toughest years of my life. I decided to quit drinking cold turkey one year ago and haven't had any alcohol. I also quit smoking 6 months ago.

I am surrounded by constant stressors; my crazy mother-in-law lives next door, living in a construction zone, husband dealing with depression and wanting to change career paths, and my loud, loud children who are home because of the Corona virus.

I have wanted to drink so many times. I wanted to literally drown myself in alcohol like that scene with the priest in the movie Constantine. 

Now I don't want to ever drink again.

For some reason, all of this doesn't make me feel strong. I feel ashamed and mostly alone. My husband and all of our friends still drink regularly, and the social isolation is strong. I now realize that I used alcohol as a social lubricant because I am extremely shy. I am still trying to find a new ""normal"", and trying to find enjoyment in a sober life.

I was nervous about the airport, not about the Rona.. but because the airport is a major trigger for me. Vacation to me used to mean a week wasted.. starting in the airport. I LOVED getting fucked up in the airport. Or at least I thought I did. My first destination was the closest bar.. no matter the hour, how long my layover, or the price of drinks. In reality I spent my entire vacation feeling like shit. Either drunk acting a fool or hungover wanting to die. 

This time is different. I’m visiting a friend in California (who also doesn’t drink, which helps so so much) and I’ve had the best vacation- one that I can actually remember, despite the shutdowns. It’s more clear than ever that alcohol never made things better. If anything it stole from the enjoyment of a trip. I’m hyper aware of my surroundings now, soaking in the experience unlike I ever have. I wake up refreshed and ready to explore. I don’t cringe looking at pictures that should have been epic but really just showed a sick drunk with a pretty background. I’m patient and carefree. I can stop, reflect and be completely at peace, without wondering how I’ll get my next drink. It’s incredibly empowering. 

It was not easy to get here. I won’t lie and say it’s a piece of cake to see people out drinking. I still get nostalgic about my drinking days, the difference now is that I have seen how life can be and nothing (I mean nothing) will take this newfound freedom away from me. Those “good times” drinking are nothing compared to the self awareness and confidence I have gained. And in reality, they probably weren’t “good times” anyways- alcohol has a funny way of lying to you like that.

Today marks the six-month anniversary since I got my first real foothold in sobriety. I don't have six solid months (yet), and my badge reflects the number of days since my last drink, but I do consider today to be my six month anniversary.

After months and months of reading books and blogs, listening to podcasts, watching YouTube videos, lurking here, and countless day ones (many of them unfinished), and just a smattering of day twos and threes, on February 2 of this year I had a successful day one. And then a day two. On day four, which felt like a goddamn miracle and like I might *finally* be getting somewhere, I got a badge and started doing the Daily Check In.  

The love and support and encouragement I found here was, and is indescribably wonderful. In those early days when I was so, so low, newly sober and coming out of a bad breakup, to have people get genuinely excited for me for reaching a week, or ten days, and to encourage me when I was down, truly gave me the boost I needed to keep going.  And it had been a very long time since I had felt so Not Alone.  It still overwhelms me and makes my heart overflow.  And just as important is that I was able to offer love, support, encouragement and understanding in return.  My mind and body began to heal with the removal of alcohol, but my broken heart and soul began to heal with the addition of SD and this community. 

Then 40 days in, Covid became very real, and my anxiety just skyrocketed.  I lost my job, and plans were canceled and life as we all knew it changed dramatically and suddenly. You all remember. I rationalized drinking “just this once” because I just could not bear what I was feeling. What could it hurt? I had just done 40 days, and I’d just get right back to being sober the next day. But as so many of you know from your own experiences, it did hurt. A lot. I drank for 10 days straight, shocked and horrified at how quickly I had returned to the exact same place, and terrified that I wouldn’t be able to get out again. One of the things that troubled me the most was feeling that I had lost SD and the people here. How could I face these people who had believed in me so much? They would be so disappointed in me for my failure. Especially the regulars over in the DCI. I didn’t know if I could face it, and I truly felt like I had lost the most valuable resource I had, and that I had lost this uplifting love that I desperately needed. But in the early morning of what would have been the eleventh day, lying in bed, hungover, it was almost like a voice popped into my head saying, “just tell them.  That’s what they are there for.  They can help you through this, and they will.”  That day became another day one.  And when I reset my badge and returned to the check in, I was welcomed back with nothing but the same love and compassion and understanding that had always been there for me. 

I started racking up days again, and making more friends here, giving and receiving love and encouragement along the way.  I even hosted the DCI one week.  But then as I came very near to day 90, it happened again. That overwhelming need to escape what I was feeling brought on by a painful and confusing encounter with my ex. Once again, I found myself in the dark despair of that old cycle.  And this time the sense of failure was even worse. How could I come back here? I had hosted the DCI, and had almost 90 days, what would everyone think of me? But when I did poke my head up, there were a handful of people who I had come to know as friends who responded almost immediately, and again with overwhelming love, compassion and grace. And once again, the DCI was just happy to see me back. 

Twice now the people here have picked me up when I’ve fallen and held my hand as I got back on track. And I know with certainty that without that, I wouldn’t be sober now. 

I want to leave off with a message to anyone who has stumbled, or is currently stumbling. Know that no matter how many days you had before, or how long you’ve been away, just come back to us as fast as you can.  We will not be angry, or think less of you, or be disappointed in you.  We will just be glad you are back, and we will help you brush yourself off, hold your hand, and cheer you on as you continue on the journey. You are not alone, and you never will be.

Alcohol was such a routine that, in the first few months of being AF, I once had a few ounces of champagne because I was at a party, someone handed it to me, and I was on auto pilot. When I realized it, I immediately stopped but that whole night was conscious of how it made me feel (anxious, yep, I wanted tons more).  I was told at the time by a “professional” I didn’t fit a classic definition of an alcoholic, but let’s just say I was drinking to numb emotional pain, it was hurting me in so many ways and I had trouble trying to moderate. My therapist kept saying “ 1 or two is fine” if I ever brought up I was worried about my drinking. He didn’t see my problem. ugh!  Had hung out here long enough to see what was ahead, I saw how trouble moderating is common. It was all just too stressful so joined y’all on the AF train and so happy I did. Alcoholism runs in my family, I struggle with depression, somehow I had the “a-ha” moment and realized it wasn’t helping me, and I didn’t need the permission or even encouragement from my therapist to stop. Duh! 

Anyway, I didn’t drink more that night after the champagne and haven’t since. But back to title, Last night I had a dream that nearly the same thing happened.

The previous month I had not drank a drop because I knew I had to get control of this thing but in the final days before the big trip I started slipping back into it, starting out with some beers in the evening, and getting to the point where I couldn't face the day without downing a few glasses of wine or tall cans in the morning. Long story short, I was escorted out of the airport by the police and had to miss my flight to Europe, the police officer had to console my waiting girlfriend on the phone, and my friends tried to contact me to see what the hell was going on to no avail, as I had passed out upon my arrival at home.   


It was a low point. I felt like an absolute loser and I felt like ending it that night. The next few days were hell on my psyche as I thought of every failure to get this beast under control, every person I insulted with my loose lips and boorish behaviour, and the love of my life who had to find out from a police officer that I wouldn't be seeing her after 6 months in isolation.

But today I woke up next to her in Europe and realized how lucky I am and that my beliefs that no one cares about me and the world is a horrible place were wrong. For one, the police did not arrest me despite my aggressive behaviour, they even drove me home. Two, I managed to drop my passport in the LOBBY of my apartment on the way back and a stranger was kind enough to return it. I could have dropped that anywhere else along the way and things would have been that much worse. Three, my sister called me multiple times per day to talk me through my feelings and help me gain some sort of perspective, along with a number of friends who also reached out with love and support. Four, my sister sat on the phone with the airlines for hours to book me a new flight two days later and managed to start the process of refunding my original ticket. Five, I was finally able to reach out to my 8 years sober roommate who I had been shy to talk to about my issues.  


I could think of many more, but I'm sure you all have things to do today, one of them being NOT DRINK!

It was nerve wracking in the moment but it passed. Then I felt like I had nothing to do with my hands but then that passed as well. It seems the longer I stay sober the easier it becomes. All the previous experiences of not drinking helped me get through the pressure I had tonight.

The amount of money my friends spend on alcohol. The way they act after a few drinks. The ridiculousness of how my friend lets her kids try a sip of her alcohol. I’m a whole new person now.

2020-08-02 07:00:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/i2a9sw/finding_life_6_months_alcohol_free/,Finding Life: 6 months alcohol free,"In 6 months, I have spent a lot of time in reflection. The path I wore down during my time drinking is a path I am pushing myself to never use again. It was my habitual patterns that crushed my ability to live in the way that I am meant to. I destroyed my time with my family. I spent my time in activity I am not proud of. But in the end, I was able to face that shitty existence and lean into a fear that was so pronounced because of booze. That fear of learning to do the right thing, the hard thing, and not doing what is easy and readily in front of me. That fear of actually pushing myself to work on something that is meaningful to me. To not allow myself excuses. To face my fear and self-sabotage and anger and my doubt in becoming the person I know I am capable of being. 

This is what I work on every day. I show up to do the things that I know I am capable of doing. I understand that this is the only chance I have at life. That if I waste it by not pushing myself, I am not only hurting myself, I am depriving everyone around me of my gifts. I am not saying this to satisfy a bloated ego. I have no idea if any contribution I make will accomplish some great good. But I will know that I tried. I will know that I put my heart into my work for once. That I did not shy away like a scared little boy afraid of the microphone. I have run from that microphone my entire life and I can’t let myself do it any longer. Whether anyone listens, is not a decision I get to make. 

I will show up today. I will put in my effort today. I will sit down at 9 AM no matter what and write these shitty words that pop into my head with no excuses, no apologies, and zero fucks given, as my friend likes to say. I know that by showing up, I am putting in my time. I am facing down and staring through the Resistance just one more day. You know the Resistance, the self-sabotage, the fear, the self-doubt, the procrastination that tries to derail you when what you truly want to do sits in front of you. The Resistance is weaponized to destroy your will to do what is important to you. I won’t let it get me. Just for today. The words may come out wonky, but they will be written. They will have meaning. 

This isn’t so much a journey of being alcohol free as it is a journey of pursuing my life’s work. The longer I go, the more I believe that this is what is keeping me from thinking about booze. Yes, I stopped drinking first, but quitting alcohol has become a byproduct of focusing my mind on what truly matters. It’s not finding some thing to take my mind off alcohol. It’s knowing the thing that scares me the most and putting all of my Power Ranger strength into it to pursue it, is what makes me want to truly LIVE. This is the moment I know there is nothing in life that I ever want to do to take away from this person I am and this person I am becoming. 

I can finally see the man in the mirror that I want to look at. No more grimacing. No more pain. No more wishing I was someone different. No more burying any feeling of guilt and shame with booze. Instead letting these words air out on these pages. This is where my thoughts live. And this is where they will continue to live. 

SD, I owe you a mountain of gratitude. This is a place I have been able to come for the last 6 months to air my problems and my victories. My newfound love for life that didn’t exist with alcohol.

I, for one, had a tough long run yesterday. It was 8 miles - not the furthest I’ve run and not even the furthest I’ve run in recent time. Heck, my long run last week was 10 miles so I went into this run believing it’d be cake.   

Ladies and gentlemen, there was no cake. There was chocolate flavored gel which is a sad and sorry standin for cake. From miles 1-5 or so, things were the cake I expected them to be. I’m trying to hit an average mile pace of 8:55 and I was more or less hitting it. But mile 5-7 came much much harder. I hit a wall and was suddenly totally gassed out. The gel Id eaten and the caffeine electrolyte drink I washed it down with were roiling in my guts and I wondered if I’d finally be inducted into that lofty group of runners who shat themselves mid run. No such luck. But the stomach  cramps were unpleasant, my leg began tightening up and that sucked, I was hot, tired, slow, and ready to be done with 3 miles still left to go.   

I did make it through, in the end we all do make it through, and it got me thinking about Failure. WAS that a failed run? I absolutely didn’t hit an 8:55 average. More like 9:34. I am a hopeless optimist, however, and believe that if you can learn from a thing - really learn and use it as a tool to become better then there IS no such thing as Failure.   

So what did I learn? An 8:55 average is too aggressive for where my endurance is right now. I need to slow the fuck down on my other runs and quit cowboying around at 9 minute paces at shorter distances. It’s giving me a false sense of fitness. that’s fine if all I want is to run a faster 5k but it won’t hold up in a half or full marathon. I also need to eat more. 8 miles is about where I need actual breakfast (even just half an English muffin) and I didn’t eat anything but coffee and a stroopwafel. Pile on caffeine mid run and you are playing with poop fire.  

How about you guys? How was your week? How are your fitness goals (if any) going? Tell me where you’ve been and tell me where you’re going.

You know how if you were put in charge of a child, your pet, someone else’s pet, or an elderly relative you would make damn sure they’re well fed, clean, and have a reasonable bed time? 

I realized I never “took care” of myself when I drank. I figured “eh I’m fine.” Well looking back, I was definitely not okay - my mind and body were screaming out for someone to take care of them.

But now I treat myself like I’m babysitting myself - because, well duh, I am! Even when I don’t feel like it, I make myself brush my teeth, drink enough water, exercise my body in whatever way feels good, have cut off toxic people, eat nourishing food, deal with anxiety in healthy ways, honor my feelings instead of drowning them... because that’s what I would do for someone else.

We say “take care of yourself!” in passing all the time but sobriety taught me the literal meaning of the phrase.

In my early sobriety I missed the crazy chaotic late night ragers because that was fun to me, but there’s so much more beauty in just having a healthy day and seeking healthy experiences.

Last year on June 29th I made a final decision to stop drinking and get more help. I went to AA and was also introduced to the SMART recovery programme. Both helped me a lot in my early recovery.
I also gave up smoking in August. 
I stayed sober until early March this year, when I went to visit a friend in Birmingham and all bets were off. I used 'what happens in Birmingham, stays in Birmingham' as an excuse to have half a bottle of prosecco and a few cigarettes. Nothing dramatic, but had my friend not wanted to go to bed after that I could definitely have gone on.
After that and due to the lockdown and me being sick of online meetings for work I found online AA meetings really boring. I was part of a few WhatsApp groups of my local meetings but muted them quickly. It all got a bit too much.
I kept doing online SMART recovery meetings though.
I didn't drink again until early July when I visited the same friend again, same excuse. Well, actually this time it was 'even in a diet, you need a cheat day'. We were three friends this time and shared a small bottle of vodka. Unless the first time in March, this time I was pretty drunk. But, the bottle was empty and we weren't getting more, so water I had.
I couldn't sleep well all night, had a headache for almost a week and just generally felt off.
Both times I mentioned the incidents in the SMART meetings I attended and started playing with the thought that maybe now, I could possibly start moderating of some kind.
Yesterday, I met a friend I hadn't seen for almost a decade. I looked forward to it and to possibly having a couple of drinks. For old times sake. Then he tells me he doesn't drink anymore. Perfect! But, I still go ahead and order a vodka coke. I am pretty tipsy/drunk from it and text a friend I used to drink with and plan, after I part from the other friend, to go and have a quiet drink or two on my own with a couple of cigarettes before going home to my (probably worried) partner and puppy.
I get on the train to go across town and it's a train that would also go to my home stop (sometimes they don't stop there or go a different route). First sign that I should just go home. I get off where I planned to get off though. I walk past the pub I plan to go to to get cigarettes. My card declines when tapping for payment, I have to use my pin. Second sign that I probably shouldn't do this. There is a short queue for the pub and I'm already feeling uneasy. They're full anyways! I light a cigarette and walk back towards the train station and make the next train home.
I already started feeling off, probably still a bit drunk, when I got home and a headache started setting in.
I didn't sleep well and still am having a headache. I finally reset my sober dates for alcohol and cigarettes on my I am sober app because I'm just done. No moderating, if even one drink and cigarette makes me feel like shit I just dun wan et! IWNDWYT",6,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9980423450469971}"

Crashed a scooter, skinned my knee, ruined my best pants, and got in a yelling match with my now-ex.

Now, I live in a beautiful home with a yoga studio, am well-respected at my new restaurant and considered The Reliable One, just bought a new vehicle after six years of public transportation, enjoy meaningful conversations with friends and family, and show up in my life in a new and real way.

His panic attacks started the day he returned to work, since he didn’t drink that day. He’s telling me now, he just needs a few drinks so it stops happening because it’s from going cold turkey, but my body physically recoils when I hear him say that. He says he wants to stop until he can start drinking “normally” again, but he has drank everyday for 14 years which I do not consider normal. I offered to stop drinking with him, as I am a social drinker and probably drink too much with him and friends when we have company over. It’s not me to say “never drink again or I’ll leave” but I can’t stand to see him do this to himself, and I can’t worry about when the next time will be and if it will be worse. Btw, he is only 28 years old and we have a small child as well. It’s not just about his health now, which is a MAJOR concern, but also his health long term. Thanks for any advice.

We met up and drank our coffees as we walked around the park. It was such an easy rapport from the minute we met, and we had honest and funny conversations about how and why we got sober. I’ve never met a fellow sober person before (now that I’ve stopped drinking) and there is just something so genuine about how we spoke to each other. No small talk. I hate small talk.

Then I met up with my cousin and friend and had lunch. After, I walked home alone in the rain listening to the Soberful podcast. I got soaked, but I smiled the whole way.

Came home, got changed into my comfy clothes and have been watching Breaking Bad all night. I’ve eaten 5 fruit ice pops but I don’t even care. I made it through another day without drinking. 

This time last year, this particular day, I blacked out at 4pm at a pregame for the pride parade. I woke up the next day with so much alcohol induced self-loathing and anxiety.

Daily check in.

Spent the evening at a bar watching the sports with a pal. Drank some non alcoholic beers. Had a few cravings but overall felt in control. Hung out with a friend who also doesn't drink. It was nice to be myself and not have to be my drunk self around a friend and it be normal. Not sure I'm making sense.

With each passing day I'm learning more about myself and now reality is setting in. I'm sorry to be a downer but sh*t. I just checked my bank statements from January to now and realised I have spent a lot of money. An amount to make me feel sick. Not saying it was all on booze but most of the past 7 months I have been extremely drunk. I spent all my savings. Everything. I feel so ashamed of myself. I spent the last 3 years building a business from the ground up that went from zero profit to a fairly strong income. This is my reality setting in. I wasn't thinking clearly whilst bound to the alcohol. I didn't realize what I had done until it was too late.

If you are thinking about quitting and are lurking. Just do it. 

I'm going to try and do better. I'm literally here at rock bottom about to attempt to build my business back up and get my savings to where they were again. I'm sharing this because I want you to know the level of damage drinking can contribute too. It's a real thing. I won't let you guys down or myself down again. I promise.

Anyway, I drove past a pub. The sun was shining and it was absolutely rammed with people sat in the sunshine, drinking. They all looked like they were having a great time and I had a fleeting moment of envy. 

I drove further up the road and there was a group of about 4 people walking, I presume from the pub, judging by them stumbling and not walking in a straight line. Just as I passed, a young woman in the group fell backwards, straight into a bush. Her friends were trying to help her up but she was really struggling. 

In that instant my envy disappeared and I was thankful for being sober today. As undoubtedly, the girl falling in the bush would have been me. A mess and making a fool of myself.

I feel great that I've managed to come this far after struggling with alcohol abuse for years.

However, I've noticed a personality trait within myself that is making me doubt that I was ever an alcoholic. 

Allow me to explain my reasoning. When I was drinking, I would go very hard. I would have an all or nothing approach - if I bought a crate of beer, I wouldn't stop until the crate had gone. If i was going out for drinks, I wouldn't stop until I couldn't drink any more. Eventually, I began drinking on my own and started to drink throughout the day. It was at this point that I realised I had to stop; it was having a serious effect on my functionality and, in short, I could see that I was becoming an irrational and irratic drunk. 

This confused me. Although I always liked to drink heavily, I was guilty and ashamed that I had become a drunk. I didn't understand how this could happen, but presumed that my drinking had snowballed over the years and finally got out of control.

Now, instead of abusing alcohol, I abuse food. I eat horrendously. When I used to sit down in the evening and demolish of a crate of beer, now I'll binge eat 4 donuts and a tub of Ben and Jerry's. This is exactly the same behavioural trait that I had with alcohol, the only difference being that the effects of abusing alcohol had more consequences (hangovers, lost days) than abusing donuts.

To get to the point, I think that my abuse of alcohol is actually part of a wider personality trait where I simply cannot moderate things that are bad for me. I used to smoke 40 cigarettes a day too, and had to stop cold turkey. I wonder that if i can get to the bottom of why I abuse these various vices, I would then be able to live a life of moderation and stop the abuse. I feel like I've just swapped one vice for another - who knows what's next after junk food!

Tldr; I used to abuse alcohol and cigarettes but now i abuse junk food and so I think that my problem is actually that I can't moderate anything  - I didn't specifically have an alcohol problem.",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9952907562255859}"

The exeriment lasts 30 days and at the end you evaluate how you feel. I've been on and off the wagon more times than I care to count in this last year and a half. This time around, I've equipped myself with tools to help aid my desire to retire from drinking. Part of it is daily journaling to help me reflect. 


Today's chapter was on setbacks and moving forward. 


Annie talks about how if a setback happens, it is important that, ""you relax and dont beat yourself up. It doesnt mean that you're an 'incurable addict' or a bad person. And it certainly doesnt mean you're beyond hope. All it means that you are human"". 


It took me at least a year and a half to feel confident in my decision to not drink. Before, I could always find a reason or I could give it up for just long enough to think to myself, ""see you dont have a problem, you can stop for x amount of time"" or I would congratulate myself for not drinking at work (even though it was okay) and just drink when I got home and I would more often than not drink enough to have a hangover in the morning. 


Those little breaks from alcohol did help me. Instead of drinking every night it was less frequent, then maybe a few times throughout the week. Those breaks from alcohol are what lead me to my decision that I am better off without it. I cant moderate and it doesnt bring me joy.

I’d shared with my fam my struggles with alcohol and then ended up talking with them while drunk the other night. I’m sure they knew. Now I feel even worse. I was trying to prove to a friend that I was doing better and had changed, but blew that up while drinking too. 

What is it going to take? I’m so tired of this. I have every reason in the book to stop, and plenty of carnage to cite. I am wasting my life. The only one as me as I am right now that I have. I’m ruining my life. I’m throwing away my life. I want to believe I’m a person with lots to give, but I’m just taking. 

In this dissolution of a relationship I realize how much wrong I’ve done and how much destruction I’ve caused through my drinking. It’s a miracle she held out for so long. But enough is enough and she’s reached that point. I’m mourning the loss deeply. I know I just kind of heard it and pushed it away and I have no doubt that it bubbling back up when I had a moment to chill was part of the reason I drank. Why can’t I be that person who wants to “prove people wrong” and be a person who’s better and makes the other wonder why they left me at all? Instead I just self destruct more and more. 

I guess I need to be more active in my sobriety. Find some solutions to the problem and be proactive too. I’ve read so many books, have so many books, have so many workbooks, listened to so many podcasts, but it’s just not clicking. I’m in therapy. Just signed up for addiction specific therapy, but then ignored it completely. Guess it’s time to get active again. But sometimes, in a totally messed up way, the more I work on my sobriety the more I think about drinking and the more I drink. Wtf.

Thanks for readying. I’m open to any thoughts or suggestions, or just some support. Maybe this will be the time. I’ve lost myself through all this active addiction. I’d like to find the real me, I know he’s in there. Better late than never eh?",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984884262084961}"

I've been a binge drinker for about 5 years, either weekly or every other week, with a few smatterings of 1-5 month breaks in between just to fool myself into thinking I wasn't an alcoholic.

I had a really bad night about two weeks ago, woke up, wasn't sure where I was, had a horrible hangover, confusion, anxiety, sensitivity to light, the usual stuff.  Not a big deal for me, typically.

But for some reason, this time I just haven't gotten much better.  I typically feel ""ready to drink"" by about day 4 after a binge, but this time I just never started feeling better.

My head is foggy, my vision is sensitive to light still, I feel different somehow.  I think my blood sugar is doing weird things, perhaps my blood pressure, too.  My anxiety is through the roof, I keep thinking I've done permanent brain damage to myself.  I'm on antibiotics because the severe dehydration probably gave me some kind of sinus infection that night.  The headaches have gotten better, but that's all.  I still have diarrhea twice a day, not a solid poop since.  I'm having visual snow and neurological symptoms, too.  It's all so weird.

Has anyone else done this? Here is the one I formulated for anyone who needs help to make the start. Its a good starting place if you want to adjust it for your personal journey. It is as follows:

(not included are the list of activities I personally could do instead of drinking, would highly recommend you add your own)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Notes

* First 48 hours are most difficult
* Can take about 3 months for cravings to go away
* Can take about 6 months to quit thinking about drinking
* Think of cravings like a teary child who wants candy. If you don't give in, they eventually stop crying.

Mantra

“My drinking held me back from reaching my full potential, so I quit. Maybe I’ll drink again some day, but not until I get to where I want to be in life. Until then, I can’t afford to drink. I mean this not in the financial sense, but in the opportunity cost.”

What sober people notice/know

* Alcohol weakens social ability more than it enhances it
* Alcohol keeps you from learning how to deal with emotions
* Sobriety gives you an edge mentally; a significant advantage in every area because I don’t drink. The only way this advantage would erode is if everyone stopped drinking.

Overall Benefits

* No hangovers
* Saved money
* Eat less
* Appreciation for everything develops (i.e. not anxiously waiting through something until I can drink)
* Confidence improves
* Liver can heal itself, if allowed to
* Several cancer risks lower
* Improved relationships
* Improved sex life
* Improved sleep, deeper sleep
* Improved immune function
* Wake up feeling refreshed and in a good mood
* Ton more time for constructive things

One week sober

* Deeper sleep, resulting in physical/mental energy increases
* Skin hydration restores
* Skin conditions improve

One month sober

* Liver fat reduces by 15%, increasing ability to filter toxins
* Reduction in belly fat
* Most significant skin improvements by this time

One year sober

* Should lose about 13 pounds of belly fat
* Insane amount of money saved",2,"{'quarantine': 1, 'immun': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6373873949050903}"

**Story, skip to bottom if the details don't matter -** My good friend called me around 1AM from outside her house saying she had lost her keys and couldn't figure out how to get in and asked if she could come to my place. I of course said she could, and she responded ""ok, thanks. I'm gonna walk to your place,"" then abruptly hung up. She lives about a 15 minute walk away from me, and while I didn't think it was a good idea for her to walk alone I don't have my license (because of a DUI) and had no other choice.

My first mistake was seriously underestimating her level of drunkenness. She sounded drunk on the phone, but not like black out stumbling drunk. Anyway, I get a facetime from her about 5 minutes later and she is crying and saying she is lost (she has been to my place a million times), and her phone is pointed mostly at the road. I spend the next few minutes asking her to point the phone at her surroundings so I can figure out where she is. I finally see a sign that catches my eye, and eventually get her to hold the phone still long enough for me to figure out where she is. I tell her to stay there, and hop on my bike to go find her.

She calls me again, and has since walked somewhere else and I don't know where she is. She hangs up, and won't answer my calls... so I end up riding to the place I knew last and riding around the blocks trying to find her. I eventually found her, and walked her to my house with my bike. She had lost her purse and only had her phone and mask. She was fully leaning on me the entire way. Holy hell, that was a long and grueling walk.

I got her home and on my couch, gave her water, and waited for her to fall asleep. During all of this her boyfriend (who was stuck about 45 minutes away) has been calling me freaking out, and she also stumbled outside pushing me away trying to walk home.

**What I am grateful for and learned from this experience -** 

First and foremost I am grateful that I was sober and awake to answer her calls, if I hadn't been she probably would have been wandering through the streets alone and drunk.

I'm grateful I got to be a good friend and was there for her when she needed me.

I'm grateful that nothing went wrong when she was walking alone. I truly shudder to think that if she had ran into the wrong person they could have taken advantage of her or even abducted her.

What I learned- I should have immediately gotten on my bike and ridden to her place, locked it up there, and then walked home with her. I'm kicking myself thinking ""stupid! selfish!"" for letting her walk alone.

I'm a little shaken up from the whole experience; I spent some time in a panic, furiously peddling through the neighborhood trying to spot her in the middle of the night.

This made me remember the times that I was too drunk to get myself home; The time I woke up in the hospital getting my stomach pumped because I had passed out on the side of the road and a stranger called an ambulance, the times I woke up with bruises and no recollection of where I had been, the times I woke up on strangers couches or even beds.

It's scary to think of all that could have gone wrong tonight, and all that could have gone wrong the many times I was in similar situations. I sit here reflecting, and wishing this stupid drug didn't have such control over our lives. I couldn't wake my roomie up to drive me because she was passed out drunk. I called my best guy friend to help me, but he was probably passed out drunk. Not to mention the fact that my friend was with her SISTER and several other friends who just left her alone because they were also too drunk to deal with her. 

What a fucking mess. Alcohol is poison, and it is dangerous. I don't want to give it the power to potentially ruin my life anymore.

**But tonight I am sober...** and that made all the difference. All in all, I helped someone I love and I'm so grateful she is safe.",9,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990010857582092}"

I've been trying to quit drinking for like three years. My longest stretch was about three months. After each episode I made new rules and eventually got to a very ""functional"" place which means, at this current ruleset: No hard liquor ever, 2 beer max in public, 3 beer max weeknights alone, 6 beer max on weekends alone, no alcohol on Sundays. But I still wake up and feel like shit every day. I still have high anxiety and depression. I still neglect self care. I still barely eat or sleep. I still spend money that should be going to improving my life on alcohol. I still amass a dragons hoard of empty beer cans in my room that I can't even look at much less clean up. And OF COURSE I still end up going out to break my ""rules"" half the damn week. I'm not throwing back handles of old crow anymore, but I'm still out of control. There is no functional alcoholism. It's the worst trick I've ever played on myself. Using it, I've maneuvered my life into yet again another golden opportunity that I get to yet again watch myself squander in slow motion until I eventually say fuck it and have to start over. But this one is going towards my biggest goal I've ever had. 18 years of my 35 years have been spent putting together an artistic body of work that because of drinking I've never been able to pursue. At this point I have dozens of paintings, 15 coloring books, an infinity of illustrations, and an 800 piece apparel line. I quit my job as an agricultural consultant and got a job as a screen printer. If I do this right, my wildest fucking dream could work out. And I'm sitting here, literally holding the dream, and watching it drown in alcohol and depression YET AGAIN. It has to be today or it won't ever happen. I can't lose this opportunity. I have early onset rheumatoid now and literally can't go back to farming. If this doesn't work I'm going to end up on disability or working in a fucking call center or something. It has to be today. This has to work. Please. Today, please.

I'd stopped drinking two or three days prior and stumbled upon a post here about dry July and decided to sign up.  I'd already made the pledge to myself not to drink and I feel like attempting the dry July would help me be accountable.

So far my results are pleasant:

Better sleep (I wear an Oura ring and have the stats to prove it, but I've gone from perhaps 3-4 minutes of deep sleep each night to well over an hour.  REM sleep has also improved and I remember most of my dreams).

I've lost close to 10 pounds (I still have at least 30 to go, but this is a wonderful start).

My blood pressure has gone from an average of 140/90 to 116/17.  I am on blood pressure medicine and will continue to monitor this and eventually have my doctor adjust my level.

My resting heart rate (while sleeping ) has gone from 78 down to 55.  That is amazing!

In the beginning I was having some pretty bad urges to drink, but my commitment to dry July and my daily visits to SD have really helped.  Last night, a waft of aroma from my husband's Scotch drifted past me and it was the first time it really turned me off.  Prior to this, it would have made me crave my own glass of bourbon.

Every attempt was a good thing as I learned a little bit of new information about myself. But I’ve now realised it’s my best friends I need to avoid, and I need to go to AA again even though I’m not a god follower but I want to be surrounded by drunks and addicts and talk it out at least for the first 90 days.  In that time I want to form some exercise and diet habits and also start to get some new activities into my routine which I enjoy and above all involve no alcohol. 

Anyways I’m a binge drinker, usually go a week of hardcore saucing and then die for 3 days, get my life really well put together for a few days and repeat. I drank for 7 days recently and drank so much that I woke up with severe shakes, heart palpitations, couldn’t breathe properly, the sweats, anxiety, slight one second hallucinations etc.  I but the bullet and got my friend to call a rehab. Called my GP who advised to keep drinking and get a friend to help me taper down so as not to take a seizure. I was drinking like 15-20 drinks a day of all Types of booze. 

I’m now in a good place but reluctant to go to rehab hence why I mentioned AA. I’m only on day 5 but I know this time this is it. If I go to rehab I have to fuck my business up and my gigs as I’m a singer.  But if I relapse this time I’m going in to rehab head first. 

Anyways it’s gonna be hard but I think avoiding all my drinking pals for a few months and trying to form new friends to talk to is key.

Zoning out to something is really all I could do - once the alcohol was flowing I had zero motivation to do anything, I could barely even play video games because it required too much of me. I’d wake up in the middle of the night like a zombie and stumble into my bedroom, and wake up feeling like a POS just a few hours later. And that was a weeknight. 

If it was a weekend and I woke up in the middle of the night, whether that was midnight or 3am, I would start drinking again. I would drink until my booze was gone, so sometimes the sun would come up. I did “love” the feeling of drinking in the silence of early morning, but I despised the feeling of seeing the sun come up which kind of told me “funs over pal”, but I wouldn’t listen and just drink till I passed out again. So many Saturday’s and Sunday’s ruined this way. At the worst of times, I’d sleep for a few hours after I finished my booze and when I woke up, since the day was already ruined, I’d go out and get more and basically repeat the whole cycle. It makes me so sad to remember and write about those times. 

Lately I’ve been living my new best life. Unless I can find something interesting to watch, it’s just not enough for me anymore to hold my attention. I’m so busy now doing random things around my place, researching stuff or or working on fun projects.

It’s Saturday and I woke up fresh, laid in bed for a bit, swiping around on my phone. I have a whole day planned ahead of me. And it just feels so nice.

I met up with a friend who I haven't seen in a long time and there was so much to talk about, and we knew drinking was gonna be involved but we just kept buying drinks for each other and talking. But I haven't drunk anything more a glass of wine in at least 6 months (pre covid). Anyone from the UK knows that Wetherspoons is the number 1 pub for cheap drinks. Ended up having 2 cocktail pitchers and 2 shots there. I was coherent, talking fine walking fine, having a great time, we walked for 20 mins or so from the pub to the park. Until we stopped at a supermarket and bought some more alcohol, I got a bottle of beer and a bottle of wine. Was drinking over about 5 hours and then i get thru the beer, we keep getting up and sitting back down, and i honestly feel fine. Don't even get through half the bottle of wine, mid conversation happily chatting away, and then from there bam mid conversation my memory is just blank.

&#x200B;

My guess was that I fell unconscious while sat down to justify the complete lack of memory but that wasn't the case, I was actually conscious and somehow did all of the following: told my friend I couldn't walk with my shoes on, used my phone to call my family, took photos and videos with my friend, my friend gave me her shoes to walk up to the entrance of the park to get picked up, threw  up in the car all over the back seat, was laid down on my side in the recovery position, they called 111 (the UK sort of emergency hotline that precedes 999) and they said I'd have to go into hospital if I didn't improve, couldn't even speak a word, and was ushered into my parent's house. I have NO recollection of any of this. The next thing I remember is about five hours later still vomiting into a bucket and shaking. I then slept for 13 hours. I now feel like shit and have a really awful sore throat.

It was 30 degrees C out yesterday and I didn't drink any water which I actually usually do but I was so preoccupied w the conversation we were having and enjoying myself that I just kept drinking.

Just a sequence of digits or letters on a screen. 

Happens to be the total of the numbers 1-36. Is also known for number of the beast in the Christian Bible Book of Revelations. A beast from hell. 

I’ve lived through hell these in these days. I struggled so hard to quit drinking. I broke time and time again. Each time I had to go through the withdrawals. I had all the symptoms worse and worse each time. Finally I was able to set it down and walk away for what I hope is forever. I never did like being drunk or hungover. I have no desire to even have it in my home. For the most part. People have respected that.  

October 2018 I started counting the days. I ate whatever I wanted when I wanted because of the missing calories from the alcohol can cause a lot of issues. For some reason I got sicker as time went on. Then we realized early 2019 that this may be celiac disease. Adjusted our diets to vegan and moved forward with healing and love. The quiet and happiness lasted only months. Then there was a shift. I was better, but my big, wild, strong husband started deteriorating in front of my eyes. We initially thought he had an injury from a workout or because he drove truck. It was treated as an injury until we got the scans two months later and it showed that his previous diagnosis had spread and grown into a tumor on the base of his spine. Pinching off nerves and making it very painful for him. So he decided to follow the allopathic protocol for radiation treatments. That gave us a bit of time. 

I had hoped we’d grow old and I’d bury him when he was in his 90’s. He’d die out there on his trapline in the woods. He would sit down for a snack and a sippa tea. Then just quietly leave this world while watching the snow fall with a bundle of rabbits or foxes in the bag beside him. 

We didn’t get that ending. 

We got 9 months. The amount of time it requires for a baby to take root in his mother’s belly and grow 10 perfect little fingers and toes. To be strong enough to live outside in loving arms of parents.

In that time. We lived, loved and stayed as close as we possibly could together. I was soaking up his presence. His warmth. I could feel his strength waning. I tried to feed him my life force time and time again. He always shut me out. 

He got sicker and  the world locked down in pandemic mode. He left this world in the middle of May and the restrictions started lifting. We weren’t able to have a funeral. 10 of us were able to gather for a viewing before his cremation. Tomorrow marks 77 days since he died.

I never even thought about drinking in the moments and days after he left me. I knew the price of love is pain, but I wasn’t expecting to lose my ability to walk, thought process, couldn’t and still can’t tolerate silence. I’m not alone in my pain or my grief. Many people stood with and loved us. So many tears were shed on his departure from this world. But I am standing alone. My hand reaches out in empty air for a hand that I’ll never hold again. I save up tidbits of my day for him specifically. His heavy urn fits perfectly in the pain and emptiness that he left me with. I hold him and pray he can see and hear how I’m evolving after him. He gave me so much love that the only thing I could do was better myself. Heal myself. Break cycles of violence & addiction. Our love was strong and crazy. Apparently people looked too us as a well set example of love. I could see that. He was damned near perfect. His only bad habits were chewing his nails, spitting them on the floor and crawling into bed with his outside clothes on. 

My journey isn’t about my addictions or mistakes. Mistakes are not life sentences. When one is made. Acknowledgement, apology and changed behaviour is the only acceptable attitude. I’ve learned being honest in all things gets you much further in everything. My journey is about me. My heart. My soul. My life. I’ve survived so much. My story is enough to make you cry.

Just knowing that other people also struggle and reading other people's experiences has helped me to figure out what the best approach is. 2 things stood out:

* how people respond to peer pressure and the overall attitude towards it
* the quote at the end of responses : IWNDWYT

I didn't touch alcohol for about a year now. I don't count the days because that gave me subconsciously the impression that it was finite. So I just stopped counting and said: I don't drink, period.

It's not that I had a severe substance abuse, but I am prone to addiction and when I drank, I just couldn't stop. And there were periods I drank daily until I released I was getting out of hand, then I drank less for a couple of weeks and then it became worse again. So I decided to stop. I took me 3 attempts to get were I am now and from every failed attempt I learned a lot.

1. I was afraid I needed alcohol to enjoy myself. But after a while I noticed i didn't need it, I was as fun to hang around with as I was drunk :). And my wife enjoyed me more.
2. If people act weird when you say you do not drink, I just flat out say that i am an alcoholic and it runs in the family. And don't show any shame in it. It shuts them up real quick. And in the end they sometimes even respect you for something that they know they could never do. Which gives an extra boost.
3. I identified the instigators : I live in Europe in a country where alcohol is part of the daily life. Beer is folklore here and we have some very good beers. So when you go out with friends, everybody drinks. Whenever I am around my 2 best friends, then it got very difficult to not drink even when they supported me. I solved this by finding some very tasty non-alcoholic beers that I make sure I have available whenever I meet my friends.

Just wanted to give my experience to those who struggle and my take-aways on how I handled things. Even if it could help just 1 or 2 people, I would be proud. If any body has any questions or needs support, feel free to contact me.

So, not quite sure where to begin so I will just dive in. I'm 43, male, and I like a drink. I don't really see the quantity that I drink as a problem, but when I had a health check up with my nurse, she was more than a little alarmed. So, gonna just, throw it out there. How much is a problem?

I don't drink every day, sometimes not even every week. if I am at home, I will likely have a friday night drink or if I go out, a friday night at the pub and a saturday at home or none at home. I have no problem going a while without drinking and have gone a month or more without any real concern. No major issues with my health other than a touch of 'fatty liver' which is likely more to diet that anything else. 

When I drink in the pub, it's usually 10 - 13 pints of lager. Been the same since I Was 18. I don't fall over, throw up or do anything stupid. I just drink, chat with the people I'm with, go home with some food, eat it and then go to sleep. The worst that happens might be I will fall asleep in my chair instead of bed, though that is rare. 

When I drink at home, it will be a dozen cans of lager or a bottle of Jack Daniels (occasionally both but that's rare). Usually 70cl, but occasionally a litre (Tennessee Honey, it's lovely.) Again, no vomiting, not much of a hangover the next day as I try to drink some water before bed, and most of the time I will remember the evening (though sometimes need prompting because really there's nothing to remember, just watching music videos on youtube and chatting online.) 

Now, my nurse was concerned, and it led me to wondering. Should I be? I'm a big guy and I have a high tolerance. I don't cause problems, don't pass out in random places or blow up my life in any significant way. No health issues and not sitting here every day thinking about that drink on friday. 

So, as you are all likely more experienced in this sort of thing. Is this a problem and is it time to stop or even just rein it in a little and drink less?  (could switch to normal whisky which I drink slower so wouldn't be a full bottle.)",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9977779984474182}"

I am 27 and recently in the past couple years have invested my time into getting more into videogames and from my experience it has done wonders for me in the sense of getting my mind off of alcohol. i love the feeling of getting mentally trasported inti a fictional world where your real life problems dont exist. i dont know if that makes sense but hey it helps me not drink so thats a plus in my book. 

p.s. movies helped me alot also but since covid there havent been many new movies or the ability to go escape and see a movie in the movie theaters.

A little over two years ago I stopped drinking as a challenge. While I was not a daily drinker and only had some mildly embarrassing moments while drunk, I have witnessed how its affected some family members. I also felt a weekly anticipation for binge drinking on the weekends. Overall, drinking had become a social outlet. So I took on the challenge of sobriety, in a casual sort of way. Two years later, /stopdrinking/ is among my biggest influences to stay sober. 

Initially, my sobriety was kind of a joke in my family. My friend begrudgingly understood and we drifted apart a bit. Basically, sobriety is hard and isolating. As I committed to sobriety, week after week, I looked for some support and found this sub. 

With all that in mind, I want to thank everyone on this sub. The stories everyone tells, the self-awareness, the understanding of our flaws, and the discipline so many users show inspire me to stay off the booze. I hope anyone struggling can find something similar in this sub.",30,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.6196423768997192}"

I wasn’t as into it.

I did it cold turkey, and I’m doing it on my own: no AA, no therapy, no rehab program; just this sub and the support of my dad and a few good friends. Clonazepam and weed have both helped tremendously. My SO still drinks every night which can be a challenge.

IWNDWYT 💪 <—- YEAH REDDIT. I used an emoji. I DID IT. Come at me. 

Me: 33 yr old woman.

The Good:
Still loving sobriety. Still dedicated. I have also incorporated intermittent fasting and cut carbs. I’ve lost 12 lbs. My skin is clearing up. The weirdo eye bags I had under my eyes that I thought were normal, they’re gone. My energy, is way higher. My appetite...is much lower. Anxiety is really almost gone. My husband is also 3 weeks sober. We are loving it. Our sexy time....off the chains. ;) The only reason I say that is because I won’t pretend like binge drinking doesn’t take a negative toll on ones sex life. We have gone from “passing out” to needing a new bed frame. Woot. 

The Bad: 
Wouldn’t really call it “bad”, mostly just a challenge. I know it’s normal (PAWS), but for me...this last week has been an emotional rollercoaster. I feel like a psycho. I’ve been a bit weepy. And I’m being a raging bitch one minute, then I’m fine the next. It’s embarrassing. Highs and lows. I felt a little more rage this week I guess. My patience would just drop. Like I ran out of human decency. And I hulk out. Granted, my fits of rage are fleeting. I have been 95% super chill. But then bam. I get that “feeling”. That weight on my chest, that burning in my throat almost. That *urge*. I know I could take it away with a drink. But! I won’t do it, and I don’t want to. I have been reading a lot about the psychology of substance abuse (I’m a binge drinker) and there really is a huge adjustment for a few months after you remove alcohol. Lots of changes in your brain. Every time I get ragey it’s annoying for sure but it’s a reminder that the rage is temporary and I HAVE to go through it to heal. My poor husband though. He’s good though, he just kisses my forehead, calls me a psycho and makes me some tea. Champ. Still having a bit of insomnia. Not a lot anymore. I slept great on week two. Week three was a larger mental challenge. I haven’t been tempted to drink really. Just feeling the mental challenges. And behavioral issues. Got my therapist queued up though. Gonna bend her ear about what I’m going through. 

Takeaways: I can’t wait to say I’ve got a month. It’s a relatively small amount of time but. Hot damn. 12 lbs gone!! My mood is so much better. I’m eating clean and drinking so much water. Yes, there are challenges right now but. I’m leaning into it. Anything worth sticking to isn’t always easy. In fact I’m glad it’s not. I feel strong, motivated, I feel happy. I’m living without the guilt of letting myself down. I wake up feeling refreshed.

I have made absolutely no effort to make sober friends. I’m terrified of going to an AA meeting and I’ve been sober for a year and a half now. I’m embarrassed to tell people I don’t drink. I know they’ll probably lose interest in me after I say that. That’s what sucks about being young (25 to be exact) and sober. My friends from before know I’m sober and respect that but I’ve seriously done something with them (dinners and a concert) prob 3 times since I got sober. Granted some live an hour or so away but still. They just don’t reach out like they used to. They’re still partying basically every weekend. It sucks. I want friends. I’m so lonely. My anxiety is significantly lower now that I’m sober but I feel like I traded it for loneliness and sadness. Sometimes I wonder what the point of being sober is if I’m really not any happier. I feel like I’m just doing it for the comfort of my family at this point. I want to drink. But I guess I won’t tonight.,18,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9681894183158875}"
