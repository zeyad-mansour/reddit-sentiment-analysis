Day went somewhat as planned.  A co-worker called me to ask for help to move some furniture.  Poor thing got her apartment flooded completely during some rains that we had the other night.  It was bad!!!  But I was glad to help.  She needed it!!!

But I did get my tree!!  Threw some lights at it and BAM!!  Instant nostalgia!!

I think I'm going to do something different than just store bought ornaments.  Don't get me wrong, nothing wrong with that.  I just want this Christmas to be a little more special.  More memorable.  Try to start a tradition in a way.  So I decided to make my own ornaments.  Meh, they may not be as flashy or fancy as the ones from stores, but they will mean something.  And I feel like I will enjoy it more.  I'm also going to ask a couple of people that are close to me to make an ornament for my tree.  Something that reminds them of themselves.  Something that is telling of their personality or simply something that represents something they just like.  

Also working really hard on the train layout.  Had a little set back, there are some miniature lights that have gone out on the layout.  I think I know what the problem may be, so it's back on the bench for the little guys.  Set back or not, it's all fun!!!  And I can't wait till I get to a somewhat finished product!!  It's going to be great!!

Anywho, you guys have a wonderful night.  I hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and hope that all is well with you'all!!!

I will not be drinking with you today!!!

I took some time off work this week to relax try to reset a bit. Work has been very stressful recently, so I thought it would help to take some time off. What I actually did was relapse hard and go on a three day bender. I can't keep doing this to myself, and to the people that I love. 


I think I finally figured something out this time though. In the past, I was trying to quit for entirely selfish reasons: I wanted to be in better shape, I wanted to be in control of my actions, I wanted to be more successful, I wanted to live a longer life, I wanted to be respected, etc. All of these things are still true, but I'm realizing that for me, drinking is the pinnacle of the selfish behavior that categorically defines my life up to this point.  


With the exception of my professional career, I'm an entirely self-centered person, and even in my career I think any selflessness I demonstrate is because I subconsciously feel it will help me win the game of corporate success. Otherwise, basically everything I do in life, I do for my own short term happiness. I have no causes, I don't *really* care about anyone else. I just want me to have the maximum pleasure in my life. 


I think unless I fundamentally change something about my life and my intent, I'll never get out of this drinking trap. It's the most selfish and hedonistic thing I could possibly do. So long as selfish gains are my pursuit, the finish line will always be me slowly drinking myself to death. I think my subconscious knows this too. Why would it bother helping me quit? For what? To buy myself more crap I don't need? Why bother... my subconscious did the math, figured out the end goal, and took a shortcut right back into the bottle. 


So, why am I deserving of my own subconscious' assistance in fighting this addiction this time after so many previous attempts? Because if I can beat this, then I can be of service to others who are in misery like I am now. I hate dependence on alcohol. I hate that other people have to struggle with this the way I do. My heart goes out to everyone here because at a fundamental level I understand at least some of your suffering. I've finally realized that this is a calling that I actually value and care about.


I realized that a lifetime of effort helping others overcome this struggle would be an honorable life worth living. If I could play a role in helping just one other person get out of this eternal cycle of torture then I think it would be worth keeping me alive to do so. 


So I will start by being here. Listening, encouraging, and offering brutally honest tales of my own misery and failure for you wonderful people.

My body hurts - muscles are tense, deep aching in my limbs... old injuries feel like they happened yesterday. My mind constantly feels like 3 or 4 broken thoughts are competing. I'm crying at the most insignificant shit. I feel like I have 101 things to do today and can't seem to start anything. I'm worried about finances, i'm worried about work, worried about things i've said that people will bring up and I have to pretend I remember. I'm thinking about all the things i've totally fucked up in the last 10 or so years and how the common denominator is alcohol. Today is fucked.

I also recently got my bloods done - not great news there on the liver front. The damage is not yet irreversible but the doctor was pretty serious about me not having much more of a runway with this lifestyle. I've been avoiding getting these tests done for a long time. Next step is to take them to a addiction clinic / specialist and look at all of my options - long term plan, psychologist or group sessions etc etc. I'll get there - just one bite at a time.

Here's where it gets positive though. I'm not drinking and i'm doing it cause i've planned to stop. I've put so much in place short term and am working on long term. Normally i'm just so ill and anxious I just have to stop for a few days. Not this time. I've set myself up so that there is nearly no possible way I can let myself slip today. I'll get to tomorrow later.

Also, my new girlfriend (has never had an interest in drinking), who I was completely honest with from the start is coming over later - we're gonna exercise and do some spring cleaning so I can sweat out some of these gross feelings and channel some tension. I never imagined meeting someone who would accept the nature of this beast... and decide to not only stay, but help me drag myself out of this hole. I feel like if i'm worth it to someone then they see something in me that I don't see when I drink - sobering thought on it's own right there. Haven't felt like that in a long time. 

Tl;dr:  IWNDWYT - that's basically it.

P.S. I had an ice bath before to hit a hard reset on my body. Can't tell you how much this helps with withdrawals if you can handle it a bit of cold. If you have a bath - 3 bags of ice for $10 from the gas station & half a tub of water. If you want to numb yourself, try that shit instead - cheaper than 2 shitty bottles of wine or a 6 pack of beer.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9937968254089355}"

Anyways, purpose in writing is to hear some of the positive effects people have experienced that maybe they didn‚Äôt expect, or are minor but add up! Some of the bigger goals I have in stopping drinking (better relationships, losing weight, better routines, etc.) are still major goals, but their nebulous time frame and lack of definition of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù has me celebrating the minor unexpected successes in the short-term. Here are some of mine, and hoping to hear some of yours as I may be experiencing the same thing but just haven‚Äôt noticed/taken time to appreciate the changes.

-Dry skin much better! I thought I had mild eczema before, but the last couple of weeks, even in the cold dry weather, ive realized the culprit was probably not eczema...

-Drinking more water- has always been something I knew I should do, but I‚Äôve been so much thirstier for water since I‚Äôve stopped drinking booze

-Messed around in my basement wood shop for first time in a while and jigsawed a laptop stand for my wife and I for working from home. Didn‚Äôt take long and was a fun, easy project that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have engaged in if sitting on couch drinking was an option.

-More cuddles with 13 year old dog‚Äîbefore it was hard to lay down with dog and drink at same time...

-Neck and shoulder pains are more infrequent and less uncomfortable (maybe because of the water?)

-More interested in physical connection with wife

-Sleep!!!- was always pretty good about getting sleep, but the quality is so much different. No more of that feeling tired but not able to fall asleep state. 

-Morning coffee tastes better when it‚Äôs not just a means to neutralize previous night‚Äôs drinking

It's weird. I have no idea what I'm going to do for bills. No idea what I'm going to do for work. My degree just gets me jobs I hate so I guess I have to start from the beginning. Maybe go back and get a two year or something? I tend to overthink things and that's probably what I'm doing, but even without any real game plan I'm at some weird level of peace right now. I'm back home, and as lame as it is I can take advantage of whatever positives there are in my life, and use this time to get healthy.

Very comfortable with my sobriety and still thankful for where I am today. Things are challenging and with my regained motivation and rising ambition in life, I feel like I‚Äôve lost focus I‚Äôve had on keeping my own well-being as a main priority. Trying to do good for others and finding myself spread to thin in some cases. 

Admittedly I have slacked off on my counselling by using the fact that in person sessions are still prohibited and I know deep down that a video or telephone conversations will likely be just as helpful and introspective. I fear slipping back into the excuse making and burying of my problems and feeling. That‚Äôs part of what led me to get addicted to alcohol. But I can see the warning signs this time around at least. 

Time to step back, take a breath and put things into perspective. I can‚Äôt be better and stay the course if I‚Äôm a hot mess again. I have to be the first consideration when making choices, equal only to my immediate family. It‚Äôs tough but I‚Äôm strong enough to get through this....

I love having a clean house, but this was definitely not the case even a year ago. 

When I drank, my thoughts, my life, and especially my home was chaotic and messy. 

Countless times people would stop by and I would profusely apologize for what a mess my place was. In hindsight this was extremely embarrassing. 

The thing is, I never kept it clean for myself, but I would clean up to have people over, and sure enough after a night of drinking it would go right back to the way it was because hungover me would not care. 

It‚Äôs amazing how much I love and care about the space I‚Äôm in now. I want it to be clean for ME. The energy is vibrant. It‚Äôs not dark and dingy like the corner of a dive bar but instead full of love and light. 

I can remember those hangovers so brutal, so dehydrated, I would reach for whatever was on the nightstand to get the dry taste out of my mouth, and sometimes that was more alcohol. I didn‚Äôt care. 

I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve come and the ways it‚Äôs tricked into so many corners of my life, expected and unexpected. 

The infinite benefits of sobriety continue to amaze me.

2020-11-29 22:10:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/k3nl0g/tapping_out_early/,Tapping out early,"Hello all you beautiful internet strangers!

Chronic lurker here, finally deciding to share my story and join the ranks of the active SD community. 

I originally joined this sub in late 2018 because I was worried about my brother's alcoholism. He was going through an awful breakup - I was providing most of his emotional support and was desperate for resources.

After joining this sub, I started to rethink my relationship with alcohol. Kinda a crazy question at the time. I had never blacked out, wasn't day drinking, and had never suffered any personal or professional set-backs as a result of my drinking, but still... when I thought about it, something was starting to feel off, unhealthy. 

A quick read through A Naked Mind and Alcohol Explained seemed to confirm my suspicions, so I tried to cut back and impose rules.

And that is when I knew I was in trouble. 

As disciplined as I am in all other areas of my life (think total type A personality), I had trouble sticking to my own rules with alcohol. I just couldn't turn the switch and quit drinking like I always told myself I could. There were situational triggers everywhere telling me to pour a glass of wine or celebrate a special moment with a cocktail. These things felt nearly impossible to do sober.

It was around that time I also started to connect my newly developing depression / anxiety to my drinking episodes. I had originally thought it stemmed from work stress or business travel / loneliness, but when I became mindful of it, I had to admit that alcohol was clearly the culprit. 

Even then, I was looking for a way to continue drinking. In fact, I remember telling my husband that I was going to quit drinking for a while to get right with my relationship with alcohol SO THAT I COULD PROTECT MY ABILITY TO KEEP DRINKING... How backwards is that???

It took a few stops and starts before it clicked, but I haven't had a drink since May 3rd this year. Quarantine has honestly been a huge help because work dinners / happy hours are a huge trigger for me, and those are nonexistent this year. 

I feel so fortunate to have caught this problem while it was still earlish - although I have plenty of drinking related regrets, they are mostly just embarassments. 

At the same time, I've been a bit reluctant to post here because I've questioned whether my story was relatable or helpful given its context. Today I signed up for my badge and decide to become a contributing member of this sub with a post because:

1) I want to thank this community. I can't count the number or times your stories have reinforced my reasons for quitting or helped me feel less alone in my decision. Please keep sharing your successes, set-backs and everything in between. There is *profound* power in this platform and the sharing of this content. 


2) I'd like to encourage anyone out there questioning her relationship with alcohol to listen carefully to her intuition, even if you think you're not quite to problem territory yet... especially then. Invest the time into reading a few of the books regularly suggested here and commit to a dry period to more accurately evaluate your habits. You might surprise yourself. 


3) To add some personal accountability. I don't know if it's the holidays or just that life has been stressful, but I've already recently caught myself thinking about giving myself an occasional pass for a special occasion or event. I've read that story a million times here, and I know how it ends. I'm re-upping my commitment to sobriety with this post. No matter the occasion, I'm never disappointed to wake up without a hangover or hanxiety. 


Final thought: In the beginning, I spent a lot of time and energy trying to resolve the question of whether or not I had reached problem drinking status. Today, I see that as wholly unimportant. I quit drinking because it's the best way to protect my life energy and to be sure I show up in this world in the best way possible. It's as simple as that.

Yet, even after months of not drinking, the days seemed the same; night came before I‚Äôd felt like I could get anything done. In short, I ended up feeling like I might as well keep drinking.

Today, as I‚Äôm making dinner at 6ish, it hit me that I‚Äôd done a lot: went for a trail run with the family, cleaned up a little around the house, practiced guitar, made a great brunch, took a nap, spent some time reading, made dinner, and there is still a ton of time until bedtime.

I realize now that alcohol is very simply a negative in my life. I can‚Äôt take a single drink without, in a very short period of time, feeling more anxious and needing another drink. This inevitably leads to getting drunk and feeling like crap the next day. More anxiety. Tired. Etc. So then I look forward to making that stop by starting the cycle all over again that night with more drinking. 

Fortunately, I had a good streak without drinking, and I know how amazing it feels. And this time I also realize that the poison is just bad in any dose. Trying to control it is a fool‚Äôs errand.

I took up drinking about five years ago to deal with my stressful job. Everyone in my old office used to drink, and I just sort of accepted it as the ""normal"" process of dealing with stress. I can't believe how much my habit just sort of snuck up on me. It used to be a few on the weekend, and it just sort of snowballed over time. The messed up thing is, the stress and anxiety has only gotten worse as my drinking has increased. I constantly wake up in the middle of the night short on breath and worrying about the most trivial, stupid things. I'm in just about the worst shape of my life. I know this habit is a net negative on my life and I'm ready to be done with it.

So that‚Äôs no excuse, just a glitch).   My cousin was already on her way to NY and my kids have been looking forward to this all week.  At the time they are going wild in the house because they are so cooped up.  We never do anything because ....corona virus. 

I wanted a drink.   Really badly.   Instead I told my husband and I cried a little.  

My cousin was very cool about it and said she didn‚Äôt care as long as we saw each other and my kids were disappointed but we took them to a park and let them run wild while we chatted.  We came home and had a pizza and watched some tv til she went home.  It was nice

It doesn‚Äôt stop there. Then, I start to feel fine after eating and drinking water so the next day the cycle repeats. Alcohol makes me EXTREMELY physically ill. Even if I just have 3 glasses of wine. No matter what, every time I drink alcohol, I have severe stomach pains (I‚Äôm talking 12 hours in fetal position crying) and then puking with severe throat pain from the acidity. Then I feel okay after eating and hydrating and drink again. Take today as an example: Decided I‚Äôm done drinking on Friday (I want to do dry December) I was hungover and knew I needed to stop. Didn‚Äôt drink yesterday as I was occupied nursing my destroyed stomach from the day before. Then I made it until 6pm today and had two drinks... for. No. Reason. I just did it ‚Äúto relax my Sunday scaries‚Äù. What a load of shit. I did it because I can‚Äôt control myself. I DONT EVEN KNOW WHY I DRINK! It isn‚Äôt fun. It just makes me feel numb and dumb. I just feel like I have to... even if I‚Äôm just home alone for the night. WHY?! Please help me. I‚Äôm at a loss. I don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt stop doing this to myself. I just want to stop.

27 year old female here.  Please read my situation below and comment whether drinking a tiny little bit is gonna help me with the withdrawal.  I don't have any support and am scared shitless tonight.

I finally realized that I need to kick this awful habit.  I had a hangover today where my hands were shaking, and I was sweating.  Does this mean I drink entirely too much?  Later I started to feel better after drinking lots of water and eating good food, but then, randomly my legs felt like the muscles were... twitching or something.  

I took a few small, spaced-out sips of hard liquor because I'm worried that I'm gonna go to sleep and have a seizure or something.  I have a lot of anxiety because of many factors (my parents always fighting, I probably have undiagnosed depression and trauma, and the city I'm living in has been bombed a few times, including yesterday.)  My mom has expressed her concern many times about my drinking, but I don't think she even knows the extent of it, she's more worried about me bringing shame to the family due to our culture and judgmental people seeing me drinking.  I want to call her to sleep in my room in case something bad happens, but I can't bring myself to do it today.  

I recently got a multivitamin and hadn't taken it until a few moments ago, because I thought it might somehow help with the muscle twitching and stuff.  

Anyway, my question is, should I taper off for a few days?  I usually take atleast a few shots of whiskey or rum at night, but I've had a few weeks where I drink throughout the day, and end up going to sleep much earlier that I would.  I'm concerned because a few times, I've had hangovers from overconsumption where I feel very shaky and regret all my decisions.   I've had to hide my hands shaking, and wanted to lie in bed all day so no one notices I'm feeling lightheaded.  

About 30 minutes ago, my jaw started feeling tight, so obviously that freaked me out more.  I haven't had time to completely read enough info about quitting and withdrawal, but I'm afraid of having a seizure or something.  Is the jaw thing happening because of anxiety?  

I'm gonna commit to quitting starting tomorrow, just want some advice from you guys regarding the first week.  I'm gonna taper it off and monitor my symptoms until I have more info and can get support from friends and informed people.  I have a friend who's a doctor and I might let him know and get his thoughts, but I would rather not do that.  I don't want to tell my mom, I'm just worried tonight and can't contain my anxiety and fears.  It's not like I don't have days where I don't drink: I do, but I've been using heavily for a few months now (damn you COVID) and I need to make a real change.     
 I used to smoke weed but I quit, I understand what that withdrawal is like and I've gone thru it a few times when I couldn't get any for months.  That's all over now.  I also smoke cigaretts.  I've read a LOT on this subreddit all day, and googled the shit out everything, but it's making me more anxious.  Please reassure and guide me!!!

It's the social aspects of being in a bar. It's the beer conversation, the banter. The picking out new beers with my friends, the neon hue of bar signs, etc. This would all be fine if I could just keep it to one or two drinks on occasion but in the past I haven't been able to, which is my whole problem. Early this year I've been able to fill the void left by alcohol with hiking and outdoor exploring but as winter begins to creep in and I find myself indoors more and more I'm starting to feel a bit isolated. This Thanksgiving was the first one I've been sober for in years. My close friends have been very understanding of my sobriety and haven't pressured to drink, but there's part of me that really misses the social circle.

Let that sink in for a second. Is that rational or logical? Absolutely not. 

If we take a step back and look at what mommy wine culture really is, it's excuse my language fucking strange. 

Sure, it may give you a brief sense of euphoria and relief, but we all know that wears off quickly. And we're continually chasing that first sip. In order to feel that exact feeling, we keep drinking more and more, end up making a fool of ourselves, and waking up with a hangover the next day. Not only are we waking up with a hangover, but we're taking care of our kids feeling like absolute garbage.

How is this helping the chaos we were trying to escape? It doesn't. It creates more. So why do we keep getting sucked back into this cycle? 

Instant gratification?

Social conditioning?

No other healthy ways to decompress?

Well, I'm here to remind you that while the memes, your friends and family, and society tell you that wine is the way to get through motherhood. I want to tell you it is not the way. 

Taking a nap. 

Getting a sitter so you can go to Target by yourself for an hour. 

Going for a walk.

Cooking up a healthy meal.

Journaling.

Meditating.

Drawing.

These are the healthy and effective ways to help with the chaos of motherhood. Notice how I said effective because alcohol isn't useful in relieving what we're trying to escape. It just creates more pandemonium.

Longtime lurker, first time poster.

I started drinking at 16, *really* drinking around 20. I turned 30 this month.

It's been over a decade of lying to myself. Over a decade of rationalizations. A decade of failed attempts at moderation. 

I've spent years rationalizing why my drinking isn't *that* bad. I've told myself that I'm not a daily drinker. That I've never had withdrawal. Never had the shakes. That I *have* been able to have a drink or two and stop. I *have* been able to cut back. I focus on all the ways my drinking isn't a problem, all the ways I'm not as bad as others. I've told myself that I'm not an ""alcoholic,"" that I can control this, that I can limit my alcohol intake.

But I am *always* thinking about the next drink. 

I've embarrassed myself. I've humiliated myself. I've said things I shouldn't have. I've hurt people I care about. I've slept with people I never would have sober. I have blacked out more times than I can count. I've driven drunk. I've been alone and lost, stumbling around cities I don't know. I've gotten in strangers' cars. I've been hospitalized for alcohol poisoning. I've woken up in my own vomit. I've crossed lines I never thought I would. I've had multiple people express concern. I've hit ""rock bottom"" just to find I can go deeper down. 

I've had enough.

I don't know what's changed. There's been no incident, no tipping point. I'm tired of hurting others. I'm tired of hurting myself. 

I'm excited. I'm terrified. I'm not sure how I'll pave the way forward, but I trust myself to figure it out. I'm done drinking for good.

I've been drinking a bottle of vodka for a couple of months now. I live with my parents who know addiction well but don't know how to help, I honestly don't think it's possible or their responsibility anyway. They usually want to play card games or watch a tv show which is super nice of them but I just want to drink. The thing is, when I started I was severely depressed (in the ""didn't eat or get out of my bed for days at a time"" sense) but now I am fairly content with my life but I cannot stop drinking.

It's pure insaneness really. It's like my heart craves it. It's getting to a point where I struggle to perform as well as I did before academically, which is my dream career but I just want to get shitfaced and not care about me being unable to do literally anything the next day because my body now takes too long to recover (Two souls, alas!, reside within my breast.). During the day I am sooo motivated to stop but then the sun goes down and I couldn't give a shit anymore. Sometimes there are a couple of days on which I want to turn my life around, I make appointments with doctors and talk to my friends and reach out for help, then the next day all I can think about is getting as drunk as I possibly can. I know all the downsides, I am aware of all the damage it does and already did tbh, however I am too impulsive to stop. What do I do? I hate it but I want it so badly anyway.

My attention span, over the course of 15ish years, was slowly whittled away without me fully realizing it - until it was mostly gone.  


Fast forward to today, and the pink cloud has finally arrived for me! I'm just past the 90 day mark and I'm able to completely engage myself again in books, movies, and video games. I MISSED THIS SO MUCH. It may sound silly to want to get lost in various sorts of media, but I was not able to do this when I was drinking! One beer while gaming turned into 8 and suddenly realizing I never made it past the starting area in a game.  


I'm just so happy, I've missed this so much. Before when I was drinking, it was to pass the time in a life that no longer felt like mine. I had pressed the mute button on my existence. Today, that isn't the case.

I didn't speak or even introduce myself I was so nervous and about to cry (out of happiness and relief). I felt so supported even though I was sitting in the back and no one acknowledged me since we were all facing forward.

Short summary: I didn't start drinking until late into college, got job, wife, first house, promoted a few times to sales, and 15 years later I was drinking 2-3 martinis every evening. Most of my worst regrets are alcohol fueled. 

I decided last year that I was, in fact, an alcoholic and that over the past 15 years my addiction had gone from ""mild flirtation with alcohol"" to ""the guy who knows all the great microbrewery options"" to ""how are you still standing"" (direct quote from a coworker to me the day after I had 7 Grey Goose martinis on a work trip). This time last year I was fucking drunk at Thanksgiving for 3 days in a row. Afterwards feelings of shame and disgust at missing (literally- blackout time loss) this time with my family and friends I decided I wanted to change.

November - too many to count.
December - 12 drinks 
January - 5 drinks
Feb - July 1-2 drinks each
Aug - 0
September- 2 glasses of wine with my wife from a bottle she opened for a recipe
Oct-Nov 0 drinks

Unforeseen benefits:
1) I did not know we would be having the kind of year we are when I decided to stop in December 2019. Because I stopped buying booze, when we went on partial furlough due to the economic slowdown, I did not have to stop paying my bills because the savings account was significantly more plush. 

2) Odd chocolate fixation. I'm not sure why but I started eating more chocolate... tbh, its a welcome trade for not remembering the day before.

3) Sleep - holy cow man, I can sleep now and I think I may have forgotten what good sleep was for like a decade.

4) Weightloss & blood pressure - I've picked up cycling and lost 30 lbs in addition to improving my blood pressure significantly.

Outlook:
I'm 39 next year. I lost 15 years due to marketing (aka real men drink, tough guys can handle their alcohol, importance of knowing between your regional IPAs, etc), biases, and lack of realization I was becoming an alcoholic. I am very happy with my turn-around and with the support of my wife, look forward to many sober years ahead and more money for bicycles, trips, vacations, and camping. It is difficult to realize one is an addict. It is joy to overcome.

Encouragement:
I am so encouraged by everyone on the thread but especially encouraged by the younger persons posting. If I could wish anything for anyone it would be that you don't lose 15 years of your life to a muddled alcohol tinged blur. I'm sure the amazing folks who put it down after 20, 30, or more years echo the same comment, ""I should have done this sooner."" Whomever you are today is the day; IWNDWYT!

It was an early 7am rise for me this morning, a large bowl of porridge and a coffee for breakfast then I was riding by 8am. It started out as a misty drizzle just as it was getting light and a road closure at a bridge over a river meant I had to detour about 8 miles! I thought about sacking it off and heading home but once I saw a few other folk out I persevered. It did brighten up after a while and there were loads of people out hiking, biking, running and horse riding! I tried a new cafe this morning (you can just make out my coffee on the bike saddle in the photo) as it opens half an hour earlier than my usual one. The fruit flapjack there was fantastic! Anyway ride done, 55 undulating miles. I'm glad I went now. I even had a chat for a while with a fellow loner cyclist!

Hello Friends!

&#x200B;

In this and other sober communities, you hear a ton of clich√©s, sayings, catch phrases, etc. In thinking about what to write for the DCI I kept thinking, ""what new fresh take can I bring to the table? What can I say that isn't just a rehash of the same old same?"" But the thing is, that ""same old same"" bears repeating. These saying are clich√© for a reason. They sound good, but even more importantly, they contain real wisdom for folks like us - for anyone really - and they have been passed down for ages by those who have gone before. And pretty much every ""truism"" and saying that gets tossed around here and in sober communities everywhere, is echoed or borrowed from the great philosophies and religions and spiritual teachings throughout the ages. They apply to anyone who wants to live a better, truer, fuller, more meaningful life. Not just drunks like us. As I've gone ""down this path"", and traveled this ""journey"" so many times certain sayings that I had heard before and thought I understood have suddenly hit me with so much deeper meaning and clarity. One of those is the idea of a ""journey"" itself. I hated it. ""It's about the journey, not the destination."" Ugh, gag me with a spoon, amirite?

&#x200B;

When I started looking into quitting drinking, during the ""Google phase"" that so many of us have had, I wanted an answer that was one and done. I wanted to simply just be a person without a drinking problem, and who didn't think about it one way or the other. I did not want to go on some big old stupid journey about it, that's for sure. I think I thought that if I could just get over some initial hump, or past a certain point, then I could just move on and put this whole business in the rearview. I got so excited when I found This Naked Mind because I thought it would do just that. It was going to transform me into someone who just simply didn't want to drink anymore! Spoiler alert: it did not. I kept drinking for over a year after reading it, and my drinking even escalated. But it did teach me some things, and it got me started questioning my beliefs about alcohol and paying more attention to how it was effecting me (up to the point where I was too drunk to pay attention to anything, that is). It was a valuable piece of the puzzle, but the puzzle was *far* from solved. I had to keep going. When I finally did start stacking up some days, I thought, ""hey, this ain't so bad. Check me out, I'm good. I don't drink anymore. Nooo problem."" Then I fell into the ""just this once"" trap, because I was different, and could totally handle it, and it would be fine. Spoiler alert: it was not. It knocked me down pretty hard. But I realized I had to get up and keep going. So I did, and it happened again a few months down the road. Through those two events I learned, and my map got a little clearer, marked with clearer warnings about where danger lies. And I began to see and understand that, dammit! It's *not about the destination, it's about the journey*! Those bastards were right! There is no magical end point. Each day is about travelling a little further down the road. The landscape and the scenery change along the way, Sometimes it's lovely and pleasant, and sometimes it's dark and stormy.  There are twists and turns, peaks and valleys, but there's no point where you get to say, ""hey, I like this spot! I'm here. I'm done!"" then plop your stuff down and stay. But the thing is, *that's life*! That's not unique to sobriety. It's the very essence of what we're all doing here on this planet. Being sober isn't about reaching some point where you're all better now, thank you very much. It's about finding a better way to live and navigate this incredible, crazy, wild, relentless, ongoing journey that we're all on, whether we like it or not. There was a time when I thought drinking make the journey more fun, but I've traveled past that now, and I've found that there is so much more to see along the way if I travel sober. It really is about the journey, and how you choose to travel through each day.

So my fabulous Sobernaut friends, what clich√©s, sayings, phrases and truisms have you found to have a deeper meaning than you initially thought? Are there any that annoyed you, but that you came around to? Any that just plain don't make sense to you? And any that are particular favorites of yours? Or are you just starting out, and like I once was, thinking, ""okay, lady, just tell me how to quit already""?

At first this stuff didn't really seem to do much, and in February my entire life fell a part followed shortly by Covid.  So that's what I figured, I'm depressed and I have a goddamn right to be.  Yes I was on suicide watch, but no one did shit/cared about that.  However, after shit hit the fan and I had to get sober amazingly I began to feel ok-ish.  Far from happy, but able to face the day and get up in the morning.  Like, finally, there was just enough dopamine trying it's little ass off to make me not want to eat a bullet.  Of course the life style change has helped, but those first few weeks, that's what kept me from relapse.  The meds were working!  

Today when I picked up my Rx there was some updated multi-page guide with is with 5 fucking pages of warnings and consequences of not taking it right and in huge bold letters what other meds to not take while one it.  

Then on the last page, last paragraph, ""do not drink alcohol while taking""  That's it.  Practically an afterthought. Nowhere does it say that booze can make the medication not work or that if that it is a possibility or that you should talk to your doctor about it.   The whole time I was on it and still drinking I just thought it was bad for your liver and shrugged it off.  Which was also bad, but never thought it could cause the damn stuff to not work.  It makes sense looking back, but that would have been nice to be told.  Doctors should be more aware of this and inform their patients!

My job keeps me mentally challenged / engaged but as soon as I stop I am relentlessly bored and I drink to fill the void.

It‚Äôs easier for me to not drink on a weekend that it is in the week due to this habitual nature. 

‚Äú I don‚Äôt feel that I have a problem‚Äù. But if it was anyone else I would say they do.

I don‚Äôt drink to get drunk. I don‚Äôt pass out on the sofa and soil myself. I drink steadily through the evening and fall asleep around 9pm. 

I know I‚Äôm in denial; but I guess I feel like my situation isn‚Äôt elevated enough to be called a problem or be labelled as ‚Äòalcoholism‚Äô.  I am fully functional and excel in my career; I don‚Äôt need or want to drink during the day. It‚Äôs just when the boredom comes and there is nothing to do. 

But then again; I am here on this sub-reddit. 

So in summary; I know I have a problem but I don‚Äôt ‚Äòfeel‚Äô like I do; and that is making it hard for me to stop.

Another big thought barrier for me is if I quit drinking it means I cannot control it; which means I have/ had a problem with alcohol which I perceive would make me feel weak / inferior in some way; if that makes sense?

This is the same reason why I can‚Äôt buy a self help book; it means I have a problem; I‚Äôve failed and it‚Äôs embarrassing. 

I guess what I‚Äôm writing this for is advice on how to stop thinking / feeling like this? 

I suppose it‚Äôs not much different from ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have cancer if I don‚Äôt take the tests‚Äù.

Woke up around 3:00 p.m. Thanksgiving day. Almost unable to breathe all day. Almost unable to walk. Then around 10:00 p.m. the symptoms got worse. I felt like I was dying and or going to pass out. And I was shaking uncontrollably. Not to the point of seizure. 

Got a ride to the ER at around midnight. I told them I needed to detox. 

They admitted me and put me in a small room on a bed. Hooked me up to an IV with saline. Doctor then handed me a few papers to sign and fill out my information. I was shaking so much that my handwriting looked like it was a kindergartners first time holding a pencil.

Dr came back in and inserted another drug into the IV and in about a half an hour the shaking died down. I was in there for about two and a half to three hours. My blood results came back normal and I was so relieved. I was so scared that I had broken things beyond repair because I was drinking every day for the past year and a half. They gave me the option to stay overnight or prescribe me librium for the anxiety and tremors. 

I ended up going home.

It's been day two since I've been home and so far while taking the Librium the withdrawal hasn't been so bad as it normally would if I just tried doing it myself (which I had before but failed)

There are drinking apps folks like, those look excellent.  I decided to go with a generic, all in one app.  There are a bunch of good ones, I did Habit Bull.  I've had it for a while now, and I think the price may have gone up?  But there are a ton. 

So use the app to track days I drink.  Even it's just one drink (yeah - like THAT'S happening).
I also track days I exercise, eat correctly, get my household stuff done, be it cleaning, or paying bills, days I get to bed and wake up on time.

By tracking every single day that I do drink, and every single that I don't drink, and having my history as a log, that I can scroll through and view has proven to be super powerful for me. 
First off, making that box green (goal accomplished) feels good!  Marking that box red, doesn't feel good.  So  it's created some  powerful accountability.   Our memories as human beings are very selective, and very malleable.  My habit tracking app? It isn't!  The data is the data. 

I've also found that when I get 15 days in, and I look and I see those 15 days, those 15 green circles - I feel some accomplishment, and I want to get some more!  

Thing is we always want to have our streaks, we want to go 10,000 days sober.  But in reality, many of us are going to fall now and then.  Having a history has been proven super valuable in this respect.  After I came off my last mega bender, I was really down on myself.  I convinc myself that I've been doing poorly the entire year.  Opened up my habit bull app to update it, and decided to scroll back.  You dummy!  I've had my best year ever! 
I'd remember times when I broken a streak, thought man, what bender filled in that gap. 
Just to go back and see it was just one day I fell off.  I'm not glad I fell off that day, but hell, I was remembering things far more negatively than they really were.  

Also by tracking all activities, I've noticed something that should be really obvious, but isn't.  The more green days I have in a month meaning no alcohol, the more green days I have of all my other activities I'm tracking.  
It's really obvious.  I have no alcohol on top.
It's amazing how much they almost fall completely in line.

Welp  .. back to 3 days. Went out for a few drinks which turned into a bottle of wine, then a shot and a few pints of beer. Ended up with my partner sleeping on the couch as I was snoring and had spewed and weed the bed. Sent cringe messages to my fresh inlaws. 
Spent all of Friday crying and vomiting and the last few days have been hell with worry and anxiety 

My journey started a long time ago with addiction. Once I had given up addiction to meth when I was 19 it then turned to social drinking. I've never been one to stop drinking until I passed out or did something cringe and often ruined relationships. Last year I knew it needed to stop, my dads killing himself from alcoholism and I got a DUI which was so high I had to get a breathalyser installed in my car and almost ruined my prospects of becoming a social worker.

Then I'd go through phases of trying to reduce which were never successful and would stop then try to drink but trust me it never works. For those of us that are all or nothing, 10 drinks not 2. The best thing for us is to stop completely and enjoy life for what it is and stop that cycle of drinking that makes us do so much thats not in our character, shit I wouldn't do or say half the things I have when I've been drunk its completely against my own integrity.

But they will always be there, are part of our environment and will suck the life blood out of us if we let them them land. Can make us sick enough to die. You cant get rid of them - if you kill them off with mozzie spray or extinguishing thoughts - even if one dies more will return.

I am 4 days sober... again.

My most recent go at sobriety was 46 days, and before that it was 30 days, so I have drank 3 times in 80 days, which is a big win for me, considering when I quit I was drinking between 2 - 3 litres of vodka a week.

I have a great career, loving family and wonderful wife. We have the picturesque life and yet, since I quit drinking, I can't seem to see a purpose to much of anything. I realized, since I quit, I don't seem to love anything or anyone anymore.

I know, I know, dramatic right? But, it is the truth.

My wife gave me an ultimatum 80 days ago, her or booze. My choice seemed obvious 80 days ago, but her list of things that I specifically need to improve upon (drinking, communication, sex, manipulation, happiness, house work, familial relationships, and a few other minor things) is quickly becoming too much weight on my shoulders.

Through all of this, she continues to drink and has nothing on her list for ways to improve, save for communication, which we are both working on.

Over 80 days, I've grown so resentful of her, that I'm unfortunately contemplating returning back to my old way of life and just moving forward with whatever consequences find me.

I still love her, but I don't feel I am any longer ""in love"" with her. I still want to make our marriage work though.

I posted here because I love this group of people and the support it carries, and frankly, I wanted to vent. At the end of the day, I do still recognize I had/have a problem. By that token though, I still want to find some joy in my day to day life, which I am struggling to find at the moment.

So I posted a couple of times when I first got sober and I made it to a month just fine. I didn't have a huge amount of physical symptoms but I really craved a way to relax quickly and do things the lazy way, rather than investing the time into relaxing.

Anyway, I caved and drank a little with my flatmates and have been moderating drinking once a week for the last two or three weeks, with pretty decent success. I've learned a few things about myself and I've also come to a decision about sobriety:

1) Even only drinking once a week, I still feel worse when I drink. Having a month to contrast against really showed me that. I'm less motivated even only drinking once a week and I cannot afford that in my life right now. I wasn't getting blackout, I was having a 4 pack with my flatmates over an evening and this still happened. 

2) I'm very much unclear about my level of physical addiction, I didn't get a huge amount of withdrawals but I did get cravings and insomnia (although I already had that, that's part of why I drank so much). 

3) I still get awful hangovers even after drinking a 4 pack of beers, I genuinely can't remember if I was always this way but this could be the kindling effect?

4) I found some old journals from before I started drinking and I realised a lot of the unpleasantness that the booze brought out was there long before I started drinking and I need to address it.

5) I can feel myself craving booze more after each moderated drinking session and I was actually anxious when I approached my last drink i.e ""what if I'm not drunk enough?"" despite the fact that I know that's not normal people's intentions for casual drinks.

All in all, I'm quitting while I'm ahead. We all know moderation doesn't last forever. I'm no longer afraid of booze, but I am afraid of how much I want it when I start. I have aspirations for myself from before I was this person. I can't achieve those while I'm demotivated and not addressing the parts of myself I don't like.

Time to reset my timer to the last time I drank and settle in for the long haul.

Turns out my withdrawal was really bad. Hallucinations, fighting with hospital staff...not good. But they got me through. Ended up in detox for 7 days/6 nights. Only reason I was there that long was shakes and a high heart rate when I would get up and walk around (150!). The day of my discharge, I complained to 3 different nurses about one of my IV sites (original one from EMTs) being sore and not feeling right.

Fast forward I end up in a.different ER the next morning because it still hurt and my hand was swollen. Diagnosis: phlebitis. Antibiotics for a week. So I can't drink, and I don't have the desire to either! 

Things really haven't been so bad. Only 1 terrifying nightmare so far. Sleep hasn't been awful (knock on wood). Anxiety is down. My only other medications I'm on other than the antibiotics are B1 and Folic Acid. (And I've been taking Aleve for some of the pain from the phlebitis.)

I knew this day would come, I just wish it didn't happen this way. I should have stopped sooner. Anyone who made it this far reading, thank you.

This Christmas I will be a full 3 years off of alcohol.


I could sit here and tell you all about my blackouts, my belligerent behavior, all of my risky decisions. That won‚Äôt be necessary. You have your own share of these stories. We all do.
They are the very stories that cause us to wake up. Sometimes we need to acquire many, many of these drunk stories that don‚Äôt end well to help us wake up.


When we took our first drink so many years ago, we never intended for it to be a life sentence to the thousands of alcoholic drinks we consumed thereafter. We fell in love. The alcohol took us to a wonderful place.


I used to say it was like putting on my cape. I became Superman when I was drunk. What a load of shit.


I just want to take a second here to tell you guys that are 1 day, 1 week, 1 month or 1 year sober. Great job! I‚Äôm proud of you. I know it‚Äôs not easy. It‚Äôs not easy at all. I‚Äôm an addict plain and simple. I am addicted to anything that makes my brain feel good. I know how hard it is to quit booze and stay off the sauce.


Keep going. Keep pushing. Build connections. People have been where you are, myself included. I can honestly say that almost three years later and I still have to work on my recovery each and every day. It‚Äôs still not easy. Anybody that paints this ‚Äúlife after sobriety‚Äù is wonderful and great story is bullshitting you. It blows. It takes work every single day. It is worth it though. 
I hated my old self and the way that I was. I am proud that I can call myself a non drinker. Life is in fact, better, more full and more robust. I didn‚Äôt lose anything. I have gained many things. 


This post is ranting a lot more than I had intended. I just wanted to say: stay strong, keep going, it gets better. I am you. I know the monster that lives inside of you.

I remember his Jekyll and Hyde personality; his frequent hallucinations of his dead great aunt; his 80s dancing but most of all I remember the stench of death that hovered in his bedroom as he asked me for a glass of water before I went off to school. I never saw him again. 

I didn‚Äôt drink properly till I was 24; the fear of inheriting that addiction gene stopped me from letting ago; I‚Äôve been forever sensible: a stick in the mud. Perhaps my best efforts to stay in control when my dad couldn‚Äôt meant I missed out on living, of loving without caution and most importantly looking after myself instead of the men in my life - like, I guess, my young father needed. 

From March, 1 drink a night, turned into a couple and it‚Äôs increased. I put on weight; I became irritable and anxious and didn‚Äôt have patience for my young child. That coupled with the shock of - and yes I genuinely mean shock - being a parent has meant that drinking a whole bottle of red on a work night has happened more that I‚Äôd liked. 

I vehemently want to say I don‚Äôt have a problem because I‚Äôm not hiding vodka down the side of the marital bed or talking to dead people in the midst of a drunken slumber but if I‚Äôm wishing the hours away till my toddler is asleepso I can relax with wine, then I do.

I wasn't an alcoholic as such, but I would say I have had a functional drinking problem for years. My weekly unit count was far too high (4-8 pints daily, with additional wine at the weekends), but not at the level of daily bottles of spirits or anything. Still far too much and I'd been at that level for years, with the occasional month off now and then.

I'm at the point now when I can see that it's just better to not drink. I'm feeling the benefit. My resting heart rate is significantly better, my face is less flushed and my skin looks better. (I haven't lost any weight because I've compensated by snacking for the first month). I made it to payday with quite a bit of money left over, whereas I would usually be dipping into the overdraft or using credit cards to bridge the gap. Even the thought of a big night out getting wasted doesn't appeal any more.

But the temptation is still there. There's always that little voice telling me I'm doing well and I deserve a drink for how well I'm doing. Today's decision is that I'm not drinking. 

One thing I talked about with my mate (who is also currently doing a great job controlling his problem too) is that if I could go back in time and stop my younger self from starting drinking I would. We can't go back and do that, but we can stop tomorrow's self from starting....

The Little Prince maybe said it best ‚ÄúI drink because I am unhappy and I am unhappy because I drink‚Äù.  (Or thereabouts).  

I‚Äôve found one thing that helped me quit in the past was accountability- like a friend to text when we both did a sober month together.  Does anyone have any advice for this or how to get started in online groups? 

I genuinely have a good time when I drink, and other than embarrassing myself in front of my partner I don‚Äôt do stupid things like drive drunk or make scenes at weddings.. so it has felt manageable but I know my health and fitness have been deteriorating.  My overall drive and mood are failing as well.  I just love the taste so much, as a former brewer of 10+ years, and someone who genuinely appreciates a good whiskey or champagne as well.  I feel like a flavor junky that got sucked into this awful habit.

I recently made it ten days then saw an old friend, had some tequila, and never stopped.

If you had friends with whom pretty much your whole relationship revolved around drinking, did that friendship survive you getting sober while they continued to drink?

I have a friend that I have spent a lot of time with over the last 10+ years and literally every one of our get-togethers included alcohol, usually wine.  Also a lot of food - its not like we were slamming shots.  But earlier this year we (with some other people) took a vacation together.  I was trying not to drink at the time...but I just found the whole trip soooo boring.  I realized he is the type of person to just sit by the pool and read for hours and call that a ""vacation"".  For me, that is right up there with watching paint dry.  I prefer to be active.  The only way I can make the ""just sitting"" part bearable is to numb myself with wine.  That's what I ended up doing for the last half of that vacation.

Now I am wondering if our whole friendship is basically a lie?  That we are not really ""two peas in a pod"" as people sometimes call us but people who are quite different and are only friends because of our common love of wine.  The few times I have tried to get him interested in more active pastimes it has not been well received...which is fine.  If he doesn't want to do those things he certainly doesn't have to.  But I do want to do those things and know from experience that, when I stop drinking, I have a ton of excess energy that needs to be channeled somewhere.  It is hard for me to see how these differences are going to be reconciled.

I was so proud to reach 30 days, then 60, 90 and then 100. Every day I would watch the numbers increase and feel great, but now the numbers are not so exciting anymore... I guess it has become normal, which is great, but also some feeling that I cant quite put my finger on isn't there anymore. Maybe it is the feeling of achievement is kind of diluted. I am also getting a bit bored of everything in general. I'm not sure what will happen now. I feel like the possibility of relapsing may increase because of this and I'm not sure how to deal with it. So far (since the loss of excitement about the numbers) I havent had any big tests and I'm even wondering is this actually me now? Am i a complete non drinker? Even when I eventually go back home to ireland where literally everyone i know will be drinking all the time? Is that even what I want? I know the idea is to take it one day at a time and this is definitely some kind of bargaining, but I'm curious to hear of anyone else's experiences or thoughts around this time.

2020-11-28 13:21:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/k2soby/general_thoughts_on_bringing_meditation_into/,General thoughts on bringing meditation into recovery.,"It hit me today that this is a common topic in Recovery these days and one I can speak to a bit. I am a Buddhist who has likely spent hundreds of hours meditating over my life and I also have a neurologically leaning psychology background. I have also had significant struggles meditating because I have anxiety problems that exacerbate both me dropping the meditation practice at times and often create relapse situations - because in both cases, my rushing thoughts during crisis times will be too much.

This last time, I've really had to fight to get my meditation practice back. It's finally starting to settle in. There's many resources on how to meditate online, I just wanted to offer some general thoughts.

***

If you just stopped drinking in the last two weeks, your ability to meditate is probably going to be incredibly spotty. There's two major reasons for this:

1. Your brain is particularly still vulnerable, a lot of neurological healing is just starting at this point through about 6-7 months, when a lot has returned to normal.
2. Your stomach hasn't recovered. Anxiety/depression is often partially a product of inbalances in the digestive system.

So, really, even though I'd encourage you to start meditating a bit to form the habit, I can't emphasize enough that meditation may not be very impressive at this stage. Give it time. **Even without a history of substance abuse, according to psychologist Kelly McGonigal's The Willpower Instinct, it takes about 3.5 hours of practice to see marked improvement from meditation.** (I'm simplifying quite a bit here, you'll see improvement along the way but think of this as a measurable dividing line where your life could improve dramatically.)

The biggest thing I found helped me this time around is **DIET.** What was important that I changed in my diet that helped me make meditation work better?

Magnesium is a key for relaxation. I don't supplement because it's really ideal to get lots of it from your diet. My main sources personally are oatmeal, bananas and spinach (which I make palatable by throwing a cup in a protein shake daily after my workout.)

Anti-inflammatory food is generally important because it will heal your gut. These can be most vegetables and fish. I personally try to drink at least a cup of my local grocery store's low sodium V8 generic brand daily.

***

Alright, so how do we meditate during this transitionary period?

First, **Do not get caught up in advice from people who can practice hard and long sessions, like Zen monks, that's like copying a marathon runner to lose weight.** This was a particularly tempting mistake for me as a practitioner of an Eastern religion. Start small, you could probably even take that type of advice with a year or two's practice, if you just start small.

Instead, set your goal for about 10 minutes a session. Twice a day, if you can, don't push it if you can't. 

A common symptom of PAWS I've dealt with is not being able to sit still or focus too long. The focus issue is unavoidable - just keep returning to what you're doing, it's ok and it will get better.

Most of the advice for meditating is for sitting. I personally highly recommend walking or moving meditation, if your PAWS makes you restless. I tried doing sitting meditation my first week and ended up either sleeping or totally lost. Instead, what I started doing is walking very slowly around my living room for 10 minutes. When I stepped with my left foot, I thought one part of a mantra; when I stepped with my right, I thought the second part. You could simply think ""left, right, left, right,"" moving half the speed you normally walk. Whenever I lost my practice, I returned to ""left, right, left, right."" This practice will return the brain how to meditate. I can now do sitting meditation, too, whereas that felt impossible in Week 1.

Another good option is guided visualization. There are many tracks available online. More simply, if you're feeling off, you can simply visualize something like a walk on a beach for 10-15 minutes, trying to imagine it completely or possible. Another technique that is good is just trying to think of as many positive memories as possible over your lifetime and trying to relive each one.",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9893845915794373}"

When I travel or go to parties, I often get accidentally wasted, embarrass myself, and suffer worse and worse hangovers. In the past few years I can think of a handful of times I've gotten too drunk and hated myself for it.

In 2020, it happened twice. In March on a trip to New York City to see some old friends I drank 4 or 5 strong tall beers and suffered insane anxiety for about fourteen hours, the whole time I was with my friends and also during a sleepless night writhing around in an Airbnb bed. In May some friends sent me a half-gallon of margarita for my birthday and I started drinking on an empty stomach at 4pm. I remember sitting down at 8pm and thinking, I am fucking DRUNK, this feels awful. The next day (my birthday) was my Zoom internship orientation, and I propped myself up at my desk and willed myself not to puke in my trash can. I asked myself why I do this to myself.

Denial isn't a big coping mechanism of mine. I've basically always known that I would have to quit drinking some day, and that my life would be better for it. After spending my 33rd birthday deathly hungover, I thought about the fact that I never have to feel that way again. I could literally live the entire rest of my life without a hangover, if I don't drink. That is a super strong motivator for me. I'm also very into fitness. I've done hiking, cycling, yoga, weightlifting, climbing, running, you name it. Drinking has always held me back in those pursuits. Since I quit drinking in September, I've beat my half marathon PR by 20 minutes and my 10K PR by four minutes. I've decided to run my first marathon in May.

My husband has been very supportive, though I expect when the world goes back to normal we'll face some conflicts related to me not drinking on vacations etc. The other day he said ""you could have a glass of wine on Christmas, that wouldn't be a big deal."" And maybe it wouldn't be. But I don't want a glass of wine. I think I want sobriety more.

I basically didn't quit until I quit  - and now that I've quit, I don't think there's any going back. My story is not one of dozens of Day 1s. The possibility that this could last the rest of my life really appeals to me, so I'm going to keep racking up days. If I did go back, it wouldn't get any easier to quit again. The fact that it's hard for even a moderate drinker like me shows I don't need to tempt fate and this progressive addiction. I'm in it for the long haul, building on these first 90 days.",7,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8017975687980652}"

It keeps getting easier and easier as time goes by. I honestly do not know what day I am at until I make a post here and see my little flair #, but I know my stop drinking start date.

This has been such a positive change in my life. For anyone who is just embarking on this journey or struggling with it, please know that it is entirely possible if you take it one day at a time. The thing that helped me the most is listening to audiobooks those first few weeks, and once I got past a few weeks and got it out of my system, the rest has been much, much easier.

Another huge help, I am a runner who had been slacking off with running these past few years, but my newfound sobriety has been an excellent excuse to get back into it, so I think it helps tremendously  if you couple not drinking with some form of vigorous exercise. I don't know what I'd do if I weren't a runner. Luckily my body was already kind of prepared for that, but if you are overweight or have never been into exercise do not feel bad about starting small. Go for long walks, for example. Long walks and audiobooks again were what saved me those first weeks.

Now I'm to the point where I think all the alcohol could be wiped off the face of the earth and I wouldn't even notice or care. I just have to keep my guard up and not let myself think ""oh, well, I can drink now,"" because I know I'll be right back to where I was: hungover and feeling awful.

2020-11-28 11:05:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/k2q4vg/30_days_some_thoughts/,30 Days - Some Thoughts,"I started my journey of sobriety 30 days ago. This is not the first time I have attempted staying sober, but it is the first time I have reached out to a group of people in a similar situation. Namely this sub. I have managed to stay sober for around 30 days in the past. Each time however it was more of a challenge than a commitment. A ""Drynuary"" at one time after New Year's Eve to say I could, a ""No drinking November"" when I realized how brutal alcohol was to my well-being, and other similar but unenthusiastic attempts. 

This is not to say that I failed to realize I have a problem with responsible alcohol consumption. I have been fully aware of that for some time now. Given the success I have had in my career though, it has been very easy to hide behind that success in an effort to marginalize my drinking. The damage I caused to those around me and those relationships however reached a point where I could no longer truly ignore it. Thus my earnest attempt at sobriety this time around. 

I am posting partly to talk and get my thoughts down, but mostly with the hope that some people out there can understand what they may go through when dropping the bottle. Perhaps too those that have been sober for some time can relive those first steps and feel reinvigorated in maintaining sobriety. 

As many have experienced here, the first week of sobriety was very tough. Not necessarily with extreme cravings for me, rather the comfort of the routine. The desire to have a drink to dull the discomfort I had when sober. After an extreme binge session by my standards (full 750 ml of vodka over the course of day followed up by a full bottle of wine) the hangover lingered for about 3 days. My body was telling me constantly that a little alcohol would help to make me feel right. This was the hardest part to get through.

Week two brought a little more comfort. The hangover and headaches were gone, but I still did not feel completely right. I was exhausted and had trouble focusing at work. I did feel better physically for the most part but I was still in a haze. I guess the best way to describe week two was a general malaise. I got through this week though and things did improve toward the latter half of the week.

Week three brought about much more energy and positivity for me. There were a few days where I felt down or physically uncomfortable. But for the most part I was waking up with more energy and that lasted throughout the day. Thoughts of drinking to ""fix"" myself largely tailed off and any thoughts of grabbing a drink were the more standard reasons I look to drink. Things like relaxing after work, rewarding myself for a good day, etc. Thankfully these feelings of wanting to drink are much more manageable than drinking to make myself physically feel better. Maybe I'm an aberration in that regard but in any case week three was a solid week.

And that brings us to the last 7 days or so. Week four was by far the best I've felt in a very long time. My energy levels were high and I saw a very noticeable drop in my coffee intake. I have been a coffee lover for a long time (mostly it is simply the comfort of having a warm cup of coffee rather than the pick-me-up) and I simply did not feel the need to be guzzling down coffee. I absolutely love a cup of coffee and my body just decided after so many cups I did not need more. Definitely a bizarre feeling after so many years of taking down cup after cup of coffee in the morning. It points to how great I was feeling this last week though. Mental clarity and positivity were through the roof and the circumstances surrounding me have not really changed. Physically I did not feel lethargic, my body simply ""worked"" for lack of a better description.

I do have to say wrapping up thirty days did not bring about a feeling of accomplishment nor was it a cathartic experience. Rather, it was one more day in what will be a continual journey. The progress made in my mental well-being and physical rejuvenation is reward enough for what I have done. As is the improvement in the relationship with both my wife and son. The journey does not stop and each day is its own day. Each day is a day to be sober to bring about a better tomorrow. As I said in one of the daily posts: sobriety is not attained it is practiced.

Wake up early to do the stuffing/turkey while watching the parade on TV with a mimosa or screwdriver to sip on.

  Fist of all I want to say I really enjoy this sub. I‚Äôve been reading it even while in my spells of drinking, feeding my desire to stop.

  On Thanksgiving day I was to have a dinner party with my girlfriend, her best friend and their new boss. I had partied the night before with friends and started my day out with Bloody Mary‚Äôs and a Manhattan while taking my girlfriend out for breakfast. When we got home to prep for our dinner I continued to drink beer and hide upstairs as to not get ‚Äú stressed out‚Äù by her wanting to make everything so perfect.

     Upon arrival I had about an hour of decent conversation and trying to keep it together when I blacked out. Then terror ensued, I started peeing in the backyard where we had our table set, refusing to use a toilet. I slipped and fell in dog shit all over my pants , so I was actually stripped down and put into my girlfriends best friends workout clothes , all the while I cried like a baby. Keep in mind I am 6‚Äù2 ,210 lb 31 year old man. When I can back ‚Äúonline‚Äù I was being driven home confused about where I was and why her friend always dropping me off at my house. When I walked in the door I realized that my phone, wallet, and car keys were still at the party. For some reason this mad me irate that they could send me home without my personal belongings. I threw on a jacket and walked the 2 miles just to show back up demand my things and disappear into the night.

    After waking up yesterday and hearing about all of this from my girlfriend I can‚Äôt deny the shame and humiliation I have caused her. All of my friends are drinkers , I was a bartender for years, but recently the blackouts come swift and unexpected . I know I need to stop 100percent or at least until I can dabble and not get sucked into the bottle. But maybe that‚Äôs just a pipe dream and I just just hang up my drinking coat for good. Luckily I am yet to have and trouble DUI or health issues yet, but I‚Äôd be lying to myself if they weren‚Äôt coming in the future , especially how I‚Äôve binged the last 15 years .

I am fortunate to work from home throughout the pandemic. I live in an apartment building and have built great relationships with several neighbors in my ""pod"". Of course with the weather staying nice and mild for so long, the weekend and random week night (and afternoon) outdoor partying has gone on and on. My waistline has grown in proportion. 

I've been looking for an opportunity to get off this ride, at least for a while, and was holding out for cold weather that never came. Instead two weeks ago we had a COVID outbreak in my building. I'm now 13 days since my last drink and I don't really desire one. My sense of taste is still skewed. For example I usually love my go-to coffee, but now it taste like crummy hot water. I have a four pack of craft beer in my refrigerator, but even if I was in the mood, I'm afraid they won't taste good and that would be a waste of the money I spent on them. Also a few of my drinking buddies are also saying they are taking a break, either of their own accord or after speaking with a doctor about COVID.

More importantly, COVID does an unseen number on you and I am taking my recovery seriously. I'm also scheduled to travel to a beach destination in three weeks (no travel shaming please). I keep thinking about going on that trip in the best health I've been in in years and hopefully nice and slim, so I can take some photos and be proud of them for a long time. Who knows when the next beach trip will be? Plus I definitely don't want to have a COVID reinfection that far from home in another country that is already stretching their resources thin.

So I'm back here again. I gave this a shot about a year ago and it didn't last very long. I feel like I'm in a better position this time to make it at least 30 days, but I also hope making it ""official"" doesn't make me more likely to fold. There is something to be said about operating under the radar.",7,"{'covid': 5, 'pandemic': 1, 'infect': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9287134408950806}"

Let's start the story of how I got to 14 days alcohol free.

Saturday November 14th
Like any other Saturday I'm m drinking beers in the kitchen with my wife listening to music. 1 am rolls around. I've now consumed 14 beers 1 shot of vodka and a giant haul off brennivin. Try to lay down... break the blinds in the bedroom as well as put a small hole in the wall with my elbow....laying there for a bit I get that nauseous feeling... got up to puke in the bathroom... can't walk for shit. End up falling face first into the bathroom doorframe cutting my eyebrow open as well as the other side of my head somehow. Proceed to bleed and puke into the bathtub... my wife is now concerned and wants to call an ambulance.... I tell her no wayyyy get me a washcloth and a bandaid... after the cuts are cleaned up enough to bandage I go to bed.. wake up the next morning and realize I have a slight concussion and the start of a black eye....

Fast forward two weeks... I still have a black eye. I ended up bursting some blood vessels in my eye. Injured my shoulder, knee, head and finger all in one drunken night...I have not had a beer since the 14th (nor has my wife) and I have to say I feel great. Thinking clearer, saving money, feeling better. I'm going to try and make it until new years eve until I have a beer.. but im going to work on moderation 100%. No more 14-16 beer nights. Im going to cap them at 2.

So I took a week off of work this saturday so I could drink, and I drank for 4 days straight..  multiple handles of whiskey and shitty food, embarassing texts and calls, and I woke up on Thursday morning immediately vomiting blood on myself, bed and floor. I wanted to taper because I was scared of the withdrawals and DT's.. I made it from 0800 Thursday till 10pm thursday and started feeling like i was going to lose my mind, I had spins, I couldnt and didnt even get up from my bed the whole day constantly fighting the nausea and body pains, messed up throat.

 I called an on call 24 hour nurse line for advice and she said I needed to go to the hospital immediately. I didnt want to because ive suffered through withdrawal a few times this year. But something was not right and i knew it.. So I called 911 who were very concerned and sent an ambulance within 10 minutes, which meant i was going so I had to get up and put on clothes to leave. I had a quick wash up and then began throwing up... 4 times. Just when i thought there was nothing left, the 5th time happened.

The paramedics were kind and patient and spoke about what was going on, and we got to the hospital where i had vitals taken quickly, everything was surprisingly all perfectly fine even my mind was racing and heart felt like it was beating out of my chest. I had bloodwork, EKG, Urine test.. I was starting to calm down at this point and felt a little better, scared to think of what may have happened if I didn't go.. They told me I had a kidney infection and i recieved a prescription for antibiotics and more diazepam for next few days. It's Saturday morning I was finally able to sleep due to the medicine.

A major personal victory!,"I (M23) have been a long time lurker of this sub, thanks to all of you sharing your stories and experiences I've been able to muster up the courage to do what deep down I know is right for my physical and mental health. In return, the least I could do is share my own personal experience in the hope to inspire even one person on their own path to recovery.

I stopped drinking 6 months ago, I did this because I knew it was holding me back from being the best version of my self. I was very nervous to stop drinking because everyone my age and actually now I think about it, almost everyone I know is semi-regular drinkers, drinking is a huge part of the culture here in my country. Once I made the decision to quit I immediately came up with a whole bunch of reasons not to.

Firstly my boss is an alcoholic and so are most of my co-workers. This is a huge problem for me because I'm usually a sucker for peer pressure. Every day after work they would ask me if I wanted a beer and every day I had to say no. This continued for literally months until they asked me why I wouldn't drink with them. I told them I stopped drinking and I was met with confusion. They literally couldn't comprehend the idea of never drinking again. This reinforced my decision to quit.

Another aspect of quitting that riddled me with anxiety was the thought of friend's birthdays and other social gatherings. last weekend I survived my work Christmas gathering. It was at a restaurant and bar and the boss was picking up the tab. I was most nervous about this because I love free stuff, never in my life did I think I would turn down unlimited free beer. 

Not only did I survive this night but I thrived, I was able to stay sharp the whole night. I could come up with the best jokes and banter while everyone slowly descended into repeating the same stories and typical drunken antics, saying things I'm sure they'll regret.

the best part was I was able to drive myself home and get a good night's sleep. I woke up early the next day, guilt-free, and went out for a picnic with my family. While I was hanging out with my family I was so proud of myself for not drinking because waking up without a hangover allowed me to spend the day with my family when if I did drink I would have wasted the whole day in bed with the blinds drawn. 

After making it through what I first thought was impossible I'm happy to say I'm free, if I could survive that I can survive any social situation. I had a huge fear of missing out but I now realize that by drinking I was really missing out. I will no longer sacrifice a sunny Sunday to a hangover nor will I sacrifice my health to keep up with everyone else's habits.

It didn't take long for them to promote me to server trainer, and I was on track to become management. And I accomplished all this, while coming in to work drunk every day, because people really loved my personality and I was fast, and accurate.

I was looking at my phone, checking Snapchat. Naturally, I was drunk. I was fast approaching a middle school in my city and there was a crosswalk where kids were crossing. I fucking BLEW past that crosswalk, and I almost hit a little girl. Thank fucking god, the universe, whatever, that she wasn't glued to her phone or I would've absolutely killed her.

I just can't believe that I almost took someone's daughter away because of my own fucking stupid actions. I can't forgive myself. I can't sleep. I can't eat. Tell me, I'm a horrible vile fucking person and I need to stop drinking because I know. Not for myself, but before I finally end someone's life and my own.

So, it's been 5 days since i had my last drink. Honestly, the withdrawal isn't bad for me. It's really just a lot of unnecessary sweating. I know I just put down the bottle but I honestly feel more energized and optimistic about my life. But still, I can't help but feel the insane amount of guilt for almost hitting that girl. I've been crying a lot whenever I think about it, so lately I've been trying to push it out of my mind but I shouldn't. I decided to finally ask a trusted family member for emotional support, and I'm going to tell her about my alcoholism and how I almost killed that girl. I think it's the only thing that will allow me to not only forgive myself, but to move on from this destructive phase of my life completely and finally find true happiness. Because, I'm not happy.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

So in some respects this isn‚Äôt my first rodeo, and I‚Äôve already completed a lot of ‚Äòfirsts‚Äô (dinners, trips, wedding etc). 

But these days I‚Äôm finding it really really difficult to not have some wine. I‚Äôm feeling a lot of stress from a new job that‚Äôs not working well for me, coupled with weight gain from the pandemic (and a history of bad body image stuff) and general lowness and darkness of winter (I live in Germany, suns down at 4). I haven‚Äôt been sleeping from all the tension, which creates more tension. 

Last night I was at a dinner with a couple and it was so hard to not drink. So so hard. It was the exact and only moment I felt like I ‚Äòneed‚Äô a drink in such a long time. 

I felt so exhausted and stressed / emotional / but also genuinely Excited and happy to see friends for dinner at a time of little socializing. I watched everyone else get buzzed on wine and whisky cocktails and wondered, why am I not drinking? Surely this not drinking is a just a phase and I can have just a few... 

I genuinely felt that not drinking last night was detrimental to my happiness. And drinking would have been beneficial. 

But I also know that in the past it was exactly that confluence of emotions (happy stressed tired excited sad) that lead to over drinking and blacking out. Cuz alcohol is the king of numbing and I feel it all. 

So just writing to hold my self accountable that I‚Äôm vulnerable to relapse. I‚Äôll focus on taking care of my poor mental and physical health as best I can and try and wait for it to pass.

I'll end up doing something horrible like cheating or getting in a fight or losing track of my son and the rest of the dream I am trying to do damage control while kicking myself for my petty desire to participate.  I wake up from these dreams sad and disappointed in myself, deflated and wondering how I can stop the world from turning... until I realize that I didn't drink.  At all.  There was no party, no drink, no damage.

My reaction to this revelation varies greatly.  Sometimes euphoric relief, other times annoyance or shame about my silly subconscious or, occasionally, anger at my mind for not letting me enjoy the hard work I'm putting in to stay sober!

But tonight I got a chuckle.  Tonight I had a major craving for a spiced eggnog drink.  I mean, it's the holidays!  Everybody drinks a little nip of something to keep out the cold, right?!  My husband was going to bed early, kid's asleep, long weekend...  Easy peasy, just sneak a little in the cup, put the bottle back in the cabinet, and no one even needs to know.  I headed to the kitchen and you know what popped into my head?  With my finger on the damn light switch and everything, I stopped and thought about how GOOD it feels to wake up from one of those dreams and remember that I didn't drink the night before.  

So instead of drinking tonight, I'll chuckle and give a little thanks to my annoying brain for reminding me about the difference between a good and a bad decision.  They say ""mistakes are how you learn,"" and I agree... but it is a rather nice reprieve to learn, this time, from a mistake I didn't make.

So, I am not one to believe that everything happens for a reason. That supposes a cruel God who orchestrates pain for some for the good of others. How does he/she/they decide who is worthy? The truth lies in what do we do with the circumstances of our lives moving forward. How do we do better when we know better?

8 years ago, my mom was suddenly and devastatingly diagnosed with an undetectable and often unheard of cancer the only case studies I could find in n my graduate level research were if the initial surgery to remove the tumor which still often resulted in death from either the surgery or the cancer. My mom was traveling down that road when one night against all odds, we as a family close hope and sprung her from the hospital to get ti a doctor who believed he could treat her. All she had to do was survive the night. And she did! And she underwent every chemo treatment they deemed improbable and radiation that was not even thought to be effective to be cancer free the following October and every year since.

Those weeks of her diagnosis and following were awful! I went through some of the most excruciating grief and loss I have ever encountered. I now have compassion I never imagined for those facing a cancer diagnosis and experience that shapes how I respond. I could have left that year behind and done nothing with what I learned. Instead, I have chosen to respond with love and kindness in areas when others had no words to give me. Did God use my mom‚Äôs cancer to give me those skills? No! I chose as a human to learn from my pain so I can help others. Know better. Do better.

Did I have to struggle with alcohol in order to have a better relationship with my children? Would‚Äôve been nice if I could have accomplished that without the whole alcohol part of it. But, I have chosen to learn, process, reflect and apply what I have learned to do better and be better. Both of my children would say they prefer me now over what I was. But, I‚Äôm going to go one step further. I‚Äôm going to say quitting alcohol is not what made me a better mom. It‚Äôs the search into why alcohol came to play that role of soother and reliever. I was not just settled with, ‚ÄúOkay, I stopped drinking. All better.‚Äù And neither should you.

The real gateway drug is not alcohol. It‚Äôs trauma. Unhealed, unprocessed trauma. I have learned there is a ton of trauma in my childhood both in school and at home. I missed the ability to make friends naturally and have healthy connections. Enter alcohol. That made it easier. I lived in terror growing up at home and was never comforted. I almost died (literally) when I was born and for the first month. I never bonded with my mom. She shut down bc she had two other kids to take care of. Enter unhealthy attachments to anyone who showed me kindness. When I experienced pain as an adult, enter alcohol.

As I entered adulthood, alcohol was part of the beginning of any relationship. I didn‚Äôt notice it as troubling. The first place I really get like I belonged was the bar. In every other relationship, I felt like I had to work or earn your affection or commitment. I was useful to you so you wanted me around. That stems from my precarious beginning. I was here, so I needed to find the reason and make my life worth something. I missed the memo that I was worthy just because I am.

I am now learning that truth. I now want to be a good mom because I love my children, not to prove I am worth something to my parents. I don‚Äôt need to go the bar to find connection. People are connecting with me because they want to. I am learning how to create and nurture relationships healthily. But, I need to confront the pain that let alcohol in my life. The pain of loneliness I had to mask with alcohol and going to the bar. The pain of not being loved and valued by two men in two marriages is what happened and I will be okay. I don‚Äôt need to drink to forget that sting. My life after those marriages has been full of blessings.

I am learning that just because someone shows me affection does not mean they love me and are worthy of my love. People will do nice things for me because they love me, not because I can do something for them. The girls in elementary school were mean. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs not the way the world works. Men who realized I was wounded and exploited me were wrong. I am not bad because that happened to me. I didn‚Äôt know that I was worth all the love.

I am learning that now. I need to undo the harm from all the behaviors I learned and start over. I have taken how I grew up and made sure that is not how it was for my kids. The abuse I experienced from my siblings is not how my children relate to each other. I didn‚Äôt have to grow up in that life to give my children that, but I didn‚Äôt let that trauma destroy me. I am learning that connections with men are not reliant on time, my sexual prowess, or my things or time I give them. It is reliant on our connection and trust we build. Do we enjoy being together? Are we good to each other? I am now confident in my relationships enough that if I only see them once a week because I am a mom the rest of the time, I am not crippled with worry that they‚Äôll leave me. I over extended myself trying to be everything to everyone so they would stay in my life that my anxiety was out of control. How did I manage that anxiety? Alcohol. Where did I find connection? The bar.

I am only in the beginning of Untamed, but this cheetah is starting to step out of the fenced cage. The old dirty bunny is not where it‚Äôs at anymore. It takes the courage to acknowledge the pain that shaped choices and circumstances that have happened and trust that it can be different. I can mess up and their love won‚Äôt be gone. I certainly expected my relationships to be over because of the actions I did when I was drinking. Alcohol used to help me get everything done till it didn‚Äôt. Soon it became the only thing I could manage, and that was exhausting. I was dropping all the other balls.

Getting sober ain‚Äôt easy. To begin to heal all the other things once the alcohol is gone is super hard. But, I am better than I have been in years. Better than I have been ever. I‚Äôve gone through and processed more pain in the last 109 days than I have ever in my life. I‚Äôm also calmer and less anxious than I ever have been.

There are a lot of unknowns in my life at this moment. But everyday is a step. And I have people in my life that know my truth and let me speak my truth. Even when it‚Äôs uncomfortable to say, I can say it and be heard. The others don‚Äôt matter so much anymore. I‚Äôm losing my sense of obligation. I don‚Äôt owe anyone but myself for my existence. I have chosen to survive. Even when I was two days and 1 week old and 3 months old, I chose to survive and I haven‚Äôt given myself enough credit for that. 109 days ago when I wanted to drink away all this pain and stop hurting, I chose to survive.

He was a pain in the ass about it at times but he pushed me to be the best version of myself. I quit smoking, I quit drinking, I got into school and began furthering my career. Then he broke up with me and I said ah, I'm gonna let my hair down and drink.

It hasn't even really been pleasant. It's just been headaches in the morning, a bedroom that keeps on getting messier, and wondering why I'm even drinking in the first place. 

So, time to quit again! It's adding absolutely nothing to my life. I poured out what I had left and it's time to start over. I'm looking forward to headache free mornings, cleaning my room, and getting on the right track again.

I had an interview for an internship that I did completely sober (which hasn't always been the case in the past, I'm ashamed to admit.)

A lot of this was due to the fact that I can't help but shake the whole 'I'm much more charming/witty/likable when I'm drunk' mentality.  Anyway, nervous or not, I ended up getting it.

After, my MIL wanted a drink to celebrate (she doesn't know I'm trying to get sober), and I declined and went to bed.  First drink offer I refused in years.

And it was fantastic!,"Well, the food was fantastic; it would‚Äôve been nice to see my family, but you know, Covid. Still, the wife and I made the best of it, and I absolutely slayed cooking dinner! 

One of the harder things for me since I‚Äôve stopped drinking is cooking. I love cooking, and I *always* drink when I cook. For the longest time it‚Äôd been a kitchen beer or two at most, but over the last year I was getting pretty sloshed before and/or during kitchen duty, and regularly putting out subpar dinners for my lady and I, if not ruining them entirely. Some days I wouldn‚Äôt even remember cooking at all, and would have to piece together what I‚Äôd made from the mess I‚Äôd left behind, as I apparently don‚Äôt clean as I go when I‚Äôm drunk.

Since we weren‚Äôt going anywhere for Thanksgiving this year, the whole meal was on me. My lady bakes and made the pies as usual, but I do all of the rest; I won‚Äôt even let her help prep, as I‚Äôm really particular and our cooking styles clash badly, plus our kitchen is tiny. This year I didn‚Äôt drink, and everything came out hot and awesome. Honestly, if I‚Äôd had another oven, I could‚Äôve done at least one more side, although I don‚Äôt know where I would‚Äôve made room in my oh so full belly.

I got up at 7:00 am, stayed sober and focused, and got it *done!* Pork loin in the brine by 7:30, cooked breakfast around 8:00, cleaned up, made one more last minute store run, assembled the new grill (two hours!), shoveled the deck to make room for said grill, made a bbq rub and a couple of dressings from scratch (one for green salad, the other for grilled sweet potatoes), spent over an hour prepping herbs and veggies, seasoned the new grill and then slow cooked the pork for a couple of hours, made homemade stuffing for the first time, whipped up some mashed potatoes, chopped and tossed a salad, grilled sweet potatoes and asparagus, made hollandaise for said asparagus from scratch, cleaned up at least twice during all of this, timed the grilled veggies and the stuffing and the pork so that it all got done within 5 minutes of each other, and had dinner on the table by 7:00 pm. Easily the best meal I‚Äôve made in this house, and there‚Äôs no way I could‚Äôve done if I‚Äôd been drinking.

I only wish that I‚Äôd had more people to feed. From a culinary standpoint, this was my best Thanksgiving ever. Sober me is a really good cook!

I hope you're all well.  In early sobriety having a plan was critical.  For me, Fridays were the most difficult to get through because I didn't work Friday nights, didn't have my daughter, and didn't work on Saturday morning.  

I'd have a comprehensive plan.  It was built around the foundations of: studying microbiology, watching Bob's Burgers, and most crucial... Ben and Jerry's.

Things are a bit different now, but still the same distance from the ditch.

I'm about to get ready for work.  Work is not going well.  It's going more not well than the standard not going well.  I work in health care.  We're going through some second wave action.  This has involved a doubling of redundancies and new policies that are in my opinion, counter productive, but I will adhere to them as best as I can.  Additionally, my whole entire crew is out with what one can only speculate, rona or suspected rona.

I'm working with the b team, and agency.  Through this, I have to keep myself in check.  This means trying my best to have an acceptable attitude, not going crazy white boy on the crew, and keeping the panic attacks at bay.  I'll step into the bathroom, splash some water on my face and then some deep breaths and then back to work.  Also trying to find some gratitude, keep the self pity from taking over, and keeping my O2 mask (or kn95 and face shield) in place and operational.

I hope everyone has a less arduous evening than myself, or at least is more up to the challenge!  And for you that may mean not taking that first sip, keeping the needle out the vein, or staying off of PornHub, as opposed to not flipping out on coworkers, not getting rona, and not spreading it.

I resolved to play the tape forward in my journal but then decided to post here in case it might be helpful to anyone. 

If I decided to listen to the addictive drive, I'd get drunk tonight. I'd buy two 6 packs of high ABV craft beer, an IPA and stout or porter in order to alternate flavors. How much can I drink? Ha with my tolerance currently probably 4, maybe 6. I'm in a good mood tonight and I bet it would be a pleasant drunk. Text some friends for a bit, interact on social media, maybe go to bed a little late but not too bad. I bet it would be a pleasant drunk tonight.

But I'd wake up hungover. I'd have zero motivation tomorrow morning or really all day. I've enjoyed eating unhealthy holiday food the last 2 days and instead of eating better like I plan to, I'd eat like crap again. I probably wouldn't exercise, and coupled with the hangover would make my depression worse.

And there would still be 6 or 8 delicious craft beers in the fridge. And I'd just had a nice drunk and didn't have terrible consequences... So I'd buy another 6 pack (cuz you gotta have enough) and sometime soon I'd do it again. The addictive drive would be sneaky at first but would ramp up rapidly, especially considering all the stress in my life. I'd be back to needing alcohol within 20 days i bet. Fully addicted again, roaring drunk. Shitty sleep, shitty nutrition, shitty guts, shitty attitude. I'd trade in my confidence for reactive victimization. This pandemic stress would eat me whole and shit me out. 

So instead I grabbed a 6 of Heineken 0.0, which is a rare treat, and posted here. Gonna watch the new Mandalorian and then something else. Gonna go to bed at my regular bedtime, wake up like normal and post on the DCI. Tomorrow I'll exercise, connect with family, meditate, eat well, and be of service. All because I didn't drink tonight.

You will likely go BACK to alcohol if you aren't MOVING FORWARD towards something. 

I've went from 8-10 beers 5 nights a week to simply not caring for a drink. No resistance or urges. I can't promise you anything, but I got here with only SD and  some phone calls with my mother as support.


Find A purpose. My main drive is to achieve the Microbiologist title at my current job and one day move into stem cell regenerative medicine. I predict stem cells will be a staple for many health fields within 15 years. This is my alternative to having a higher power and I simply can't save the world with stem cells while I'm hungover or buzzing.

- reading material
Read something that sparks your inspiration for a hobby, self help books, alcohol recovery books. Something you enjoy, but also sparks action or motivation out of you. Now motivation is fleeting, but use motivation to build discipline over time.

My top books
1. Reality Transurfing
2. The power of Now
3. The naked mind 
4. Think and grow rich

- start journaling daily
Every night before bed I fill out my questionnaire.
What did I learn today? What am I grateful for today? Did I give 100%? Why or why not? If I could relive the same day what would I have done differently? What was my biggest success today? How can I build on today's success tomorrow? How can I be supportive of myself? 
Those are some of mine. I don't answer them one by one, but instead use them as guidance to write to myself.

- daily meditation
Let's face it, alcohol causes trauma. In a lot of cases people turn to alcohol because of trauma. Sit with your feelings and clear your mind. Let the thoughts come in, but don't follow them. They will float away. Stay aware of your body and breathe. This is honestly one of the most important things I have started and attribute much of my feelings bad growth to this. I have grown more in 2020 than I did with 8 years of drinking. There are endless youtube guided meditations, but remember this is YOUR practice. Try for 10 min a day and I guarantee you will feel refreshed when you open your eyes. 

Meditations to try
- whim hoff method
- pranayama breathing
- Hz music
- mantra meditation. Find your own mantra. I found a very good forgiveness one on youtube. Repeat to yourself ""I love you. I am sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you.""

- have fucking fun
Don't take life too seriously. Stop labeling everything as good or bad. Are you giving intrusive thoughts too much energy? Why? They don't serve you. Remember, reality is just your interpretation of it. Focusing on negatives will only net you more negative. Make it your goal to do something nice for others. Good intentions will come back to you eventually and even at the perfect time

- physical activity
Must for anyone and there's not much to say because this is the most standard advice. I'd recommend yoga plus something to get your heart rate up. Kettlebells are killer for covid at home only exercise.

I eat reasonably healthy and am not a big fan of sweets or sugary things (most of my regular foods are pretty low on the glycemic index).  Caffeine hits a bit harder than when I was drinking, which makes sense to me.

I'm probably what you call a functional alcoholic, able to hold down a job, make pretty good money, make my fiance happy, all while finishing up my college degree. I'm able to work on and attain ambitious goals, I have interests outside of work and family, and I have big plans for me and my family that are within my reach.

And I've drank nearly every day for the past 4 years, and quite often for at least 2 years before that. I drank much less in my college years than I do now. These days, I'm hitting around 300-400ml of hard liquor a day. Most times I didn't drink, it was just circumstantial: no drinks in the house and too late to buy them; another time, I was stuck in Istanbul for a week and couldn't find decent alcohol for the life of me.

Now's around the time I bring out the bottle. I'm finding that I'm walking to the fridge and looking inside frequently, even though that's not where we keep the alcohol; am I trying to fill the calorie deficit left by the alcohol? 400ml of cognac is probably around 1000 cal; how the hell is my belly so small? The anxiety is creeping ever upwards, and my mind is racing as it usual does.

That's one of the reasons I drink, to silence my mind for a bit, or maybe I'm just slowing it down. I work evenings usually, always remotely for the past 5 years. By about 9-10pm, I'm not able to get anything productive done unless I start sipping on a tumbler, especially if there's a lot of noise in the house. When I finish work I keep drinking while I'm watching something, or maybe doing some personal errands. Eventually, I'm tired enough to want to go to bed.

Right now, I don't know what to do with myself. I should sit down to read, or go to bed, or maybe flip open my calm app and try meditating, but I can't tone the anxiety down enough. Every little noise is irritating me.

All day I was surrounded (virtually) by good wishes, kind words and warmth from my colleagues. My CEO even dropped in to make a speech (I‚Äôm relatively low-level, so that was a big deal to me).

I was mentally and physically present and able to show my gratitude to all the wonderful people I was saying goodbye to.

It‚Äôs been a good day, I‚Äôm so proud of myself, I‚Äôm so grateful to everyone who has helped me be the better version of myself.

I deserve these good things, you do too, we all do, and the work (the hard hard hard work) is absolutely worth it - even on the less good days, it‚Äôs worth it.

I was hungover at work, shaking like a leaf, and reading post after post on my phone.  It almost seemed like each post was about me or something I had done: drinking way too much, making an ass out of myself, lying, letting drinking ruin friendships, relationships, creative projects. For the first time, I genuinely felt like I wasn't alone in my struggle to control my drinking.

Flash forward six years and I can't say that I ever gave quitting drinking a real try. I managed to grow in my positions at work, keep and marry the woman I love, have a child, but I never really tried to get my drinking under control until this fall, and finally really stop this week, and I have to express my gratitude to everyone who has posted or even just lurked here like I did for so long. It feels so great knowing so many of us are on this path together. 

On September 1st of this year, I woke up shaking and nauseous after drinking 12 hard ciders the past night with my buddy who had come into town to visit. I had kept that same pace for about five straight days. I was ""functioning,"" sure, but I was buzzed or drunk the whole time. By that last day, on the drive back from dropping my buddy off at the train station, I had to stop the car several times because I was sure I would puke. I thought about what would happen to my family if I had crashed the car or gotten a DUI, and I told myself from that day on I would try to moderate my drinking. 

Moderation worked out well for a few months, but one of my worst qualities while drinking is lying and hiding it from my wife. Slowly, my drinking increased from my self proposed limits. I was drinking before 5pm, drinking more that the two drinks limit that I had given myself , and worst of all I was hiding it from my wife and ruining the trust I had worked for 2 months to build back up. We got in a fight over one extra beer that I had hidden behind a wall four days ago. I wasn't even drunk - it was a shitty fight over one extra stupid beer. I woke up the next morning and promised myself to not drink that entire day. 

I'm on day three now and I'm not drinking today. I'm crushing a 12 pack of La Croix every day but I'm managing to stay away from any alcohol. Thanksgiving wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, even with family offering drinks.

It was far too easy to grab a Seltzer during work at home at Noon and have 6-7 glasses of wine a day for a long time.  So fast forward to October.  My wife and I realize this is not a sustainable way of life so we start backing off and trying to take a day or two off.  Around Halloween I decide to take a week off, and made it 8 days but the first few included a heart rate of 100-110, mild anxiety, insomnia and some minor sweating.  

After the break, we went out for dinner and had 3-4 glasses of wine.  Woke up the next day, clearly hungover but didn't have any withdrawl at all and had no issues skipping another day or 2.  Then of course we got back into bad habits again for 10-12 days of 3-6 glasses of wine a day.  Realize we just can't do that and had sweating, and a minor panic attack.  Had 3-4 at dinner to taper off, the next day was better after 24 hours and then I'm at 9 days off again.

So my question is this.  I absolutely believe that I can do 1-2 glasses of wine a week, 3-4 at most, maybe on a Wednesday and a Saturday.  That's it.  And happy to do it because I'm far more productive, and sleeping great, and generally feel better.

My question is, while I drank far too much clearly, I wasn't the guy doing a liter or handle of Vodka every day or two.  

Does this mean that I'm at risk for kindling?  If this means that a half a bottle of wine or bottle of wine a week will make me eventually get withdrawls that can put me at risk of Seizures or the Hospital especially during Covid I guess its game over.  That is not a road I want to ever see.

Upon returning home after the date, I remember feeling a little disappointed that he wasn't what I expected, and the thought occurred to me to say fuck it and have a drink to get over the disappointment.

At least once a year I realize I need to stop drinking because of its effects on my physical and mental health. Back in March of this year, some events occurred that gave me a strong push to try to stop drinking like never before (you can read about that in my post history). 

I made it over 100 days and was feeling good. Then stupidly thought I could have ""just one"". I ended up falling back into my usual habits. 

Then in September I moved across the country to live with my partner. I didn't stop drinking then, but severely curtailed how much I was drinking. However, I slowly creeped back into my usual drinking routine.

Since the middle of October, my partner was asking for me to stop drinking because they were worried about how it would affect my health.

For the past two weeks, they have been working entirely from home and saw firsthand when I would start drinking and that I was getting drunk every day. Last night he finally got fed up and talked to my friend about me drinking again. This morning he told me that he doesn't want to have to give me an ultimatum that it's either him or beer, but thinks that I have been ignoring his requests because I ""knew"" he would never actually follow through with an ultimatum. Now my friend also wants to talk to me later today and I am sure I am not going to like what she says.

I really don't want to deal with this. I hate confrontation, especially when it's me being confronted. But I have done this to myself and I have to deal with the repercussions.

Yesterday was actually a really nice day, and honestly I didn't really think about drinking. I had 2 Heineken 0.0's, but even without them I wouldn't have felt weird not drinking. It was my Husband and I this year, and he quit drinking the day I did, even though he could have a 6 pack in the fridge for a month. He really doesn't care about drinking - he cares about supporting me not drinking. The days leading up to yesterday were reallllly hard though. I temporarily started doing customer service and cashiering (I normally wait tables) I rang up so many people for booze in the days leading up to yesterday... Also, even though my Mom died on Thanksgiving, she technically died on November 24, so that day I actually was in tears a lot. My Husband did this thing though, where in our new town you could pay $5 and have a light put on a public tree in remembrance of lost loved ones. He took me to it, and we joked about which one it was (""That one""??? No, it's that one""!!!!!) We hugged a lot, I cried a lot, and he talked to her, saying how much he wished he could've met her, and what an amazing person she raised (me : ) My Husband is an atheist, but he goes along with things where my Mom is concerned. When we got back in our truck, he slid open the back window real quick, and was like ""C'mon! We're going home""!!! and told me he let her in. We joked, because I said that, you know, angels can fly through glass, but he said he was just trying to make it easier. Which was nice. Lol At any rate - my Husband, guys.

I've gotten to the stage where I prefer to drink on my own in my room in case I do anything stupid and embarrass myself or cause arguments. I'm normally pretty good, but you never know, and the after shame is too much for my brain/soul to handle.

At the start of lockdown I moved into a new place. The people here are lovely and I get on with them really well. My room is pretty big and I have a chair. (King of the Castle, King of the Castle!)  


But. as I said I took things a little too far. I got into the rum game. Probably a 70cl bottle a day for 3 weeks. On My last day on the sauce (Last week) I think I managed to finish off 2 of them.

I don't remember much, but I remember crying on the phone to my Pa. And I had this horrible shame and fear with me the following week. Did I go down drunk and embarrass myself to my new lovely housemates? I remember trying to avoid them for the whole 3 weeks so they wouldn't think I was drunk. I felt super bad for just moving in and then stay confined to my room getting licked. I decided enough was enough and did something I would never normally do for fear of judgment, I called my mum for some help.  


Well, that was a 5 day hangover. Or Withdrawals. It was nasty. The first 2 days I couldn't eat anything yet alone hold down water. The following 3 were Apathy and exhaustion. I decided I needed to sober up for work coming up soon, and also to get back into my fighting spirit. 

The thing is it's been about 8 days since my last drink now, and I just feel... like not all there. I hope I haven't killed too many brain cells! The past 8 days I have really struggled to sleep properly. I keep waking up after every hour or two in a freezing soaking sweat. And then it takes another 4 hours to get back to sleep. Even sleeping pills have done nothing. I'm currently doing an all nighter in order to make myself super tired tomorrow so i can get a proper sleep sesh in. 

I just feel, I dunno depressed? Lethargic? It feels like a piece of me is missing. 

Alcohol not only mess's with my anxiety and brain functionality, it also mess's with me spiritually. I feel depleted of all my personal power. I feel disconnected from god/source in a way.  

8 days and fuck man do I feel a lot better than I did, but i hope it doesn't take much longer to get myself back. It feels horrible like my souls fed up with me. I'm sorry soul, I'm sorry body, I'm sorry mind, I'm sorry family for treating myself so badly. It seemed fun at the start. 

So day 8 going on strong. Although I get the occasional craving, I really just can't be fucking assed with this tiresome bullshit energy sucking cycle anymore. 

I'm 25 so it's normal and fun to drink right? Sucks I ruined that train. Maybe I'll just drink on dates in the future? That would motivate me to put myself out there i guess. Maybe not. I don't plan on drinking for a while.

Some people can handle it, some just can't. I guess I've proven time and time again I'm the latter. 

I hope to regain whatever is missing in me soon. In the mean time,

I can honestly, truly say finding this sub changed my life.","Even as the days started adding up... I still can't believe I actually did this. I am overjoyed and so, so grateful.

I started drinking when I was 14 and have been a black out, binge drinker ever since. There was no such thing as just one drink for me. My teenage brain logic was: what's the point of drinking if you're not getting completely fucked up.

I first came to r/stopdrinking when I was 25 after a particularly bad week of binge drinking. I knew I had a problem, but in hindsight, I don‚Äôt think I could fully imagine my life without alcohol then, I don't think deep down I really wanted to give it up. And so began my 8 year dance of full sobriety to moderation to blackout binge. I‚Äôm 33 now. For me, and I know so many of us, this has certainly been a journey. But thankfully I wasn't on this journey alone.

I had my counselor and my doctor. I started counseling in March 2019 - after I gave myself a black eye by tripping and falling face first on the floor in my hotel room while traveling for work (That is... I *think* that's how I got the black eye and broke my glasses. I have no idea what actually happened, of course). Despite this being the catalyst for seeking therapy, I didn‚Äôt have my last drink until November 26, 2019. From March to November I was still drinking in the same way I always had, but something inside had changed. I didn‚Äôt want to drink anymore. There was no reason why or rock bottoming. The date was arbitrary. I was just fucking tired of the anxiety/guilt/shame and hurting myself and the people I love. I was ready to stop, had been thinking about calling it for weeks, but I just kept saying yes... *until I didn‚Äôt.* I told my partner of 15 years I was done and I started saying no. In September 2020, about 9 months after I stopped, I was really struggling - depressed, anxious, and absolutely white knuckling it. I was finally completely honest with my doctor and my therapist about how I was feeling and I started taking an SSRI. I had never done this therapy + medication in any of my other attempts to quit drinking, and I think it has made all the difference. Quitting allowed me to address things head on in a way I was never able to do before.

I also had you **you** r/stopdrinking. It was coming here, day after day, year after year. I commented and reached out for support and in return received messages of understanding every time. I am not exaggerating when I say that finding this group changed my life. I can't even remember how I stumbled upon it all those years ago, but I am deeply and truly thankful that I did. Being part of this community is one of the main reasons I am still sober today. Y'all inspire me every day. I am so grateful for all of you for your honesty and strength. 

And you know what? I had **me**, too. It was my sometimes brutal honesty with myself and ultimately my commitment and dedication to not drink. And then actually *believing* it. A deep *knowing* and acceptance that I would not drink. In the end, it was both the hardest and simplest thing I‚Äôve ever done.

I see myself and my life so differently now. I used to believe there was this hole inside of me that I kept trying to fill with booze and bad decisions. I truly believed that I was irreparably broken inside. Through therapy and r/stopdrinking I learned to be kind to myself and accept that I and every other person in the world is fallible and deserving of empathy. Looking back, I'm not sure I ever really knew what being happy or at peace really felt like until now.

I stopped drinking because I wanted to feel better and be a better partner, daughter, sister, and friend. So here I am. One *leap* year completely alcohol free. I thank you. My husband thanks you. It wasn't easy, but I did it. And I know you can too. You will never regret the drinks you don't take. I promise you that.

31F, and I've been drinking since I was 13. That means over half my life has been spent in some kind of dedication to trying to find alcohol or getting drunk. I don't want this life anymore. My father is an alcoholic and I don't need anymore motivation to stop drinking. I've embarrassed myself, my partner, and so many others because of alcohol. I'm sure many of you will understand the kind of regret that comes with alcoholism. It's truly painful amd gut wrenching to remember or try to remember certain times in my life. I had surgery 6 months ago for the Dr. to tell me that my stomach essentially is falling apart from the abuse I'm giving out.
Last summer I was 3 months sober, and I was just 15 days sober until I agreed to a glass of wine for Thanksgiving and that turned into my infamous sneaky whisky shots.
I will never be able to have just one and this endless cycle is entirely exhausting and defeating.
I suppose I'm just venting. I'm tired and tired of drinking and also really tired of holding onto the demons that seemingly provide support towards being a drunk.

I guess you never do until it‚Äôs happening to you. (34/M - multiple organ failure).,"So here I am. My 5th night at the hospital after checking into the ER with severe stomach pains on Monday. 5 miserable, sleepless nights.  34 years old. ‚ÄúHow much do you drink?‚Äù The doctor asks. ‚ÄúSocially mostly.‚Äù, I replied. I had aways considered myself a drinker, but not an alcoholic. I always had a good job, good friends, good relationships. And definitely didn‚Äôt drink as much as my friends certainly did. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to ask you again and I need to be honest with me.‚Äù Well, I always considered myself a ‚Äúsocial‚Äù drinker, maybe had too much sometimes but since around 2014 when I moved to the city the standard became 1-3 beers a night with the roomies after work, heck maybe 4 or 5 if a hockey game was on. Happy hour with colleagues at work on Friday, maybe 3 or so, then maybe meet up with friends for a few more. Saturday, bottomless brunch, because you know you have to get your money‚Äôs worth. Nap it off. Meet with friends later to go out and party. Sleep it off Sundays (unless this is during football season in which case, what bar are we meeting at to watch the games?). Does this sound like you? Not much had changed for me since then aside from a failed marriage, which caused my drinking to go up for a while, but I had my liver tested in 2018 after that period and it was functioning normally. Fast forward to Monday. I‚Äôm pissing out blood. My organs are failing. The doctor said if I had waited one more day or had one more drink I‚Äôd be gone, and couldn‚Äôt guarantee I‚Äôd survive this. 34 fucking years old. 2 years of ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù drinking after a clean bill of health. So not knowing when I get out of this torture chamber hospital and growing ever so delirious from lack of sleep. I will not drink with you today, or ever again. Because my next drink will be my last, as it will kill me. And I am choosing to live.

If your lifestyle sounds similar to mine, please consider changing it. All it took was 2 years of ‚Äúsocial‚Äù drinking to bring a healthy young man in his early thirties to near death. It CAN happen to you. I never thought this would be me. I guess you never do.

Edit- after my second day of positively trending blood tests they are discharging me and anticipate a full recovery (given lifestyle changes).

Edit 2 - for those doubting my story due to drug use and divorce. Drug use was not common and was done at festivals like electric zoo maybe 3 times a year? Not to say it had nothing to do with my current situation.

About my divorce - we loved each other but she had severe bipolar and I have depression which she eventually refused to continue treatment, which created an abusive environment. We actually monitored each other‚Äôs alcohol intake to try to make the situation better. At some point after being hit so many times, I had to leave. This led to a severe depressive period where I drank much more than usual for several months. I returned to baseline after changing treatment with my psychiatrist.

It has been tough when those closest to me are the opposite of supportive.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It isn't my first attempt since I started drinking about 15 years ago. Drinking at first seemed like a cure to my anxiety but very soon became a crutch I couldn't get rid of.

 This time around realizing that alcohol is something I really want to give up and also something that is definitely possible is making the difference with previous attempts. This subreddit has really opened my eyes to the fact that a life without alcohol is not just possible but also worthwhile!

Nearly 10 weeks in and things are going well. I have really got a lot of motivation back for the activities I used to enjoy, playing music in particular as well as increasing my foreign language skills. Both were activities I wanted to improve but due to laziness caused by alcohol hadn't got around to doing in years.

I am no longer content at being a passer-by in life just sitting on the couch, a slave to whatever football match is on with a bottle of beer in one hand.

Where I live is still in lockdown which has weirdly worked out well as I have been able to keep up my good routine. The upcoming holiday period will probably mean a change in routine and a time where I have to rationalize to other people why I don't want to consume the drug that is alcohol!(what a weird World we live in!) but there is no point worrying about that today.

I suffer from crippling anxiety and depression thanks to a lot of life circumstances I won‚Äôt go into. 

I‚Äôm on a number of prescription drugs and while I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre helping me cope with the anxiety on a biological level, I wasn‚Äôt feeling happy. 

The only time I felt happy was when I got tipsy. 

My wife will be the first to tell you, I‚Äôm not an angry drunk I‚Äôm an awesome drunk. 

I‚Äôm fun, and friendly and loving and silly and for the last few years it‚Äôs the only time I really laugh and have a good time. 

Unfortunately Covid came along and I lost my job. Which meant a) more depression and b) never leaving the house and being social so over the last few months I‚Äôve caught myself drinking alone a LOT. 

My wife goes to bed early and I continue to drink and watch TV for several more hours. 

I rarely get drunk but often get tipsy and thanks to my extremely high tolerance that means a lot of *volume* of alcohol my body has to process just to feel relaxed. 

I would say I was drinking 12-13 nights out of 14. I would try to make sure I took a night off here and there but it didn‚Äôt happen often.  

In the last couple weeks I‚Äôve really taken it more seriously and tried to limit drinking to 3-4 nights a week, which I am well aware is till too much but a *significant* reduction from what I was doing. 

However ultimately I just want drinking to be fun again - which means 2 things: 
1) only drinking when I‚Äôm happy; and not to try to MAKE myself happy and 
2) only drinking in a social setting - even if that is just watching a movie with my wife, since during covid that constitutes a party... 

My questions for the support system here: 

Is this realistic? 

What is the most reasonable system for cutting back to that degree considering I admit I am dependent on alcohol to ‚Äútake the edge off‚Äù often to the point that it has become habit.... 

I know it‚Äôs rare for someone to go from a dependent level of drinking to a controlled level without going cold turkey... but I also know it‚Äôs possible and I‚Äôm confident I can be that guy. But I need help and advice.

A few days later, I checked in to a residential rehab program designed for the homeless and addicted, be it alcohol or drugs.

I just entered my 5th month of treatment and sobriety, the longest I've ever been sober since before I turned 21. Its still difficult sometimes, but everyday I make it another 24 hours without a drink, I gain more hope that I can lead myself back to a normal life.

And ""that guy"" is a lawyer, a PhD, a physician, a college student, the guy at the oil change shop, even our best friend who just seems to like to party.  We just somehow got addicted to this shit.  It is what it is, but we CAN change it!  And God Damn it - I AM CHANGING IT!

Aligning, custom cutting, trimming and fitting.  Very very tedious work.  It took me all day from 8am to 5pm, it felt like a darned work day.  Haha, but it was fun.  I've always loved working with my hands.  Making something out of bits and pieces and material.  Tomorrow will layout the foundation for the little layout.  And thinking of scenic ideas.  I plan on setting it up right next to the Christmas tree, whenever I get the chance to get one.  I've never worked this hard on any of my hobbies.  Guess this one was just itching to get out of my system.  Which is now possible because I've stopped drinking.

Eleven weeks ago I was wallowing in COVID & life let downs. I was fully embracing the pandemic coping lifestyle of drinking and eating too much and too often. I was ignoring my emotional and physical health at the time I needed to cherish them the most. And I scared myself by how detached I was from my own daily experiences.

I am grateful that something switched inside me to make me actively care about myself. I found people to help me feel my feelings, appreciate my body & what it can do, and reclaim my agency to make good choices. I am so grateful for them. 

We harnessed the spark of hope and ignited it to a full, beautiful bonfire. I did things I didn‚Äôt think I could do. I accepted others‚Äô belief that I could, and so I DID. 

Today, I am celebrating Thanksgiving in good health and with a full heart. I celebrate 11 weeks of being in charge of me - alcohol-free, low carb, down 24lbs, and with a strong body that can lift and press and move. Most of all, I celebrate the emotional return to myself, and healthy coping and feeling the feels. It was time to do the work. It‚Äôs not over, but what a journey it‚Äôs been so far.

The bit about it being a full month dry AND a holiday AND the fact that today was my initial goal date (that I later felt inspired to extend) is kinda nagging at my urge to drink. That plus the fact that I have zoom calls with extended family & friends later (anxiety!), and I also reeeallly love the pairing of wine with a :chef's kiss: special meal. (Then again, it's lucky I'm back in quarantine this early in my sobriety instead of celebrating with family or friends, because I get THE strongest cravings for alcohol being around certain people and I don't want to chance it yet.)

This feels harder today somehow, and I'm looking forward to shifting my mindset so it goes back to feeling somewhat effortless. Writing this helps. I very nearly broke my resolve at the store just now and bought a can of wine, but pivoted and searched out some cranberry ginger ale instead. (You know, all festive-like.) Later I will bake a pie, keeping my hands busy and drinking herbal tea until it's time to go to bed. It will be fun, and I will feel proud of myself and everyone else on here.

The last 3 it's become extreme...lost my long-term boyfriend, lost a job, am plagued with physical problems, was/am depressed and suicidal, and barely graduated because of it. Tried to quit hundreds, if not thousands of times. Could never make it last day 2 or 3. Ive always tried to quit cold turkey and never wanted to add any additional substance to help me quit (as I would likely just become addicted to that).

I accidentally found something that has reduced my cravings to almost zero: CBD oil. I started to use it last week to help with my anxiety and my sleep, and found that it SOMEHOW reduces alcohol cravings...it also suppresses my appetite which is great, but more-so I haven't craved a drink since I started using it! I don't know WHY or HOW it works, and I'm sure results are different for everyone....but there is some sort of an interaction going on that is physically reducing cravings to almost zero. This is a game changer for me. Mentally, I still want to drink more than anything..but since my body isn't craving it as strongly, it's making the battle a bit easier. Again, I've tried to quit so many times and this is the only time I've been able to stick with it quite naturally and not struggle as badly.

I just thought I'd share this with you all. I don't know if anyone has had a similar experience or if its just me. But it could be something to try if you are desperate and don't mind introducing another substance into your body (thats the only downside imo, even though CBD oil is natural and pure and arguably has no addictive qualities).

I don't know if that's just who I am as a person but I rarely lied before alcohol entered my life.

They called the bars and the bartenders said they'd never once seen me or heard from me. Like who the F does that?

There were times where I would drink and be just fine and actually have a blast but it was a gamble every time. I could go in with a plan and peptalk before drinking that I would have a good time and not slip up, yet I would slip up all the time. Friday night-amazing night where everyone loved being around me. Saturday night-horrible night where I acted like a huge jerk and flat out weirdo. A lot of weekends were like that for me....like I am a bipolar drinker.

My turn came up, and as usual the need to be funny, the need to be get a reaction out of people, don‚Äôt know truly what I‚Äôm grateful for, I raised my glass and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for Alcohol!‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt going for laughs, I was hoping for gasps, but all I got was sighs (thanks Mac). As I look back on old self, unable to sit still without a substance in me. Looking around for any kind of attention, good or bad. Drowning in that addictive liquid, hoping that the next one will be better.  Back then I wouldn‚Äôt wait for the day off, I‚Äôd be drunk all Wednesday. Woken up today feeling like absolute shit. But happy because I have a couple of days off. Mainly so I could drink uninterrupted. 

And now I‚Äôm just sitting on the couch, with my stupid cats, drinking coffee. Content, at peace with myself. Enjoying the quiet, enjoying being bored.

Managed to get down a cup of coffee but then my anxiety peaked and honestly felt like I was about to die. My heart was pounding, head hurt, really thought my heart was about to give out. I‚Äôm quite the hypochondriac which makes me spiral with anxiety from the smallest issue. 

I woke up my girlfriend and tried to tell her what was going on and got her to drive me to the hospital. Got into the ER. Got hooked up on an IV drip and had some blood tests/EKG done and the nurses said I was fine. They kept making jokes about how I just had a bit too much to drink the night before. Which they weren‚Äôt wrong but in my mind I honestly didn‚Äôt think I had had that much. Looking back at it, it was probably around 12-16 drinks. 

After getting home I realized I needed to quit drinking. I knew I couldn‚Äôt keep doing this to myself if I wanted to get my mental health under control. I made it about 2 weeks until I got right back to where I was. Started my daily drinking again and tried to find another reason why my mental health was suffering. Decided I should start talking to a psychiatrist. I liked the guy and appreciated his efforts but his main thing was telling me I needed to quit drinking before things could improve. So as someone who was going to his appointments with a beer or two in his system I decided to quit seeing him and that I could figure it out on my own. A few more months go by just business as usual. 

The day I finally quit again wasn‚Äôt for any big reason in particular. I just woke up and decided I was done. Decided I didn‚Äôt need some rock bottom to know my current life choices weren‚Äôt a good idea. The daily issues of drinking were enough for me. So I quit cold Turkey (hah) almost 6 months ago now. Wasn‚Äôt easy at first but it‚Äôs getting better every day. My mental and physical health have never been better. I‚Äôve lost 25lbs just from not drinking and I‚Äôve got my anxiety under much better control. It‚Äôs not perfect but I‚Äôm able to keep myself from spiraling much better than before.

Last night I decided to go back and read those early posts during the depths of my addiction. It was a stark reminder of how bad my life sucked during that time. Most of my posts had the same theme; depression, anxiety, low self esteem, hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. I also saw a mental health counselor regularly for years to deal with these issues. While I wish I never put myself through that I‚Äôm glad I journaled as much as I did because if I hadn‚Äôt those painful times would have been a distant memory and I would continuously be going through the stop/start cycle and getting nowhere. 

I‚Äôm almost 50 now and have always thought that I just suffered from depression my whole life. But now I‚Äôm starting to see that my depression started at about the same time I started drinking (in my mid teens which is about as far back as I can remember). I‚Äôve been alcohol free for almost a year now and looking back over my journal entries since quitting I see a significant reduction in those same feelings I had when I was drinking. Whereas before I would say 75% of my posts were negative and since quitting I would say less than 25% of my posts have been negative. Also I haven‚Äôt felt the need to go to a counselor anymore since quitting. So while it helps to hear other people‚Äôs testimonies of how their lives have improved since quitting it would be even more helpful to document your own journey and see exactly how far you‚Äôve come. I personally use an app called Day One but I‚Äôm sure there are many other free options out there.

So I reached a month a few days ago and on that day I got incredibly sick. Felt like a hangover for 3 days and I was so bummed out and confused. Upon research I thought maybe I was experiencing PAWS or something along those lines. I was just so disappointed. I achieved something that was a big deal for me but felt worse than when I was drinking. It made me want to give up. I was depressed and thinking maybe I will always feel like this. How I was feeling before was just a lie, maybe a pink cloud that would never come back. I came close to giving in and drinking ...but decided I would give it one more night. A bit later on I discovered that I had unknowingly ate some chicken my roommate had put in the fridge that had sat out for 12 hours the night before! No wonder I felt like crap I had food poisoning! I was so relieved to find out what was wrong and even more relieved I didn't drink. Whew....close call. I need to remember shit will happen and bad days will happen but I can't just give up because things aren't perfect. Don't feel good..I can't drink. Depressed? I still can't drink... horrible day...don't drink. The weird part was that I felt so guilty for being sick...staying in bed..throwing up. I felt like a total looser even though it wasn't my fault. I am just so used to being ashamed of making myself sick with booze that now even though I was not hungover I still had the guilt like I was. Now that it's passing Im so freaking glad I didn't give up. Definitely a reminder to take things one day at a time and ride out those crappy days knowing they will pass.

 I'm aware of the dangers of going cold turkey. I've seen that some on here have done so successfully, but whether I'm a hypochondriac or not, I don't want to do that. I have a feeling I've gone too hard for too long to just stop. I'm concerned about the dangers of abruptly stopping.

I also don't want to check myself into a center right now. Where I live COVID is currently rampant. Our hospitals are nearing capacity. I know this might be a hot button topic, but I don't want to be part of the current community spread. 

That brings me to my question: I feel like what I want should be possible/available, but I'm not sure -- I want a daily accountability ""program"" where something or someone checks in with me and helps push me, safely, to zero. Something external to me that isn't just a spreadsheet that asks me about my number of drinks, that I check into when I have a drink, and mindfully brings me to zero. And then to stay there. I have tried, unsuccessfully, to get family to help. Everyone is overloaded with their own worries right now and I think it's asking a lot to also be my coach. People around me are supportive of my desire to stop, but their engagement is spotty.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

One major thing that has been helping, is an intentional change in my attitude towards alcohol. Seems obvious now as a useful element. In the past I had always strived for indifference to the stuff, and maybe that will be my eventual outcome, to never give it a second thought - who knows?! - but for now I am gunning for all out exposure of this toxic shit that has been marketed to us so relentlessly that we associate it with any and every conceivable event and mood. The insidiousness of this shit is remarkable when you step back and observe it coldly, passively. It's literally all over the media, whether that's in your favourite TV show manifesting as the usual way people come together, to relax or celebrate or in the latest tabloid story of someone who has fallen from grace because they have 'abused' the same substance others do without the (visible) consequences.

There was even a post today on reddit that speaks volumes about how conflicted we are about this stuff because we have been taught to believe it is a necessary part of life and necessary that we join in so that we can be and feel that we are a part of something.  I am not sure whether this is supposed to make us identify, judge or laugh. It's certainly an indicator that there is yet again an angle of alcohol use that we can only make light of becase we refuse to call it out in case someone takes it away or turns the light on us, so we stay quiet and we laugh along. Watch it, think about it, this is actually sad and scary *because* it's true, we know that there are probably too many people who have actually done this/are doing this.

I‚Äôm hoping to get an appointment with my counsellor in the next few days & we‚Äôve discussed in the past about trying naltrexone for helping me to stop drinking. For those of you using it or who have used it, I‚Äôd like some info if possible. 

First, one of the big reasons I drink is to immediately calm down my anxiety and give me that sense of peace. Problem is, then the ‚Äòbuzz‚Äô fades and I drink more... rinse and repeat till I‚Äôm drunk. Does naltrexone provide any kind of calming response or should I discuss this added need with the counsellor?

Also, I‚Äôm worried that without alcohol, I‚Äôll have a hole of boredom or restlessness that I‚Äôll try to fill with...something. 

Essentially, I‚Äôd like any responses that let me know what I can maybe expect and, other than suppressing opioid effects etc, what naltrexone does to truly help me stop ‚Äòwanting‚Äô to drink. TIA.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9943429231643677}"

And it has no problem bleeding you dry.,"For years I believed I found a profound sense of happiness and hours of nostalgic hope at the bottom of a bottle. I loved to sit and dwell on how shit adult life and working a career job was and longingly drink until I found my ""cheeriness"" or drunken clarity that things weren't as bad as they seemed.

I thought that drinking had a purpose in my life and the small sacrifices (e. g. anxiety, hangovers, weight gain, no friends) were a minor inconvenience compared to the improvement drinking had on my life... 

Well, we're all familiar with how that story goes. The symptoms of the problem persist, get worse, and then get debilitating. The drinking gets less cheerful and more a burden and a chore. But we find our ways of rationalizing and maintaining the course until for the fortunate of us, something happens to jar us back to reality. For me, it wasnt the DWI or the hospital visit or breakdowns while drinking on anxiety meds or the shame of my performance or excuses at work. For me, it was treating the new woman in my life that I absolutely adored like shit. It was the excuses of why we couldn't see each other because of how embarrassingly drunk I was and her driving 2 hours round-trip because she still wanted to be with me. It was creating arguments when there wasnt anything wrong because of some ""profound truth"" that only I could see. Etc.

Stepping away from alcohol allowed me to see how one-sided a relationship with alcohol is and how low I had actually sunk without realizing it. Life doesn't have to be some anxiety-ridden, depressing and dark existence to the grave. There are so many moments and new memories I was missing by withdrawing and letting the alcohol convince me that sitting alone with it was a safer and happier existence.

I am marrying that woman in a few months and I have been sober for longer than I've been in a decade (almost half a year). Coincidentally, I can truly say for the first time in over a decade that I am happy. Simply cutting out the parasite has had innumerous postitive and cliche sounding impacts on my life and I will never go back. Its a slippery slope my friends. Don't invite it back in to your lives because I promise you, what it offers is not what it appears.

2020-11-26 01:54:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/k1ad9k/thankful_thursday_stubbornly_grateful/,Thankful Thursday: Stubbornly Grateful," Thankful Thursday is a weekly thread where we share and discuss our gratitude. Feeling grateful is a skill we can develop. This is an opportunity for us to practice. 

Hello everyone! It is an honor to be your host and to have the opportunity to be of service to this wonderful community. I'm immensely thankful for the support and fellowship I‚Äôve found here, and I look forward to our discussions about gratitude and the vital role it can play in our sober journeys.

Usually, for me at least, gratitude comes a bit easier this time of year. Reminders to be grateful are seemingly everywhere during the holiday season. But this is an unusual holiday season in an unprecedently awful year. Everyday we are confronted with unfathomable suffering caused by the pandemic. The death toll continues to mount, more and more businesses are failing, unemployment remains rampant, food bank queues stretch for miles, social networks have been severed, and on and on. Mental health experts have voiced concern about the deep psychological pain inflicted by these compounding losses. Psychologists assert that the magnitude of deprivation has fostered a novel form of mourning, an extended and seemingly irresolvable state of despair called Covid or pandemic grief. It appears as though there isn‚Äôt much to be thankful for given our current collective predicament. 

And yet, as often is the case, it is exactly times like these that force us to reflect, quite intensely, on what we do have. Today I found myself dwelling on a job offer from a prestigious university that was revoked due to Covid. But my ruminations were interrupted by an elderly man being interviewed on a news program while waiting in line at a food pantry. I was struck by his optimism despite all the hardships he had endured since the onset of the pandemic. He spoke movingly about many of the things I take for granted everyday, remarking on how lucky he was that he was healthy enough to walk, in the cold, to the food bank. He practically rejoiced in the fact that his legs and arms worked just fine. But what really got me was his appreciation for all the Thanksgivings he was able to enjoy throughout his life. Sixty-three to be exact. I was awestruck, in tears even, by his humility in the face of incomprehensible tragedy as he fondly recalled better times. And here I was at home surrounded by the loving warmth of family as the comforting scent of fresh baked goods enveloped me. How easy it is, I lamented, to lose sight of what is right in front of us and become embroiled in thinking about what is not. 

I‚Äôll never forget that man, he will be inextricably tied to my memory of this tumultuous period. He embodied the worst of pandemic grief and yet was steadfast in his determination to remain grateful. His graciousness under extreme duress showed that gratitude sometimes thrives where we least expect it to, reminding me that thankfulness is our greatest source of hope in the darkest of moments. 

Have these troubling times had a way of focusing your attention on the beautiful things in life, big and small, that can otherwise easily go unnoticed and unremarked upon? Or caused you to reexamine your priorities? I sincerely hope everyone here, whatever your circumstances as you navigate through this crisis, can find something or someone to be grateful for.",28,"{'pandemic': 4, 'covid': 2}","{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9980238676071167}"

And no matter how many times I gave up my mind would lie and justify it to me by saying a few you might be familiar with ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not as bad as some people‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs only beer‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôve had a hard day at work you deserve it‚Äù ‚Äúyou only live once‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs the weekend‚Äù ‚Äúsome people have a bottle of wine a day and they‚Äôre fine‚Äù 

But I wasn‚Äôt fine,  constantly had a swelling underneath my ribcage that I was convinced was my liver, my mental health was a mess, I‚Äôd be on benders so long I‚Äôd lose track of days and forget I had work, I‚Äôd be sick at least once a day, my stomach was severely inflamed I had really bad mental health, would go back to my toxic ex and lose control of my bowels my stomach was so bad. And then that‚Äôs why I decided to call it quits. I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. 

So I started my first few weeks sober and I spent every day drinking as much water as I could, I ate healthy I made eating good clean food my new addiction, I ignored all the lies my brain would tell me and after 8 days sober I decided to get a liver function, and to my surprise it came back normal! instead of taking it as a green light to go back to drinking I took it as a second chance to get things right. I failed a liver function before and made that mistake. 

And now 108 days later I do not miss drinking at all, one of the biggest changes I‚Äôve noticed how coherent I am, I can have better conversations with people and my anxiety has decreased lots and my mental health has improved, getting out of bed isn‚Äôt much of a challenge Anymore and my skin is much better and I have a glow instead of a grey and dry look. You can take everything in you‚Äôre not numb to the world around you. You‚Äôre less irrational and less likely to send embarrassing texts, so many reasons to get sober. Your body can be quite forgiving If you‚Äôre young so quit before you do irreversible damage!

I wanted to just do my usual of having a few seltzer‚Äôs after work. I drank 4, opened a 5th and then realized I would rather have a burrito and water and dumped the 5th out. I stayed up a bit longer without drinking and had a bit of a chat with my boyfriend. He pointed a huge realization I didn‚Äôt realize I was unconsciously ignoring-drinking isn‚Äôt fun for me any more. 

This routine of drinking after work was trying to serve myself excitement or fun. Let‚Äôs face it-we can have fun drinking. But I wasn‚Äôt really having fun.  I was trying to will it upon myself with crappy gas station booze and empty calories. 

Each relapse is getting easier and I‚Äôm only human. I‚Äôm prepared that this can always more difficult in the future. But the burnout from working in healthcare and having enough energy to watch tv wasn‚Äôt better because I was drinking. 

I‚Äôm starting to value my sober time much more than I‚Äôm determined more than ever to not drink. I saved enough money to pay off my credit card. I‚Äôm not starving myself to save calories to drink. My days off can be more fulfilling and I‚Äôm actually remembering things I‚Äôm interested in again. Mediocre nights in the darkest, coldest time with a second lock down approaching might just be mediocre at best. 

One thing that helped me was from my therapist to recommend I have a plan in place to not drink. So I know Friday or Saturday night can be a trigger so I‚Äôm going to find something to do with that time ahead of time. I‚Äôm also valuing my health a lot more and have been enjoying exercise. I find I‚Äôm kinder to myself that even if I don‚Äôt come home from work and want to write a novel, I‚Äôm sober and made it to work and that‚Äôs enough.

I appreciate everyone here and the stories everyone shares. We are all in this together and we can learn from each other and support one another.

I have really come to learn that I have an addictive personality and that I need to break my habits. I've been dry since 8-2-2020 and feel really good about that. It really hasn't been that hard for me to not drink because of the blast of self-worth I have from being dry and going against the grain and hearing my friends tell me how hungover they are some days and how much energy I have from not drinking. My heart (physically) also feels the best it has in the past year. I was having really strong palpitations from a really bad binge night that have stuck with me for about the past year, but are starting to calm down now. But drinking isn't my only problem. I also realized I have a marijuana addiction, masturbation addiction and coffee addiction - and I've decided to make the move to work on all these addictions. 

The hardest part right now is finding things to do to fill in the gaps where I'd be doing things such as drinking or watching porn or similar. Since we are mostly locked down due to Covid it makes things even harder since we are spending so much time indoors, isolated and alone. The cravings for all my addictions are at some of their highest points. 

I guess what I'm really trying to get at here is that we are the ones holding ourselves back from achieving our goals, and if we don't learn to conquer ourselves then who is going to do it for us? No one. That's who. So I'm writing this to share with the community that I am on a mission to become my best self. The time is now. I'm here by myself, with myself, chiseling away at becoming the man I know I can be.

In a time for giving thanks: thanks to everyone on this sub for sharing their experiences, their thoughts and their emotions. Sometimes it's hard to even type out our thoughts while hidden behind the screen, so thank you for digging up the courage to do so. Everyone's posts here are so powerful and really help remind us that we are not alone and there are so many people going through the same things we are.

Based on what I've read MOST people don't get thus side effect and it goes away quickly for most who do. I sure as hell, though, cut the dose in half today (very little issues today on lower dose) and took with a meal. I will probably taper up (thicken up??) to the full dose pretty slowly.

I have a question about resentment re: the person that called you out for drinking...,"This is a new account, but I have posted a couple of weeks ago.   BTW - This is a BRILLIANT community! IWNDWYT

Starting with questions... My backstory for context afterwards (if helpful).

1. When you were confronted by your significant other, did you feel resentment?  If so, for how long?  Honestly, while many of the things my wife said about how I have hurt her I agreed with, there are some things that she said that were flat out wrong.  I can't parse out if I am holding onto what I don't agree with OR if I am mad that she called me out for drinking?
2. How long do you typically have to wait for your biochemistry to rebalance?  I read about 60 days (and to be honest, while I want to stop drinking excessively, I am not 100% sure I want to never have a drink again; one day at a time, I guess).
3. When do you rebalance, is that when you have engaged with your past transgressions?  Or is it better to do it sooner while the wound is fresh?  I ask because I am deliberately avoiding my wife (coparenting vs. coupling; sleeping elsewhere) because I am angry and don't want say something that isn't well thought out... 
4. This is most controversial -  after your rebalance, do you find yourself realizing you drank in the first place was because it was the marriage?  In other words, is it drinking that causes problems in the marriage or problems in the marriage cause you to drink?

My story

Where do I start. I am in my mid 40s and have been drinking heavily (at least a pint a day) for about 6 years.  It really started when I found my self utterly bored with my suburban life and, what I felt (and continue to feel) was constant criticism  from my wife.  I did all of the classic things that I have read that others on this thread have done - bought, hid and drank in secret.  Embarrassing, but I did it and have shame.  Anyway, about 6 weeks ago, my wife found a re-filled bottle and things started to spiral from there.  Over several weeks she thought the discovery of bottles over the years were ""one-offs"", but she did a little investigative work and found that I have been buying bottles daily for years and then found videos on the Ring of me taking ""sips"" from my car.  Of course, she had her intuition, but chose to believe in me and I ""deftly"" deflected and made it seem like it was her imagination.  

We started couples counseling with a therapist that specialized in alcohol (my recommendation is that it is REALLY helpful to understand why I drink - mild depression, unable to ""sit"" with discomfort).   In our first joint session (Day 0), my wife effectively unloaded and called me out for all of my consumption over the years and the impact it had to her.  The therapist was helpful in saying that for my marriage to work again (if ever), I need to remove this abuse of alcohol from the equation.   So I agreed and here we are on Day 3.

Day 3 is harder than Day 1 + 2, but I am sure I will get through it.  The holiday's are on us and because of Covid, no family will be over and therefore I am not worried about parties, etc.  So by hook or by crook, I feel like even if I want to drink, it will be hard for me to given the situation.",4,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9965956807136536}"

I don‚Äôt dread 30 or think I‚Äôm crazy old or anything- I realize I‚Äôm still young. I just did not picture my life being this way.

I‚Äôm on extended FMLA (thank god) and ‚Äúleave‚Äù from work while the Board of Nursing works at snail speed (seriously, this is where Ron Swanson should work, it would be his favorite beaurocratic nightmare of a government agency) to process the complaint against me.

A month and a half ago I went into my 3/3 shifts in a row (all 12-14 hours each) and blew a 0.15 at 3pm. The fact that my tolerance was that high that I didn‚Äôt even NOTICE how fucking wasted I was is insane to me.

I could have killed a patient, endangered patients, endangered other staff members. I put the entire unit at risk with my ‚Äúsecret‚Äù (read: not so secret) alcohol problem I‚Äôd been trying to manage through a second Bachelor‚Äôs, a Master‚Äôs, getting married, etc. 

Right before this happened I was offered a dream NP position at one of the best hospitals in the world. I don‚Äôt mean this to brag. I mean to say I really thought I was close to achieving all my dreams- my hard work was about to pay off. I thought I was fooling everyone (turns out EVERYONE in my close circle was considering talking to me out of concern). I even fooled myself by thinking I was fooling everyone.

Alcohol doesn‚Äôt lie. A breathalyzer doesn‚Äôt lie. As I approach 30 I am fucking BLESSED to have a supervisor that HAPPENS to understand alcohol addiction and substance use disorder. I am not fired, by some miracle. An even bigger miracle: I didn‚Äôt lose my nursing license or my nurse practitioner license. I will be closely monitored by the state for 3-5 years, and at this point, tbh, I likely need to be.

Other things I talked myself out of being worried about : going to the hospital twice for chronic pancreatitis, elevated LFTs, a blood pressure that would make my chronic CHFer patients Feel good.

Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be here when I turned 30. Today I‚Äôm grateful I‚Äôm even TURNING 30. Holy shit do I have a problem. 

This year I am thankful to the kind people in this sub. Stay strong, reach out for help, keep trying.

I know, I have drank and smoked for many years to cover up emotions. I know, when I drank too much those emotions came out as blubbering tears and thoughts of that I was losing my mind. But these sober emotions are CRAZY!

Depression: at 24 days in I have my up and down days but have never felt this alone and empty. I‚Äôm starting to feel ok in this though. I‚Äôm riding this wave even though I don‚Äôt get anything done. I realize it is only the emptiness of the addictions that make me feel so empty right now. I‚Äôm alone because no one truly understands what you are experiencing. I keep telling myself that my brain is healing and I need to give it time.

Tiredness: I have a diagnosis sleep disorder so I‚Äôve always had sleep issues, but...OMG all I do is sleep! I am thankful I am not working right now because I‚Äôm not sure I could function at all. Kudos to all you dealing with kids, jobs etc. you are my heros! I get up, read a bit or eat and crawl back to bed. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt stay awake. I‚Äôm sure this will get better and I‚Äôm trying not to OD on caffeine to make it worse. 

Aches & Pains: I swear my body got old overnight! Has  daily alcohol caused me to not realize the aches and pains of this 50+ year old body! Or is it because I‚Äôm spending her so much time in bed and not exercising! Lol!

Crying: the tears just keep coming! It‚Äôs like YEARS of tears have been damned up! I‚Äôm not crying because I crave alcohol or nicotine, I‚Äôm just crying and crying! I‚Äôve been watching the series This Is Us and for some reason all the family interactions have set my emotions in a whirlwind. I‚Äôll be smiling and laughing then just sobbing. It actually feels good in a way as I believe I have been numbing my emotions for so very long.

I just felt like putting this in writing. I guess in a way to remind myself that I am a work in progress.  I am feeling so guilty for not getting anything done at times but I have to remind myself that I have been the caretaker of others my whole life and it is MY time. I want to get better, I want to be able to feel and acknowledge my emotions and damn it someday I want to actually like myself and accept the broken but courageous person I am!

It's also made me think about the narcissistic behaviors I engaged in, and certain unhealthy patterns I think was deeply rooted in this lack of self esteem. I liked being liked, even if people liked me for being a shithead. 

So now I'm trying to build new relationships with people, but I'm wanting to do it in a constructive way. Some things I noticed were how I'd excessively rely on people for emotional labor without offering more of my own help. I wasn't an active listener. I disrespected boundaries for myself and for other people. So my big focus that I think is ultimately helping my sobriety is unpacking those negative thought patterns and trying to create strong foundations with new people. 

I'm just out of a breakup and I think that was a prime example of my failures to be an equal partner in my personal relationships.

We may feel broken... but we are repairable. We may get comfortable being broken and sometimes we just need a reminder a fix is possible. Be the super glue and not the floppy microwave handle. Getting and staying sober may not be as easy as gluing a handle back in place, it‚Äôs certainly well worth the work

2020-11-25 16:28:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/k11bgs/3_months_25_days/,3 Months 25 Days,"First time posting. I just wanted to share my thoughts on what is by far my most successful run at this, and I think my final one, after often coming back to this sub for inspiration.

I've made it nearly 4 months now without a drop, though I have had several nightmares about drinking. I had been trying to stop for a couple of years, and had made it as long as two months before. This time I'm feeling rock solid.

My approach was to read This Naked Mind plus the Allen Carr book on drinking (his books also helped me stop smoking). As I understand it (based on reading some pop psychology books like ""The Marshmallow Test"") the switch I had to flip in my mind was to highlight the long term downsides of drinking (hangover, lack of accomplishment, ill health) and look more critically at the apparent short-term upsides (the buzz). Aging honestly helped me here, since the hangovers were becoming more severe, but I also found myself in a more rewarding job that I felt I really wanted to show up for at 100% and was lucky enough to have a great wife that I wanted to be 100% present for. So the costs were becoming really apparent to me. Ultimately the greatest benefit, that I did not want to risk, was my relationships with friends that often included drinking. COVID has given me some healthy time away from them though, and even when we did see each other early in the year I had found that I drank so much that the whole experience was blurry and I really wasn't even myself with them. Once I realized that drinking was costing those relationships more than it was supporting them, it wasn't that hard. The books had taught me how to view the chemical urge as just an addiction. 

Now I see alcohol as just an addictive, heavily marketed poison that robs me of my time, happiness, and clear thinking. When you achieve this, it's a no-brainer not to drink. In my nightmares I drink and think something along the lines of ""well the next 36 hours are probably shot"". What a relief to wake up fresh.",5,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9871250987052917}"

If you haven't seen Bojack Horseman I highly recommend it. The first few episodes of season 1 are pretty silly, but once you get past that it becomes a much deeper and meaningful show.
  
I would like to say after hearing from the Monkey in the clip that both Bojack and I got our shit together. I would like to say that, but it's not true. 
  
The first time I heard this quote I took it to heart. That was over 5 years ago. At that time I knew drinking was ruining my life, but I couldn't manage to put more than a few days sober days together.
  
The hard part truly was, doing it every day. It took some pretty massive tragedies in my life to see alcohol for what it truly was: a poisonous anesthetic that temporarily numbs the affects of unpleasant mental stimuli, only to have them rage back the next day 10x stronger.   
  
And here I sit, 500 days from my last drink. It is as cliche as cliche gets, but I can honestly say what has kept me sober for these 500 days is just worrying about the current day. Not putting energy into what has happened in the past, not obsessing on what will happen tomorrow. I've got today in front of me, and that is all I want to handle right now.
  
If you are still reading my diatribe and are considering quitting, please take the leap. It will suck at first and you will be bored, anxious and angry. But that will only be for today. It gets better, but you have to do it everyday.

I knew I did not want that drink. I am almost 23 days in. In my Nth attept at quiting. I told myself that it's the middle of the week, that I have work tomorrow, that I am exhausted and it would make me even more sleepy. I was iterating every negative aspect of me drinking that whiskey.

Do not have any booze in the house at the moment.  Rather thankful for that.  In times past when I was trying to go cleaner I could look at a beer in the fridge and not be tempted by it.  It used to actually be reassuring. ""I have alcohol.  I can have it.  It is available.  I am just choosing not to have it .""

It was clear that the after work routine was traditionally a quick way to release the knots of thoughts in the mind until I went to sleep.  I do not like the sensation of sobering-up.

Last weekend I had 100 days sober and my birthday, I had very little problem doing sweet f all at 37 and not popping corks, bottles and cans to mark another year on this planet. I actually felt good about it and was happy to not be hungover or depressed afterwards.

I see a lot of positive energy about not drinking on here, but to be honest, for me, I miss the old fun times. I miss LETTING LOOSE. I miss the randomness and excitement of it all and just forgetting my problems for however long.

 Thankfully the physical aspect of the craving has totally gone but I would still love to go on a pub crawl or stay up all night playing cards and drinking. Just letting loose!

But I know I can't control it. I know one drink means ten, I know that means a week of drinking, and awful withdrawals and obsessing over alcohol when I am around it for some time and just going nowhere with my life and being consistently broke. 

So I am alright not drinking, but (and there's always a but), the birthday is one thing, but Christmas is another entirely! For some reason it is much more prevalent in my thinking than a birthday, a date, anything. I am not going to see my family this year because I have finally decided to draw a line in the sand re boundaries/no contact. I suppose the whole festive season was always one monstrous knees up with my family. Even last year I drank enough to sink a small ship. The prospect of seeing them without a drink seems preposterous. And I'm not going to see them. 
I am going to spend it with my housemate who will drink (but that is fine). 

I guess this might come down to being lonely. I have quit dating for the minute too, so just the prospect of having noone at Christmas means I hear Elvis' Lonely This Christmas kicking in already. Why would drinking affect that loneliness at all? It wouldn't but I guess drink can always be your friend. Distract you when you're down, cheer you up. But I have to remember it was ruining my life, health, and long term happiness. And I have to fight the battle. And win.

Just hoping when I get through it to the other side in 2021 I'll think thank the lord I didn't falter and am still on the good track.

I've been wracked with worry that one cause for this can be a damaged liver and liver disease. I've been through the ringer: sent for a series of check ups, loads of bloods, during which I've just been sat, anxiously worrying about this.

The irony is, I drank because of health anxiety, because of anxiety in general, and I have found it exceptionally hard to not drink. I have such an active mind that I've worked through all my worries in life, but I can't solve death. So I just dampened the journey with booze.

To make matters worse, I had the week off work, some much needed time off, having worked pretty much frantically and non-stop since March.

There were moments, the first *real* moments I thought about just going and buy a bottle of something, *anything*, and just distracting myself. Just drinking. Just to dull it, to be able to have a ""rested evening"".

But I rode it out, I didn't crack, I felt awful, but a different KIND of awful.

Then yesterday, I heard back - I'm all fine, there's some monitoring to do, there is a raised risk of rupturing, but that can be kept an eye on, and my bloods, other scans are fine.

And the Doc specifically noted after I said about my worries, that the they could see from my original ultrasound and from the bloods that my liver wasn't just healthy, but was perfect. In perfect shape. And to keep it up.

Not drinking during a health scare in the middle of a global pandemic was tough. But we're tougher.

I‚Äôve mostly posted when I‚Äôve been struggling pretty bad but I really do feel like I am turning a corner with the struggle bus I was on. No pink cloud here... life is still full of ups and down and days I struggle with motivation and energy and all that... but I‚Äôve picked up some amazing tools lately that have been extremely helpful in meeting my challenges head on. It feels good.

Speaking of sober tools... I started (after posting here and getting a suggestion to do so)by jumping in AA meetings and connecting with people there... building a sober army of friends who understand my struggles has been so helpful and many women there have wrapped their arms around me as I‚Äôve shared parts of my story. However, I don‚Äôt know that I agree with all of the aa tenants they believe. I like the idea of empowering myself to take accountability for my choices to drink or not and develop tools to choose not to drink. I have started to also go to SMART meetings and am reading that handbook and going to Refuge recovery meetings. Those two programs have each given me the most tools to help me along my path. The cognitive behavioral approach and all the exercises that are in the SMART handbook have been so amazing for lightening my stress about all of this... and I‚Äôm waiting on the refuge book but the meditations and readings in those meetings have been helpful too. 

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone here does a combo of all three. I‚Äôd love to hear what you take from each and how you communicate that to others in the groups and how you make it all work. 

Anyway... I hope you all are being easy on yourselves along this sometimes difficult path we all find ourselves on. I offer out all my love and kindness to this group particularly bc this is the first place I reached out for support when I started trying to stop drinking many many months ago. I appreciate everyone here!!

Then you're all alone the next day, stuck to wallow in your own pain and sorrow. Even if your friend sitting next to you on the couch helping you binge eat pizza and watch trash shows isn't feeling exactly how your feeling. Only you know what its like to feel your own hangover and misery. Its like a one night stand. Makes you feel good in the moment and then crushes you, leaving you to fend for yourself. Whether your drinking with friends or drinking alone it is a great comfort and makes you feel like you're not all by yourself. The next day you are alone again. Its a constant break up then make up..then break up again. No wonder people who suffer from alcoholism may experience heavy emotional damage. I know I certainly do.

Not hungover today but was just thinking of this and thought I might share. I hope you are all doing well on this Thanksgiving eve (or whatever you're doing in your home country) and find solace knowing that being sober doesn't mean your alone...it means you've kicked your abusive friend to the curb and you've found new company, a safe sanctuary where everyone is your friend and never your foe.

2020-11-25 12:14:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/k0w87w/alcohol_withdrawals_are_no_joke/,Alcohol withdrawals are NO JOKE,"Longtime lurker on this sub, but I finally have something to say. I'm writing this for anyone in their 20s who's recognized a drinking problem or has even admitted they are an alcoholic, but is having a hard time maintaining sobriety because of a lack of real consequences from their drinking. By real consequences I mean damage to your health/organs, DUI(s), loss of a job, loss of a relationship or home, etc. 

I was you, and your luck WILL run out. It's not a matter of if, but when. And if it's not directly from the alcohol itself, it very easily can be from the withdrawals as your addiction progresses.

I just turned 30 and a trip to the ER on Sunday is my wake-up call example. I apologize for the length.

TL;DR had a grand mal seizure while detoxing after my latest binge. If I weren't in the company of my father, I don't want to know what could have happened.

My drinking had gotten to the alcoholic level long before this awful past week. I've known I'm an alcoholic since I was 25, and the past 5 years have seen numerous stints of sobriety followed by progressively worse relapses.

I whiteknuckled 18 months after running into commercial property and leaving the scene, somehow avoiding DUI (plenty of other minor legal trouble but could have been so much worse). I've been lucky in that regard more times than I can count and never gotten one, though I'm definitely not proud of that.

I've had several 3-6 months runs of sobriety broken up by 3-6 day binges where the amount of liquor consumed in those sprees began to scare even me. But no ""real"" consequences from even the worst of my drinking. Though I left one arguably due to my drinking, I never lost a job. Never been homeless. I'm still married to the same beautiful woman I fell in love with 6 years ago (though I don't deserve her) and we have the most amazing baby girl. No DUIs, arrests, or jail time. Never hurt anyone (thank god).

And until this past weekend, no apparent real consequences to my health. That all changed this past weekend, and in my case it wasn't while I was drunk. It was the withdrawals.

Over the last 3-4 months I'd go about 30 days and fall into that same old binge pattern almost on cue. In the past my detox was nothing more than an inconvenience, but these withdrawals were growing more and more debilitating. What was once just a shaky, sweaty Sunday was becoming hours of violent vomiting and dry heaving to the point I thought my stomach was going to come out my throat. And this past Saturday night/Sunday morning became even worse. 

I knew the detox was going to be awful so I called upon the help and support of my dad, who at 15 years sober I'm so incredibly lucky to have. He picked me up from home and brought me to his house, where I commenced the violent vomiting and dry heaving for most of Saturday night. Once Sunday morning rolled around I thought I was past the worst of it, and was on to the cold sweats and headache.

Around 8am I sat down at the kitchen table to talk with my dad, who had just brought up his concern about the severity of my withdrawals, when he said I slowly started turning my head, staring off into space, and my left arm twitched heavily a couple of times.

A second later he said my jaw clenched tightly shut and my entire body shot out straight as a board, arms and legs completely stiff and the muscles in them hard as a rock. He kicked the chair out from under me and slowly guided my fall down to the floor where I proceeded to violently shake and foam at the mouth, eyes rolled to the back of my head, for the next 2.5 minutes, which must have seemed like an eternity to him. 

I remember nothing until opening my eyes and seeing my dad's face as he held my head in his lap, with a look on his face that will haunt me forever. I apparently asked who he was and what happened and he explained that I had just had a seizure and an ambulance was on the way. My dad thought he was watching his son die in his arms. 

I was taken to the ER where it was explained that I had had a grand mal seizure due to the alcohol withdrawal. After some IVs and a couple of hours of tests they let me go home under the direction that I cannot drive for 7 days. I was informed that if I drink again I'm almost certain to experience another seizure, and the likelihood of my withdrawals progressing to delirium tremens was very high.

This whole experience has scared the shit out of me. I'm enrolling in treatment this afternoon. To go from headaches to a seizure in a few relapses scares the absolute shit out of me.

And it should.

If my dad wasn't there and I was still at home alone who knows what could have happened. If I was in the shower or going down the stairs I could have been seriously injured or worse. If I was alone I could have choked on my own saliva and not had the chance to wake back up to this incredible life that I'm so fortunate hasn't been seriously damaged sooner. I could have left a 9 month old baby without a father and a wife without her husband. A father without his son.

I'm done. I have to be. There are no more chances. If I drink again there's a good chance I will fall into oblivion. 

So if you're young and struggling to stay sober because alcohol hasn't REALLY messed your life up, please know that your luck will run out in one way or another. If you're lucky enough to avoid the DUIs and jail time, it will be your health that it takes.

It could be your life. If not from organ failure, then from the withdrawals.

Please don't drink with me today. There is nothing to gain from taking that first drink, but everything to lose. Wish me luck in this new chapter of sobriety.

P.S. - thank you all for your inspiring and helpful posts over the years. They've made all the difference in times of need, I hope someone out there can relate to my experience.

EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words of encouragement and support!! It really means so much in a time like this to know how many of you are out there facing the same battles every day. Although I hate seeing how many people are all too familiar with the pains of withdrawal, I'm so happy that my story helped even one of you from taking the first drink today. I wanted to elaborate a little more on the amounts I was drinking since it seems like a lot of people can relate to my patterns..

From basically 23-26 I was a daily if not almost daily drinker, where the amounts progressed from a few beers a night, to a few mixed drinks, to 1-2 pints of vodka per day for about 18 months, until I got sober for the first time. I drank to self-medicate, numb the pain of anxiety and depression, and then it became drinking simply to relieve the physical and mental torture that stopping produced.

I could only last a few hours near the end of that period without taking at least a shot to stop the hurt. Then I messed up, realized my problem was a danger to others, and got ""sober"" for 18 months (during which time I self-medicated with any other substance I could get my hands on).

The last 3 years have basically been short/medium periods of true sobriety with more and more dangerous relapses (continuous binge drinking for days on end until stopping cold turkey and suffering the consequences). The last 12 months I have been on and off benzos for anxiety, which I am certain played a role in each relapse, and certainly added to this most recent withdrawal nightmare. 

This most recent binge was about 6 straight days of 1+L vodka or whiskey per day, until taking my last drink Saturday afternoon, and suffering a seizure Sunday morning around 8am. 

I'm sure the amounts at which withdrawals become dangerous vary greatly from person to person. I realize that stopping cold turkey can be insanely dangerous, which is pretty much why I made this post. To show people that you might get away with it, or with minimal physical consequences, for a long time. 

But one day you won't. 

Thank you all so much for your support. I'm beginning out-patient treatment Monday.


EDIT: Quoting u/hyperfat's comment: 

A little bit of a PSA, please anyone who is trying to quit cold turkey after years of chronic alcoholism, please please consult a clinic on how to proceed safely. 

Alcohol withdrawal is one of the only withdrawals you can die from. DEAD.

My problem is that I binge. There‚Äôs no such thing as one drink. Why waste the calories on that? Instead, I‚Äôd drink to get drunk, always socially. The worst was a night I went to a very fancy event and felt very out of place. Several glasses of wine later, I began to black out. I ‚Äúcame to‚Äù in the bath in my velvet dress, sitting in a freezing cold shower, my husband standing over me screaming for me to get up. Apparently I threw up all over my car on the way home. I continued drinking after that but finally stopped four years ago on New Year‚Äôs Day. I have one drink a year to celebrate my dad, who passed away, but no other alcohol, not even a sip. Last night I decided to have a hard cider. We‚Äôre on vacation and it sounded really good, so I ordered it. I only drank half because I felt a buzz starting and I felt good with my decision. About 30 minutes later regret sank in. I don‚Äôt drink because I don‚Äôt stop. I stopped last night, but I never should have begun. Today is a new day.

NA beer may be a trigger for some, but for others, it helps them beat the craving without them having to feel excluded or asking a lot of questions from family members or friends. Tons of recipes for mocktails on Pinterest too!
2. Have an exit plan. If you're going to someone else's house for Thanksgiving make sure to have a plan in place, so that if you start seeing your will run out then you can simply get up and go for a walk or make an Irish goodbye. Most importantly park your car where you won't get boxed in.
3. Eat all the food you want! Use all those extra calories that you aren't drinking for all the mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, and pie!
4. Reach out to a friend or a sober community like this one. If you are a mom, Sober Mom Tribe is a great one as well. 
5. Move your body. Go for a walk, dance, do some yoga, stretching. When we move our body dopamine gets released. Dopamine is the same feel-good chemical that gets released when drinking or using, so moving your body is the best way to get those same feel-good chemicals without ingesting a toxin. 
6. Remember your WHY. When times get tough it's important to remember why we're embarking on this alcohol-free journey, to begin with. For your health? For your kids?

I am sure I am not alone in the desire to have just one glass of wine over the coming holiday.

I often romanticize about having a glass of wine with a charcuterie board, or getting a little tipsy with a partner. Enjoying a craft beer and sitting on a sun soaked porch and conversing with friends. It sounds amazing.

The truth for me is that I never drank this way. It was whiskey until I black out, pass out, wake up and polish off the bottle. Getting so drunk with a partner that I can't remember anything and embarrass myself. Yelling about philosophy at my friends after 20 shitty beers.

It seems nice, but it just isn't how I work. Finding other ways to channel that energy and interest has been a challenge, but rewarding in its own way. I still want a bottle of wine to enjoy over the coming holiday, but I know it won't stop there and I am better off without it. Its a particular struggle.

A joke I read on here a few weeks ago. An alcoholic is walking down the street when he passes by a bar. He sees someone walk in, order a drink, talk with strangers, then leave. He says to himself, ""Man, if I could drink like that I would drink everyday!""

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

1. I quit drinking to help improve my insomnia/anxiety. It worked. But, occasionally it comes back. When that happens, the little thought of ‚ÄúIf this is back, what was the point of quitting drinking?‚Äù creeps back in. I assure myself that there are many other good reasons I quit, and the thought passes. But why is it here? I think it‚Äôs because:

2. I am relocating my family right now. I got promoted, we‚Äôre moving to a new city, and our truck arrives today. We haven‚Äôt been able to sell our house in the old city yet, so the double mortgage stress, combined with worrying about how my wife and kids are handling it, really ratchets up the anxiety. I‚Äôm very fortunate/blessed to have a great career though, so I don‚Äôt want to sound humble-braggy. There‚Äôs a possibility I made a huge mistake in accepting this, and the timeline that I agreed to. I also worry about meeting new people and making friends in our new neighborhood, especially for my wife. It sucks, but a lot of people will write off the new guy who doesn‚Äôt drink, so I have to prepare and gear up for another big wave of explaining it to new people. 

Drinking would stop the gears from constantly turning about all of this, but also make it 10 times worse, because of the accomplishment I‚Äôd be throwing away, and the shame I would feel about that. It won‚Äôt happen, but when I‚Äôm laying here wide awake in the dark, with a dry mouth from a salty steak I ate, it feels a lot like day 1 again.

I lost my best friend to an overdose and had to resuscitate another friend from one in the same week. Earlier this month I had a pretty sudden breakup that ended up resulting in me blowing up on my ex and me slipping into a relapse a couple days later and I had to move out.

 It ended up being a messy breakup when we kept coming back and forth to each other until we broke up one more time and I slept with someone else right after she left my house when I was drunk and she ended up having never left, and walked back in to confront me and I ended up getting belligerently drunk until 1 in the afternoon the next day and passing out and missing a mandatory work meeting at 2. 

Everything about this should have been a pattern I'd fall into again. My heart was broken and I felt so guilty that I normally would have just drowned those feelings in a bottle. But something in me broke that next day where it finally hit me that everything I was doing was so selfish and now I wasn't just hurting myself but everyone around me if I kept doing what I was doing. I needed to be sober and it needed to be different this time. No exceptions. 

I looked up meetings and committed myself to go, and my new roommate was very encouraging, especially since I was having strong feelings I'd relapse into my other drug use beyond alcohol. 

At first, I was so anxious I wouldn't even turn the corner. It was an outdoor meeting, around a campfire, and it felt less intimidating. But I was still shaking in my seat. It was my second meeting in my life, and the first I'd been to alone. But then I got to the end of it and I felt so much peace, so much calmer, so much less alone in everything that I've been going through. I actually slept okay when the previous night I couldn't stop tossing and turning. 

Today I saw my ex on the street with her mom. I was supposed to meet her before it all fell apart and it broke my heart all over again. Originally I was going to just go to the sauna with my roommate and decided that I needed the meeting way more. And I went. And I feel so much better.

I actually feel like I'm taking real steps this time. I'm actually starting to unpack why I abuse substances and even though I'm not there yet, take steps to forgive myself.

I know this may get under some peoples skin, or sound pretentious, or maybe im experiencing an emotional drunken night and stumbled upon my computer. This is not the case, Ive had this outlook for about five years now.

TLDR: I dont care if I die at the age of 40 from poor health, I dont care to live over that anyways. Its not that Im sad, or any other emotional reason, but my outlook on life. Its a tad difficult to change someones perspective on such a heavy and personal topic. Everyone around me seems to care, as if this is some monstrous deal that I drink often. I am functional, I work, I come home and I write music while I drink myself to sleep. And ive never been happier. However, they are looking at my life through their outlook and philosophy on life and applying it onto me. Seeing me as a miserable man who drinks because of all these deep emotional issues. The gods honest truth is that I just dont give a damn. Id be content dying in the next hour. And eventually, they will die too. If someone is truly a happy person in debauchery, why stop him?

My drinking hasnt done anything but spend my money, which Id gladly give away. I dont have much need for anything, hell, I would be fine living in my civic. What do you say to someone who is an alcoholic and completely satisfied with it? What can you really say to someone who truly doesnt care about his life, plans to live to 40 at most and is content with it? Im not depressed, or angry, what happened in my life happened, things happen to everyone. If I got fired from my job today, so what? If I died from drinking too much, so what?

Ive been on both sides. Sober, alcoholic. I much more prefer being an alcoholic, because regardless of if I am sober or a drinker at the end of the day. I never cared about my life, thought it was of much importance, and needed to make this drastic enlightened change. I will die sooner than you, but youll die too. And wherever that leads to be it nothingness or afterlife, wed end up in the same place regardless of whatever decisions we made while we lived on this planet.

Im not trying to be stubborn, Im genuinely curious how you would approach a drinker like this. Ive been through the whole show of meetings, the steps, and I personally think it was probably the absolute worst approach, for me. Im not speaking for everyone, its clearly done some amazing things.

IVe been to therapy for over 8 years. Ive been to dozens of therapists and doctors and I truly believe it has nothing to do with these ""root issues"" that cause the symptom of alcoholism and drug use, its a philosophical/perspective belief. Ive expressed this to plenty of therapists that were actually very good but its a difficult question to answer.

There are two big things that happened to me in the past couple of days.  A situation with my friend, I have been having these feelings of selfishness and it was causing me to make not-so-smart decisions.  I put a stop to that quickly and fix it quickly.  I didn't run and hide behind drinking.

Another one was at my job.  I handled a situation that came up, calmly and rationally.  I spoke up and defended myself to my boss.  Something I never do.

It really is amazing watching the transformation right before my eyes.

Thank you SD.  I'm getting better!!

I‚Äôve been a heavy drinker for almost eight years now, it started out socially and quickly became a problem, it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôve realized that I can‚Äôt live much longer living that lifestyle. My last big binge was around a month ago, I bought over two liters of vodka and lost almost a week of my life, I missed work and more importantly missed out on time with my wife.

I‚Äôve gone longer than this without drinking, but those times were generally due to lack of money or ways to obtain liquor, this time is different. I have money, and I had every opportunity to buy booze these last few days, but I made the concious decision not to. I recently got a full time position at my work, and I have the day off tomorrow, so I am incredibly proud of myself for not caving and buying the stuff and losing time.

I feel incredibly lucky to have a wife who has stood by me through this, and a job that has been more than understanding despite my several missed days, it just seems selfish to ignore the great things I have in my life just so I can get drunk.

I feel amazing, my appetite is in full force and I can actually get a decent nights sleep, and I‚Äôve been spending much more quality time with my wife and our two dogs. The longer I‚Äôm sober the more I realize just how much I have to be grateful for and how much time I‚Äôve wasted, well, being wasted.

Changes:
Feeling ready to start my day when I wake up & actually feeling tired when I go to sleep.
Better quality sleep, fewer nightmares.
Some weight loss (not binge eating as much).
Feeling more patient with others and generally more engaged with what the kids are doing.
Incorporated 30 mins of yoga into my daily routine.
Pain in my right side is gone.
Not constantly thinking about alcohol and planning my life around my next drink. 
More time and desire to try new hobbies.
Less consumed by guilt and regrets, feel like a better person in general. 
Fewer cravings for alcohol, and when I do have cravings, they have become easier to ignore. 
Smoking about 4x as many cigarettes (not all changes are positive).
Able to deal with unplanned events better (ie. able to give kids last minute rides in the evenings due to not being drunk). 
Feel more comfortable being alone as well as with others (this could also be the antidepressants I‚Äôm on though).
More comfortable telling others that I don‚Äôt drink. 


Same as week 1:
Still have bad days where I feel really sad and have to give myself mental pep talks to get through the day. 
Still working on repairing relationship with SO.
Still feel the need to participate in counselling.
Still have to avoid deviating too much from my non-drinking routine to avoid situations that I‚Äôm not ready to handle (travel, certain kinds of gatherings).

I noticed that ever since I started drinking 8 years ago that I have developed a nasty habit of lying. I thought I could easily have self-control over this habit but I do it constantly and people call me out on it all the time. I recently got blackout drunk and said a bunch of dumb stuff that I can't even remember and it cost me all my friends and my best friend. I've hit rock bottom and want to change for the better. I've always coped with my problems in the past by drinking and this time I'll be coping with my issues by attempting to be 100% sober and becoming a better person. I am terrified. Terrified that the more sober I become, the more I remember about my past actions and all the people I threw away.

Thursday night a friend and I decided to get loaded, shoot some pool, and who knows what else may happen. So we are in my basement shooting pool, a 12 pack is being hit pretty hard and then we ran out.  Oh well, no problem! I thought, I have a handle of Bacardi upstairs I‚Äôll just go snag that. This night started around 6 pm. 2 am comes around, we have walked and bought / cooked steaks for whatever reason completely shitfaced and at this point we kept hitting the bottle hard. 4 am comes by, still drinking, bottle is almost empty so we decide to go to his place next door and do a dab. I don‚Äôt remember even going to his house (or falling down a flight of stairs), or waking up in my front yard to my stepbrother leaving for work at 5 am. (He lives with me.) he helped me into my bed and I slept until 6pm the next day. Woke up still drunk, but the hangover that came my way was one of the worst I‚Äôve had in 10 years.. (27M) so it was at that point I had decided to quit cold turkey.  I‚Äôve been a daily (heavy) drinker for probably more than 10 years now, and at my worst i was starting in the morning and didn‚Äôt stop all day. I have puked more than 30 times, and I still can barely keep water down. Death would honestly be a mercy for me at this point. I have a migraine that nothing will treat, if I move too fast I‚Äôll puke up what little water I‚Äôm keeping in my stomach, and it feels like there‚Äôs needles in my throat every time I swallow. Puking has slowed down to about once an hour but it‚Äôs still agonizing every time. I get winded walking to the fridge and back, shaking is off the charts, light hallucinations/ lucid dreaming as I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep properly in days, heartbeat is irregular.. Don‚Äôt be like me. Please back off before you get to this point. Quitting heroin was easier than this (for me.) I‚Äôd rather be dead right now and I‚Äôm not just being melodramatic.

This has been the longest I've ever gone without drinking since I first started over a decade ago. Even as my health declined and my soul was chipped away from keeping my heavy drinking a secret from everyone in my life, it took an unrelated hospital stay (and subsequent detox while there) to finally stop. I can't speak for everyone's journey, but my experience has been that it's always hardest for me to quit at the start. I was in the danger zone for withdrawals and it was agony if I didn't have enough alcohol in my system. I couldn't function without it. I wouldn't get drunk as much as I would get ""normal."" I would drink as much as I needed to stop shaking, make me hungry enough to eat food, and ward off the terrible anxiety. 

I was absolutely terrified to quit, not because I was scared of a life without drinking, but because I was scared of the process and the hardship I knew would come by quitting and not knowing how long it would last. I was, very much, self medicating.

I can't tell you just how happy I am to wake up every morning at a normal time (not 5 am, craving a drink and unable to sleep), not having to think of an excuse to go on a walk and secretly down 3 shots from a bottle hidden in the trunk of my car to feel slightly normal, having to premake a drink in a water bottle so I could have at lunch, another mid day, another before dinner, and another before bed. Not traveling to friends or family because it would be too hard to plan a 5 hour drive without a drink, then having to sneak drinks there. It was miserable and I was so scared to stop because of some stupid fear it would be worse or I would die. I. Am. So. Glad.

This all being told to say to anyone on the fence or wondering, it gets better. I'm so much happier not having drinking literally rule my life. I've rediscovered hobbies. I feel better. I'm a hell of a lot healthier. Even after the first month my labs are better than they've been in years. I can't wait to go to the doctor in a month and see what they are now! The weight off my shoulders from hiding liquor bottles and wondering how I could buy alcohol without my wife noticing makes me feel like I can fly! 

Every once in a while I get the urge to have a few, but it quickly disappears. I know I'll never get the same high I got drinking when it was fun and a relaxing activity with friends. I broke myself somehow and chasing that feeling will only lead me back to that pit. I can't get that feeling of euphoria from drinking anymore and last time I tried, it led to despair. I'm thankful for this wisdom, even though it sucked a lot to gain it. 

100 days of a better me. As I said, my drinking was a complete secret, so I can't celebrate this victory with anyone but you all, haha. Here's to many more days, mine and yours. It. Gets. Better!

Also, given that we are in a pandemic, does it really seem possible that hand sanitizer is enough to cause a bad reaction? I don't always have access to a bathroom but I do have hand sanitizer on hand at most times in my car or at my office.

I always compare it to breaking up in a relationship. 

One person or maybe both parties feel that it isn't working out anymore. Maybe the spark isn't there. Maybe your needs aren't being met. Maybe they cheated on you. Whatever the case is, breaking up is hard. Why is it hard? Because you're getting out of a routine. You're used to seeing them or talking to them all the time. You're accustomed to texting them when you're having a bad day. So you miss them for the comfort they provided. You know that they aren't right for you, but you miss the good times. 

The same logic can be applied to alcohol. 

Alcohol was our comfort. On good days. On bad days. On any day ending with a y. üòÇ When our brain is used to running to alcohol, then, of course, it will be hard to interrupt that thought pattern. It's a habit that's on autopilot. 

Of course, you're going to miss it, because your brain is thinking about the good moments. Funny how that works, huh? Our mind thinks of the one time we could ""control"" our drinking instead of the 50 other times we made a fool of ourselves, blacked out, and acted in a way around our kids that we regret. 

My whole point is to say it's ok to miss drinking and never want to drink again. It's ok to miss that moment of euphoria that alcohol gave us, but we have to play the tape forward. We have to remind ourselves of why we broke up with alcohol in the first place. It wasn't serving us. Physically, mentally, or spiritually.

I broke up with my girlfriend back in September. I had gotten to a point where I just couldn't take being in that relationship anymore. She was all take and no give. At the end of the day, she didn't want a partner- she wanted someone she could take advantage of. I knew I'd be lonely after breaking up with her, but I also knew that it was the healthy thing to do. 

As I lie here in bed after a night of binge drinking, followed by a terrible night's sleep, I'm having a bit of an epiphany: alcohol is nothing but a faithless, selfish girlfriend that I'm scared to break up with, because I don't want to feel alone or bored. I continue to keep inviting you into my home. Introducing you to my friends. Getting in bed with you. But just like with my ex, I'm getting to a breaking point with you. Enough is enough. I know you're going to throw a fit and try to make my life hell when I end things with you. You're going to try and make me feel like I'm a loser for breaking up with you. You're going to rub it in my face as you go around and openly flirt with nearly everyone I know. You're going to show up at my house unannounced, drunk, and bang on my front door, saying ""Baby... Please... Just open the door... Babe I'm sorry.... Just... I want to try again... Please open the door...""

Nope. Just like if you were a real person, I'm not letting you back in. You're toxic, and I'm not interested in associating with you any more. We can't even be just friends, because I know you'll try to manipulate me into worshipping you again. My time and money has been wasted on you, and I'm done. For good.

The first 3 days I didn‚Äôt even try to make myself go to bed..stayed up until 4am. I‚Äôm a graduate student and VERY lucky to not have a traditional work schedule. Last night I got sleepy at 10pm. The sweats have subsided a bit and the mood swings are my next hurdle. 

My husband rarely drinks but he‚Äôs never been critical of my drinking, except when I express wanting to cut back and don‚Äôt. He‚Äôs proud of me but does not understand withdrawals at all.

Drinking put my mom in the ICU for a month 4 years ago. She still drinks and does other drugs. I have no contact with her. I detest her addictions and lifestyle. I‚Äôm not strong enough to love her at any distance. Years before the hospitalization she told me to give drinking a 3 day break and ‚Äúthe whole world will look different‚Äù. 

She was right about that. Looking ahead is strange and brand new to me. I know we focus on not drinking today but this is the farthest I‚Äôve ever come. Most people relapse right? Should I plan on that? Forever is a long time and I don‚Äôt know if that was ever the plan. I just wanted to see myself more clearly without the wine fog. Ive learned a ton. 

Feeling emotions and knowing I don‚Äôt have the shelter of wine to hold out for makes me feel so naked and exposed. I‚Äôve bawled my eyes out so many times the past few days. It‚Äôs scary out here without wine. 

Seasoned quitters continue to have waves of understanding and struggles. I‚Äôm not sure where I‚Äôm going with this. I‚Äôve told family and friends I wanted to get the physical addiction kicked and then I‚Äôd evaluate. 

My strange coping mechanism has been reverting to habits of my childhood. Probably sounds weird but I‚Äôm trying to remember who I was before I became dependent on wine. listening to Harry Potter and doing puzzles with junk food.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

After the first year which was all pink cloud and stuff, the one year mark was a bit of a letdown as instead of being happy at the anniversary I just saw this unending sober future in front of me like some yawning chasm and it was pretty daunting. I lay  on the couch on my 1 year sober day and stared at the ceiling for 4 hours just thinking ""fuck its always going to be like this.."".

I was undergoing counselling at this time and talked it out with them and kinda made peace with it, the alternative is self-loathing, illness and death all the stuff we know about.

The last few weeks have been pretty stressful as a couple of friendships have broken down irretrievably due to various reasons. I keep having daydreams of when I was in my 20's (im 48 now) and was living in London in a band, hanging out with other bands, i had tons of friends and it was all clubs and cool bars and sexy people and music and drugs and alcohol. I didn't care about my career as i didn't have one, if I wanted to get fucked up and sleep for two days I could. These ""carefree"" memories keep coming back to me, things i haven't thought about for years, and the last week or so, i am constantly dreaming that I have broken my sobriety and started drinking and am firmly back on the booze and back to the old comfort of london pubs full of sticky bars and old depressed men. So I am dreaming about it whether im awake or asleep! This is pure romanticism I am intellectually aware of that, but for the first time since getting sober (i drank myself into the hospital and nearly died) I have this feeling of inevitability. That some day and someday soon, I am going to drink its just a matter of when.

I dont want to drink, and it will undo all the work i have put in, ive lost good friendships, some of over 25 years partly because of their drinking and my sobriety. I was lucky to keep my job but my boss and (young) colleagues and the whole dept still look at me as that old drunk guy who's a bit of a joke, but ive regained their trust for the most part. 

Why is this happening to me now? This nostalgia for the chaos is going to kill me. 

In these drinking dreams I realise at some point that i have broken my sobriety and my reaction is like oh no! well youve done it now, might as well enjoy it.

If any of you especially those with long term sobriety under your belts could offer some advice as to what you do when/if these feelings arise I would appreciate it. 

I will not drink with you today!

2020-11-24 02:21:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/k00fiq/a_warning_against_selfdetox/,A warning against self-detox,"Hey, I fell super heavy into drinking this summer when I figured out there were two locations I could walk to and get six-packs from. Doubling the amount I could drink. When I tried to quit, I had withdrawal symptoms, but I also just had fibro pain and a mild sunburn. I did research and talked to people and decided to try self-detoxxing while waiting to get into rehab, which reneged on their offer for me.

There is a reason they only say to self-detox if you are with family and loved ones. I couldn't do it. I'd get to 8 beers and couldn't do less. I started falling on the ground, hitting my head, and having to crawl to get up because I have Cerebral Palsy. I could not get ahold of my few ""loved ones"" to ask them to take my cat so I could go to the hospital for detox. I ended up drinking until I finally got in with my dr who gave me valium to come off it.

My cat died 6 days after I got sober from everything. But, also, my brain's not right. The memory is worse than usual. I have weird gum recession and muscle loss so I can't eat, and my skin aged. And to what part of this is drinking vs grief vs not eating, I don't know. But I wish I had said fuck it and gone to the ER and texted my friend about my cat.  Chances are I would have been in outpatient rehab or out by the time my cat passed, but healthier and with less shame because like, my final straw was being promiscuous and I was like, ""I am doing this just to feel something,"" and luckily neither encounter led to full hetero sex. No, I don't date right now. I don't look for friendships. Abstaining from sex and relationships is easy once you really wish to change. But you have to wish to change. I was sober twice for 6 months each but didn't understand what I needed to actually recover.

Anyway, self-detoxxing is dangerous because as alcoholics many of us lack the self-control to actually drink less each day unless supervised. And rehabs are moving away from detoxxing also. Because valium works just as well, at least for someone who doesn't have DT's.

And no, obviously I do not have a lot of loved ones if I couldn't get a hold of anyone to watch my cat while I was in the hospital. I am flabbergasted tbh because I told people I was falling down and hitting my head. All I can say is after I sobered my friend told me he would have come and got the cat if I had texted at the hospital. If you can't find anyone to supervise or hold your hand, go to the hospital even during covid, because drinking is far more dangerous than our culture pretends.

And it is NOT sexy to drink yourself to death. And no one will come to rescue you. You have to pick yourself off the floor, and go to the doctor. Anyway. Hopefully my body will sort itself out. It's funny. For years, I didn't care if I lived or died and I treated my body like shit and it never occurred to me that someday, I would feel happy enough to want to live and be a productive person. And it certainly never occurred to me that this would only occur to me after I fucked my body up. Because I'm 37, which seems young to me, but it's not. And it's definitely not young when it comes to alcohol. Who knew? I thought that when you were young your biggest risk was alcohol poisoning.

FWIW, if anyone is still drinking, the time it took for me to devolve from my normal problem drinking to holy-shit-this-is-out-of-control, was less than two months. Society acts like it's ok to abuse our bodies for a short amount of time if we stop and let it heal later but ... society is all kinds of messed up.

I wouldn't say that I needed to go to the ER when I started having withdrawal but by the time I was falling and hitting my head, yes, and I just want to reiterate that I was honest with people at this point because I was desperate. I think I wanted someone to tell me to go. But no one did. You have to rescue yourself. So if you can't, go to the doctor or ER, ok? Because even a few extra weeks or so of drinking can lead to huge health issues or you could injure yourself or others. Even during covid, ok? Do you know how many times I now have to go to the doctor?

This week I finished reading *The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion* by Jonathan Haidt. Very interesting book with cleanly lain-out, easy to understand arguments presented, most of which I personally ended up agreeing with. 

Haidt spends a lot of this book talking about various interesting ways the human mind works. It had me thinking about sobriety and recovery quite a lot. The author didn't say much on these particular topics, but I did a lot of dot connecting on my own. He talks about the ways in which things like music, certain drugs, and participating in rituals involving large groups of people (like a church service or a college football game) all switch the human mind from a ""me"" to an ""us"" mode that is very pleasurable for us. I kept thinking about the sentence one so often hears in recovery: ""the opposite of addiction isn't sobriety. The opposite of addiction is human connection."" I believe this idea originated in a TED talk a few years ago by Johann Hari. I've heard it repeated many times by both addiction experts as well as just fellow travelers here at SD and I think there's something to it. 

Haidt talks a lot about how essentially ""groupish"" people are in this book and how that groupishness has helped us conquer the world as a species. I do think that sense of belonging is important on a primal level and some of us learn to shortcut to that feeling by drinking. At some point, it no longer works and alcohol starts making us more isolated and bitter, but by then we are hooked. I think this is why having a strong sense of community in a support group is so helpful for us. Not only is it great to know that you're not alone in having succumbed to an addiction that you now must fight, but you're fulfilling that need for connection in a real and meaningful way and in a sense, feeding your soul what it was actually after all along. Makes the bitterness of saying goodbye to the booze a lot easier to swallow. Of course I think alcoholism is a really complex condition and these things alone do not create or fix it, but I think they could be significant parts of it. 

*The Righteous Mind* is a good one. Haidt weaves together aspects of philosophy, sociology, and psychology into a compelling argument that is a pleasure to read regardless of how far you're willing to buy into it. 

I think I saw this one recommended here so thanks to whichever of you suggested it. I think it was actually more than one of you. I read a lot of articles about books and listen to a lot of podcasts where authors are on plugging their books so I usually forget where I heard about each book. Often it's in the zeitgeist and I hear about them from multiple sources.

Or .. they were those friends that laughed at you. That got a kick out of it - it became their story to be told whenever I came around.

Suddenly, to some of them, things ‚Äúaren‚Äôt even that bad‚Äù, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to quit drinking...‚Äù, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have a problem‚Äù, ‚Äújust drink with me tonight‚Äù. Like, I can‚Äôt believe someone would say that to someone they call a friend - but then again I can. 

Because honestly, people don‚Äôt get it and I can‚Äôt be angry at them for that. They don‚Äôt get it until they themselves get there - if they even get there. So many people are just riding the wave - taking it in. Living with it day to day, ever so slightly - the feelings that seem to have hit us over the head. 

I am 140 days sober (I still smoke pot, but that‚Äôs next) and the past few days more than ever my feelings and bad memories have been crashing over me. 

Last night I laid in bed until 3 am just recounting my life from start to finish and really looked at all the extremely difficult things I came to face. How much I went though , a look at when my drug use started and when the drinking got really bad. I thought about all of my horribly unhealthy past relationships and the massive mistakes I made. 

I‚Äôm not saying I sat there dwelling on them or shaming myself for them. But when I came to think about it I realized how actually I never have deeply faced my past. I have always covered my pain and heart break with substance. 

I was dealt a heavy hand by the age of 15, I am 30 now. I still was and am extremely lucky and blessed. But the past few months me make really see that I don‚Äôt have all that strong of a support system. 

I have my parents , my mom - who doesn‚Äôt drink at all, so she really doesn‚Äôt get it but she is proud of me. My father who could possibly be classified as a functioning alcoholic with a strong family history of alcoholism and a history of mental health problems. 
Little brother who is a junior at an Ivy League college, need I say more? 

My boyfriend who has his own issues with alcohol but faces denial and doesn‚Äôt really show any interest in understanding the issues and problems it creates in his and our lives. He is completely supportive of me though and even though I know it is tough for him some days , he is encouraging and patient. 

Then there‚Äôs those friends, the ones that just don‚Äôt get it. They were once your closest friends - but they haven‚Äôt even congratulated you, haven‚Äôt cheered you on once, don‚Äôt ask if you‚Äôre okay. I guess I don‚Äôt get it - but I guess I don‚Äôt need to. The bottom line is I have faced so much and at the other end of everything the main lesson has really been that I‚Äôve got myself to hold accountable.. I have my own back. 

Life is tough for all of us, I‚Äôm certainly not trying to say I should be everyone‚Äôs concern. Like I said, I am extremely blessed and I am very grateful for my loved ones. I just really imagined sobriety being like some sort of movement that brought them into this understanding with me. So far it has been sort of awkward and clumsy around everyone. No one really knows what to think or feel or do or say. 

I can only hope time will heal the wounds of the pain and worry I brought so many people in my drunken escapades. Hopefully it heals my shame and embarrassment. My deepest darkest moments..

So, early in November on my way out to work I slipped on my porch and twisted up my lower back and right hip pretty bad. After visiting the ER ( my gf drove me) I knew I was gonna be off work because I could barely move. Luckily x rays showed no damage to discs so it was mainly muscle and ligament related. A few days later the depression set in and I started pounding the whiskey. Almost for a week straight I drank 20 to 30 ounces of whiskey a day to the point I was puking and couldn't eat. Just angry at myself and everything else. But I came out of it. I knew I had to stop, I couldn't keep food down and I couldn't function without a glass of whiskey and I could still barely move...

I snapped out of it, went through about 3 days of severe withdrawal, and I found once I started to feel better the thought of alcohol repulsed me. I've had long periods of sobriety in the past but it was always really tough. This time around ( can't count how many of those I've had) I feel different. I'm only just over a week in but I feel a very strong urge to move into a more spiritual lifestyle. Drinking makes me very self centered, and after the realization of just how bad I can get I think I'm finally on the right path. One where it won't be a fight to stay sober. Call it a spiritually enlightening moment I guess but I think this time I'll go alot longer than even the 2.5 years I went a few years back.

I just wanted to take a moment tonight to say thank you to everyone who posts, shares, or just reads /r/stopdrinking for helping me to be able to get here.  I don't post much on here anymore these days, but I do still read through this sub pretty often and find it enormously helpful every time I do.  

When I first stopped drinking being Sober became the paramount facet of my identity.  During that time I was posting here multiple times a day and reading every single thread and comment, clinging to them like a life preserver.  For those first couple of weeks just knowing that others were going through the same thing as me, having the same thoughts and experiences, and seeing how they were able to cope and live without drinking helped give me the strength to be able to do the same.  Sharing my experiences helped break the cycle of denial and kept me from ignoring my problems and stay accountable to myself.

Over time I was able to go slowly grow from a guy who was desperately clinging to being Sober just to stay alive, to a guy who was struggling but maintaining, to a sober guy who was doing ok, to a sober guy who was doing well, to a guy who just doesn't drink, to finally now just a guy.  After so many years of struggling to quit, then finally actually doing so, not having alcohol define my life anymore is indescribably freeing and is something that I'm enormously proud of.  

This subreddit has helped me more than any other method I've used to get and stay sober.  Whether you're on your first day 1 or your 100th, you're a month sober, a year, or a decade, just being here has helped me enormously so for that I say, Thank You.

I've had GERD for years because of drinking almost every day, eating shit food for comfort when I don't and chain smoking cancer and herb when I drink. Because of this, my chest hurts often from the smoke and GERD damaging my esophagus, Dr said that's how the nerves work I guess. I've just never loved myself enough to care to quit even though I'm in discomfort a lot of the time.   


Anyways, I've been a wreck for 3 days now wondering if my chest hurts from GERD or Covid. I'm so freaking done with the anxiety, feeling like crap all the time, going to the clinic or urgent care, random muscle pain, stupid decisions and being a grumpy asshole from getting shit sleep or not having booze. Not being able to tell if it's Covid or not has really been the straw that broke the camels back on my drinking and other addictions.   


I'm hopefully getting tested soon and in the meantime quarantining myself. I was planning to just take a break and have drinks on Turkey Day but F that, that's just me rationalizing and etching my way back to my addiction so I decided not to give in. It's going to be a shit Thanksgiving but at least this year I'll have a few days of sobriety to be thankful for, hopefully.   


Thanks to anyone who is reading this though, most of my family drinks except my mom (similar but more sever issues than me, minus the cigs) so when she isn't around or available to talk, I have no one else I feel comfortable confiding in. My brother, who is living with me, drinks 6-8 24oz malt beers every other night and it's almost the only time he socializes with me so I know this is going to be very hard for us both.

I got sober back in June 2019 after several years of heavy drinking. I was very forthcoming with my fraternity brothers and friends about my ordeals and the process I went through.

One of my brothers graduated a few years ago and moved. Long story short he got married and has a kid now. His drinking has gotten consistently worse. He‚Äôs now hiding bottles and drinking alone. 

The straw that broke the camels back was that he was supposed to be a groomsman in a wedding for his fraternity little brother a few weeks back but he got so hammered off of booze and pills that he crashed his car and almost got into a fight with the mother in law. 

His wife reaches out to one of our fellow brothers and told us he needs help. He won‚Äôt listen to his wife, or his parents. Which leaves us.

I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôs not going to listen to us, and that the only thing that will make him open his eyes is something terrible happening to him, like a car wreck or getting fired from work.

He 100% believes addiction is a choice and that he could never have a drinking problem.

I‚Äôve been a weekend binge drinker since high school but it has not impacted my life in a dramatic way. I‚Äôve had some relationships that centered around drinking and I come from an Irish family that drinks quite a bit (my dad and sisters, mum drinks mostly tea) 

Since moving into my own place during quarantine I‚Äôve been drinking by myself frequently. Recently watching The Queens Gambit I realized I had more similar habits to the lead than I would have liked to admit (frequenting the local store to buy wine, drinking at home alone dancing to music) I  black out about once a week. 

Last night while hanging out with my family while watching a movie I nearly finished a 1.5 litre bottle of white wine to myself. That day I had already had two mimosas at breakfast and two canned margaritas drinks before dinner. 

This morning I woke up not remembering how I got home and there was broken wine glass on my floor and a new bottle of white wine in my fridge 3/4 full. The frightening thing is that I have been cycling everywhere and I could not remember if I had cycled home. I reached out to my mum to ask how I got home and she told me I had insisted on cycling home but that my dad dropped me off instead. I hate to think about what could have happened had I rode home while blacked out, I really could have died and I‚Äôm lucky that this happened while I was with my family. 

I‚Äôve been keeping some of my drinking habits secret and this morning opened up to my mum about my habit of drinking alone and drinking more by myself after seeing friends. I would like to try moderating my drinking with a rule like 3 drinks maximum or something but I‚Äôm not sure if the answer is to just quit entirely. 

I never want to blackout again. I really hope this is a turning point for me.

I'm sometimes genuinely afraid that I might do something stupid when I'm in that mindset. 

The thing is, so much of my life seems to revolve around alcohol: I go for a walk with friends but we take wine, my roommate was saying how she wants to invite a friend for brunch on Saturday and immediately my thought was ""oh fuck, but I wasn't gonna drink"", cos brunch and alcohol are so interconnected in my head. 

I'm also kind of a socially awkward person (although much better now) so I've always used alcohol to help me with that. I've always thought that alcohol was a way to help me be more myself and more open, but lately I've come to realize that drunk me is not who I am and it's actually someone I don't like: I exaggerate immensely, make a fool of myself, say things I don't mean,... 

It's just a bit scary cos when I cut out alcohol out of my life, I see these massive gaps because it takes up a lot of my energy, it seems. (even though, to be fair, there are weeks when I don't drink but it's just that when I do drink, it immediately becomes this massive presence in my life)

Has anyone had similar struggles? Could really use some advice or words of wisdom as I do want to make this work, mostly because the anxiety alcohol is giving me is too much.

Work has been the main reason of the drinking these days, and I don't know if it's just maturing or apathy, but I just can't care about it anymore. There's no more stress for my body and mind to give to that place. Sure, I'm not doing the best job I can, but it's not for me. Tele-Sales is not something I'm even slightly proud to do, so why worry if they get rid of me? That's just another door open to full time job search and find something I might enjoy more. Why does it have to be a disaster if I lose a job I hate? Simple answer, it's not, and I think today I've accepted that. 

Basically I'm just gonna focus on not drinking, that's it. Do the bare minimum at work, take my last few paychecks and run with them. Or, there's a chance I'll get moved to a different position, I don't really know and I need to stop acting like I do. I gotta stop acting like that job defines me and just realize I'm young, and a lot of people go through this point in their life. 

Many here have told me that job is a trap, and I think I finally get it. I don't know why today, I don't know why it's taken months upon months of restless night, panic attacks, and wasted days to get it through my thick skull. Hell, I'll work at walmart stocking shelves I don't care at this point. 

And the more sober I get the better off I'll be. The more likely I am to, and the faster I will, find a new job. In the meantime, I think that company's taken plenty from me, I'm gonna snag some free paychecks off them. IWNDWYT",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.996494710445404}"

I played golf and came home very mildly buzzed, I could have stopped, but of course not.  I poured myself a glass of 100 proof Evan Williams bourbon and then another.  By the time she was off of her zoom call and finished after a long ass day,  I was drunk, she was irritated.  This isn't the first time, this isn't the second time, not even the third, but for some reason I continue to put our relationship and our marriage in jeopardy.  I kept thinking when it happened before that I could chill out and drink a little bit here and there, have a couple and be fine, but in social situations, I just couldn't stop myself, then the same thing started happening at home, and now here we are....

We started arguing, loud, fighting, I started slamming doors and at one point even slammed my head in to the wall, called her names, and brought up stuff from 3 years ago that I let bother me and never addressed.  I packed a bag, threatened to leave, which didn't really do much.  I slammed the garage door so hard the Nest thermostat flew off the wall and broke, $250 mistake.  I just finished patching the wall, it looks ok, but it will be a constant reminder of what happened.

It took this situation for me to actually admit and say out lout that I think I am an alcoholic.  I am seeking help, I have been in a couple of situations the last two nights back to back with my family who drinks heavily and managed to stay sober with soda waters and diet cokes.  I am positive and looking forward to a change, but it is still tense at home.  She doesn't believe that I am really going to do this because I haven't given her any reason to.  So while I am feeling like I am moving in the right direction, even though it has only been 4 days, I don't feel like she is going to take it serious until she sees results.  With Thanksgiving around the corner, I am really going to be putting myself to the test.

Now, whenever my partner has a glass of wine, I get whiffs of it and it just reaffirms my choice.

It didn‚Äôt quite feel right, so I decided to post on this subreddit first before relapsing. Doing so saved me, because the responses were thoughtful and compassionate and reminded me that I quit for a reason. So I decided that I should hold off on drinking, at least for a little while.

Anyway, since then I‚Äôve basically been pampering the hell out of myself. Just spending money left and right, getting my nails done, trying new fancy skincare products, taking long ass bubble baths. Let me remind everyone that in my state of depression I did not want to do any of these things nor did I think they would help, but somehow they are helping. It feels good to indulge in some expensive self care. I‚Äôm sure this is not a good long term solution but for now, it helps :) Hopefully a few months from now these cravings will be a distant memory but for now, I‚Äôll take all the help I can get!

Well here we are , for a moment of time where I finally get to shout it from the digital rooftop . I stayed sober for a year.  It seems pretty surreal to me.  Over the years my drinking has been very problematic for myself and the other folks in my life.  I spent a lot of time just not getting it at all .  I really did not care about myself or what my drinking did to anyone and I think deep down it was a hatred for myself that fuelled my insanity.  It‚Äôs been a year of ups and downs but here are some of the things I have learned about life while being sober . 

I am a morning person .  I always wanted to be one. I always wanted to be up first and have that hour of silence before I get going for the day , a cup of coffee and silence before the sun comes up makes me feel good so I do it as often as I can .  

My focus and memory have greatly improved.  I would constantly forget important things and miss stuff at work.  I would show up half drunk to work from the night before and flounder for several hours before I actually could do anything worth paying me for . How my boss never caught on to this is still amazing.  I also had a very hard time remembering my childhood and though it‚Äôs not all there lots of things are coming back .  Also on the other side of that coin I remember a lot of bad things I have done while drinking. The fights , the dangerous situations , the risks that nobody should take.  

I finally respect myself .  This was a big one for me because it was what I like to call a root issue.  When I first started this I was told that drinking is a symptom of a deeper problem.  I had to chew on this for a while because I thought that my drinking was just something I did to let loose and it just got out of control .  Well after some time with a therapist it was pretty clear that I had some pretty serious self esteem problems and no self respect which stemmed from a fucked up childhood.  It‚Äôs not perfect yet but I will continue to get to the root of these problems because the more work I do the better I feel overall . 

I now have control over my finances- this has been a huge hurdle for me .  I was raised in a family by another alcoholic who like me thought they didn‚Äôt have to answer to anybody. Not my partner , or my bank , my cell phone company , creditors , my x wife .  I was always looking for ways to get out of it so I could keep all my money for parties, and that‚Äôs exactly what I did.  When I quit my bank account was 1300$ in overdraft every 2 weeks and my visa was maxed out around 5 grand . My paycheque would cover the overdraft and I refused to pay my visa.  I thought I was above it all.  This year I have paid back most of my debts and my partner and I with the help of a budget have purchased a new car , taken some trips and furnished our home with things we love and that make us happy .  I don‚Äôt miss wondering if I have the money for a case of beer or if I‚Äôll have enough for the rent .   

These are just a few instances of why I choose sobriety over alcohol every day one day at a time . My returns are greater when I‚Äôm not drunk . I have grown so much over the last year it‚Äôs safe to say that I‚Äôm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel .  Booze whispers softly in my ear sometimes still and I still get the urges to disappear for a moment here and then when the shit gets hard but every time I say no my suit of armour gets stronger.  

For the new folks or lurkers , yeah you , you can do this friends.  It‚Äôs so damn worth it.  

Also as a footnote because as a community I don‚Äôt see this talked about as much as we should SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP.  This place is a great way to connect with other addicts and people struggling but nothing can replace the help of a therapist or counselling.

Instead I curled up on the couch, put on some TV, and played a game on my phone. The craving was a strong one so I actually paid $9.99 for the bonuses to keep playing that stupid game. An hour later, while $10 poorer, the craving was gone and I slept like a baby.

Apologies for the long rambling but I think I need to write this down so I can hold myself accountable.

I used think of myself as a high functioning problem drinker. But now I'm just a problem drinker. I never drank in high school, and barely did in uni, mostly because I couldn't afford it. I worked in a restaurant as a cook, and saw my manager's drinking as a cautionary tale. When I got my first ""real"" job(back the mid-00s), I began drinking more socially, and the occasional afterwork beer at home with the roommates. Then I had the opportunity to live in Europe for five years and that's where things started to go out of control. A typical evening was a bottle of wine here, many cocktails there, and endless amounts of cigarettes. My boyfriend at the time was a bartender, and I left him because of his drug habits, but was in denial of my own problems. Somehow being an Asian woman with a taste for Scotch, and a high tolerance to alcohol became a novelty amongst my social circle, and I held on to it.

I moved back stateside a few years ago, got married, got divorced. I worked a really stressful, but good job(on paper) in the corporate world. This entire time I would be drinking at least a bottle of wine to myself a night, or drink at my local bar until closing. I would show up to work hungover, but powered through the days, and wore that ability as some alternate universe badge of honour. I was promoted and given my choices of projects etc. I was ""very successful"" by definition.

From a bottle a night, it became one and a half, then two. Covid WFH made it even worse and I began drinking by noon. I didn't see that I was deeply unhappy with my job and my relationship. I remember Annie Grace of The Naked Mind talk about drinking box wine instead of bottle to ease the feeling of guilt‚ÄîI did the exact same thing. My excuse was that I needed it to unwind, destress, and sleep. But I became a very unpleasant person when I drank. I became angry, and would pick fights with my then partner, slam doors etc.

Now at 37, my 2.5 year relationship ended end of summer. We had to move out of the house we shared together, so I'm crashing at a friend's house. And then I was laid off last month(this part sucks, but I'm okay with it, I hated my job, and didn't have to courage to leave on my own). I've been in many shitty situations before, but at 37, this was just too much at once. I'm just so tired.

I've been a wallowing mess for the past two months, and there are days that I honestly don't remember what I did because I would just drink to pass the time. I started lurking around here a few weeks back, and started The Alcohol Experiment last week and have not been successful. For some reason I woke up today feeling a tiny sense of positivity that I haven't felt in a long time, so I'm holding on to that to get through this. I missed the old me, and I want to see her in the mirror again. I really want to do this, please wish me luck.

I don't have a great support system irl so this has been quite emotional and overwhelming. I took a break from work stuff and picked up sparkling water, a fancy kombucha, and a bottle of non-alcoholic sparkling cider as a treat. My mind is very scattered but present.

I had a couple of rough Christmases over the last few years and alcohol certainly did not help my emotional state or decision making processes.  I had a fairly solid sobriety run at the beginning of the year.  Got married.  Went on the honeymoon and had a drink again.  Have not really stopped since then, especially with the pandemic.  Fell back on to old anxiety ""coping"" mechanisms.  BUT, I am getting back on track today.  I made a decision yesterday that I would stay sober from now until at least February 1.  I want to be sober for the holidays (also my birthday is in there, too) and I usually take a solid crack at Dry January every year.  I figured it is a large block of time, but a goal I can visualize.  Something I can plan for.  Also, it gives me a nice set of days before I even get to Dry January.  I have my hobbies lined-up: playing music, getting back into yoga and bike riding, some projects around the house, some writing stuff I like to do.  I downloaded an app on my phone to track every second I am sober (and how much money I am saving) and coming here was always a big help for me when really trying to work at this.  In reality, moderation is not really my thing.  Even my interests are things I get into in an encyclopedic manner, so intoxication is really not a great mix for that kind of personality.  At least not anymore.  When I was younger it was something edgy, fun, seemingly easy to handle.  Now, no matter how much (or little) I have (whether in an hour or the next day) I always feel tired, bloated, and disappointed.  The idea is always better than the reality of drinking (for me, anyway), so let's just enjoy life, not put myself into an altered state to TRY to enjoy it.  So here we are.  Day One.  Looking to reach Day 70.  If I make it to 90 days that will be the longest I have gone since I first had a drink in September of 2001.

My initial post said something to the effect of ""my  drinking isn't that bad, but I should stop."" It is no wonder that, if this is all I am able to admit, my first attempt ended after two weeks (not bad) in several days of drinking. I think I need to be more honest with myself if I am going to have a more successful run at this. So this post is my outlet for being honest with myself. 

I started drinking in college on the weekends. I wasn't interested in partying, I just wanted to drink by myself and play video games or watch tv. We all know how this goes. I started drinking more often. I lost friends and didn't make new ones. I stopped engaging in my hobbies. General anxiety grew over time. I was always high functioning so I didn't think I had a problem. I would black out every weekend, sometimes during the week. This continued through my undergraduate studies, through masters studies and into a PhD. Eventually I get to the point that I work 12-14 hours per day and get drunk every night to ""relax"".  I think I would get very drunk on purpose just so I would be too hungover to work so I would HAVE to take a day off. Alcohol abuse combined with stresses from PhD studies created horrible anxiety and I started having panic attacks. I stopped drinking because my anxiety would skyrocket when I drank. Slowly but surely, I got back into old habits. I convinced myself that alcohol is a symptom of my lack of friends / fulfilling hobbies. I recently woke up to the fact that the opposite is true. 

So here I am. No hobbies. No real friends. I am so used to being filled with shame and regret that it's hard to imagine a life without it.

People who had disasters in their lives and were addicts, or drinkers like me. I could see other people had loving, supportive friends, but my friends weren't loving or supportive of what I did or wanted to do. Some were controlling, demanding, and manipulative. Some drained me of my energy. Later I learned about toxic emotional vampires and how they left their victims devoid of energy. 

But not understanding my codependent behavior, I never thought they were the problem. 

I thought I was. I didn‚Äôt pay them enough compliments or be there for them enough. Or I allowed them to direct areas of my life where they did not belong. Or I clammed up and gave them the silent treatment. I lived out how my abusers raised me: their needs came first because mine were immaterial. So inside me anxiety grew, and I did not know how to manage it. Again, I did what I always did: I got drunk and stuffed myself comatose.

Despite that battle, what connected us? 

I‚Äôll tell you: My body language screamed needy and insecure. How I carried myself, including my tone of voice, showed up on their radar. Not built on respect or a love for fun or reading or any common interests, I built our toxic relationships on my allowing them to disrespect me, and boss me around, cloaked in manipulation and disdain.  Or keep me in line by giving me ultimatums, threatening to cut me out of their lives if I did not do things their way.

Not realizing what drove me to latch onto people who could not be good friends, I put up with far too much, plus I caused painful endings. I did not know I was passive aggressive; I did not know how to be direct about my wants and needs. 

I did not know what my rights were.

I kept working on my mental health issues that fueled my depression; I kept healing. In that light, I grew to see toxic behavior around me. Some people I fought with, not knowing how to change my steps. Others I cut ties with little explanation, if any. Some fought with me, ending our ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù.

Furthering my healing on 10-18-2012, I started facing my fears, blogging about any anxious thoughts that crossed my mind. Back then, my clinical depression and complex ptsd were clear, so almost every thought that crossed my mind included my fears.

Doing that gave me strength because I faced those fears, accepting them as they were. Slowly, they stopped nagging me and I went on to my next fear. I kept going and kept going and kept going‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. To this day, I do the same thing because as I stared down what scared me, my self-esteem healed. The thoughts my inherited fears dominated settled down and logic grew in their place. I developed common sense naturally, slowly and steadily. Solutions popped up in my head!

Now, I know what was going on. My loneliness and shredded self-esteem drove me to latch onto anyone who paid an ounce of attention to me. Desperate for someone to belong to and to feel secure and safe for the first time in my life, my unfulfilled needs drove my behavior. Desperate for human contact, I went along with what I knew were not good ideas. I didn't know how to say no. I didn't know how to read people or to set boundaries.

Now I ask more questions and to pay attention to their behavior. 

How do they treat others? 

Do they talk about people behind their backs, spreading lies? 

What do we have in common? 

How do they treat me? 

Can I tell them no without them blowing up or bullying me into submission? 

Do they respect my choices or try to talk me into doing something I don‚Äôt want to do?

Covid has amplified all 3 and I desperately want to climb out of this hole, but I feel like I just can‚Äôt.","As the title suggests- depression, anxiety and alcoholism are not new for me. It was just more manageable before, or at least it felt that way.

I have a fairly high pressure job with a lot of responsibilities. When Covid hit in March,  I decided to pack up my office and move it home. Working from home was great at first - until it wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm a director for a brewery/restaurant group (convenient, right?), and when the shutdowns hit the US, we were forced to layoff 75% of our staff. I was gutted by this. People were angry, hurt, stressed out and scared. Aside from the lay-off really fucking sucking for moral compass reasons (it‚Äôs the worst being a socialist forced to exist and work in a capitalist society), it also meant that work began stacking up for those of us left.

Work was and still is incredibly stressful. Like many others, i was worried for loved ones catching the virus. I don‚Äôt think I realized the toll it was all taking on me. There was uncertainty in literally every facet of life- would my company survive this? Will i lose my house if we dont? Are my grandparents taking this seriously and staying inside? How long until someone i know dies from this? I don‚Äôt remember when exactly things REALLY began spiraling, but at some point along the way, the hour in which I began pouring myself a drink slowly crept earlier and earlier. Next thing i knew, I was full on drinking all day, every day.

My partner is starting to become distant. Unfinished work has been stacking up. I have long since accepted that I have a drinking problem. And a bad one at that. But the fact that I recognize my drinking for what it is (a malicious, soul sucking monster) and I still haven‚Äôt managed to just set the damn bottle down is the most terrifying part. I‚Äôm on a fast track to ruining every good thing in my life, and I am desperate to stop before I arrive at rock bottom.

I saw first hand yesterday how much alcoholism is a family disease. My sister and I learned it from our parents, who learned it from theirs, who learned it from theirs. In my family, you either ARE an alcoholic or are MARRIED to one. I happened to do both, lol.

Anyways, untreated alcoholism **destroys** lives. It destroys connection, trust, dreams, relationships, hope... it destroys it all. Untreated alcoholism almost cost me my life. I see it take and take from my family. It‚Äôs a struggle I‚Äôm sure some of us can relate to.

I try to remember that I also learned codependent behavior when dealing with alcoholics and family members. I want to rescue, then become the victim, then persecute those who don‚Äôt get help. It‚Äôs a learned behavior ALSO in my family as we have all tried to navigate how to approach alcoholics since, like I said, we either are one or are married to one.

I am writing today because I need to stay mindful that my recovery is not ANYONE‚ÄôS responsibility but mine. Same goes to other member‚Äôs of my family. Their choices to not seek recovery are none of my business nor my responsibility. All I can do is let them know I support them if they choose to seek health and relearn patterns of behavior.

I had to get cooking sake because I'm in Japan and am really trying to be better at cooking Japanese food. Except I knew if I bought it I was probably going to drink it.

I poured half a glass then filled it with bubbly water which I normally drink from that glass.  Because of course I was hiding it from my husband. I drank it and refilled it with an even stronger drink while making a delicious Gyudon. That's when I was done.

I'm one year sober from meth and alcohol today. I relapsed last year hard. I had 13 months sober from alcohol before it all came crashing down. I never did drugs before, I only drank. However, I ended up getting caught up in meth last year. I don't even know how it happened, it happened so quickly. I know for a fact I never would've smoked meth sober. I ended up drinking and smoking meth from July to November. This time last year... I was sitting in a prison cell, facing multiple felony charges. 

I want to say to those struggling and not knowing what to do... go for counseling, see a psychiatric, see a therapist, talk to somebody. No matter where you live, here has to be resources to help you. I tired to do it on my own, and I couldn't. I was one of those people who thought shit wouldn't work. I thought ""free"" therapy and counseling would be shit. It wasn't, and it helped me a lot. There are people out there that get it, that understand, people who want to help you. This whole year I've been in drug and alcohol therapy and trauma therapy... without it I don't know where I would be. 

My court date is coming up on the 16th of December. My charges are going to be dropped. I'm extremely lucky. I'm so glad to have a new lease on life. 

If you're in that place I was last year... you can do it. Never give up.",1230,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6052646040916443}"
2020-11-23 04:27:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jzek2k/one_week_7_days_i_feel_soooo_good/,One week. 7 days. I feel soooo good!,"This is probably the longest I‚Äôve been sober in 2-3 years. I‚Äôm feeling so incredible so far. 

But first, the dark part, the reason I need to quit. This year has been difficult and I fell into a bad habit of daily drinking, usually alone, and always more than I planned. I got so used to waking up sweating at 3 am in a panic, it started to feel normal. Slowly I started to feel my old self slipping away. A little less mental sharpness, more anxiety, less able and willing to fight for life. I felt myself starting to give up and slide down into a dark place where all that mattered was when I could get drunk again. 

Fortunately I only drank in the evenings and ‚Äúfunctioned‚Äù during the day. But my mental and physical health during the day was terrible. Even the smallest challenge became impossible. I held on by giving myself one or two minor tasks to complete each day. Just tiny things like responding to 3 work emails and doing the dishes. That was all I could handle. I would reward myself for these minor accomplishments by having a few drinks. 

During the time I‚Äôve been drinking so much, I‚Äôve dated a couple really wonderful women who could have been great partners. But looking back now I see I blew it with them because I wanted to drink more than I wanted to really try with them. It‚Äôs hard to form a solid relationship when your mental health is in shambles due to drinking. 

Ultimately I‚Äôm getting sober for myself and my kids. They need me. I think one of them might be struggling with addiction. How can I help him if I‚Äôm not sober? What kind of example can I be?

Fortunately I haven‚Äôt suffered any huge obvious consequences yet. I haven‚Äôt ruined all my other relationship with friends and family or lost my house or anything. But it‚Äôs only a matter of time if I continue on this path. 

Now more about how good it feels to not drink. The sleep!  That wonderful rested feeling you get when you wake up not hung over! It‚Äôs bliss. But a natural and healthy bliss- not like that artificial, lying, back stabbing ‚Äúbliss‚Äù of being drunk. 

My mind is clearing up and the negativity and irritability is slowly lifting. I can feel it. It‚Äôs as real as anything. What the hell was I thinking to not want this earlier? 

I know 7 days isn‚Äôt very long. The path ahead is difficult. But if 7 days sober feels this good, how good will 14 or 30 or more feel? 

I feel more optimistic and confident than I have in years! 

If you‚Äôve read this, thank you. I needed to tell the truth to someone. Even if it‚Äôs internet strangers. I‚Äôve lurked here for several month. Sober curious, you could say. It‚Äôs incredibly helpful so thank you and good luck to all of you on your journey. I think we can do this.",28,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9728798866271973}"

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

You are all so kind in this sub and it's spectacularly refreshing. Who needs a drink when I have you? I want to share a little bit. I don't often feel inspired to write about my enemy.","Hey everyone! This is my first time posting on here. 

I quit drinking back in August and this is the longest I've been sober by choice in recent years! While I've experienced cravings only a couple of times since quitting, they are enough to remind me that I'm never safe if left to my own devices. Usually by this time I have full blown alcoholic amnesia and I forget that I can't moderate my drinking. Usually by about 90 days (seems to be the reoccurring theme) I'm just beginning to prove to myself that I can moderate. 90 days is usually about the time I say to myself and my partner, ""sEe... I OnLy HaD 2 dRiNkS a CoUpLe tImEs ThIs wEek,"" which quickly turns into, ""sEe, I oNlY bLaCkEd oUt oNcE tHiS wEeK."" But it always ends the same within a matter of days to weeks, rarely taking any longer. Its insidious nature presents an illusion of self-control. It starts by establishing a false sense of security. It demands that I bet with confidence on the tiny bit of dignity I've managed to get back in the meager 3 months. It demands that I risk that regained sense of dignity in exchange for my pride all while knowing that the odds get worse over time and they will NEVER be in my favor. When I inevitably fail at maintaining self-control, that dignity turns into compounded guilt and withdrawals, which get exponentially worse every. single. time. 

But... I've made it past 90 days! I've made it past 100 days! It's been 101 days since I've had a drink. My dignity comes back a little bit at a time every single day. The self-confidence that's (slowly) coming back reminds me that I don't have to be in control of everything all the time. Some times it's better to just admit defeat. It's empowering and humbling to admit that I have an enemy and it's stronger than me! But hey, as long as I'm never back in the ring with the enemy I'll never have to get the shit kicked out of me ever again.. not by alcohol and certainly not today Satan, not today.",35,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9052652716636658}"

I have come to terms with the fact that I have very little control over alcohol. I was definitely one that would turn 2 drinks into 20. Although i wasn't dependent upon it, I had to learn to accept that I didn't have an off switch once I was going.

My acceptance of this and my will to make change led me to stop altogether. I haven't had a drink since march of this year.

I understand the difficulties associated with stopping alcohol, so I wanted to share with you something incredibly powerful that has helped me on my journey... Mindfulness.

Mindfulness is teaching me to enjoy presence. Presence is living in the moment, as you are. Presence leads to happiness. There is always a choice that comes before the use of a substance, practicing mindfulness is creating a space for us to consider the results of our actions.

I encourage everyone to give it a shot, like this group, there are other online forums rallying together for a common cause.

2020-11-22 21:05:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jz8nlq/tonight_might_be_the_last/,Tonight might be the last.,"Story time:

It has been such a year. I don‚Äôt know what to say. December 2019 was an odd but great month for me. Then everything started to change.

In early January this year, I was sleeping alone in my apartment one night as I had done a million times before. But this particular night I had a nightmare. I was hooked up to an oxygen tank, coughing up blood and lung. I woke up in a sweat thinking, ‚ÄúI should quit‚Äù but ignored it quickly as I had done for years. Two nights later, same dream. I woke again telling myself I was serious this time, once and for all. I had been smoking for 11 years. When I was 25 I promised myself I would quit before I turned 30, so that I could feel good about myself for establishing that and still get to procrastinate and continue smoking. But it never seemed like I would do so up to that point, because I was so nervous about quitting and what would happen to my life if I did. That is until that night, mere weeks after my 28th birthday. Maybe I could fulfill that promise to myself after all. So later that night, I had one last hoorah and finished up my pack. That was it. I was quitting.

Fast forward two hours later. I wanted to see if anything was going on in the neighborhood. Maybe see if I can get together with some people I know at one of the bars. But it was a slow Wednesday night so I decided to walk back home and toss back some beers myself. Around the corner was an exposed piece of rebar sticking out of the concrete. It hooked my right shoe. I fell like lumber and landed on the base of my skull on a sidewalk tile. I was dazed, but all I wanted was to find my glasses, as they had flown off during the fall. I found them and thankfully they were fine. But my neck was stiff and I had a huge bruise on my hip. No cigarettes anymore either. I just decided enough was enough and went home to bed.

The next morning my brain was screaming in agony and my neck wouldn‚Äôt move. I could barely walk either. I called off work and drove to the ER. The CAT Scan showed I suffered a very near fatal subdural hematoma during the fall, and they told me I‚Äôd also gotten cervical lordosis as well. I was told I should stay a few nights while they discussed what would need to be done with me. They also told me I had acute brain shrinkage and that I could never drink again. That‚Äôs when the tears welled up in my eyes. I hadn‚Äôt known a life without drowning out my own thoughts every night since I was in my early 20s. But the pain in my head from the fall was so much it was all I could really think of. For the next few nights I laid in the hospital bed, in such pain and I just wanted to talk to someone. I asked a neurologist and neurosurgeon who would come to check up on me if they would please give me burr-hole surgery just to end the madness already. They settled on medication, which wound up being the right call. Soon enough I was released and healing, but the blinding headaches wouldn‚Äôt stop for months. They made migraines feel like child‚Äôs play. Eventually they went away, but my desire to drink didn‚Äôt. After having been sober a few months, I started back. I didn‚Äôt care. I had been in a very depressed state for a long time already as it was. And life just seemed to be getting worse. Everything had been falling apart for a long time and there was nothing for me and nowhere to go.

Enter June. I got an offer. From an old family friend. An offer for a whole new career and training in different trades with a whole new company. It was an immensely better opportunity than anything I‚Äôd ever had before. It was also halfway across the country. It felt like a call I had to answer. So I did. Within a month and a half I moved my entire life to a new state and a different way of life.

I started the job. I got back into strength and endurance training. My workouts were showing a lot of improvements. I began eating healthier again. I began meeting new people (within safe reason). I still never had the desire to smoke again. But drinking was still a serious problem.

Fast forward to November. I‚Äôve been going through so much and this ride is as hectic, stressful, and crazy as ever. I knew deep down something else needs to change, for me and my loved ones alike, and for my future. I was on the phone with my dad as we hadn‚Äôt talked in a while. And the topic came up. He knows me better than anyone, and he knows it‚Äôs holding me back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt still be doing this when you‚Äôre 30‚Äù, he said. It reminded me what I once told myself about smoking. I know it has to be for me, but I want there to be a day when my family doesn‚Äôt see me like this, when I can have a family and life of my own, and when I can finally have a future.

I have a few cans left. I may do what I did with the cigarettes. But I don‚Äôt plan on buying another case. I think it has to stop. Another hard test has to begin. Thanks for anyone who read this. I just wanted to get this off my chest.",19,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987521171569824}"

I can‚Äôt pinpoint the exact wrongness of my life right now. Nothing bad has happened. And I have time to sort out future challenges that I am aware of. 

But something isn‚Äôt right. Not sleeping more than 4 hours a night. Usually less.  I feel disconnected from my feelings.  I feel numb.

I am sad but don‚Äôt have enough emotional fuel to cry more than a few seconds. I am eating sweets to feel something. But recognize it would take me pouring an entire bowl of sugar to begin to feel anything sharp enough to break the dullness. 

Is this why I drank?   To not feel this flat nothingness with its sharp edge of impending doom?

I am exhausted thinking about ways to be better. Do better.  Try more. Different. Harder.

I made my first goal to make it a week, and here I am, feeling good, feeling like I can do this. I‚Äôve had a lot more time alone this week than I normally do, and honestly that‚Äôs when I am the most likely to drink, so the fact that I‚Äôve done it in this situation really gives me hope. I‚Äôve written a bit about how my wife is in treatment currently for alcohol, and that I‚Äôve finally figured out that I also need help, but this really makes me think about the last time she was gone. I drank a lot, it was ‚Äúgreat‚Äù at the time to my booze soaked self. I made myself different fancy cocktails, tried different wines, some seasonal beers, I was getting more cultured. Looking back I want to kick my own ass, while my wife was addressing her real issues leaving me alone to deal with the kids etc, I was doubling down on my love affair with booze. 

When she went to treatment a few weeks ago, I did the same thing, got a really good bottle of aged rum, made some fancy drinks, got some beer I loved and had a party of 1. After a few days, still feeling hollow and actually starting to have panic attacks, I realized that maybe this was a problem for me too. Maybe I needed to grow past this bs as well and not just label my wife as the problem drinker. 

So last Sunday I said no more, i had just furnished the last of the beer and was considering getting more and just said to myself ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to get too drunk and be hungover for work, and drinking a few more beers wouldn‚Äôt really add anything to my day besides calories, lethargy, and a rougher tomorrow. Then I thought about what the first beers did, and all it really did was eased my nerves and helped turn part of my thinking off, and I knew if I didn‚Äôt drink I wouldn‚Äôt need to calm those nerves because it was only caused by my previous drinking, and as far as turning my brain off, I have a lot of things I need to figure out now, personal growth as well as just work and family things, so I really decided it was time to be done. This was all with the background knowledge that my wife needs to return to a sober home, and she is doing that with or without me. I think what really makes me feel good though, is I did this for me, not because of relationship consequences. 

It really took me a long time to get here, but I‚Äôm glad I made it. So I have one week down, my next goal is to make it a month, then through the end of this shit year we call 2020. 

Your support has been great, and I‚Äôm really happy to be a member of this community. There are a lot of shitty people on Reddit, but I haven‚Äôt met any on this sub.

The dreams have been less than ideal.  I've had a few night terrors raise their ugly head (I'll spare you the details of those horrors because I want this to be a happy post) and last night I dreamt I drank a beer and I was so upset and disappointed in myself - until I woke up and realized I was now at DAY 7!

Over the weekend my partner treated me to a mani/pedi  and we went to the local markets to wander around and enjoy the sun followed by a huge nap because I've been getting so sleepy since kicking the devil juice.

I'm shocked at the physical changes in just a week.
I look at least a year younger and my skin looks the best it has in years and I'm actually getting HUNGRY again!

It's amazing and I'm so proud of myself and everyone here!

So, I‚Äôve been a teacher for 22 years and this is the first year I have not used alcohol to cope. My Friday afternoons have consisted of FAC with my teachers as long as I can remember. Hell, least year, I was in charge of that committee. When my drinking went sideways, it was because I was using alcohol to cope with the anxiety of teaching. The latest podcast of Sober Powered addresses how alcohol hinders our ability to deal with anxiety normal and alters to structure of our brain immediately post alcohol to be more agitated. If you have not listened to it, please do. 

I would say that waking up in the middle of the night stressed out about that lingering student or disconnected class often plagues teachers. This article is from 2014 and talks about how teachers get only about 6 hours a night. I can‚Äôt even imagine what it is now. And alcohol interferes with your sleep. I know I drank to sleep and that only contributed to me falling asleep, not getting restful sleep. As your body eliminated the alcohol, the gaba receptors that were happily buzzing along are no nowhere to be seen and the glutamate in the brain has been boosted because of all the gaba and alcohol you supplied.( Sober Powered Episode 22, 2020)  So bam, you‚Äôre up at 3:00 sleep deprived and anxious about your day. How are you going to teach without any sleep?

This is part of the teacher alcohol lie. It doesn‚Äôt help with relaxation and sleep. We only think it does because of that initial calming feeling in the first two drinks. I have polls out right now asking teachers about their drinking alcohol and sleep. I want to see if my feeling is right. I am speaking from my own experience and the ahas I experienced listening to this week‚Äôs episode. 

But the real shift is when did it become okay or expected that you drink? FACs have always been a thing in my career and go ask your local bar what Friday afternoons are like when the teachers come in. A couple of weeks ago, it was National Drop a Case of Wine off at your favorite teacher‚Äôs house. https://www.facebook.com/699965304/posts/10163904133745305/?d=n We can do this without wine, though I did not know this was possible. I didn‚Äôt know how you get through a day of teaching without a drink to relax. I would get itchy for that drink around 3:30. I enjoyed decompressing with the my bar friends about the hell that was my day. I‚Äôd receive admiration, kudos, and, perhaps, a free drink. It was a win win and I got to relax. But then I began to worry if I didn‚Äôt have my me time to be able to get that drink. Then we had to stay home. It wasn‚Äôt the same drinking by myself, but that didn‚Äôt stop me. My anxiety increased and I thought my meds weren‚Äôt working and I could look everywhere else but the alcohol. 

What supports need to be in place for teachers so that drinking isn‚Äôt seen as a panacea for the stress of teaching? That teachers who are struggling with drinking can get help without worrying about repercussions? Education about sleep hygiene and turning off our email notifications after 4:00 on any given week day and things can wait till the next morning. That we do leave by 4:00 each day. That we find community who can support us in our struggles and provide more resources so our job isn‚Äôt so hard. And there is enough pay that teachers don‚Äôt need a side hustle to survive. My teacher friends in their 20s and early 30s all have a side hustle. I‚Äôve only stopped mine this year because of self preservation. I knew it would be too much in 2020 to teach and work a second job. And it finally became too much to teach and drink this year. I hope we can continue this conversation and you can listen to this podcast and learn how alcohol is not helping you cope and it makes it worse for you in the long run.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.998105525970459}"

I posted here the morning after my bachelor weekend, and looking back on it, the feelings I felt that day are no longer palpable or poignant. 

It‚Äôs only been two weeks, and already my mind is playing that same sick, predictable, yet incredibly effective trick on me. It tells me the same old tired lies that I know so well, yet it seems I eventually fall for them every time. I look back on some of what are objectively the worst moments of my life, and somehow my brain omits all of the misery, and then exaggerates or fabricates any positive feelings it can. 

Why do I have to keep proving to myself that those stories are lies? Every rock bottom dips a little lower, and comes a little quicker, and yet I struggle more and more to put any significant sober time together. My wedding is in less than a month, and I fully intend on being sober, but I know there‚Äôs something in me that has different plans.

I used to smoke weed for years- last time was maybe 12 years ago or so. Towards the end of my smoking days it was just a little- literally 1 hit after work to take the edge off and deal with home life. Then, due mostly to kids, I stopped (kept drinking though). 

More recently, as I've I've gotten sober from alcohol (after YEARS of very heavy drinking) and now my kids are grown and out of the house, I decided to smoke a little weed. I had to drive an hour to a dispensary in the next state to get some (man- this ain't your father's weed!!). Been smoking it again for the past month or so- but still just a small amount. 

Here's what I've found- again, just my own journey and experience. I enjoy being sober!! From alcohol, weed- (those were the only things I did). Once I got into being sober from alcohol I enjoyed the weed at first, but now have decided I feel better/operate better/have more motivation/etc. when I'm sober. I'll keep the weed around and may partake once in a while, but I just like this clear headed feeling of being totally sober. It's actually quite nice.

I think growing up I never really learned to love myself or value myself. As I got older, those early childhood problems manifested into some deep insecurity that fueled all sorts of bad behavior. I started drinking for fun, but then over time it became a coping mechanism for all the bad things going on in my head and my heart. Eventually drinking started to create all sorts of problems for me - in my romantic relationships, friendships, physical health, mental health, and basically everywhere. Drinking unfortunately became the tool I used to deal with the problems that came from drinking, and then I spiraled out of control. 

I had been trying to quit for over a year now. What made this time different is really hitting rock bottom and knowing that something has to change, or I will never be happy in my life. So I quit. I replaced drinking with healthy habits. I see a therapist every week to help myself heal and grow. I go to group classes every week too. Those feelings of self hatred and resentment are slowly growing into a genuine desire to live, be happy, and do the work required to make those things happen. I've lost 70 lbs since July. I started reading every day. I've made a lot of big and small victories to slowly build myself up.

My best friends were drinking, they kept offering me alcoholic drinks, went as far as both saying ""can't wait until you start drinking again"" (I've always said my stopping drinking was for as long as I felt like it but I just haven't wanted to drink again). It started to get to me a little bit, they're supportive when we're sober and then it's like my company isn't good enough when they're drinking and I'm not. When I stopped drinking a few months ago, I was determined to not let not it get in the way of having fun with my very-into-drinking friends, and I feel like I haven't. I stay up with them, I dance as much as them, I laugh as much as them, I have a good time! I miss the pubs and nightclubs being open as much as they do, albeit for social and music purposes. I feel like them wanting me to drink again is only to make themselves feel better about being drunk, but them drinking doesn't bother me in the slightest, and I've tried to tell them this. I even made cocktails for them last night!

I guess, the point of this is to say, I woke up feeling fresh as a daisy this morning. Well rested, well-hydrated, full of energy. No regrets, no wondering what silly stuff I might have said last night, no patchy memories. And it reminded me that this is better for me, and makes me happier. It just feels right.

So to everyone else who is struggling with friends not accepting it, or taunting a little bit, or being a little insensitive, or thoughtless. Stick to your guns, stand your ground, remind people that this isn't about them, and appreciate the lack of hangover the next day.

This morning I am sitting here reflecting on my WHY of why I stopped drinking. It‚Äôs actually really hard for me to think of the day, let alone write it. But I wanted to share a little but obviously warn that I am sharing my darkest thought at my darkest time - so please be aware this might be triggering and that‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt want to read this. 

I remember being at my apartment, alone, and texting my sister. Basically saying that I understand why people get suicidal. I am so thankful I had/have 2 amazing dogs, because they have always kept me rooted and grounded in this life.. but I was LOW. She was in med school and literally couldn‚Äôt care less about her depressed mess of a sister. 

Essentially, two nights before on a Friday I had gone to a very adult party (as an adult myself this was fitting) celebrating my best friends cancer-free anniversary. I got black out drunk and have over the years put together most of the details of what happened that night, but I still don‚Äôt remember how I got home. Sucks. I had 2 amazing friends who stayed with me essentially from Saturday morning until Sunday night, and then I got the Sunday night blues. Bad. 

And after not getting the support I desperately wanted from my sister (and truly this is FAIR, I am my own person and had to be my own support system) I started to google. 

I googled ‚Äúwhat to do when you want to die but aren‚Äôt suicidal‚Äù (which feels like an oxymoron but it made sense at the time) and somehow that search lead me to this group immediately. Like, first thing I clicked on kind of immediately. 

I felt so SEEN and for the first time I could admit that I had a problem without feeling like a failure. I was 27 & truly had it all going for me. None of it made sense, but coming on here and reading everyone‚Äôs stories helped it make sense. 

When I was 40 days into sobriety and so depressed I couldn‚Äôt exist without crying, it was because I had this support group that encouraged me to go see my doctor.. and that appointment changed my life and started my path to therapy. 

I come in and off from this group, but as I further into my recovery - I see that this group is a core part of my journey, and I am finding myself commenting and reading much more these days. 

Since being sober I have had a whirlwind of a life! I have several diagnoses that help explain a lot of my drinking and coping skills, and I‚Äôm so thankful for this vulnerable subreddit that changed my friggen life.

&#x200B;

First of all, it was so good to see everyone as this lockdown has me missing them all something fierce.

&#x200B;

I was the only one not drinking alcohol, and I want to write today about how that went for me.

&#x200B;

There was a very brief moment where I thought to myself, it's a shame that I've done what I've done to myself and I am not able to be a ""normal drinker"" and join them.

&#x200B;

However, thankfully, I quickly dismantled that thought - almost effortlessly.

&#x200B;

In the 2.5 hours we spent chatting, My brother had 2 drinks and my sisters each only had one. In that time, I would have probably had 4 or 5.

No one was visibly drunk or slurring or acting a bit off, which would be very touch and go for me.

In fact, in that time, I had 2 teas and a sparkling water. I drank the most! I guess I have a bit of a hand to mouth habit that I didn't realize I had which probably contributed to my consumption rate.

&#x200B;

I also thought about my day. I had a productive day - I didn't get everything I wanted to done on the chores list, but I made a good and respectable dent.  I wouldn't have done that hungover.  

I took a hour and a half long hike with my boys, and wouldn't have done that hungover.  

I lost my wallet after grocery shopping (arrgh) but a good Samaritan who found it called me at supper time and was holding it at their work for me to come pick it up. If I had still been drinking, I wouldn't have been able to leave the house right away to meet them before the store closed as I would have been several drinks deep by then already.

&#x200B;

And I was present, and enjoying my video chat without alcohol. I didn't need it to have any more fun, or feel any more pleased with the day's accomplishments.

And then it hit me - I am not being deprived of anything! To be able to live the life I want to live, I CHOOSE to not have a drink of alcohol, and that is what works for me.

It's not what works for everyone else in my family, and that's fine too. That's a whole lot of their business and I need not compare myself to them in any way.

&#x200B;

And for those of you who were wondering if my tea-tottaling affected the dynamic for my family, well, NO ONE CARED. At all. No questions about ""oh why aren't you joining us in a drink"", zero, zip.

I wish I felt amazing, but I feel kind of blah, a bit sick in the mornings, and energy is all over the place. Exercise and eating well seem to even out the swings though. Still, it is worlds better than it used to be.

Two of the most important things I learned for my sobriety are:

* **I can choose to quit any time.** Many times I tried to schedule a special quit date (e.g. the 1st of the month, a birthday, moving to a new place, etc.) I almost invariably drank early on to ""ruin"" that attempt, which would send me back to waiting for the next good time. Or, I would have just gone drinking with friends, co-workers, etc., and I'd think I have to give it some space before I quit. I'd think, ""I can't just drink one day and then quit the next."" Yes, yes I can. I can quit any day, hour, or minute I choose...even if there were witnesses.

* **I'm an adult and I don't need permission to quit.""** Part two and this is important as a hopeless people pleaser-I want to fit in type. It's my life, I'm solely in charge of it and responsible for it. I don't need outside validation or permission to quit. I was so afraid of what people would think. I always wanted to keep my options open. When I stopped waiting for the sign, the validation, the OK, the thumbs up on quitting, then I was able to move ahead with quitting on my own.

This was honestly the last straw for me because I thought we both had matured in some sense and I don't like myself or her when we are drinking. It's been a massive wake up call because I realised I actually feel nothing towards her any more. A bit of anger,  a bit of love but mainly I don't want anything to do with her and she expects our relationship to go back to the way it is. Also she tries to normalise my drinking and uses it to try and make our 'bond' stronger. Thinking now how is it makes me feel sick  

I realised I cannot have her in my life anymore, she's too toxic and the biggest enabler in my life. Everything when I've done something stupid or wrong she's always been in the picture. She lies and steals and after seeing her not care about her actions or how it affects me I cannot allow her to be in my life. 

So my question is any advice or share stories on how you've had to cut toxic loved ones or people out of your life? She doesn't see a problem with drinking and she's stuck in the past. Alcoholic use to do that for me to but I have slowly been evolving and have know for a while now that my drinking isn't healthy and I'm an alcoholic. It's been a long and slow journey and I've relapsed so many times but each time I still keep trying.

I told myself that this time will be different; it has to be different. 

I began using Tarot as a tool to reflect, and these are my findings.

*^(‚Ä¢Disclaimer: Tarot is not a fortune telling tool or a carnival trick. The cards are used as a tool for self reflection; they don't tell you your future but rather help you frame your questions into answers that can help with a new perspective. Please no negative comments. thanks.)*

**Day 1. I asked myself: ‚Äúwhat can i do to ensure I wont relapse this time?‚Äù**

***Card: 7 of Wands***

My reflection on this is that I need to be a warrior and dont lose my fight to sobriety. In the past, I have passively urged to stop. I would be strong willed on the first day (like today), but I would lose that fire on the next day and give into my cravings. This card has reminded me that **It** is a battle, and it is a battle that I can win. I can literally fucking win this battle. I CAN be sober. I CAN kill this monster on my back. I just can not give up the fight. In order to prepare for the fight, I am going to work hard on building a toolkit and foundation, The next few weeks are going to be hard for me.. I know that. **Instead of giving into the urge to drink, I will read the books, I will attend the zoom meetings, I will read blogs, I will connect with nature, I will reach out to others, I will find my community, I will continue to fight for myself.** I am worth this fight. I am a warrior. Thank you, 7 of wands, for this realisation. 

**I asked myself ‚ÄúI am entering this new life. What is something that I need to know‚Äù**

***Card: queen of pentacles.*** 

The queen is an advice giver. An educator and healer. I dont feel like the queen is a representation of myself, but rather it is my need for a community. I often hide my problems and I dont really have a community. I think this card is telling me that I need to find a person or a community dedicated to healing. It is hard where I live, since Berlin is known for it's drunkenness... where beer is cheaper than water. I work for a startup, and we literally have a fridge that only has beer in it. My desk just happens to be right next to this fridge, so the temptation at 6pm to grab a cold one is STRONG. 

I am looking into some AA clubs, or some other groups. I would like to make some sober friends in berlin who I can talk to. I also maybe need a mentor? I need someone to discuss my vulnerabilities with. **I need to remember that I am not alone.**

\-

**Day 2: I asked ‚ÄúI know that i need to find a community, but I my social anxiety creeps over me. Should I tell my current friends about my problems? Or should I keep this to myself??‚Äù**

***Card: Reversed 4 of wands.***

It is kinda crazy just how accurate this card is. I need stimulation and contact with creative individuals of a like mind. I must consciously seek it out because it's not going to come to me. This is interesting, because I was kinda just hoping to passively meet others. Join a few AA groups, read a few blogs‚Ä¶ hope that people come to me. But the fact that this card is urging me to consciously actively seek it out‚Ä¶. **I will put more efforts and more energy and more of my mind energy into finding my sober tribe.** I was also worried about telling my friends about my addiction (which I have done a good job at hiding).. but I think I must be honest. If they will not support me in getting sober, then I need to be able to let them go. As a foreigner in this city, I do not have a lot of friends, so the thought of letting someone go is scary. But, I can only allow people into my life and heart who share the same values as me, and who support me truly.",6,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9904583692550659}"

I'm 23M and I recently moved in with a friend in my country's capital. My country is in lockdown due to corona so there's not much to do or not many people to see. I have a full-time job that is extremely unrewarding and I basically don't have to do anything at all. I work from home but it's basically sitting behind my computer all day waiting to get some work, but most of my time is spent reading, scrolling through Instagram, cleaning,...

In college I used to be quite a heavy drinker cos I went out a lot but after four years I managed to cut down quite a bit. I managed to keep this going for 2 years, ""only"" getting drunk once or twice a month. In the beginning of the year I met someone I fell desperately in love with and he wasn't a heavy drinker at all so that motivated me as well and I managed not to drink a lot during the first lockdown. I was dumped in June and since then I've been drinking much more, and moving out of the house has only made it worse. I've also ""discovered"" that I can be hungover on a weekday cos my job is so unchallenging. This week I got drunk three times and yesterday was an eye-opener cos, again, I drank much more than I had promised myself and I dropped my laptop which is now broken. I also videocalled a friend for 30 minutes and I honestly have no recollection of anything I said. My hangovers are also super bad recently and they give me massive anxiety. The weird thing is that I'm a very health conscious person otherwise: I eat healthy and exercise every day. 

The difficult thing is that all my friends are heavy drinkers and it seems that even new people I meet all love to drink: I have some colleagues I genuinely like but even with them it's always drinking we do. It's a difficult time for me as there is not much going on in my life and there is a lockdown going on, so it's easy to turn to drinking. I've now made a promise to myself that I'm not going to drink for the next two weeks. It's going to be difficult cos I already had made plans with my colleagues next weekend and I'm a person who generally has difficulty standing up for myself, so telling them I won't be drinking is going to be hard. But I know it is something I have to do.

It's just frustrating that I can't seem to control my drinking: I manage to not drink anything at all but once I do drink, there's just no stopping and I disappoint myself time and time again cos I feel like such a loser for not managing to just control my drinking. I have a father who drinks a lot so I know how bad it is and how I do not want to turn out, because our relationship is definitely strained because of it. But it just seems that alcohol is such a big presence in my life that makes it hard to escape it. When I go to the woods with my friends for a hike, we always take alcohol with us for example. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? And any advice on how to stand up for myself and just tell people I'm not drinking? I'm not saying they'll force alcohol down my throat but they'll be like ""ohhh, why not, it's gonna be fun""

I‚Äôm having lots of struggles right now as we all are during this terrible time. My main stress is my 13 year old son‚Äôs awful behaviour right now. He‚Äôs been having a hard time with changes and hormones and some issues. He‚Äôs impossible to live with and it‚Äôs constant no escape as his Dad Died and I have no support. Work is shit and although I‚Äôm kind of grateful for having a job I also hate it right now. My dog was ill and was bleeding profusely last week she‚Äôs ok now. I also have a bullying case to deal with where he recorded his teacher verbally abusing him, calling his names and inviting others to join in. So after another hard week I almost hit the ‚Äòfuck it‚Äô button. 
So here I am sober again. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt do it but I was very close. The thing is once the ‚Äòpink cloud‚Äô goes away you‚Äôre left to deal with the harsh realities minus alcohol. It‚Äôs a learning curve. Alcohol was my go to during stress and although it was dire at times it numbed everything. This is the bit that‚Äôs hard to get used to when living without alcohol. Reality is hard quite often. 
I‚Äôve noticed that my drinking friends seem happier than I am when problems arise. They drink most days and it seems to take their troubles away to the degree that they are oblivious at times. Part of me feels jealous that they do that, another part cross that they turn a blind eye to things and I find it offensive and the other part of me that knows how bad it is feels sad that they do this to themselves and how their lives will be 10 years down the line. 
I get that the path we‚Äôre on is just our daily choices adding up. That‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt do it. If I would‚Äôve drank last night then I would‚Äôve felt so rubbish today. I‚Äôd probably be morbidly hung over with anxiety and god knows I‚Äôd probably have sent some awful drunk messages and I dread to think what else.

I was cynical about that.

Alcohol poisons all the body, not just the liver. It poisons the thyroid glands, the brain, the gut bio and a whole range of things. Healing all those and getting them balanced takes time. Some of these thing affect the emotions so until they are in balance the emotions will not be stable.

Another comment on SD was that when I started drinking I stopped maturing. The emotional healing is a complex and iterative process. It included starting that maturing process again, dealing with the consequences of drinking, my own own recriminations, dealing with the relationships that have been damaged - one way or the other. I came to realise that I had expressed my alcohol anxiety as competitiveness ( bordering on aggression.) This is a raw, brutally honest process. Some sticky plasters get ripped off and some stones get turned. 

I didn't understand what spirituality meant. The emotional healing is a hugely introspective process. I  got to a place of knowing myself, understanding the impact I have on the lives of others and what can be changed and what can't. I have ended up in the best place I can.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I find myself doing a lot of thinking and reflecting as I'm fishing, and I want to start to document that.  If anything, it would make for a nice thing to re-read after a years time.

I've tried a whole lot of times to start journaling, but I run out of content.  Or it all starts to sound the same.  I'm going to try again.  Maybe it will be different this time since I have theme now, rather than just jotting down random thoughts.

It's about the only moment I vividly remember from that night because it was so jarring. By some miracle, there is limited damage to my car. Just some scrapes and I'm completely unharmed. I actually pulled off on the next exit, checked my car to make sure it was fine, and then went to a store to purchase more alcohol. I don't remember getting home.

I woke up the next day in a panic, checking my car and looking through my online banking to try to track my movements of the night before. I knew I had made some calls to people but didn't remember what I said. I still haven't pieced that night together.

I have binge drank on and off for about 3 years. I always knew the drinking was problematic but it had been inconsequential. In my mind I did not fit the bill to be labeled an alcoholic. It never caused any tangible problems. However, my perspective changed the morning after my last drink and I realized how my escapade could potentially have been fatal, for me or for someone else. How I was risking it all. I start school next month, and overall my life lately has been fantastic, and in an instant I could have ruined everything. 

I spoke with my mother that morning and told her everything. Even opened up about depression and counseling. I called my closest friends as well and filled them in. I want everyone I care about to understand that I'm not able to have a healthy relationship with alcohol, and that I'm done with it. It's just too big of a risk. And I have a wonderful support group of people that are routing for me.

This is day 14 of sobriety. I'm happy to not be drinking, and I just wanted to share that with some people. The ugly side of sobriety for me is that I'm now coping again with feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. My relationship with alcohol was one of self medicating, and now I'm relying on myself and it can be tough. 

But I'm glad I made the decision to stop, and I'm celebrating with this little post and a glass of water.

I only included that on the title cause I didn't want to make a second post.

I've spent the past 5 years drinking almost every night. Something clicked in my brain recently and I've made a commitment to quit for real, well tonight is my 7th night. Zero cravings today, and most of the days really. I've struggled with opiates too, and most of the cravings I've had this week have been opiate cravings, but I've won too (9 days opiate free btw).

&#x200B;

Back to the Wim Hof method, I posted about this on r/OpiatesRecovery and people found it helpful, so I decided to do that here as well.

I bet most people don't know who he is, he is known as the ""IceMan"". With his breathing technique and meditation he has learned to push past the pain of being cold and holds multiple Guinness World records related to withstanding the cold.

Now, I know this sounds all like complete BS and all that. But If you are interested at all, look into it. You will find there is a lot of scientific evidence backing up his claims, he has actually let doctors and scientists do tests on him.

His breathing technique coupled with cold therapy has helped a lot of people overcome anxiety and other mental issues.

I have been doing the breathing for 3 days now, and it honestly makes you feel an amazing rush, Wim Hof calls it ""getting high on your own supply"". I seriously believe this breathing could help people having cravings and dealing with anxiety.

The idea behind the cold therapy (cold showers) is to train your body to deal with the stress of the cold, and by learning to cope with that, you learn to cope with daily life stresses. It makes sense. I've tried the cold showers too, lmao, they suck, but everyone says they are life changing so I'll stick to them.

2020-11-21 20:12:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jymo81/my_cat_likes_me_now/,My cat likes me now,"I stopped drinking when the pandemic really hit my country and we went into 'lockdown' in March. In that time I started to become depressed. The contours of the depression and the subject matter of my depressed thoughts and feelings felt darker than they had ever before. I put this down to a) some kind of brain-related trouble from sustained heavy-drinking b) me getting older and perhaps somewhat wiser and c) having to face some issues in my mental life in a more direct, literally sober way. 

Well, so, the upshot is that I put down the drink and became more miserable then ever. I put on weight, I wasn't sleeping right, I neglected to speak to my friends etc. etc. In spite of all this, my cat which (/whom - whatever) i've had for years has started sleeping on my bed, rubbing herself all over me and wanting me to scratch her neck snd shit. She curled up between my legs during my hours-at-a-time tv and call of duty sessions. This would be the case pretty much every night. She would scrarch at my door when she wanted in and then hop up on my bed and sit on my feet. She would purr a lot which is relaxing though in the morning can be a nuisance.

I would say that I fell of the wagon around my birthday in June, though to be honest i wasn't really committed to never drinking again. It's not like I had even vowed never to drink again. Anyways, it got to a point where i was drinking a lot again, going out walking all night and listening to sad music and drinking cans of lager. The whole arrangement with the cat i guess went out the window, though i didnt really give this much consideration. My schedule got all fucked up because i didnt have a job all summer and i've been living at my mums place. I didnt drink everyday but i certainly had one foot back in the drinking hole. All the related chaos returned and on days i wasnt drunk or hungover i was feverishly worrying about other things - almost like once the depressant effects of alcohol wore off, my mind felt catapaulted in the other direction to state of heightened anxiety (what goes down must come up, or something.) Whatever, basically, i didn't really think much about the cat. She just slept on the sofa downstairs like she usually did. 

Nowadays i'm back to working. I started a job in September and, after a particularly stupid Sunday evening at the start of this month on which a friend of mine decided to have his birthday celebration i have been sober for over two weeks. Mostly because i need to focus for the job i have which is a short-term research project but also a lot of anxiety i have nowadays i feel is directly related to drinking and not just exacerbated by it. As in, i know my mind will be racing the day after, especially if i do something bad while drunk - which rarely happens but still happens enough and unpredictably so to worry about. 

So, i'm back to normal 9-5 hours with no alcohol. I'm 'clean'. It took me by surprise, when i heard the familiar scratching at the bottom of my bedroom door this Monday. It reminded me that the cat hadn't tried to get in here for a while. I open the door slightly and she slips through immediately and jumps up onto the bed with a sort of mumbled 'meow' noise. She's currently curled into a sort of circle between my legs as i type - like soup in a bowl. I don't know what it is. At first i thought it was more of a coicidence than anything. I'm not happier sober, in fact, i don't ever feel great at all. But, as long as i dont drink, my cat likes my company.",80,"{'pandemic': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9986155033111572}"

But I wanted to give some insight into what it‚Äôs been like to be stone cold sober for this many months.

Let me preface by saying that I‚Äôve been a heavy drinker since 21 (30 now). I‚Äôm talking drinking pretty much every night or maybe every other night to make myself feel better. In college, I could keep it to a six pack. As I got older, I needed more. 8, 9, 10 if I were home alone. When I got married I tried to forcibly box my drinking to the weekend, but those weekends were all I could think about during that week. So Friday and Saturday meant either going out drinking or staying home drinking. My husband was quite worried by how much and how fast I could drink on the weekends, like I was drinking water. Having a 12 pack wasn‚Äôt impossible anymore and I shocked myself by how much I could down. I hid cans and bottles to make it seem like I only had 5 when in reality I had a lot more. Every morning I was grossly hungover and glued to the bed and my phone. Last September, I tried cutting back on my antidepressant (panic disorder) and in doing so, the drinking kicked up to a level it never had before. There was a week where I drank (and I mean got hammered) Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Saturday morning I was supposed to go on a road trip with a friend. That morning I uncontrollably wept because I felt so down and so anxious. I still went though and it was‚Äî by far‚Äî the worst experience of my life. I had severe disassociation (which if you have never experienced, you feel completely disconnected from reality and everyone around you) all while trying to stifle what felt like a constant panic attack. My heart rate was through the roof and I was restless, unable to sit down or sit still. It felt as though my brain was broken. I remember getting to the hotel and ordering a bottle of wine. With every drink I felt myself calm down and return to normalcy. We went out that night and I drank like I usually would. I felt more normal. Next day, same god awful panic and disassociation. Heart rate high. Restless. Wanted to scream for help but tried to keep it cool until I got home. When I did get home and my friend left, I collapsed on the kitchen floor and sobbed and prayed to God out loud and screamed to my husband that something felt so terribly wrong, that I felt like my brain had broken. I couldn‚Äôt eat. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. The only thing that calmed me down were the white claws in the fridge. I went to the ER the next morning because I still felt so awful and that general sense of something being wrong. I didn‚Äôt disclose how much I had been drinking, only that I had tried to come off of some medication. 

Finally, I got in contact with a psychologist and I made a pact with myself to be honest. His take away‚Äîcoming off of antidepressants are unpleasant, but the majority of what I was feeling was alcohol withdrawal. I quit drinking for a month, thinking that would cure everything, but the amount of chemical imbalance I had done to my brain meant I needed more than a month. I went back to drinking because, even though I knew it was a problem, it was also an escape.

When I got pregnant, after 5-6 months of not drinking, is when I started to feel a sense of calm and normalcy without severe disassociation and panic. The reason I share this is because I‚Äôm sure there are people out there who wonder when they‚Äôll feel normal again without a drink. I guess it depends from person to person, but for me, it was a while. Many months of being sober began some healing and revealed a light at the end of the tunnel.

So it‚Äôs Saturday, I was all alone with my son. We slept in a bit and he started playing some video games after breakfast, and that‚Äôs all he wanted to do, I had nowhere to go, it was a bit overcast outside, finished yard work yesterday. All I wanted to do in that moment was go get some booze and just relax all day. I surfed the urge, read a chapter of ‚ÄúThis Naked Mind‚Äù and was still sort of craving it, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I just wanted to do something that wasn‚Äôt sitting around bored while my kid was preoccupied.
So I took him on a hike for the afternoon! It was wonderful, went on a section of the Appalachian Trail I hadn‚Äôt done yet, got some good exercise, some great bonding, and just an overall great time. We then stopped off at this cute little Christmas village thing and I took him to a candy store, now we are home and lazing about and if feels good. A week ago I would have not left the couch, barely interacting with my son, and would be so tired by now. 
While we were out I paid attention to all of the bars, liquor stores, and alcohol advertisements I saw and how they made me feel.

They may even sound too simplistic. 
When I quit drinking, I felt all alone in my anguish. I knew it was time to change when I did, or accept that I was going to be dead. I decided I wanted to live. I didn't know how to change. I knew that alcohol was at the root of my physical health problems, but didn't fully understand how alcohol influenced my psychological and emotional health.
It was daunting at first, because quitting drinking seemed impossible, let alone changing my entire life!  I read some books, I listened to podcasts, I watched videos, I read posts by many of you on Reddit and researched medical and psychological information online.
When I quit drinking a year-and-a-half ago, my mind was in no place to receive some of the information or advice I was hearing. I felt like they didn't really understand what MY condition was. 
But the truth was that I wasn't in a position psychologically to accept the information.  I was still trying to hold on to an image of myself, carefully developed as alcohol changed my neurological pathways, damaged my memory, lungs, kidneys and arteries, among other things. 
What I didn't know at the time, was how much the little, seemingly simple things make a difference in changing a lifetime of self destruction; daily adequate sleep, sunlight, fresh air, exercise, nutrition, hydration, engaging activities, and social connections. Of course, I've discovered that these can be actually harder to do than quitting alcohol, because quitting drinking was just the beginning to changing my life. Quitting drinking gave me a fighting chance. And each thing I work on gives me more of a fighting chance. For instance, I have been walking almost daily for a year and a half. Now my cardio-vascular system can handle more. My immune system is working better, and my memory is improving. I have happier days and more hope in my life. Everybody wants that, but alcohol inhibits and destroys potential: physically, emotionally and mentally, changing us. 
 And a fighting chance is something I didn't realize I even lacked when I first started on this path. One thing builds on another and they are all connected. The change is worth it, but not easy. My process is working. I see and feel the evidence of it in my life.
I'm still working on my life changes, but at least now I have a fighting chance.  I now know that I needed that and why I needed that.
I hope that someone can use this information, much like I used what I learned, to give yourself the space and ability to change, unhindered by alcolol and self destruction.

At university, a few friends had to go to counselling or the like because they were drinking too much, but I never had a reckoning like that.

Over the years, the amount and how often I drank steadily increased, to the point where I was waking up hung over every morning and being evasive, unreliable, and unproductive. The few half-hearted attempts I made to cut back never made much of a dent. During the lockdown, I started drinking even more than normal. It took a few months to come to terms with the fact that I had a problem and needed to stop. Once that was clear‚Äîand it did take a while for the concept to gel‚Äîthings got a lot easier and I just needed to get over the initial hump.

I'm 32M, and this is probably the longest time since I was 16 or so I've gone without drinking. Just making it this far has been a massive confidence boost.

Things that helped:

* Early on, being proactive. Identifying when I was mostly like to want to drink, when I would buy it, and modifying those situations. Even just saying to myself 'it's Friday night and I need to go to the supermarket, but I'm only going to buy items I've written on this list and avoid the alcohol aisle completely' was useful.
* Picking up an old hobby that had waned over my years of drinking. In my case it was a board game that requires focus and so doesn't mix with alcohol at all.
* Reading in the evenings again. Seriously, reading while tipsy just isn't the same.
* Getting a haircut and growing a beard. This one is a little silly, but it combined with the above two points it helped draw a personal line in the sand. New polishedslate doesn't drink.
* Substituting beverages. I started drinking carbonated water mixed with juice or cordial in the evenings. Just being able to reach for something sweet, tart, and fizzy took the edge off things at first.
* Making it clear to the people around me I wasn't drinking. This happened gradually and it eventually stopped people from tempting me drinks.
* Being a bit stubborn. Simply refusing to drink when other people expect you to is actually quite easy if you're willing to be stubborn about it. And very, very few people really care.

The hardest parts were/are social interactions where everyone else was drinking. Avoiding these judiciously, bringing my own NA drinks, and the last point above got me through them. Also, 'nightmares' where I start drinking again were unnervingly common for a few weeks. These have mostly stopped now.

I'm feeling much, much better than six months ago, although it's been something of a wild ride with messed up sleep. I have essentially no cravings at all now. Complacency is a risk, but 'playing the tape forward' helps with this.

I still have a lot of problems but now they feel defined and approachable, where before they were all mixed together in a miasma. They plausibly could have been caused by alcohol consumption, so it wasn't possible to address them at all while still drinking. For the first time in years, I'm optimistic.

I have been a weekend drinker (sometimes I don‚Äôt drink on weekends but I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs an overall pattern of drinking some 1 night out of the weekend) for the past 8 months. Before that i was sober from age 17-28. I abused Xanax and whatever else as a teen. I lived in a traumatic environment and that was my escape. As I grew older I did a lot of trauma work and healing on many things within me. I wanted to experience drinking again because it was too difficult to accept I never could because of how young I was when I for sober and the trauma I was enduring at that age. I waited until I got my final degree, licensure, and checked in with my support team that I was going to be trying drinking and had a plan for if I got out of control and was a true alcoholic. (I have an aa background). Over the last year it has been very interesting drinking as an adult. Much different than when I was a kid. I‚Äôm exploring stopping drinking again for a few reasons. 1. I don‚Äôt like the weight gain. 2. I‚Äôve found alcoholic significantly increases my anxiety and I‚Äôve spent 10 years being able to regulate myself emotionally and alcohol interferes with this. 3. I don‚Äôt see it adding anything into my life. It is fun but it really is just wasted nights. 4. My body is like wtf every time. It had most of my life and development without alcohol. 5. I worry about the effects of it on my body and sometimes that weirds me out. 6. It‚Äôs time I could be spending in my personal growth. 7. I‚Äôve noticed overall lower motivation. 8. I think all people, even normal drinkers (whatever those are) are always at risk of it escalating to full blown addiction. It seems so ridiculous to risk this. What is worth that risk?! 

These are just some thoughts I‚Äôve been coming into. Initially it was just really fun and I enjoyed trying it as an adult. I think teenage me was and is still in there and felt like wow this is awesome I can just be a normal adult drinking. But I don‚Äôt think even normal drinking is for me. I have friends that drink and they don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù but I still think it‚Äôs insane how much drinking is a part of their life and don‚Äôt see how they are functioning to the best of their ability with alcohol.

I‚Äôm laying wide awake at 6:30 in the morning. Slept for only four hours. Too excited to go out camping and explore the desert sober, get out of town and away from my WFH computer. As I lay here I have Rage Against The Machine stuck in my head. Just for shits and giggles I compared The Matrix to being an alcoholic in this world. Sorry if I spoiled this classic film for anyone. I might edit it it as I have more comparisons.

IWNDWYT

The matrix has you. You live in it, function, thinking you are having a normal life. Yet you know something isn‚Äôt right. You meet a couple of people who say that they know the answer, but you have to see it for yourself. They know that if they drag you out, you will fight them til the very end. You finally have a glimpse of what the world is, yet you‚Äôve forgotten how to use your limbs and never used your real eyes, so you face anxiety and don‚Äôt know how to function. Not sure if you like the real world. You want to go back to the comfortable fuzzy green drunken world.

This is where the agents come in play. They are the social norm. They get you to sit down and eat a delicious steak. And you can‚Äôt have the steak without just one glass of wine, right? Now they have your attention. ‚ÄúDrinking is fun. Drinking makes you funny. Drinking is what you do when you hang out with friends and family. Drinking is what you do when you deal with stress, or celebrate any achievement in life, Mr Anderson.‚Äù And then when they put you back in the matrix, they tell you  that you can be anything and anyone. Just as long as you are drunk, and just keep fantasizing about it. And then when you are hungover the next day, it‚Äôs not like you will remember your grand ambitions anyways.

So you fight. You go in and out of the matrix. Slowly realizing that the rules of the machine could be broken. But it is too big and too powerful to be shut down. You make sacrifices along the way. Your eyes adjust. You realize that some can go back to the matrix, but you will want to stay in it if you were given a taste.

I had just gotten out of an incredibly toxic relationship and on the Friday of the festival I was fired from my job. I didn't go out that weekend to have some fun, I went out to delete myself. I wanted to get as far away from consciousness as I possibly could.

When she mentioned that she seen me it hit like a tonne of bricks, I'm saying things to myself like - ""Everyone thinks you're disgusting"",. I shudder at the thought of behaving like that and it really scares me to think if I slip up I could be back there.

Right now I live in a new country. I've made new friends and started a new chapter in my life - nobody here knows me as the guy who destroys himself.

I was a heavy alcoholic for about 3 years (26 years old). I became really stressed and then depressed with my graveyard freight job, and then started coping with alcohol. The problem is that coping via alcohol prevents you from learning to cope via healthy mechanisms - plus it's quite unhealthy physically and mentally in the long run. I was throwing up almost every day. I was drinking the equivalent of a full bottle of hard liquor every 1-2 days. Before I started this sobriety journey I had been unemployed for a while and went thru a breakup from the longest relationship I've had (2 years). I also ended up getting a DUI. Life felt completely hopeless and I had regular thoughts of suicide. My finances are still f***ed but I've made a strong start in paying down some of my debt. I went through an out-patient treatment program, I attended AA meetings weekly, and then I started going to college full time. I just finished my first quarter in college, ending on a 4.0 GPA. I haven't had suicidal thoughts in over 8 months at this point, and I give myself positive self talk every night. I'm growing into a person I can be proud of as each day passes. I am finally investing my time and work into a degree that can net me a career which pays a wage over the level of poverty. Make the decision to quit drinking and you will find that after a rough couple months, your life will improve drastically. Someday down the line I may drink alcohol again and enjoy it. However, I'm first going to make sure I can easily handle life and live happily without alcohol.

2020-11-21 08:10:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jyah8s/2_months_sober_reflections/,2 months sober reflections,"Hi everyone, just a bit of context.
29 y/o female. Was addicted to weed from the age of around 16-20, smoked morning noon and night.
Paranoia set in and it became unpleasant so I stopped smoking and gradually over the last 10 years have developed a strong dependence on alcohol.

I was never someone who drank every day, and never drank in the morning- unless I was still awake from the night before ‚Äúpartying‚Äù. 
My drinking became dark though, drinking at home alone, always to blackout, missing days of work. I work full time, so the 2 days off I have were pretty much always spent in bed hungover with crippling anxiety. 

I injured myself quite badly (broken ankle, operation needed) whilst under the influence in the summer. Was off work for 3 months none weight bearing.

Anyway, one day I just woke up and thought I need help. So I have started therapy, started taking medication for my anxiety and depression. And stopped drinking. Here are some reflections from the last 2 months:

- Eat what you want (obviously within reason and try not to eat takeout every day), but basically don‚Äôt beat yourself up for eating chocolate/ junk food. Eat what you want. Just don‚Äôt drink.

- The feeling of waking up not hungover with dread, guilt, anxiety and everything else thrown in to the mix is unmeasurable. The feeling of drinking for me never comes close to the relief I get after waking up feeling calm and rested.

-Buy scented candles, bubble bath and Epsom salts. Play some slow jazz (or whatever relaxes you), and feel your worries melt away with the water.

- Read. 2 books which have really motivated me are Glorious Rock Bottom by Bryony Gordon, and The unexpected joy of being sober by Catherine Grey. I have just started reading This Naked Mind.

- Playing video games. I know this isn‚Äôt for everyone, but for me, they really help.

- Play the tape forward. I have no off switch once I start drinking. I cannot moderate and so none is better than 1. If I have a craving, which to be honest are quite rare, I always imagine how I will feel the next day if I indulge in the craving. It is never worth it.

- Nobody ever woke up regretting not drinking the night before. Ever.

- Start to experiment with soft drinks/ herbal teas.
Fizzy water with fresh lemon and elderflower cordial is the shit. I‚Äôve also started an impressive herbal tea collection. I‚Äôm pretty sure I have one for every occasion / time of day.

- I have more money. So much more money. Since stopping drinking and smoking cigarettes, I have started buying house plants and spending more time on making our home a home. I have done more
Jobs in the house over the last 2 months than I have in 5 years. So far I have saved around ¬£600.

- Not everyone will understand. And you don‚Äôt have to justify anything to anyone, ever. This is your journey and nobody else‚Äôs.

- It gets easier. Trust me it really does. The sense of calm after a long walk on a cold day with my partner, coming home running a bath, cooking a roast dinner and choosing a film to watch- nothing compares.

- Say no. Say no to any future invitations where you feel your sobriety could be compromised. The most important thing in the world is to stay sober.

- Get some hobbies. These will often be trial and error, but try them before thinking you won‚Äôt enjoy it. For example, I bought a beginners pottery kit and it is so much fun. Some other things I enjoy now that I am sober: 
Baking, reading, painting, drawing, journaling, I take more pictures when I am out on my walks. Applying face masks, cleaning (I have to be in the mood for this one). Video games, as mentioned previously. 

-Weight loss. Within the first week my stomach felt so much less bloated. I have been eating Oreos however so probably haven‚Äôt lost as much weight as I could have. BUT this is the last thing I am currently putting my energy in to. One thing at a time.

- horror fiction. Again this isn‚Äôt for everyone, however I have to say that I read IT by Stephen King and it has to be one of the best books I have ever read. I think there may be a link between my addict brain enjoying the thrill and suspense of a horror book and the thrill and suspense which I often got from drinking alcohol. Except with reading horror fiction I don‚Äôt wake up wanting to die.

Just remember you are not alone. This community has helped me so much. I come and scroll through every morning, and every evening before bed. It‚Äôs not all sunshine and rainbows, but it is a million times better than being stuck in the middle of a tornado.
 Thank you all, I hope you find the peace and happiness you deserve for the rest of your days üòå

Although I knew this was completely unsustainable, I remained quite functional. Regardless of the hangover / still drunk feelings I showed up for work (first responder) and maintained my relationship with friends and family. I was also functioning under the 'work hard play hard' mantra. Sure, you can drink - but get to work, get in the gym (sometimes twice a day), eat clean, head home and drink again. Caffeine fueled me through my days, consuming preworkout and energy drinks regularly. 

On October 4th I suffered a massive panic attack mid afternoon on a day I had told myself I was not going to drink. I was particularly hungover and caffeinated. I had begun to feel what I now believe were minor withdrawal symptoms in the months leading up to this - light headed at the gym, headaches, anxious, etc. 

October 4th my body and mind snap - riddled with anxiety, disassociation, fear, impending doom, heart beating out of my chest, no appetite. Called my Doctor who advised that this was likely caffeine related - despite me coming clean about my drinking habits. These severe symptoms persisted for 4-5 days. Blood work normal. 

At this point I still wasn't sure exactly was happening - ignorant to the fact that alcohol could even have this effect on me. My symptoms faded and I felt normal for a few days before having a secondary, albeit minor, panic attack at work. Symptoms came and went a lot faster (2 days). Both these attacks came out of nowhere, in non-stressful situations. 

It's been a long month and a half since I knocked off caffeine, outside of green tea, and booze. I haven't had cravings at all, mostly because of how intense my panic attack was for me. I'm not on any medications and have never been diagnosed with anything medically - so to live with crippling anxiety, amongst other symptoms,  for 5 days was completely eye opening. 

I still struggle with my mood, fatigue and anxiety but the longer I've gone without, the less intense these feelings have become. Lost about 10 pounds, skins clearer, workouts are improving - just need to progress out of the PAWS stage.

I spent two hours tonight looking up local sober living housing / meeting information / outpatient service options.  


I don't know what's truly best for me. I feel inadequate taking any steps because it's hard to imagine any serious damage occurring no matter how bad this feels (it feels very bad.)

I don't mean to be vague but I am trying to limit any triggering language -- I'm just so tired. I want off this ride. I'm 24 and I've been pining over quitting before 20. Weekend partying at 15 turned into codependent alcoholism turned into binge drinking to cope with traumatic events that occurred from binge drinking in the first place.  


It's a cycle. I want out. I want out of my environment. I know that you take you with you and moving is never the answer or cure, but I feel so ill living here.  I want away from my partner who enables my addiction. He lets himself into the house if I don't message him back (only because there have been times i have been too hungover to be reachable, this isn't nefarious behavior on his part.) and he always asks me if I need him to make a store run to which I always reply yes. I don't hate him I just hate my inability to say no. I've begged him that I don't want alcohol in the past, have gone as far as had him hold my ID for me to keep me from buying alcohol for myself. I think that's happened maybe 4 times over the course of our relationship. We've been together for 8 years. But I think I manipulate him because we've had multiple talks with a lot of tears about how I need to quit and yet we end up in the same place. It's very codependent, it's very unhealthy. But he still asks me unprompted if I need alcohol and that's hard to the extent where I question the relationship itself.   


I know I need to leave my environment but I'm feeling stuck. I know that I'm sick because when I put the real reasons why I'm drinking on paper I can't think of any sane person who would remain in the position I have kept myself in. I wouldn't drink to cope if I would only fix my problems.  


Regardless it's an intense case of analysis paralysis. I get stuck in a loop because I realize that alcoholics such as myself like to place blame everywhere but with themselves. I want to avoid that but the walls have been closing in and i feel like my analysis paralysis is at least partially influenced by my environment where past traumatic abuses have occurred.   


I feel like if I leave I'll have a fighting chance without being constantly triggered. But I don't feel I am justifiably sick enough to receive support to leave. And lastly I don't have the confidence to support myself well enough if i take off on my own. My partner said I'd likely spiral into a depression if I left because I'm not capable of taking care of myself in basic ways.   


It's very hard.  I hate analysis paralysis. The more I type the more I know I need help but the more I type the more I talk myself out of it.

It's been several years now that I binge drink on a regular basis. The last 18 months, it's so regular that i don't spend more than 4 or 5 days without drinking to oblivion.

The pattern is : drink in the evening (roughly a liter of wine), spend 48h to come back from hangover then drink again. 
I have stretches of 4 or 5 days without drinking then my brain tells me it's no big deal then start again. I had a few quitting times where i didn't drink for 2 or 3 weeks during the last year but it doesn't seem to last.

Now with the lockdown which has been on and off for the last 10 months, it's of course even worse as I don't really need to go out or see anyone. 

So, with your support, I will try again starting today. I had wine last night, I am of course hangover but nothing unusual. I am grateful that I don't have shakes or sweaty nights when I quit, so it's mostly psychological.

I dreamt of getting ready to go out to a club (WHAT!, I'm 54, haven't been to a ""club"" in ages -  and are those high heels I am wearing!).   The next dream sequence was of me the next day not remembering anything from the night before, looking quite disheveled and having lost my jacket (where did my dream-self get that jacket, it was awesome!).  In the dream I felt confused and ashamed.  I was sickened by the thoughts of what I may or may not have done during the black out period.  I was thinking about how angry my husband was going to be, how angry I was for letting this happen.  And of course, horrified that I had no idea where my jacket was (still a little pissed about that - it really was a nice jacket).

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

""Fire Poker Zen""

Hakuin used to tell his pupils about an old woman who had a teashop, praising her understanding of Zen. The pupils refused to believe what he told them and would go to the teashop to find out for themselves.

Whenever the woman saw them coming she could tell at once whether they had come for tea or to look into her grasp of Zen. In the former case, she would serve them graciously. In the latter, she would beckon to the pupils to come behind her screen. The instant they obeyed, she would strike them with a fire-poker.

Nine out of ten of them could not escape her beating.

We gather here to pledge our intention to not drink for today. I believe that the intentions we carry in our hearts and minds have real, measurable effects in our lives. Are we showing up to the teashop for the tea, or something else? Every time I read this passage, I am reminded of the importance of intention, and the consequences of not being honest about my intentions. I've certainly taken a few fire-pokers to the head in my days, maybe you can relate?

 What do we want to gain, what do we want to lose, and where do we want to go from here? I look ahead at the unknown possibilities in my future, and backwards over the years of already written story, and despite all that mental time travel, I remain here in the present. When I break down my sobriety into these 24 hour pieces, my intentions are strengthened. I think Marcus Aurelius captures this idea as well in the following:

""Live not as though there were a thousand years ahead of you. Fate is at your elbow; make yourself good while life and power are still yours.""

Here's to living intentionally in the present, enjoying a good cup of tea, and avoiding the fire-poker!

I know it‚Äôs not healthy for me physically, mentally, and emotionally.

Since I was 16 I drank socially at parties and just weekends. It wasnt until last December that it went from weekend binging to everyday a drink then covid hit and it turned into a fifth or a 12 pack a day. I was one of those ""functioning"" alcoholics able to still work and hide my lonely alcoholism from family. It wasnt until a couple weeks ago a was on a binge that had me vomiting at just the smell of the beer. I gained 20lbs since February and just knew my body wasnt right. I woke up one morning two weeks ago very hungover on a Saturday.  My first thought was to drink to ease the hangover but just that thought had me running to the toilet.  I sat there dry heaving for 30 minutes, I felt heart palpitations and cold sweats. At that moment after seeing my reflection I knew I had to do something.  My bp was 145/94 and I'm sure my blood tests would show me I'm slowly killing myself. Alcohol was the reason my best relationships ended and also why I had broken my wrist a couple times. That morning I said no more. The next few days after were some of the most miserable but thanks to this community I found motivation.  Today I'm proud of myself for being 14 days sober for the first time in 12 years.

So I started hanging with my buddies who party and they have a party house that is everything you want, karaoke, a casino room, a coke dealer who lived there, and girls. For about 7 weekends straight I would drink shots of vodka, chain smoke, do a few gs of cocaine, and pop trazodone to go to sleep.

It was like the sweetest nightmare with really high highs, and very very low hangover comedown days so dark that I thought of ending my life because I felt like I failed myself. Then something devastating happened, it was my birthday and I woke up to the news my good buddy Zach overdosed on heroin. I immediately started to cry and told myself I can't go on this way. Later that week I went to his funeral, and it was the saddest thing watching his parents and two kids having to say goodbye, I promised myself I wouldn't do that to my family and that I would be a recovery advocate from then on.

I got help, therapy read books, and got back into my fitness and health routine. And I also got back to my passion for music.  I am a singer/rapper similar to like Eminem or nf people say. I put my heart into my songs. I ended up making a very deep song where I came clean about everything that had been going on, and I released the music video on youtube. And it now has over 40k views with no label or help.

Then the Facebook version has 50k as well as over 800 shares and comments of people telling me they felt every word of my song and how they can relate. I have been humbled by the response.

It releases tonight on all digital music streaming services and I'm feeling a bit emotional. So I felt I would share with my fellow addicts. If you wanna listen to it google search Stylez Major -Lost in a High.

Security and management kicked her out and told me why, I quickly talked with her and she said she didn't do it and went to the toilet. I knew she was lying however she was so convincing I stuck up for her because she's my friend and told them she didn't do it. After a bit the security guard turned on me and was like I've seen you here 4-5 time in the last few months (I'm an in the closet alcoholic,  I hate going out and drinking and know for a fact I have not been in that place only one time years ago to use the bathroom randomly that's the only time ever). 

After we went i eventually talked to her and it was like drawing blood out of a stone getting the truth out of her. She even told the truth and she did not pee in the toilet and peed in an open area space. Management told me she was barred from the place and would not be allowed back in and we're lucky they didn't call the cops because usually they would etc. 

After my best friend lying and the security guard saying false shit thinking I was a stupid drunk chick that would believe anything I am done.

I'm 32 and I'm on the second go round of studying medicine and for the first month I struggled to go two days sober with anxiety: meeting new people, starting a course that had kicked the shit out of me last time (imposter syndrome, culture shock of moving to England - despite being Irish ha ha - and not fitting in and being lonely made me drink and I'm sure you can see where this is going), and just the fact that I come from a very different social background to a lot of my classmates and housemates. 

When the second lockdown here hit I took it as an opportunity to reassess my drinking and how bad it had gotten. I'm delighted to have found this community and it's been a great source of comfort to know so many people are walking the same path.

A friend recommend I check this sub and feel that it is a good place to share my story. I am doing this because I can no longer do it on my own and need to find whatever means to leave alcohol for good. 

Some background: I am a graduate student at a large university in Texas, and this process can be entirely overwhelming. The long nights don‚Äôt seem worth it after a while because you are constantly feeling pressure from the university, your department, your colleagues, and your family that are wondering when you will finish school. The constant deadlines, reading, writing, thinking, grading, unusual working hours get to most people after a while. Aside from this, I am not entirely surrounded by family/friends here. I am a originally a (Southern) California native who decided to take a shot at grad school and my partner and I drove halfway across the country to pursue a longtime dream of mine.

So, I think my downward spiral started early this year. I have never been a casual/heavy drinker. I had drank socially before, but it was always more of me looking for ways to drink around trusted friends and hiding the alcohol from my family. I grew up in a strict Christian environment where drinking was unacceptable. Although I am now a full-grown adult, these ‚Äúteachings‚Äù seem to never leave and you always hear that voice in back of your head reminding you of right from wrong. The third year in my program, I realized that I needed to start going out more after rejecting invitations from colleagues to grab a casual beer after class. After all, much of their activities revolved around drinking and food. I went out a few times, had a great time, and asked myself why I hadn‚Äôt done this more often. 

Then, COVID happens and I am confined to staying indoors. While I didn‚Äôt mind this, I did not anticipate things playing out the way they did. Instead of going out with friends, we had virtual ‚Äúhappy hour‚Äù over Zoom or Skype to sort of remain social. I found myself stocking up on alcohol to avoid having to visit grocery stores more frequently. After a while, I enjoyed the feeling of taking a shot before class to take the edge off. It also made me more chatty and I felt like people liked me more when I was tipsy. The days turned into weeks, the weeks into months, and this behavior was only progressing. Two days ago, though, I reached a tipping point. I overdrank to the point where I could not vomit anymore. I woke up sore, sweaty, and with a migraine. I felt humiliated. How could it be possible that a grown man was still drinking like some high school teenager? I feel shame just thinking about it.

I don‚Äôt blame any of this on colleagues, or my career. I have an addictive personality and these circumstances created the perfect storm to become an alcoholic. But frankly, I am tired of waking up smelling like booze from the night before. I am tired of having to lie to my partner about overdrinking and hiding alcohol in unconventional places. I am tired of running to the store before midnight telling myself I will only drink half the bottle tonight. Being an alcoholic has been a hard fact to accept, but I can no longer stay this way. It is hurting my relationship with the person I love the most, my friends, family, and more recently my progress in the program. I need help.

I appreciate any advice you all can lend about cutting off this self-destructive behavior and learning to build myself up again.",17,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6571387052536011}"

For those of you starting out or on the path, know that the yearning in your soul is telling the truth.

There is freedom in sobriety. I have lost 80 pounds, ran a marathon, met the love of my life (and was prepared to do something about it) and established a challenging but rewarding career in only 2+ years. Your journey will undoubtedly involve different goals. 

Please know that deliberate, consistent healthy action will give you the clarity to handle life on your own terms. It will get hard before it gets easier and the urge will seem overpowering at times.

\-having to wait in lines in public bathrooms because you have to pee so much from said booze SUCKS

I've been trying to varying degrees and quite unsuccessfully for the past month or so to quit smoking.  So last week, I went on youtube for a quit smoking hypnosis session.  Still smoked.  About 3 days ago, I was going to listen to it again, but thought what if I try to tackle why I smoke?

At some point during the quit smoking meditation, I was directed to go back to the very first cig I smoked and ask myself why.  I didn't get an answer per se, but I felt this incredible amount of pain and grief.  It was unexpected, but I'm not sure why.  But it was so heavy.

So instead of another quit smoking session, I put on a much shorter ""meet your inner child"" session.  Holy crap, y'all.  I didn't know what to expect.  I kind of thought I was going to get that 14 yo version of myself that I encountered during the quit smoking thing.  Nope.  It was me at age 5.  This incredibly sad, scared, and insecure little girl.  I know I had fun at that age, but there was also so much trauma.

I promised that kid that I would protect her.  That I would not let anyone hurt her again.  I rocked her in my arms and let her express all the grief.  And I promised to keep her safe.  

I went outside to smoke a cig like 3 hours later, took one drag, and that was it.  I realized that I could not keep that promise while actively poisoning her!  I have not had any desire for a drink or a smoke since and the idea just puts me off completely.  I cannot break that promise.  I cannot break that fragile trust.  I had no idea I actually loved myself this much.  It's a little astounding, but kind of awesome.

All the arguments and hurt feelings that my drinking caused so many drunken tears caused & shed. 

The worst has been all the weight gain downing six packs at night and eating fastfood after waking up to get more to drink day after day after week. 

I do not miss the utter shame as I filled garbage bag after bag of cans and boxes seeing them all and knowing that they all went through my liver. 

I am so happy I no longer have to wake up and check every can for a half full disgusting room temperature syrupy beer that I would drink for the sake of placating my addiction. 

No more uncontrollable hiccups that ended in beer foam spewing out of me. 

The truly worst were all the blackouts pissing myself throwing up and being aggressively unresponsive, leaving my loved ones to clean up after me all while I recalled nothing. 

I do not miss it and I need to keep reminding myself this is the truth of my drinking. 

I cant enjoy one beer because ill want 5 more. I cant enjoy a shot because half of the bottle will be gone within the night. I cant be content with one can of hard seltzer because the whole 12 pack will be gone and ill go out and buy more. I cant repeat any of that. 

For my health & marriage.

I'm thousands of miles away from home, and I don't feel liked where I am. I used to override that feeling by being the fuck up, not caring and not feeling, and now I can't hide behind that. I don't know what to do or if it's healthy to spend this much time alone. I've been in serious relationships before and lived with my partners and now I feel like that will never happen again, because sobriety and lockdown have turned me into an asocial, awkward hermit. I sometimes think that at least alcohol can be a social activity, that it would be way easier to just call my old drinking friends to get drunk, and they'd welcome me back. It would be easier and less alone and more familiar than whatever I'm trying to chart now, alone, in this year in which I've had to rely completely on myself.

After a couple of months of drinking, we decided to nip it in the bud before it sprouted legs and really took off. We went to rehab, first me, and then him.  One of us had to stay behind and care for our four greyhounds.

Now we're doing great and I really love feeling like me again.  I have missed that chick!  Spare time in the evening is perhaps the biggest hurdle.  I have several things I tinker with, though.  I would say the most helpful hobby has been diamond painting.  I get so focused when I work on a diamond painting that I forget pretty much everything for a while.  It's great for anxiety.  

Hobbies are important.  We have to find ways to fill that void we created so that alcohol doesn't have a chance to take hold of us again.  I also crochet.  I go to church.  I cook.  Soon I'll be working again, full-time at night.  Mostly, I ask myself how I can make today different.  What can I do with this day that I'll enjoy in place of alcohol?  How can I live a more purpose-driven life?  The answer is simple.  I have to stay sober because sober me can do anything.  

I would also add that it's very important to rid ourselves of toxic relationships.  It doesn't matter if it's a friend, a spouse, or a family member.  I felt such a push to cut out all of the people who were poisoning and sabotaging me.  It was the first and best thing I've done for myself and let me tell you...it really does make a huge difference.  

I'm going to do whatever it takes to stay on track.  I'm grateful that God gave me the strength to lift myself up by the bootstraps and move forward in peace and happiness.

We always convince ourselves we are okay and can just ""go back to normal."" What we don't realize is that there is no ""normal"" left in us. That ship has sailed, the door has closed on that possibility. And then we are faced with staying inside what feel like the confines of sobriety. 

Something I have realized with myself is that I don't stay sober long because I find a lot of the new things I try out to replace drinking to not be as immediately pleasurable. I have had horrible runs, yoga classes, gotten bored reading, wanted to throw my ukulele out the window for not immediately soothing me! 

Sobriety, at first, requires commitment not just to not drink, but to start and continue with something new. I recently forced myself to go to three yoga classes three days in a row. The first one sucked. The second one I was dying. The third one was alright. With each one I feel a slight improvement, and I realize that i am BUILDING MY NEW NORMAL by working through the pain, boredom, and frustration that comes with trying new things and reinvention. Consistency with any new endeavor is painful. Stick with it! Commit to something new. 

For most of us, drinking was our biggest commitment. We got there by several repeated instances of committing more and more of us to it. We gave up jobs, time with families, money, time, and our minds to the activity of drinking. So next time you think about bailing on that new healthy activity that is less fun than drinking, ask yourself--am I really making a new commitment to this like I committed to drinking?

With the lockdowns and the way 2020 has gone, I've noticed my drinking has picked up dramatically, and hangovers are more frequent. So it's time for me to reassess my relationship with alcohol and stop drinking.

With that, I have decided not to quit until the holidays are over because I have read/listened to podcasts that suggest that's incredibly difficult, and I think that's the right thing for me because I don't want to just go cold turkey. So what's a good way of tapering off as I get ready to prepare for this journey?",6,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9839954972267151}"

I went to counselling the summer before last during my last ""successful"" quit, which lasted 3.5 months.  During that time, I was preparing to leave my husband.  Got a bank account of my own, squirrelled money away, rented a storage locker to gradually build up the bare bones basics to have a place to sleep and cooking supplies for my own apartment.  I was dead serious.

Then, I went back to my wine habit, and decided to stick it out - maybe I'll outlive him.  

A year and a half go by, I am content... BUT

Now, after nearly 3 weeks  without my tranquilizing drug of choice (wine), I am very unhappy and want out of this marriage again.  The passive aggressive digs are getting to me.  I have no other financial support.  My kids are launched.  They are highly successful in their chosen pathways.  Both are working in other countries.  I have no grand children. 

Summary:  I can stay in a comfortable home with financial security if I am drinking.  I am trapped in an emotionally abusive marriage if I am sober.

At the moment a friend of mine is going through a really difficult time and I have been here the last two weeks to help take care of them since the person's caretakers have been diagnosed with corona. 

Normally this wouldn't be a huge issue but I've just gone through a really tough break up around the time I was asked to step in and help. It's pretty tough overall I'm not going to lie since I am responsible for most of the household tasks, helping take care of the person's caretakers aka parents and making sure there are enough supplies in the house. The person also has a disability meaning I am also the emotional support for this person around the clock at the time.

Mostly my day consists of taking care of this person from around 9 am until 3 am and working for a few hours when they are asleep and grabbing maybe a couple of hours rest a night myself.

I also have other friends going through difficult times who also lean on me for emotional support right now and frankly I am finding myself feeling suffocated. The only time I get to sit and think or rest somewhat during the day is when I use the restroom or take a shower and even then sometimes people will be knocking on the door with questions.

I know they can not help their situation so I don't take it out on the people but I do feel agitated at times but I try hiding it behind a smile.

Right now it's making it very very difficult to process my break up and I'm catching myself smoking a lot of cigarettes and drinking frequently again.

It's also not helping that multiple women are trying to woo me into a relationship with them since they found out I'm single.

I can't just walk away or bail on this person nor some of the other people so does anyone have any advise on how to deal with this situation? Any tips would really be appreciated.",2,{'rona': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982683658599854}"

Hey Jamal,
It‚Äôs kendall. I am you about 26 years later and a lot different looking and  way more troubles. But I am still you. I am still 5 and I still remember what it felt like to be spit on. At 31, I would slap the shit of someone who spit on me. But we were 5. I still remember that ugly ass blue jacket we were wearing. I remember knowing that was wrong but not knowing why. There was nothing wrong with you. People suck. We don‚Äôt even remember his name but we remember his face at the time. It‚Äôs okay. You hold onto that memory now because you refuse to accept disrespect from anyone in 2020 but you still hurt from him. So I want to tell you, let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Be free from it. Because about even if no one cared about you then to help you, I care about you now. I care about us and I want us to be better. So let that go and you will slowly start letting all your pain go.

I was raised catholic. And when I was maybe 6, I started to freak out over the idea of eternity. You see, I was told, if I was a decent, caring person, I‚Äôd go to heaven and I‚Äôd spend eternity there with all the people I love. Even pets!

‚ÄúEvery day? Like, forever? No end in sight?‚Äù I‚Äôd ask anyone who would listen. (Usually my mom, once a priest.) And they‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúYes! It‚Äôs heaven.‚Äù

And I‚Äôd wonder what this place might be like. Is any place perfect all the time? What if I don‚Äôt want to spend eternity in heaven? What if I‚Äôm good and I die and I simply don‚Äôt want to live there forever? I would sit in bed at night and calculate the days I‚Äôd been alive and while I very much enjoyed living (still do!), the idea of doing anything forever, even in some idyllic place, that was not something I found very comforting.

Eternity scared the ever-loving shit out of me. Blew my little kid mind into a million little pieces. 

Eternity is terrifying, if you think about it. So I eventually stopped considering this. I started thinking that enjoying the day, the time I‚Äôd spend catching lightning bugs, deep into a humid, crickety chorus-filled summer night, maybe that could be enough.

I have since fallen from the catholic wagon and now my faith (or lack thereof) is more of a question mark, leaning toward a whole lotta nothingness. But I think that‚Äôs ok, too. It‚Äôs easier to make sense of, at least for me. (Gotta say, however, letting go of the idea of one day reuniting with all my pets? Weeps.)

I realized yesterday, that I‚Äôve been approaching not drinking in a similar manner. I can‚Äôt look at eternity right now. It‚Äôs terrifying. (And I think I‚Äôve written something like this before.) But the idea of not drinking forever is a recipe for failure. 

So, I‚Äôll take this single hour I get to sip my morning coffee as I watch a family of deer nibble on the rotting pumpkins in our compost pile. I‚Äôll take right now and just not drink.

I have no understanding why this tradition ever began, but my friends and I would get together back home on that night and party when coming home from college and then once I got married, I would buy a bunch of beers or go out to the bar with my wife and then once we had kids, I'd just buy a bunch of high powered beers and sit around drinking them on this night.

Over time, Thanksgiving Eve began stretching into taking the week off to be home with my family during the slowest time of the year for me at work, but it was also a big excuse to drink for ten days straight. And instead of Thanksgiving Eve being the big night, every night was a big night that week, especially the Friday before Thanksgiving week, the night that kicked off ten days of drinking double IPAs at home. It got worse and worse over the years as my drinking progressed to 5-7 nights a week, usually 2-5 drinks on weeknights and 6-10 drinks on weekend evenings.

I feel so differently now. I sincerely look forward to the next ten days and I will return to work the Monday after Thanksgiving refreshed. I used to be so full of anxiety and paranoia about work, especially on that last Sunday before going back. The only thing that could relieve that anxiety was you guessed it...beer or wine or sometimes gin. I'll spend the next week accomplishing projects around the house that need to happen before the ground is covered by snow. I'll swim every day. I'll smoke a big turkey starting early in the morning on Thanksgiving day. I'll finally make oyster stuffing because I've always wanted to and I have the money to buy fresh oysters because I haven't spent $100-$150 on beer for a week of partying. Most of all, I'll be happy. Is it too much to ask in life to be happy? I don't think so. I truly am happy. And I'm Thankful. Happy Thanksgiving, Everyone! IWNDWYT.",17,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.991534948348999}"

I know it‚Äôs up to me to make the change. I just want to share my story.

My country is currently in its second lockdown. I‚Äôve been working from home since March and I‚Äôm likely to be doing so for the foreseeable future. 

I‚Äôm quite isolated. My family can‚Äôt visit me, but when they could I struggled because they can be very overbearing. 

I‚Äôve been caught in the anxiety and depression driving me to drink and I have anxiety and depression because I drink loop several times in my life. I‚Äôve overcome it in the past with self determination, support groups and healthy regimes. I‚Äôm a classic case of someone who loves exercise, but getting myself to do it is difficult.

I actually love my job. But once I finish for the day I‚Äôm lonely. I used to work in a bustling city (which I‚Äôve heard is now desolated) it wasn‚Äôt easy to fight my demons with the nightlife but it was easier than it is now. I‚Äôve been drinking every evening after work to get through. Then waking up just before I start work, crawling to my computer without a shower. I convince myself I‚Äôm never going to drink again and by the time it‚Äôs 6pm I‚Äôm back on it.  

I‚Äôve gained 20lbs. I‚Äôm bloated. Spotty. My skins grey. I always feel sick. 

I wish I was able to pop to my local AA meeting to just listen to people and get some motivation. I need to make positive changes regardless. I‚Äôve started cooking healthy food again. But washing it down with vodka or beer isn‚Äôt helping. I‚Äôm thinking about buying a treadmill to go in my home office. I have a wonderful dog who gets me out the house for walks. I hope I can get on top of this and work through it.",6,"{'rona': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9885590076446533}"

Had I been caught by police doing this I would have lost my license, lost my job, and who knows how my life would‚Äôve played out from there. 
I still stop at that group of shops sometimes. There is a good bakery there. If I‚Äôm feeling particularly naughty I will get a sweet treat that will inevitably make me feel sick after eating it.

(lockdown rules over here only allow one family member in the supermarket) and figured I'd post for the first time instead of just checking in and commenting.   
Ever since college I'd been drinking every day.  My junior year in Germany just concreted my love of beer and by the time I was out of school I'd already made a daily habit out of picking up a twelver everyday after work.  On days off the drinking began in the afternoon and slowly started beginning at 11am.  Started working shifts and drinking a couple before the evening shift...so it was really spiraling out of control.  Contracted a nice life long case of gout and always had ""my drinking medicine"" in case it flared up...never even considered stopping drinking to control it.  Finally, for some reason, after almost 30 years of practically daily drinking, I decided enough was enough.  We were short on cash at home and I had to decide between buying food til payday or buying food just for the night and beer until payday... Something just clicked and I decided to stop prioritizing my whole days and nights, holidays, day trips around beer.
So I stopped and haven't looked back.  It hasn't been easy and I had my temptations but little tips and tricks I've learned in thia sub from all of you have helped tremendously.

Good morning to all,

 Deciding to stop drinking is just the beginning. Once we have ourselves heading in a better direction, we can begin the process of sorting out the wreckage we've left behind us. I've found that as I address these issues and my burden becomes lighter, a space has opened up in my world for new things, like more houseplants, for example. I picked up an anthurium a little while ago, and I remember thinking how much better of a chance I have keeping it alive, because drunk me would have this laceleaf dead in about 3 weeks from neglect.

 It's remarkable just how much healthier and happier my plants have become in the last 8 months, because of the attention that I can give them now.  Sometimes I feel like I might not be doing enough to keep myself on the road of recovery, but I can not deny that someone more engaged with reality is watering my plants. The plants look so much healthier, happier and cared for, and in a similar way, so do I. The person I see in the mirror is definitely more hydrated!

 Has there been something in your life that you've seen turn around or improve because of your sobriety?  Is there something you would like to see happen, if you are just starting out on your journey? Let's remember these things as we head into the energy of this Friday night, when temptations can run high.

It is a beautiful day to be alive! Let's do this!

I started drinking in my teens and I hit the ground running. From 17 until 25, every time it was my birthday, I saw it as a ‚ÄúGet plastered with no consequences for free‚Äù card. It became especially apparent when I went to college because my college was a known party school. From then on, my birthday schedule was the following: take a day off work, start day drinking, host a mid-size shindig, and then hit the bars. My entire birthday was based on getting drunk all day and surrounding myself with the party. My 24th and 25th birthday were especially bad. 24th birthday I blacked out very early into the evening and called it quits before midnight. Terrible hangover the next day per usual. My 25th birthday i was on a work trip but I recall spending the entire time at the conference plastered. After the conference, spent the evening wandering DC binge drinking until I stumbled back to the hotel. 

This was my first birthday sober. Going to work, having coworkers thank me and tell me how much they appreciate me being around. Friends online and in real life going out of their way to wish me happy birthday. Spending time with family with no thought in my mind like ‚Äúcan we get this over with? I have other places to be‚Äù. Just being in the moment for once on a special occasion. 

It makes me realize how much alcohol sucked out my life and the special moments i was supposed to be there for in my own life. On days where I was allowed to be selfish, I let alcohol take the wheel that day full throttle.

One of them I found out I have during an MRI scan after a recent auto accident, it is a lower spine spondylolisthesis which was causing a nerve pinching due to lower bottom disc protrusion.  

I had injection for that and also stabilized my spine by strengthening my abs and back muscles, so I no longer feel that pain anymore.

I've had so many ""day one""s in the past decade that lasted less than a day. The longest I've gone without drinking was three weeks or so a year ago.

Of course, my Booze Brain tries to blame everything else or pretend these things aren't real, but they are.

Somewhere along the way, it went from de-stressing after work to using alcohol for courage, to treat anxiety, as a gift to myself, as a way to fit in with other people, etc. 

I'm starting a new job soon and I'm thinking this is now or never. My stomach still aches from last night's binge, and I'm anxious and can't focus on anything. I need to change. It's just so hard. I'll have willpower in the morning, but after work it all just falls apart. 

My boyfriend's parents send him care packages that contain booze sometimes, so it's always in the house. He can stop at one or less, and I don't want to ban him from doing it since I'm the one with the problem. I hope I can come here whenever I need help in the future.

My fianc√© and I had a 2 month old at home, and my priorities were fucked, and I knew it. Truth be told, I've known for years, I just couldn't imagine a life without alcohol. 

Sometime in mid-January, I sat down with my fianc√© and told her I had a problem.

It was hard to acknowledge - you know, opening up, acknowledging my own flaw...emotion crap. Lots of crying. I thought at the time, surely that was the hardest part. 

However, that was not the hardest part of my journey. From that point in January through the beginning of May, I stretched together a few streaks of 7-10 days, maybe 2 weeks, but couldn't get past that. That means I 'failed' at least 10 times in those first few months, and I can tell you each one hurt worse than the last. I started feeling a lot of shame every time I drank, which led to me hiding my drinking. Or trying to hide it. It is the only thing I've ever lied to my fianc√© about. 

I put together a 45 day streak from the beginning of May through mid-June. It was the longest streak I had in over 15 years. I thought I was fixed, let the thoughts of drinking slip back into my mind and convinced myself I could handle it. I actually decided I was going to drink several days before I actually did - I remember when I caved. My fianc√© was my girlfriend at the time, and we got engaged, and I started thinking maybe I could have a bachelor party, and I was done, mentally.

Later that week, I actually did it. I limited myself to 2 beers the first night, 3 beers the next, and by the next day I was sneaking whiskey in the morning. That's how quick I spiraled.

Between mid June and mid September I put together several 10-15 day stretches, but also still continued to fall off the wagon at times. It didn't always feel like it, but in hindsight, I was making progress. I was going longer between relapses and I was holding my shit together better even when I did drink. 

The last day I drank was September 16th, so I just hit the 2 month mark earlier this week. This is the longest I've been alcohol free since I was 15.

Now, I could look back and think, 'Damn! Imagine if I had just been able to stop in January - I'd be closing in on a year!' Or, 'I would be at 6 months if I would never have caved back in June'. 

I'll admit that I have had those thoughts at times, but I brush them off. I guess that wasn't my journey. 

I don't let it discourage me, because it is clear to me that I've been making progress. Each one of those terrible day 1s and day 2s were days I DID NOT DRINK. 

So maybe I don't have a huge number next to my name, but I bet I will one day. If I keep trying. 

One thing I do know - if I ride this streak through the end of the year, this will be the first year since I turned 21 that had more sober days than drinking days. I'll fucking take that.

If you are struggling, keep trying.

I am so happy! Last year on Nov 16 (my birthday) was the last time I blacked out. 

Even tho that night was terrible, I am really thankful it happened because I dont think I would have made the choice to become sober if I didn't have such a wild night. I am considering my sobriety progress to be at one year because the journey started then. I had one slip up in January (2.5 drinks) due to a mental health crisis but I picked myself up and continued to work hard. Im so proud of myself, to go from blacking out every weekend to being totally sober. 

If you ever want to talk, reach out. I remember when this journey first started, I was anxious and felt terrible about myself. 

I promise, every day that you are sober, is an opportunity to be a better and happier person. It is so worth it to be sober!",189,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9983804225921631}"

Fast forward to March 2020 and I‚Äôm still sober but I‚Äôm divorcing him because he is lying about drinking again. Yesterday my daughter visited him in the ICU. He needs a liver transplant (along with a host of other organ problems). It looks like he won‚Äôt live long. This is the first time she has seen him in months. She writes this poem last night. 

11/18/2020
Six After, Six Under
Day by day, he whittled his soul away.
A proud man falls, after he loses it all.

Loved by many, the Man had everything: a beautiful, intelligent wife and two amazing daughters. He had a passion, a drive. His laugh lit up the room and his eyes sparkled. Books captured his interest and the ocean was his love. Bright, neon yellow sneakers adorned his feet. Adored by many, he was handsome and kind. The Man taught his children to live a life of honesty and integrity.

After many years a slow fade began. A drink here, a drink there: our society cheered.
A seed was planted, a weed appeared. 
The more it grew the more the Man lost. 
He worked hard and life was rough. What would another glass cost?

The honesty was the first to go. Before he knew it, the Man was telling lies. 
Sneaking to get more, conniving for another sip. The sparkle left his eyes. Books no longer held the same appeal. His laughter slowly died.

He left his daughters and his wife‚Äôs touch. The man sought the arms of the ocean he loved so much. 
Was it time to end it all? 
No, he still had to answer the drink‚Äôs siren call.

A breaking point had been reached. The Man lost his home, his wife. He pushed away his daughters.
He went back to his glass, barely eating food, and hardly drinking water.
The Man‚Äôs handsome visage began to fade. 
His thoughts became clouded and his memories forgotten, as only the drink stayed.

The Man wakes to find himself in a hospital, mind clear, no longer filled with a buzz. 
Bright, yellow hospital socks adorned his feet, a mockery of the man he once was. 
The daughter he had pushed away held his hand.
He clutched to it tightly, hoping somehow she‚Äôd understand.

The daughter looked upon her dad, with tears in her eyes and saw death‚Äôs door. 
He appeared twenty years older, maybe more.
Yellow eyes and skin, wrinkled and peeling. 
Black and purple splotches along his arms and legs. She didn‚Äôt know what she should be feeling.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no going back,‚Äù He cried. Apologies, too few and too late.  
He remembered the times he lied.
The Man now stared death in the face. 

And all he could think...
When could he get another drink?

You see, day by day, he whittled his soul away. Six years after, six feet under.

&#x200B;

First of all i want to thank all of you ‚Äì this sub has helped me so much by being so relatable. The heartbreaking and the wholesome posts.     


Little backstory beforehand: I'm now at 105 days after drinking a bottle of vodka daily for the last 1 or 2 years. My problem already started at the age of 14 (30 now) i guess and became being coping mechanism for not dealing with my life.     


105 days ago my life turned upside down and stop drinking is the first thing I did in order to get my sh\*t together. Currently dealing with Codependency (still living with my depressive ex, but soon moving out) and some kind of quarter life crisis which seems to lead to a depressive episode and maybe burnout. Unfortunatly I have to wait for another 6 months to get therapy but it's on the list. Maybe it's just my wicked mind and not necessarily the alkohol but don't worry ‚Äì I get to the point now.   


I never thought of me as a ""dumb"" person. In fact I have a degree in computer science. But in conversations and at work I don't seem to think about what I'm doing. The easiest and most obvious answers to questions or problems just don't come into my mind ‚Äì although working in the field for some years. It's not only that I have some kind of brain fog (it got better over time, but still there) but also that I just zone out of conversations and that I'm not able to remember most of what people are talking. Also happens while reading articles. I sometimes just stop and try to remember the last 2 sentences I just read. But nope ‚Äì it's gone. Also my mind is blank most of the time.     


I'm taking Vitamin B and Magnesium pills because I read that this might help and that there is often a deficit in recovering alcoholics.     


Has anyone gone through something similar? Did it get better? I REALLY don't like being this way and I'm scared that I damaged myself to a point of no return....

What are your experiences with sleepiness and sobriety?","Just like title says, after this coming Saturday, it will be a full 4 weeks since I've had a beer, the longest I've gone in over 20 years. It's a little difficult to compare my own consumption to other topic starters, sometimes I see people posting that their daily habit was 3 bottles of wine or ""a handle"" a night. Personally, I love beer, I love going to breweries, but over a long time, I developed a habit of 3, 4, 5, sometimes 6 (usually only on weekends) high ABV (6-10%) beers a night, and over that time, it really started to catch up to me. I was having major anxiety that started after a breakup 3 years ago, and the anxiety would just get worse and worse every morning if I drank the day before, oftentimes waking at 3:00 AM for no reason, with a feeling of just doom and having no future and missing the things that I once had and of what could have been.

OK, so, almost 4 weeks ago I decided that was it, I can't handle the anxiety anymore, I can't handle acting stupid anymore, or saying things I never would have said, and I have a ton of personal goals that I want to achieve, which wouldn't be possible if I kept pressing the pause button on life every day.

So I went from 4-5 hours of sleep to 7, still getting up at random times to use the bathroom, but not lying there starting at 3AM anymore.. I started eating way healthier, cooking at home 2-3 times/day, mostly fresh veggies and protein and stir-fry, tofu, rice, beans, oatmeal, salads, etc.... I've been getting a very strenuous workout 4-5 days/week. But now I'm tired all the time..  whereas, when I had that lunch beer (or three), naptime was because of the beer, now I nap just because I'm tired, and I want to go to bed before 9.   Is this my body and mind healing from all the poor sleep and lack of sleep while drinking almost everyday? How long does this last? I'd love to be able to go to bed at 10 and wake up at 6 everyday without feeling the need to nap in the afternoon.

I will say that I still love beer, and occasionally indulge in a NA option like Athletic, Clausthaler, etc..  perhaps that ""less than .5% ABV"" is interfering with things, I don't know. Looking for others who have felt the same way to chime in.

I‚Äôm not saying that this freedom has come easily. Staying sober is really fucking hard in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù times, not to mention during a global pandemic.

From being integral in my family culture to my social and work networks, alcohol has always been around. It was pretty cool that my parents let me drink some wine with dinner when I was young. They really did teach me responsibly and I wasn't always such an avid drinker. Times change and people grow older and we form new habits, though.

I was diagnosed with ADD a few months ago and I had no idea how I missed it all these years. It wasn't until some casual pokes and prods that I thought about getting referred to a psychiatrist. Well, now I'm properly medicated and really taking a stone cold look at my life and my habits. 

It's amazing how much alcohol was a crutch to fill boredom and time. It went from a social activity to the social activity. Bored in the afternoon and stressed out from work? Quick shot and a beer back and you'll be right as rain. Except that really wasn't what I needed. The self-medication to absolve myself of responsibility for my failures, but also the poison pill that kept me from doing anything about it in a meaningful way. When alcohol is your second job, it gets in the way of a lot of things.

My obsession with alcohol, drinking, and (for lack of a better term) ""bar culture"" have ruined relationships. I've been so obsessed with getting wasted I went on shitty dates with shitty people and got stolen from and mentally abused. I've done plenty of things I regret at company christmas parties, social gatherings, etc. It wasn't the only thing wrong with my last serious relationship, but it certainly helped put the final nails in that coffin. I used to be in great shape, now I'm fantastically overweight and out of breath.

I don't really know what my point is, or why anybody would be reading this. This whole account has been created because I'm DONE with letting that insidious voice in the back of my head telling me to crawl back to the bar and pickle myself alive call the shots. I am starting again, sitting here working on my fourth day sober. My close friends have been supportive so far, but I'm just not ready to share with the world yet. I've got my strategies lined up and ready, but I'm scared that this resolve and sense of purpose will falter over time. It's important to not worry about the future and its pitfalls, however, as they're omnipresent and there's no way you'll ever be fully prepared for everything. 

So here it is, my promise to you. I will not drink with you today, and I'll come back here when my resolve does waver. If it does, that's not the end of the journey, but a stumble during the middle of one. Today's always another chance to make the change you want in life.

I was a beer and nightclub person in my 20s, and that didn't go very well. Then I settled into quiet beer in the local pub, and wine at home. I started to find as I headed through my forties that my hangovers were getting worse and worse. Right now even two pints of beer will leave me feeling miserable in the morning. I get a chill feeling of regret in my stomach a minute or so after I wake each day. If I am at all drunk when I go to bed I wake in the night feel tense and miserable and can't sleep again unless I take painkillers. I take ibuprofen as all the others have other health effects that I don't want.  


As beer and wine both make me feel so rough I moved over to spirits. Whisky in fact. I had avoided whisky for most of my drinking life as I didn't understand how it is consumed. I thought being strong it would lead to me being very drunk. However I discovered that actually it's a drink which is sipped, not gulped. I liked all the tastes of different whiskies, and found a new world there. I found that I could measure out and only drink four shots in a night, which leaves me with almost no hangover and a bottle lasts a week. Great!

However the Covid lockdown has been getting to me. I don't really miss the pub. I drink beer there and to be honest many of the guys in my local are not that great to talk to - some actively dislike me for my centrist politics. Right now it would be plain dangerous anyway. I digress. 

I have found in the past few weeks that the number of whisky shots per night is going up, I now will do 8-10 per night which is about the same alcohol as a bottle of wine. The whisky advantage has gone.

So.. it's time for me to break the pattern. I don't know that I'll give up forever, but I want to give up sitting and drinking whisky in the lockdown.  I have been struggling as it is now embedded as a habit. I stop work, go to the lounge and put on the TV, watch something good and sip whisky, Its making me fat and miserable.   


Getting past this first night will be a challenge...  I have about three hours before bedtime. I will not go to the shop and replace the bottle I finished last night.

I'll post back later and tell you how its going. Thank you for reading.",19,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 2}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9843797087669373}"

Hello r/stopdrinking. I find myself in a somewhat unique situation and one that I can't find much info about googling. I have been an alcoholic for the past 16 years (currently 36). When my wife became pregnant three months ago I had an existential crisis about my habits and resolved myself to change. Over the course of the last two months I've managed to make radical changes to the amount and frequency I drink, going from drinking all day every day to limiting myself to 1-2 drinks in the evening every other day. It may not seem like much to most people but this is an accomplishment for me and has been great for my general feeling of well being and my relationships. I had forgotten what it feels like to wake up every day feeling fine because just feeling like shit had become so normalized.

I now find myself going through symptoms of PAWs, most especially brain fog and sleep difficulties. It comes and goes and I'm managing, but I wonder if they'll every go away so long as I choose to continue drinking even if in small amounts? Will it take longer? The brain fog is becoming really difficult to deal with. I worry about stopping completely because the times I have for any amount of time in the past I would become a wreck with stress and anxiety over the smallest things, something I can't afford to have right now. I know it can take a long time for things like brain fog to go away even when quitting completely but I wonder if it ever will if I continue to drink comparatively infrequently, or if I'm just prolonging the period. It's definitely the worst symptom for me and it's starting to effect my job performance on and off.

Typing to you from here in fair Philadelphia, where were are experiencing another round of new restrictions and gyms, among other things, will be shut down again beginning tomorrow.  


And... I just can't tell you how much that knocks the wind out of me. Having the gym and this positive routine in my life is what really, REALLY has been helping me during this time. I'm just over 80 days and proud as hell but this is definitely going to be a challenge. Anything destructive or unhelpful in my life has always been blotted-out with other, more positive routines- weight training, running, meditation- these are all things that I've incorporated into my life in order to heal from something.  

I really leaned into not drinking and fell into a really good rhythm of being in bed early so that I could be up and in the weight room by 6:30. My recovery times were so much better in sobriety and I had worked out a routine that allowed me to work out 5-6 days a week with proper recovery time. My fitness routine had given me a real focus and helped me with some kind of routine in a world turned inside fucking out amid the pandemic. I've really been seeing great results, too- as someone who has been working out for close to ten years, the energy and recovery in a sober life was bloody *unreal* and I honestly believe the last 2 months have been the most productive in all of my time in training. But now that's not happening for a while- who knows how long- and I have to come to grips with that.  


I won't pretend that this inconvenience is anywhere on the level of the times that other people are going through- I'm thankful to be able to work from home and that I'm very fortunate to live by myself. I have a paycheck coming in. There are people who have been out of work for months, people who are sick. Hell, I lost my mother to COVID-19 not even two weeks ago and we couldn't even have a funeral for her. But y'know, I am thankful that I wasn't fucked up and drunk with grief during all of it. Happy that I could be the kind of person my stepfather needed during this time, rather than just turning my phone off so I couldn't be bothered while getting drunk. I'm not happy she's a box of dust now but jesus christ, I'm fucking happy that I could experience those emotions raw for once and not blurred and smeared and never truly experienced. Alcohol does that to me, and has done that to me my whole life.  


But fuck- this is gonna be tough. Despite most things being okay otherwise, I know this is going to be difficult. I know that it's good-intentioned and all but I'm note sure I can deal with one more person lecture me on the virtues of *calisthenics* and *at-home exercises*. If you have a routine or take weight training seriously, you probably know what I mean. Again, I know it's meant to be helpful but it's nothing short of infuriating.   


I'm reading this over and feel like I'm just bitching and moaning about something really trivial but it's coming from a very real place and as much as I'm already rolling my eyes, I feel like I should share it. I feel that sense of sharing it because  I'm sure there is someone else who is experiencing the same thing in these absolutely absurdist times we're living in.   


I legitimately feel like this is the first real challenge since I stopped drinking almost 3 months ago- weight training helped me find a way out and now I need to make do without for a little while. And yknow, I think life will be normal again someday but in the meantime I need to consider everything else that isn't breaking for myself and lean into that, instead of the things that I can't control.   


Thanks y'all. Love y'all.

I've cut back on my drinking quite a bit in the last few months after a bender at the beginning of lockdown that made me really sick.

The problem is that I can't get myself to do anything now. I know some of this is tied to my adhd. Even though I'm medicated, alcohol served to quiet my brain enough that I could focus on tasks, and not get overwhelmed as easily. 

It's also just a result of having created this pattern and relying on it for the last 10 years. Does anyone have ideas or experience with changing this pattern?

I've tried just letting myself off the hook when it comes to being productive, because logically I know tackling this addiction is more important than having a clean house. That led to feeling overwhelmed or ""buried"" and also triggered me to drink.

We did a lot of reminiscing about old photos last night and I had an enumerable amount of my ex that I just can't bring myself to delete. It hurts to look at them and think that I fucked up something so good by continuing to drink, but they are all good memories of her and our time together at the very least. I realized last night and this morn that since we split back in the beginning of the year and I drank for a little while after then, I never really got to mourn the relationship.

Now I am. And it hurts. Taking everything I have not to message her.

I remember the disgusting feeling walking into the LC to buy my poison. The shame, the guilt. It starts there.

Then I have my brown bag, and I reach into it when I am in the car and pull out the road drink. Yes, road drink. 

I gag as I open it and get the first whiff of alcohol. I take a tentative sip, swallow and gag again.

The next sip is easier, and the next one is a gulp. I finish the can in time to arrive home.

Throw the can into the trash bin, and grab the brown bag. Tuck it under my arm in hopes my neighbors don‚Äôt see and recognize the bag.

I get into my house, frantically fumbling with my jacket and boots as I can‚Äôt get them off fast enough. I run up with my bag into my room and stuff it between my bed and night table ignoring the old wine stains on both.

I settle onto the bed, grab the contents of the bag and I twist the cap of the liter tetra pack of red wine. Sometimes I pour it into a glass, sometimes I drink straight out of the carton. It depends how desperate I am. I take deep long sips until I no longer notice the warmth in my chest. About a quarter of the way through, my head starts to feel swampy, what used to be the onset of a happy buzz is now just a cloudy, soupy and numb feeling. 

It‚Äôs time to start the chain smoking ritual, so down to the basement bathroom to smoke so my neighbors don‚Äôt see and judge me. I only leave my bed to go to the upstairs washroom to pee, or downstairs to smoke.

What do I do all night? Who knows. Put on a show I pay no attention to, scroll through my phone looking at whoknowswhat, spending money I don‚Äôt have on Amazon ‚Äì this item is what I need to finally make my life better! Maybe stuff some crap into my mouth that I call dinner. 

This will continue until I am shaking the empty carton above my opened mouth trying to drink the last drop. Regretting I haven‚Äôt saved any for the morning shakes. I can only save some when I buy a box of wine, but I‚Äôm trying to ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù the amount I drink in a night and I always go over when I have a box.

I shut everything off and lay down in bed, close my eyes and hope to pass out shortly. Which I do, usually around 8 or 9 oclock. 

I wake up with a jolt around 2 or 3 am, heart racing, in a full panic attack. I feel horrendous. I know I have to be up for work in a few hours. I lay there sweating and shaking, cursing that I don‚Äôt have anything to drink to get me back to sleep, in full anxiety until my alarm clock rings. 

I snooze it until the last possible moment, not because I am sleeping but I am horrified at the thought of getting out of bed and facing my day. When I finally get up, I rush through throwing together a sorry excuse for a lunch, I try to put some makeup on to hide the bloated, puffy hungover mess that is my face, shakily get dressed and make a coffee. I gulp the coffee down hoping that it will wake me up and make me feel better, but it never does. I crawl back under the covers, set a timer for the last possible minute before I have to leave and clutch my pillow. The anxiety grips my whole body and I am exhausted. And I despise myself for doing it again.

This was my life. Not anymore.

I cannot express how grateful I am to be sober today. I am no stranger to attempts to quit and stretches of sobriety, but I never fully committed.

Today, I have a strong recovery plan that I am treating like a full time job. AA and other recovery meetings daily, devouring books, blogs, articles and podcasts on recovery, journaling, reflection, meditation, healthy diet, and even starting light exercise.

I have been prescribed Naltrexone in the past, and it worked a bit but I never committed to that either. If I had been serious, Naltrexone would have been a huge tool in the recovery toolbox, and if that‚Äôs an option for anyone I highly recommend it. I still have it handy, but I don‚Äôt need it currently. I work through cravings as they come with my CBT Therapy workbook, meeting attendance and meditation. I play the tape forward. I revisit my reasons for not drinking. 

Today, I choose to put my recovery first and for that I am infinitely grateful.

I've lurked here off and on for some time now and finally feel ready to start this next chapter.  I've been tapering down for a few days on beer (not my drink of choice) and plan on having just one today and tomorrow and then having Saturday be my first day without a drink.

I have so much on my mind and want to share with someone but am afraid to talk to anyone in my life just yet mostly because I'm afraid that I'll fail and they'll be disappointed in my weakness.  Most people know me as a drinker, but I'm not sure if they think I have a problem (although after typing that out I suspect I may have been deluding myself).

My primary motivations for quitting now are:

1. I'm preparing to merge households with my boyfriend and his (shared custody) young children.  For the past two years, the kids have only seen me for chunks of time until now so I've been able to do the bulk of my drinking outside their presence.  I spent the entire weekend with them last week and it shamed me to drink a bottle of wine a day in front of them.  I would have had more if I were by myself and I didn't present as drunk or foolish.  I'm not even sure that they noticed.  But I don't want to set that example for them and I was embarrassed of myself.  My partner is a very moderate drinker.  He's never said anything about my drinking, but I don't want it to cause problems between us.  This is the healthiest relationship I've ever had in my life (I'm in my mid-40s) and I don't want to screw it up.
2. My depression and anxiety are out of control.  I'm attacking them on multiple fronts and giving myself some grace because of the state of the world, etc.  But ignoring the elephant in the room has to stop.  I'm hoping that eliminating alcohol will allow me the energy to start exercising and utilizing other tools to get out of this darkness.  This is my biggest fear as alcohol has obviously been my self-medicating drug of choice.  I suspect things may get worse before they get better.
3. Mostly related to #2, but I need to get my professional life back on track.  It's not completely off the rails, but its slipping.  I've always taken a lot of pride in my work and my self esteem is closely intertwined.  Both feel like they're in the shitter right now.  Drowning myself in wine hasn't improved the situation.

Anyway, sorry for the long post.  Appreciate anyone that reads and/or has any words of encouragement.  I'm exploring the resources shared here and will be checking in frequently as your successes (and willingness to re-start after setbacks) are truly helpful and inspiring.

I also want to air something I feel strange about and here is the only place I can, it may be stupid but here goes. I listen to arm chair expert podcast. For those who know dax shepard is the host and he admitted to being dishonest about his sobriety. Basically claiming 16 years but recently was doing oxy daily for 2 months (also admitting to a couple other oxy abuse events during the 16 years). 

After admitting it he talked of his experiences with his relapse and it was very interesting and I respected it a lot. No judgement. Since he was one of the first sober people I knew I've been really appreciating his insights and honesty. However my problem with the show and I suppose dax comes when I listened to the show right after it when he begins the show saying he is 16 years sober. I guess I just feel cheated here and bad for people who truly have long term sobriety. I don't judge the relapse, just claiming being sober for that long just seems like a joke. I've never listened since. 

Thanks for letting me vent. Iwndwyt!

Yesterday was crazy, was drinking with a stranger I just met called Tom, then he drank too much and ended up in hospital. I called him an ambulance and went home. I was smelling like booze when I got there, next day part of my family made an intervention, said if I don't stop drinking I will ,,kill them all (emotionally)"" and they will ,,turn their back on me."" They said they loved me and I had to promise it... So now my new life starts I guess...

Im 56 days, 9h and 35 minutes sober as of the time I started writing this.

Im writing this because I'm in my own head and feels right now and just want the opportunity to vent. Yesterday was crazy for me. Im newly sober, this being my first real forray into sobriety instead of strictly abstinence after a 16 year pattern of addiction. I couldn't get sober, not did I understand what sobriety was, on my own. I went to a 30 day inpatient program specifically designed for people like me. Follower that with two weeks of outpatient therapy and treatment and now here I am in this big beautiful world doing this sobriety thing without the safety nets and guide rails that I had when I was first starting out on this adventure.

Yesterday sucked. I was asked by friends to help someone with about a year of sobriety who had very recently relapsed. I called my sponsor, my therapists, and anyone else I could think of in the moment for what I called ""sage wisdom"". Sponsor answered and told me I should probably not get too involved, just offer to take him to a meeting and encourage him to get professional help. Unfortunately I felt obligated to help by friends. After all, I'm the guy who just got a new lease on life right? I should be perfect for this. Or at least that's what I thought they were thinking (I can hear my therapist admonishing me for mind reading as the annoying, but almost always right angel on my shoulder). Problem is, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. Like, I do, I'm learning what works for me and I'm practicing skills I once thought long gone, dead, and forgotten. But suffice to say I was super nervous about going to help. I mean I JUST got sober, JUST got out of a intensive inpatient psych center. Who the fuck am I to be helping this guy with a year or more of sobriety, until very recently at least.

My therapists never called me back, and that stings. Makes me feel more alone. I know I'm not alone, I've got AA, a sponsor, a wife, and a practicing clinical therapist as a family member.

I finished yesterday having spent almost 6 hours with the guy. I chose the path of rigorous honesty. I was authentic and real with him. I took him to two meetings, all the while being questioned by everyone else who feels like they have a right to know what's going on. I kept his confidence, and reminded folks that AA is based around anonymity. But I left there feeling worn the fuck out. Mentally and emotionally. I felt stressed too.

I then discussed the day with my wife, and we proceeded to have a long conversation about the whole situation. The way we talked, all I kept thinking of is, we're using this conversation about SOMEONE ELSE'S problems as a proxy for a conversation for our feelings on sobriety and relapse.

 What I'm doing is enough. I'm sure of it. All I've got to do is not drink today. Im confident that I won't drink today but, I'm also stuck feeling icky about all of it I guess.

Im not completely sure why I wrote this, but, I did. Im struggling to manage my own anxieties and insecurities. Im trying to be self compassionate, and afford myself grace, but self esteem has always been an issue for me.

The people involved want me to keep taking the dude to meetings and trying to talk to him. I want to, I feel obligated to, but boy does it make me anxious and stress me out.

Any thoughts, opinions, or whatever is welcomed. I guess I just needed to vent.

I hope this helps some people struggling to understand that it's ok to struggle. Some days being sober is easy, some days it's hard. My best day drunk is still worse that my worst day sober.

I have struggled with alcohol abuse for as long as I can remember.
In the past I often found myself binge-drinking where I'd wake up without memories of the night before.

Now as a 21... Or 22? I can't remember how I old I am, probably 21... It's time for more changes in my lifestyle!
I have used and abused various drugs in my life, I lost my mother some 2 years ago and have found myself dissociated with obsessive thinking and bursts of mania or adrenaline since.
When I was younger I was diagnosed with ADD and this whole cocktail of experimentation, the death of my mother, ADD and obsessive thinking with a verbally very strong brain made me an absolute mess at times.

My best friend (22F) and I got together about 3 months ago, she hates drugs and I did quit in fact... Her opinion of alcohol is somewhat mixed, she saw alcohol being abused in her family and obviously doesn't want me to end up in the same spot....

Now to get to the point, I have no problem with not drinking though sometimes it's tempting especially when I'm with friends or other drinkers since I found myself being a real star when I'm drunk!
The problem is I can't stop... I drink and drink and drink and pass out.

Now last weekend my girlfriend took my on a surprise trip to go camping which was alot of fun, I didn't drink in 2 weeks and she brought 2 beers for me. No problem... Until I made it a problem by buying a bottle of rum, thinking I could use it in moderation... I couldn't, it was empty by day 2 and I even took a huge sip when she was out of my sight... :(

Fast forward to today, I am hungover... I thought of drinking a bit of vodka and passed out, called in sick... I checked the bottle and it was near-empty...
I am DONE!

Because sometimes it really did come down to the second. 

Before I got sober I spent a lot of time silently wishing for anything to happen that would put me out of my misery. I am so incredibly grateful that wish came true in a way that gave life back to me instead of taking it. I owe so much of who I am & what I have now to my sobriety. It gave me back to myself, to the world around me, & there is no greater gift as it is the gift that keeps on giving. I am deeply devoted, day after day, to loving myself. To choosing myself over & over, even if what I discover is ugly or difficult. To making amends with my past & sometimes my present. To waking in happiness & in kindness. I decided in the beginning that forward (with some stumbles, side steps, & a jig or two) is the only direction I am willing to move. I chose sober because I wanted a better life. I stay sober because I got one.

I would get withdrawals in the middle of the night and have to wake up at 4 to get a fix. Then I would drink all day. An in-patient detox was not an option so I have been tapering off at home. 

Last night I went to bed early, still with two full cans which I saved for the next day, something that never would have happened a week or so ago. (I‚Äôm down to 4 a day now, which I allocate myself over the course of the day). Later I went into the kitchen to find a nearly full bottle of rum on the counter. Old me would not have hesitated to have taken a swig (or three) but instead I resisted. Luckily I live with very supportive friends who know what I‚Äôm going through- it was an oversight on their part. 

This morning I woke up and WASNT SICK. I didn‚Äôt NEED a drink. I made my bed! I‚Äôve eaten breakfast! 

Full sobriety is the goal but I know how dangerous going cold turkey can be. For me those small achievements are enough for now. 

Big love to all those trying to cut back. The self control required is insane and it‚Äôs hard to battle with that perfectionist feeling of wanting to just quit straight away- I can feel like a failure but little moments like this are what keep me going. Eyes on the prize guys.

If I began drinking now, tomorrow, or sometime in the distant future I would not have a limit. The lines of control would be blurred, and I‚Äôd run right through them like a marathoner through a thin ribbon. There is no STOP sign in all capital letters for me. I have no red or yellow light, only a giant green one encouraging me to reward myself with another drink, and then another, and another... you get the gist.

This won‚Äôt change with time, no matter how long I abstain from alcohol. This is what makes me an alcoholic. I am the very definition of it, and I always will be until the day I die. 

So no, I can‚Äôt just have ‚Äúone drink‚Äù, and yes, it WILL kill me, albeit slowly and gradually over time; Not to mention the other things it kills, including trust, relationships, and dignity. Alcohol is that bad influence friend from adolescence, throwing you into all sorts of unwanted trouble. It‚Äôs that mean voice that‚Äôs normally silenced but unleashed into the wild after your second bottle, ready to sink its teeth into the ones you love most. It‚Äôs deceitful, gluttonous, and has a hunger for self sabotage with every rich sip that might as well be your last. If I could die from embarrassment I would have a dozen times over. Alcohol has never had my best interests at heart, and the funny thing is... I‚Äôve always known this, but I kept doing it. What can I say? I‚Äôm no quitter, but I had to be, just this once. 

I‚Äôm not holier than thou or self righteous by choosing not to drink, and I don‚Äôt care if you do. That would be quite hypocritical, no? So please, respect my choice not to drink. I could fall off the wagon at any time, and each day I don‚Äôt drink is a miracle. I‚Äôm living every moment on a tight rope, swaying high above a tempting pool of strong spirits calling my name like sirens, but I choose not to fall in. Instead, I continue to balance, and walk across that tight rope to the very end of my life. 

Why? because of the dangers that lie in the deep end, and a tiny serene voice beckoning for me to dive in so I can drown. You see, I don‚Äôt consume the liquid, it consumes me, and it always has.

Time to share. 

I noticed some cravings creeping in just before my one year anniversary and put it down to PAWS. I didn‚Äôt take it seriously enough and wanted to believe I was free and didn‚Äôt need to worry about relapsing. I was so happy and grateful to be sober! No chance of me sliding back into that hell! Drinking had become something I barely even thought about and I‚Äôd started taking my sobriety for granted.

A few weeks ago I gave in to the daily cravings and had three glasses of wine. It wasn‚Äôt a pleasant experience and I thought ‚Äúoh, that put the lid on that!‚Äù Two weeks after that I had another three glasses of wine and again, it wasn‚Äôt great. Four days after that (last night) I had four glasses.

Uh-oh. Not a tragic relapse story (yet) but enough to scare me. The episodes are getting closer together and the amount increasing. Today I‚Äôve made a doctor‚Äôs appointment and am shoring up my sober resources.

In retrospect I can see how internally rigid and uncompromising I‚Äôd become with myself. I‚Äôve had some stressful family experiences that I‚Äôm struggling to cope with. The self-love and self-care had evaporated. I was still doing all the right things but I was putting a perfectionistic spin on it. Militant self care! I‚Äôd started eating shit food and craving weird things every day, like frozen berries and lentil chips. I was thinking like an addict but didn‚Äôt realise because it wasn‚Äôt alcohol. Until it was.

I feel pretty vulnerable and am scared I‚Äôve put myself back into the trap of fucking misery, self-loathing and helplessness.

I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre here.

He took a fall and couldn't get up and was on the floor for 24 hours until the friend he was to meet at the bar for his Birthday went to check on him when he didn't show up.

I see a pattern and need help breaking it. Asking for genuine advice.,"It was so refreshing not craving alcohol. I'm a six-pack-or-more -a-day-er . When I had covid, not only did I not crave booze, I didn't even realize I had no cravings until  4 days in. Two weeks passed EFFORTLESSLY. Typically, I can only do 3-4 days sober before I'm kaput, so this was an incredible, gratifying, and, ironically, positive experience.

What sucks is that I craved no booze UNTIL the day before I was out of quarantine. And then, the day I was cleared for general pop, I single-mindedly ran straight for a drink and had the best time ever that night and the two nights after.

My problem is that when I drink, things don't turn out bad. At worst, I spend too much money on delivery food and get bad sleep and am a cranky ass at work. Other than that, I'm very affable, sociable, and everyone seems to like me. I am a gregarious person whether sober or drunk, but drunk-me offers me a sort of cheat code to being super-personable. Yes, there are times I have over-done it, but honestly, I am cursed with the fact that being drunk works out for me  99% of the time.

To contrast, my mother was an angry drunk. She wasted away sitting at the TV, unless she was burdened with taking me out to drive-thru, where she'd drunkenly berate the cashier. She had multiple DUIs. She was physical with both of her husbands. One time, as a young teenager, I was helpless as she sat on the ground and drunkenly wept, insisting that a clerk told her she was too fat for a pair overalls. I was 16 and had no one to turn to.

My steps toward sobriety consist of intermittent AA meetings, which have ceased since COVID, to audio books (This Naked Mind, The Easy Way to Control Alcoholic by Allen Carr), to therapy with various therapists, who are frankly way more ignorant about the topic of addiction than the dirty, grimy people of AA.

Despite this attention to my well-being, I am still helplessly addicted to alcohol, marijuana, caffeine, videogames, my phone, etc. I try to develop healthy habits, but my drug addictions and poor sleep hygiene render me helpless to make rational decisions.

What should I do when I feel rational half of the time, and irrational the other half? I go to sleep hopeful, and awake a different man. I work my stressful job and then after the long day, the question of drinking isn't even a question. It's an answer: Yes, of course, why not? Life is hard and you have nothing to look forward to.

When I am sober and I think about drinking, I think about the immediate relief of stress, tension, anxiety. I know that alcohol disrupts my life to the point that I have poor sleep, hygiene, physical conditioning, etc. But, in the hours it takes to make a choice, alcohol is always a good choice.

And then there's when I know drinking is wrong but I do it anyway. I think to myself, ""BE STRONG. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. YOU WANT TO BE SOBER, REMEMBER?"" But my emotions don't match up with these alien thoughts. I know these thoughts are fucking bull shit and that, two drinks in, I am fucking GOLDEN.

So how do I care enough to stop myself? How do I undermine my lack of willpower? My irrational thought patterns? I wish I had to be sequestered to an island so I could spend 90+ days re-configuring my brain.",15,"{'covid': 3, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5526479482650757}"

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning, lovely SD,

I could not expect to keep what I had gained unless I gave it away.

One of the reasons I enjoy being a part of this community is because it is an opportunity to be of service. I can offer a kind word, or an upvote, or even take the wheel here at the DCI for a week. 

If you have over 30 days here, and want to see what it's like to do this yourself, please give it a go and let u/SaintHomer know you're interested. I've really enjoyed having you all here at The House of Fox, and my time hosting is quickly coming to an end... I'll be back though, this is too good to stay away from for too long.

Something that I've been rolling around in my head today: ""Keep coming back!"" is a snarky, backhanded thing to say, like ""Bless your heart!"". I always knew I'd hit some raw nerves, or was, in fact, the actual raw nerve, when that little saying would come piping out of mouths at a meeting. That's how I knew I was heading in the right direction, that I still had the fight in me to try, even if I fell short of the mark. They got to sit there with smug self satisfied little smiles on their faces, but I could not help to think to myself, ""that is not what I want my sobriety to look like"".

Keep trying and to hell with all those opposed, bless their cold little hearts. ;p

Today is a beautiful day to be alive!

I'm a bartender. Been drinking roughly a bottle of whiskey plus 3 to 12 beers a day for 20+ years. Drinking on the clock is advised. I have my first doctor's appointment since 1996 coming up, and I'm going to talk to them about detox and meds I might need (already have moderately high blood pressure and health issues from drinking/smoking/drugs), but that's not until the 9th of December. I'm terrified to quit. I don't know who I am. Haven't done well with moderation. Tapering seems impossible. My partner still drinks fairly heavily, but has expressed a possibility of stopping if I need that support. Finding another job in my area isn't likely; face and hand tattoos make me largely ineligible for regular office, warehouse, or retail work, and the pay cut I'd have to take would make rent and utilities near impossible without taking on multiple jobs. I don't know anything but high pressure substance abuse service industry. No insurance, so inpatient detox isn't possible.

He is 37 years old and has been sober for at least the last 3 years. 

We were mostly acquaintances up until a few years ago, but my best friend was his roommate and close friend in 2011-2012. They lived in a small mountain town on the other side of the country from me, where the entire culture is skiing and drinking. My best friend knew that this friend was a heavy drinker, and told me about how he would drink to the point of blacking out often. We knew he struggled with some mental health issues, but I don't think anyone realized how bad it got over the years that followed, but shortly before the time that I came to know him well he was taken to the hospital for treatment, and later admitted to rehab. During his early days of recovery he was told that, due to the extensive damage he'd done to his organs, he had just months to live, even if he stayed sober. The last time I saw him, at a bluegrass festival last September (2019), he told his friends there, including me, that there was still a 50/50 chance that his organs would fail in the near future. Still, he maintained a positive outlook and made his peace with it all.

Things seemed to be looking up since then, and there were no new developments until yesterday, when I learned that over the past couple of months the scales tipped the other direction. His body began to fail, and his liver was no longer responding to treatment. He was admitted to the hospital a few weeks ago, and yesterday his wife made the decision to put him on hospice care. He is completely unresponsive to anything but physical touch and she cannot see him at the moment. 

I know it sounds cliche, but he is truly one of a kind. Most of the people I know are somehow like at least one other person I know, but there is no one like him. He was absolutely born in the wrong century, and as such never felt he fit in in the modern world, being more content to fiddle around with old tools and instruments than to watch Netflix or play video games. He is a gifted musician and avid outdoorsman, and combined the two to teach conservation and history through a variety of programs. When I think of him he has a backpack on and his mandolin in his hands. I consider him one of the earliest musical influences on me who I knew personally, and I play the things and the style that I do today partly because of him. He took solace in his music in his darkest times, and I wish that the people who loved him could have found a way to convince him that the booze wasn't helping either. And now years after getting sober it has come back to claim its due. 

I've been working on getting better this year. I don't have my badge set right now, but I'm on day 10. I was able to string together over 4 months of sobriety earlier this year, but broke in June and it's been hit or miss since then. The past 24 hours have been a stark reminder of how bad it can get and how many lives it can absolutely crush. My friend influenced thousands of people, people who loved him and told him that often. He had a hand in educating people from all over the world about conservation, history, and music, but that couldn't save him from himself. He couldn't either. Nobody on Earth deserves life more than he does, but the bottle always gets what it's owed. So tonight, I'm not drinking for you, Tim.",50,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7789348363876343}"

My depression in particular spiraled, and I ended up in the psych ward at one point last year. 

I would do sober stints here and there. I‚Äôd feel better for a while but always come back to drinking. And then progressively back to drinking more and more. Over the same period my medication for anxiety/depression kept changing. I‚Äôd keep seeing my therapist but not make many improvements in my daily life.

I feel good about this, yesterday was the first time I‚Äôve ever been truly open about my drinking to anyone that isn‚Äôt SD, I talked to my therapist and had a session with my wife and her therapist, and even though it wasn‚Äôt easy and pretty exhausting, if feels good to have it out there, known to the people I need help from. My goal is to make it until the end of the month and hopefully the end of the year, I feel like I can manage that, and I will. 
Thanks SD, it‚Äôs weird how good it feels to make these posts and read your replies. I‚Äôll give you an update tomorrow.

This went on for years. I dint start at with the amount mentioned, but progressively got there. On bad nights I could drink 25-30 Whitelaw's or similar. 

I'm in a marriage with my soulmate, and I have shown her more than once that I can be an idiot. I'm more than grateful that she loves and supports me. Its time I pay her back the love she has shown. Many reasons for doing this, but for another post on another day. Tonight I get to go meet her for dinner, and I'm sober going in, and will be sober going out. Feels good!

This is what I wanted and what I thought would be fine. 

I had always lived in the bubble that society had constantly supported...alcohol is where the fun is. Everything is better with drinking. Growing up in a small town it‚Äôs even more ingrained in the way we live. 

That being said, I have been successful throughout my adult life for the most part but have done plenty of very dumb and dangerous shit. I‚Äôve put myself in situations that could have taken everything from me...numerous times. Each of these occasions were the result of heavy drinking. 

Next thing I know, I‚Äôm returning home from a year tour in South Korea and facing a divorce. I immediately thought alcohol was the comfort I needed....but I knew in the back of my mind that I needed to be able to make better choices and get my life together or shit was about to get really bad. I was introduced to This Naked Mind, a book by Annie Grace. Decided to listen to it on a podcast. It seriously changed my life. I decided to try sobriety. 

In 6 months of sobriety I decided to run a half marathon, finish my degree, and get out of the military, after 10 years of Active duty service. Wow, everything was going great...and I finally saw alcohol for what it was...shit. For the first time in my life, problems seemed smaller, life felt easier, and my self confidence skyrocketed. I felt like I had some kind of a cheat code on life. 

Fast forward 6 more months and it slowly crept into my life. I thought since I had my shit together I could just slowly let it back in. However, I‚Äôve already put myself in sketchy situations that have risked my new career. Having ‚Äújust one‚Äù almost always leads to more. And good decision making ability goes right out the window! 

If anyone is struggling with the thought of going back to alcohol. Remember, it doesn‚Äôt help anything and doesn‚Äôt make anything better. You‚Äôll never regret NOT drinking. Hang in there folks and enjoy your day. Also, enjoy tomorrow morning when you wake up with energy ready to take on the day. IWNDWYT",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9753192663192749}"

Reading this sub made me trying to give up regular drinking. I (33M) had less sober days then drinking days since I was 16. Before I reached 25 it was like getting drunk like shit every time I drank. But since that time I started disliking being drunk and it became just a regular 200-300g per evening. No blackouts, no crazy things and stuff. I have a good job with good salary (IT specialist), healthy (hope so) relationships. But every meeting with friends ended up with booze and weed/coke. I don't have a hangover usually and I'm rather sporty (roleskating and riding a bike/bicycle). 
About a month ago my dad had a brain insult and after clinic he had to move to my place, so i supposed it's a good idea to stop gathering parties at home because of pandemic. I'm not that much afraid myself, but rly afraid about dad getting I'll. So finally I decided it's a good idea to break up with booze and take care of my health. 
Now a week passed, since I haven't been outside and that was totally sober week. I got into work, writing code like 10 hours every day, and looks like I love my new life without alcohol. I can't say, that I will never have a drink, since I like wine, I rly love how Guinness tastes, but I will do my best to never make it regular again. My goal is to stay absolutely sober until all this pandemic stuff ends, and then avoid drinking more than a glass of wine few times a year (hope I can manage this).

I was a binge drinker a heavy binge drinker at that... I'd do anything I could to get a drink, all I thought or cared about was my next drink. I look back and realise my pattern of behaviour screamed of alcoholism but I could never admit it and I'd brush it off everytime.
I was fed up of how destructive alcohol was in my life, I was fed up of how I was with alcohol in my life. I genuinely thought at the time it was the solution to my problems but in reality now I can see it was the cause. 

Outside I would say I'm doing pretty good and there has been no real drastic change but the real change for me has been on the inside!! 
I am so much better at handling my emotions and I can deal with problems head on and I am much clearer in thought. I no longer suffer with crippling anxiety and mentally feel in a much better place, I'm more accepting of myself and have really found out that I am a lot more resilient than what I thought. I've also learnt how to stand up for myself and stop being a yes person.

I've achieved a lot over the past 100 days, I've started college to begin a career in nursing, I've completed running challenges and fundraised for charity, I'm more present in my relationships, I'm receiving counselling for things I've avoided from my past, and I've confronted my past too, and still made it out the other side without a single drop of alcohol!! 

I never thought I could enter sobriety and stick to it but it really does go to show if you want something that badly then nothing is impossible because the word itself says IM POSSIBLE not forgetting the help from this subreddit too!!

Until this latest quitting attempt (taking various recommended supplements and getting back into intensive exercise) I'd been drinking quasi-regularly for ease-of-thought for writing, maybe 15 units a day (cider, therefore high-sugar, possibly cause of inflammation et al.) for a week every month, alongside social stuff.

Weirdly I seem to think considerably better in low ambient temperature, whereas the smallest amount of caffeine shuts my brain off pretty much completely (alongside a general hypersensitivity to stimulants).

Brain fog also worsened considerably after bingeing for several months whilst on anti-depressants (venlafaxine) several years ago.

Apart from perhaps occasional bouts of hypomania I don't appear to be exhibiting any withdrawal symptoms.

Does this sound familiar to anybody? Especially unfamiliar? Does anybody have any advice? Do you have any questions?

I was exposed to weed very young, regularly getting high by age 8, 9, 10. By 5th grade, I was smoking pot regularly and smoking cigarettes.  
Drinking was on/off throughout my youth, 20s, 30s, 40s, and now, 50s. I have quit for a couple or a few years at a time. I always go back.
I do the same with pot. I have tried to quit before - numerous times - but I always fail.
I cannot talk to anyone about this - not in my family, anyway, because they are all crazy and also substance abusers/drinkers. They'd more than likely try to convince me that its all fine....here, have a beer. So, they are no help. 
I have been in therapy. I found the last therapist I had to be very anxiety-raising withher own little goofy things. She ate during my session regularly, she had a weird tic where she would cough or clear her throat all the time, but often, while I was speaking. I always found myself way more agitated when I left, than when I arrived. I digress.

Not sure how to proceed. I cannot check into a rehab. I do not make 6 figures, and I am literally head of household and need to be working and taking care of the house. I have a cat and my 21 year old son lives with me. I am ashamed and embarrassed to even talk to him, or anyone else I love about it. I hide my drinking from my SO. We do not live together, and he once said, years avo that if I ever started drinking again, he would leave me.  I am pretty sure I stopped and bought a bottle of wine that same evening, after he said that. It was my reaction - to drink. Alone.  He has a very bad opinion of any and all alcohol, so, I cannot talk to him, either. 
My mom just died 1 month ago, and I am so fucking sad and lost. My daughter lives 3000 miles away, and my 26 year old oldest son hasn't spoken to me in over 3 years and that, too,  is my fault. Long story. All preventable. All stupid. All the time.
Today is a bad, sad day. I know I am going to drink. I know I am going to get high. Its been my release valve all my life and I know I have to stop.  I just know that it ain't easy and I have to be willing to go thru some painful times. Im not ready. Its easier to justify my bullshit to myself, while marinating in self pity. Underachiever.

And you know what? I went back in and bought the damn sweater. Because by the end of this week, when I‚Äôm on day 7, I‚Äôll have not spent any money on alcohol and I‚Äôll have put that money toward this cozy little thang coming my way. A start of sobriety gift to myself. 

Next week - I start to budget.

Later in my teenagehood alcohol and xanax would mute that never ending thought machine. After decades of abuse and self medication, I've realized that I just never had the ability to learn how to control that idiot box inside my mind. I've been taking melatonin nightly 3mcg. But even that doesn't seem like a good option, better to have my body produce it on its own. Couple of weeks ago I realized that I had a very strange sensation right as I would be falling asleep. Not even sure how I would describe it. It's like a slow and heavy feeling. And every time I would get it, I would get excited, thinking that I am finally falling asleep. Only to make the feeling go away. So the other night I decided to try to hum the tone of the feeling inside my mind. This will sound pretty stupid, but the stupidity is part of this process. Tried getting the frequency correct by thinking with ""baaaa"" and ""bwaaaa."" Eventually I realized that Mongolian throat singing was giving me the closest vibration. Even though it was all inside my brain. The weird part is that my brain would stop itself, because it sounded very stupid. But also as if I was running out of breath. So then I would keep forcing my brain to keep with the ""baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...."" add some modulation to give it that throat singing ambiance. I realized that I can sound as stupid and cringy as I want in my mind, and there's no one here with me. And then something magical happened, it's as if I was watching that idiot box do what I wanted it to do. And it was just me in my mind, slowly falling asleep.

I have never experienced detox that bad, and medical intervention was necessary. I called a few close friends, my sister, and my husband took me. Telling my 16 year old son why I would be gone for almost a week was the hardest thing I've ever done.

It was also the smartest thing I've ever done. After two days I knew had I tried to do it on my own it would have been dangerous disastrous and I probably would have failed.

I checked myself out after 5 days when physically I was okay. I immediately schedule an appointment with an addiction specialist therapist, and we clicked which is wonderful because I've never felt comfortable with a therapist before.

I've been drinking since I was 13 with the exception of two pregnancies, I am in my forties now. I need to figure out the why now that I'm through the physical detox. That's what the therapy is for. I'm also doing Zoom meetings, reading books, and of course checking in here even though I don't post much.

Overall, I feel this time has a much better chance for Success. The therapy is important, the community is important, I already have good support from family and friends. I'm just very grateful even though I got to a really bad place but it wasn't any worse. I know it certainly could have been much worse.

My whole family is supportive and understanding which I'm eternally grateful for. I am trying to live each day, one day at a time, and focus on catching up on everything I missed, while not going down the guilt rabbit hole, which is hard of course.

I guess I don't really have a point except to post it for accountability and offer a ray of hope to anyone as far gone as I was. I won't lie, detox was brutal even with all the medical intervention, but it was something I needed to do and I'm proud I took that step before someone or some incident had to make it for me.

I'm taking control of that whiny toddler in my head who keeps bugging me for a drink. I'm the grown up here, and I said no!

I just created this throwaway account to ask for advice. On my main account I have used this wonderful sub to help myself stop drinking. I  (34 f) successfully quit drinking in August and have never felt better. I need help with dealing with my husband (40 m). He has been a functional alcoholic for about 20 years. It's normal for him to have a six pack every evening, wake up and go for a jog, and then be successful in his job. He's also working on his third master's degree. From the outside no one knows the way that our lives revolve around drinking. We have two young children who have no idea how sick their dad is. 

 Since I've gotten sober (I used to drink 2-3 glasses of wine a night on a pretty regular basis) I've encouraged my husband to cut back with me. He has grown increasingly resentful of me to the point where he barely communicates with me anymore. The past three weeks have been hell. He's increased his drinking significantly and only interacts with our kids, won't even make eye contact with me. This past weekend I told him that I'm miserable and he needs to either accept help or move out. He ignored me and went to the store for more beer. On Sunday night he drank a 12 pack and slept until 10 am Monday morning. I told him that if he wouldn't commit to getting help or communicate with me I was taking our kids to my parents (a 6 hour car drive away) until we figured this out. He said ""fine"" and locked himself in his office. I packed us up and drove my kids to my parent's where we are now. Since then he has sent me texts cursing me out and telling me I stole his kids. I have sent numerous replies telling him that I just want him to get help and I will support him but he needs help. He refuses communicate with me and will not respond to anything I say or pick up the phone. I know that he is alive because he's still active on Twitter and his friends are checking in with them but he is refusing to talk to them, too. I'm completely lost on what to do now. I'm not comfortable going home until I know he's in the right frame of mind but he won't communicate with me.

Thought I would introduce myself here. I have thought about giving up alcohol for a couple of years now. I decided to give it up for Lent this year, although I‚Äôm not especially religious. I‚Äôm certainly spiritual, but I‚Äôve never practiced Lent before. I made that choice because I knew the people in my life would not fight me on the decision if it was wrapped up in a religious practice they honored.

The transformation was significant physically, spiritually, mentally, and beyond. For a long time I kept it to one night of drinking a week, and to this day I know I don‚Äôt necessarily have a problem because I can ‚Äúmanage it‚Äù as much as I manage sugar consumption, over eating, etc., but the reality is when social activities increase, so to the temptations. It‚Äôs not even that I drink because I want to, as I drink because that‚Äôs what you do in that situation do not make anyone else around me uncomfortable. So for me, this is less of an exercise of me versus alcohol and more an exercise in me honoring my boundaries and living in a way that ultimately allows me to serve in my highest good. Alcohol is simply one of a handful of vehicles that I can jump in to dishonor myself. So we are going to be intentional on not offering that vehicle as an option.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have totally used alcohol for numbing, and other less healthy things, but ultimately this is about my own inner knowing, my self respect, and what I want to accomplish in this world. I want to be at my best, and alcohol keeps me from being at my best, so if the social trigger is what derails me most frequently, I thought this group could balance that and cheer me on as I treat my body (and me) with the respect and love it deserves. And I can do the same for others because the reality is , it‚Äôs just not that easy.

So I raise my club soda and lime to everyone for remaining awake, remaining present, better sleep, clear skin, no bloat, reduced anxiety, and living as our highest selves!

I was a pretty normal drinker until I got sick a few years back. Really sick, and the diagnosis-treatment process lasted a long time. That was when the drinking started. I felt sick and hungover every morning due to my illness whether I drank or not, so why not enjoy a few hours of happiness? Also, the happiness itself was part of the problem. I‚Äôm a \*really\* happy drunk. Never mean, never violent, rarely even sad. I never ever got behind the wheel or a car or did anything else dangerous. I don‚Äôt text exes or go wild on social media. Pretty much just stay in my house and shower my dogs and my SO with affection and do nice things for them. Career is in good shape. Which is probably why it took me so long to realize I had a problem. 

Eventually found you guys, became a lurker, realized I definitely DID have a problem, read up on sober literature and made a really solid plan for quitting and stuck to it. (Happy to share what I did if anyone‚Äôs curious) I stayed quit for around 18 months and things were going well until the pandemic hit. 

Things were even fine for a little while in the pandemic. I am an introvert by nature so for a while I was really loving the whole work from home and don‚Äôt see people. I felt less stress than ever before. I was working really hard on yoga. Reading books. Catching up on all my TV. I felt okay. 

But now we‚Äôre 9 or so months into the pandemic and it‚Äôs not slowing down and I‚Äôm coming apart at the seams. I‚Äôve read so many millions of books. I feel like I‚Äôve watched all the TV and movies there ARE in the world. I‚Äôve done crossword puzzles, I‚Äôve exercised, I‚Äôve explored every hiking trail in a tri-state area. I‚Äôve cleaned and reorganized every single corner of my house. There is nothing to do, nothing to look forward to, nowhere to go. I AM SO BORED. 

It doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm so sick of my SO. He is always in the house, always. So I never have any alone time, which is crucial to me. I know it‚Äôs not his fault, it‚Äôs not like he has anywhere to go, but it‚Äôs driving me up a wall. We have run out of things to say to each other. It just can‚Äôt be good for a relationship for both people to be stuck in a house with each other 24/7 for months with hardly any outside contact. 

So as you‚Äôve probably guessed...I started drinking again. Honestly I think the intense and unrelenting boredom is what did it. I guess you would call it a bender. I started drinking last Friday night and although I didn‚Äôt drink during the daytimes, I drank Saturday night and Sunday night too. I got pretty drunk. I drank some bourbon, which I also never did before, always stuck to beer or cider or wine. I got maybe drunker than I‚Äôve ever been before. I didn‚Äôt black out but there are portions of my night where I don‚Äôt remember things very clearly.  I was too sick to go to work when I woke up on Monday. That has never happened to me before. I‚Äôm sober now, finally, but I‚Äôm terrified and ashamed of what I‚Äôve done and what I can see myself becoming. How do I make this stop? What do I do? I know that was long but I think I needed to type it out. Thanks for listening.",22,{'pandemic': 3},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5593472719192505}"

It‚Äôs been a tough year for me and drinking has only made it worse. Got diagnosed with gout at 28 years old and that was the worst pain I‚Äôve felt ever. 

Been on antidepressants and when I first started it was amazing to feel content, relaxed and energetic. Fast forward being on them for a year and I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm back to feeling anxious, depressed, and lethargic. 

My drinking has gotten so bad. I used to only drink occasionally, maybe on a Friday or Saturday night. Now anytime I‚Äôm on my day off I‚Äôm downing a 12 or 18 by myself. When I get home from work I may have 4-5 beers. 

I‚Äôm going to make this change. I need to be kind to myself and take better care of my body. I don‚Äôt want to be crippled by diseases that I could have prevented by just taking better care of myself and not drinking. 

Wish me luck on this journey. I‚Äôve tried before and I keep falling back into habit. It‚Äôs been so easy to say, well one drink won‚Äôt be bad and next thing I know I‚Äôm 5 deep and I‚Äôm ready to have another 5.",7,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.7248636484146118}"

It had been about 3 years of near daily binge drinking that I hid from everybody. I was putting away 2-3 handles of cheap vodka per week easily. My mental health was in shambles, my physical health not far behind. I finally came clean to my very loving and supportive boyfriend about what had been really going on, and together we vowed to make some serious lifestyle changes. 

I've had a few slips since that day, but overall I've been off the sauce. We've been making an effort to eat healthier and exercise. Spending time together trying new recipes and working out has actually been really fun. Things are definitely looking up for the most part, with the exception of some lingering health concerns as a result of my drinking. How fitting that today, 2 full months since I came clean and vowed to change, I'll be visiting my doctor to give her the run down, get some testing, and figure out next steps so that I can hopefully recover. It's absolutely scary as hell, but waiting and not knowing if my organs are about to give out on me at any given moment has been worse. 

Finally, I feel like I'm making some damn progress!! So glad I didn't cave yesterday like I so badly wanted to. Best wishes to you all ‚ù§Ô∏è

She moved away, but we've kept in touch, somewhat sporadically, and I was worrying that our friendship may have run its course.  Recently, we reconnected to chat, and I found myself sharing not only that I had stopped drinking, but why.  It's an intensely personal story that I haven't told anyone--not a falling down, DUI, slobbery, pissy kind of end, but a moment in time that presented a fork in the road, and I moved into the sober lane.  Almost 8 months ago, I finally did something I've been needing to do for a long time.

The thing with our friendship--alcohol framed it.  We weren't friends because of alcohol, but we were friends WITH alcohol.  Wine with lunch, specialty happy hour drinks, trips in first class with cocktails in hand, wine tastings, wine trips, you name it, we drank around it.  What she didn't know was after boozy lunches, I kept right on drinking.  After dinners with several bottles of wine for the couples gathering, I would go home and drink some more.  It was getting out of control.  I don't know her real situation with alcohol because she didn't know mine--I suspect it's similar but it's none of my business.

I'm proud that I told her.  Her reaction was interesting--gratitude that I shared, but not much more to discuss.  Which is okay.  I'm in a wonderful new place and I'm not going back.  I hope friendships survive the change in me, and some won't, I'm sure.  

It's one more step forward.  I just breathed in, and then exhaled.

I first drank at 15 and I would always drink to get drunk. I have pretty much drank my way through life with the exception of pregnancy. I've lost count of the sick days I pulled in my younger more bingy years, after rolling to bed at 2am and spending the morning vomiting and telling myself I would never drink again. Maan, how may times I told myself that... It hit me last week when my husband commented on 2 separate occasions that he can have one or two drinks, unlike me. He likes a drink, maybe more than me, but I don't think he has as much as a problem because he can stop after one or two, and I can't. I feel excited to become a better version of myself, but I'm also scared because I don't know who I am without alcohol.

The inciting incident was a DUI that could have ended up a heck of a lot worse than it did. I've still got all the legal stuff to deal with but I have to say that I'm feeling pretty grateful for the kick in the ass to get my mind right, and determined to keep it that way.

I've spent the last month or so full-send committed to just not drinking, and haven't sweated trying to decide whether my other coping mechanisms are the right ones. I tended to smoke a bit every night with drinks (maybe a quarter pack a day or so) but it wasn't quite back into full addiction mode, and I've managed to only smoke 2 or 3 this month. Other than that I've been in full indulgence mode: computer games and TV into the wee hours, huge bowls of ice cream and sweets, porn, compulsively switching between several different news apps, compulsively checking the stock market.

Now that I'm feeling solidly past the 'detox' mark, and my mood is stabilizing, I'm looking to find some healthier escapist habits, especially given that COVID restrictions are ramping up hard here. Anyone have any 'forget about the world' type hobbies/outlets to recommend that I might not have thought of? Lay it on me.

Thanks for being out there as a touch point that's always available!

I drank for 45 years and the last 2 years it was all day, every day on my own.  I was isolated, in despair and very sick. 

I did not want to stop drinking and I didn't believe I could. My doctor confirmed that if I kept going I would die. My immune system broke down completely. 

The pain got so bad, in absolute desperation I took up my drug and alcohol  counsellor's advice and got into detox. Then naltrexone and AA and NA nearly every day. Over Xmas I did 90 meetings in 60 days. 

Gradually my health recovered and the cravings eased. I started to learn how to live sober.

My life is infinitely better now. In fact it is the best it has ever been. I am reconnected to family  and old friends. I have new sober friends. Most important I have peace. 

All of these things are priceless gifts. I had no idea that this life existed or was possible.

I am so grateful to every single person who has helped me along the way. I could not do it on my own.

My standard for having a good day is SO MUCH HIGHER. I have a mood tracker app (Daylio) and today while I was trying to decide if it was a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù or ‚Äúgood‚Äù day, I compared my day today to one while drinking.

.

*A ‚Äúgood‚Äù day in Lemur‚Äôs drinking life:*

Force myself out of bed around 2PM with a hangover that actually isn‚Äôt too bad today! I mean, my head hurts a lot and I‚Äôm a little nauseous, but I can pop a few ibuprofen and get through it. Hop in the shower because that might make me feel a little better, then make a super cold smoothie to help with whatever hangover effects are left. Put on some music and try to find some clean clothes to wear to work. 	
Damn, I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt really sweat because none of my work shirts are clean. That‚Äôs okay. This one‚Äôs fine. Shit, where are my keys? FUCK, my wallet better be in my bag. Okay, it‚Äôs there. Now where the fuck are my keys?! Okay. Retrace your steps. ‚Ä¶HA. I don‚Äôt even remember how I got home last night. 
Search around my apartment some more, find my keys. Phew. Okay. I‚Äôm going to be 20 minutes late to work, but I‚Äôll just call and tell them I‚Äôm running 10 minutes late so it sounds better. It‚Äôs fine, they‚Äôre used to it. Hop in my car and head to the bar I work at.
Open the bar, listen to regulars talk about things I don‚Äôt care about‚Ä¶ Holy shit I hate opening. I actually have to talk to people.  Why am I even a bartender? I hate the glamorization of alcohol. Stop trying to act like a gin connoisseur, you‚Äôre not fooling me. 
Finally, 8 o clock. I‚Äôm relieved from my post and my favorite coworker and I head to the same bar we always do to ‚Äúplay pool.‚Äù She probably actually likes pool. I just pretend to like it so it seems like I have more hobbies than just getting drunk. We play some pool and talk some shit and take some shots. I get pretty drunk but I call it tipsy because if I still remember the night I wasn‚Äôt really drunk, then I run into this guy I used to talk to. Damn, he‚Äôs cute. Why did we stop fucking? Talking to him becomes my primary focus and the rest of the night at the bar is a blur. I go home with him and we stay up until the crack of dawn doing lines off a plate on his bed and watching an old season of Game of Thrones. We finally fuck, but I‚Äôm so drunk and coked out that I can barely feel anything. I act out the part until he finishes and we go to sleep. 
The next day, I wake up with a throbbing headache and terrible nausea. I leave as quickly as possible so that I don‚Äôt puke in this guy‚Äôs toilet. Fuck, I‚Äôm running late for work because it‚Äôs already somehow 4PM. I better hurry. I can‚Äôt wait to tell my coworker the details of how my night went.
It was a good day.

.

*A good day in Lemur‚Äôs sober life:*

Wake up to my alarm at 7 AM. Okay, I don‚Äôt have to be anywhere for a while and my room is freezing so I turn on my heater and hit snooze for an hour. I lazily roll out of bed at 8 and go make coffee and breakfast. I chitchat with my roommate and then head to my room to get some studying done. I change into my scrubs and think about how lovely it is to be able to be so respected in what are basically fancy pajamas.
I get to school around noon, feeling prepared but nervous. I‚Äôm cracking jokes with the other students and having a hard time taking life seriously even though we have a practical today. Before, during, and after the practical the air is filled with laughter. I leave in good spirits. 
On the way home, I see on insta that a few friends are getting drunk poolside just a few blocks away‚Ä¶ I could stop and hang out with them. I don‚Äôt have my swimsuit, but I could stop and buy a suit and then go. The sun will be setting in a few hours but today is one of the last days it‚Äôll be warm enough to swim!
I stop myself. It‚Äôs not about the swimming, and it‚Äôs not about the friends. This is my drunk brain trying to sabotage my perfectly happy day. I keep driving until I get home.
I practice speaking Spanish for a while, stretch, open my patio doors and pet my cat. I go for a long walk with my roommate, and we talk about space exploration and our lives and the shitty internet at our place and motivation and the holidays. Drinking doesn‚Äôt come up, romance doesn‚Äôt come up, drama doesn‚Äôt come up.
We get home and she cooks an amazing meal full of colorful vegetables. I read a book and drink cinnamon tea while she cooks. After dinner, I make more tea and retire to my room to take a mental break by watching a dumb Hallmark movie and staying up a little too late.
Today was a good day.

I hadn‚Äôt had a drink in a while, things were good. Then I went to a new city and started talking to a woman. I wanted to move past my awkward history with alcohol and for her to think i was normal, so we shared a bottle of wine over dinner. Then I started drinking her whiskey (even though I don‚Äôt like whiskey) just to keep the party going and from what I understand, made something of an ass of myself. 

I guess we had a pretty good time but I started to have flashbacks; I was raped in a similar situation about 10 months ago. So I decided I‚Äôd rather drive home than sleep over. It was 4am and yes I was still drunk but somehow made it home safely.

The next time we hung out I was a bit more tense as I typically used alcohol as a social lubricator, but given that it was a weekday we decided against it. She noticed and kept making comments about how stressed out I seemed which only exacerbated the problem. She tried to diffuse the situation by flirting and kissing but I just couldn‚Äôt relax and just kept saying things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better at this when I‚Äôm tipsy.‚Äù 

The final nail in the coffin came when the next night, I brought over a 4-pack of cider to go with dinner. She said she wasn‚Äôt drinking bc it was again, a weekday, so feeling dumb, I drank them all myself. She was uncomfortable with my sober anxiety the night before, so I figured this would help. Boy, was I wrong. The fact that I was the only one drinking seemed to make things worse. Not only that, but I was so worried about seeming too drunk that I didn‚Äôt even touch her! Which was half the problem the previous night! It somehow ended up being so much more awkward than the stone sober night. 

I left immediately after the movie which was fine with her despite the relatively early hour. I walked out knowing that she wouldn‚Äôt text me the next morning (we had been texting everyday for two weeks) and lo and behold, this morning I wake up to nothing. Nothing all day. That‚Äôs it. 

I‚Äôm not saying this girl was my soulmate or anything but we were getting along well and wanted to at least be friends. I‚Äôm dumb and made some shitty mistakes. I‚Äôm hopeless with women without it but completely stupid with it. I realize my problems are psychological and alcohol is a crutch but damn I just wanted her to think I was normal and ended up doing the most abnormal shit out there. I went from wasted to sober to drinking alone in a span of 3 dates. So here‚Äôs to another try lads, let‚Äôs set the clock back to day one and not lie about my issues to the next woman!

Good morning SD,

&#x200B;

I rang all the warning bells today... Hungry, Angry, Lonely and Tired. HALT!!!!!

It didn't feel out of control, but due to my extended stay in Soberville, I can actually identify these feelings/conditions AND take actions to remedy the issue.

I was hungry, so I made some food... this is day three of making a pizza at home and eating it all, saving a piece of crust for my dog to enjoy, of course! Ripped it apart while watching some comedy videos, to treat the anger, as laughter is a very effective tool for me to drop the pissed off attitude, and I started to come around the bend. I refilled the water in my kettle and in my bedside cup, then went back to the cozy comfort of bed. 

A generous helping of laying in bed happened, to treat the tiredness, and though I did put the underquilt on the hammock outside, I opted to keep my outdoor activities to letting my dog out, and talking to myself like a loon while smoking cigarettes in my shed, to help with the residual anger that the pizza/video combo didn't seem to fully quench. There was an afternoon coffee, as well, which was delightful, however... my brain really loves a shot of (insert caffeine or nicotine), this much I am sure. 

I'm starting to tire of feeling like a puppet on an addiction string, but I am not doing anything quite yet to rock the boat so hard that I might go towards the booze. I was considering attempting a quit on Thursday, but I'm feeling weak, and Thursday is still off there in the future... It pains me to admit that, and I wish I was stronger now, but I'll keep hanging in here... this isn't a sprint, it's a marathon.

The loneliness was addressed with many check-ins, lurker style, to here at SD, and through a few one on one chats with friends. I would be going to get a pint of ice cream right now, but have eaten so many pints of ice cream in the past few months, I might be at least 75% milkfat and 20% pure cane sugar... anyone else have their sugar cravings turn to salty cravings? I swear I would go and lick a salt lick if I found one right now... well, maybe not, it's deer season here, haha.

Below is the post. Also, IWNDWYT & did not drink today üí™üèΩ



Leaving my mother... for good.

The last two weeks have been the pinnacle of the crazy train I‚Äôve ridden for the last 12 years. For context, I‚Äôm 25 (m), from a single parent home (dads an alcoholic too). Mom got tired of raising us &amp;amp; after the 2008 economic crisis and her continued unemployment  - she turned to the bottle &amp;amp; maybe other things. 

She went to visit my aunt who lives down south and after drinking on medication had a literal mental break - drinking uncontrollably (while on medication) &amp;amp; as a result lost all control of her bodily functions. The family decided it was too much to deal with and had her involuntarily committed to an institution in the south. I wasn‚Äôt there, I‚Äôm at a university up north doing my masters.

After her 3rd day, I was able to speak to her and she began to cry about the facility, conditions, and her situation. I felt bad, but couldn‚Äôt do a thing because the state had her under watch. I called a friend of hers who stood in as her lawyer and spoke to her case manager about her condition and the factors of her release. I was torn between being a good son, and aiding her addiction. 

Because she was deemed mentally stable she was released today. The facility mentioned that she shouldn‚Äôt go back to my aunts house and instead somewhere where she would be safe. 

She has no friends or family who would be willing to house her because she‚Äôs cut all emotional ties with everyone. She booked a flight back to NY and has returned to our family home in Brooklyn. I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôs going to return to the bottle. If she returns to the ways that nearly killed her, I am nearly ready to wipe my hands with my mother. As hard as it may seem, the simple worry I dealt with here at university nearly made me miss too much that I might have had to drop out - something I dealt with during undergrad as well. Thank God for understanding professors. 

All I can do is pray, but I‚Äôm reaching out because I‚Äôm worried that if she feels alone she‚Äôll return to whence she came &amp;amp; if I try to be there again, I‚Äôm not strong enough to be there mentally nor do I have the time personally.

But I‚Äôve felt solid the entire time. I haven‚Äôt wanted to drink at all. Even when sobriety doesn‚Äôt seem like the best thing ever, I know it‚Äôs my best option.

But this Thursday I‚Äôm supposed to visit my long distance girlfriend (I‚Äôm 25f, she‚Äôs 32f) and stay with her through thanksgiving. It‚Äôll be a big test because I‚Äôll be sober through our anniversary, her celebration for a career success, and thanksgiving, plus there is always alcohol in the house because she drinks daily. I‚Äôve told her I absolutely do not want to drink on this trip, and she is supportive of that, but I just don‚Äôt love  the idea of being around it and watching her drink every night. She doesn‚Äôt get super drunk, just winds down with 2-3 beers, but still. 

Through all of this, I‚Äôll be working on seminar papers and exams remotely. It just sucks. Part of me wants to protect my sobriety by staying home, but it wouldn‚Äôt be fair since we haven‚Äôt seen each other much lately and I want to celebrate with her. I have NO intention of breaking my sobriety and I‚Äôm pretty positive I won‚Äôt - I just think I‚Äôm going to feel more discouraged and deprived than I have for the first two weeks. I live alone, so it‚Äôs been easy so far to control my environment.

Anyone been in a similar situation in early sobriety? I just feel so sensitive right now, like I just want to sit in my bedroom wrapped in bubble wrap until I‚Äôm two months sober.

I'm going to make it guys!!  And I'm dang proud of it!  Double digits!!!

The next milestone is just a few days away at two full weeks.  That is going to be incredible.  I've been picking up a lot of good little habits on the way but one of my favorites is breathing exercises. 

I hope you don't mind I share this experience with you!!

I guess it is meditation because you can really get your mind clear of everything.  It doesn't work all the time but it's getting easier and easier to get there.  I can still hear things around me.  Distracting me from clearing my head, but for the most part I can center myself very quickly when something distracts me.  It's so weird, I can almost see my mind thinking or at least trying to think.  And it will take the noises of the morning while I sit on my bed and try to be ""quiet"".  The noises of the cars passing, the birds chirping, the AC humming, the little wobble that the ceiling fan makes.  And my mind will want to expand on it, try to almost visualize the mechanics of it.  Then the inner voice will start talking, ""I wonder why that fan is making that noise.""  

But I can shut it down and reset my mind before it gets worse and goes on to ""I wonder if I can fix that.""  ""Maybe I should see if there is dust build up on it"" ""Maybe that's what's doing it""  ""What time is it?""  All the while that pesky song is trying to turn up the volume and be front and center in your mind.

I center my mind by imagining a white blank surface.  Sometimes the surface is textured like a very fine sand paper and I'll change it smooth with my imagination.  I don't wonder what it feels like, I'm focusing on what it looks like.  Or sometimes very still water.  Not like you're looking at the water from a distance, but up close.  I can't see through the water because it's reflecting an endless white wall.  And I make the water move in the slightest smoothest variations.

My muscles will relax, my shoulders will fall and my head will slightly tilt forward.  With my eyes closed.  And when I exhale, I will hold my emptied lungs for a second and I will feel an every so slight tingle in my mind.  Almost feels euphoric.  And my breathing slows even more.

And then, just for a moment.....there is nothing.

The sound of my breathing begins to fade.  There is no tension in my muscles.  The music is gone. The sounds of the cars and birds fade to almost complete silence.  Just the sound of my breathing, but my breathing begins to quiet as well, as it slows.  There is nothing.  Just calm.

Then I open my eyes and there is a tiny moment of disorientation.  It's like waking up from sleeping, except your not all groggy and stiff. 

I practice this every morning.  And I think it's helping me.

I will not drink with you today and I'm proud that I finally get to say I'm in the double digits tomorrow!!

First I would like to thank everybody who is a part of this community. I have spent so much time here the last week and this community continues to inspire me, provide hope, and give me all sorts of practical advice.

This week has been filled with lots of ups and downs, which I will attempt to summarize.  I apologize if this is a bit all over the place.

I am already feeling much better physically then I had been.  It was so nice to wake up early on Monday morning feeling reasonably energized and get a good jump on the day.

Wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm eating that much better than before, but my appetite for healthier foods is increasing.  I had two bananas yesterday!

Focused on trying to go for more walks throughout the day and that has been beneficial.  Trying to get more meditation in but finding that a bit harder.  Next will be trying to get in my old exercise regime, which I fell out of the past few months.

I‚Äôm finding the hardest thing to manage to dealing with the emotional fallout.  My days seem to be about 50-50 between feeling pretty good and just trying to keep it together.  Sunday was a hard day and I ended up going back to bed after making breakfast.

My partner has been pretty supportive so far, although I know she has a lot to process right now too (she was not aware of my drinking problem before).  It‚Äôs going to be a long road to rebuild the trust, but it‚Äôs a relief that she has stuck with me so far.

I went to my first (virtual) SMART Recovery meeting last night.  Had some anxiety leading up to it but found it to be a good and positive experience.  Look forward to attending again next week.

Had an appointment with my psychologist this morning too, which was also good in terms of both talking about my issues and getting good recommendations for a course of action forward.

Work related stress was a big issue for me the past while, and it continues to be, it‚Äôs been nice to remind myself that I am more equipped to handle the stresses when I have a clear head.  I am really happy with how productive I have been the last few days of work.

My partner and I had planned a few days away (before I was sober) and we leave later today and return on Sunday.  It will be nice to get away and relax a bit.

My wife hit me up about a Friendsgiving thing next week that she wants to go to, but is also clearly aware that my going with her is really dependent on my mindset on that particular day. She‚Äôs cool with that. Also note, these are close friends that we vacation with and obviously drink with.

It led to this exchange on text today after I told her my participation would be a game day decision:

Her: I‚Äôm sorry, babe. I still think a support group would be helpful for you. I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre feeling all alone in a world of drinkers surrounding you. 

Me: Yep.

Her: Well, I‚Äôm super proud of you. I‚Äôm not going to quit drinking but if there‚Äôs any way I can help support you please let me know. And I really mean that. 

Me: üëç

Her: I‚Äôm also happy to go talk to someone together if you think that would be helpful. This is difficult for me too BC I don‚Äôt have my drinking buddy & I feel bad drinking in front of you or going to social gatherings without you. üòî And I‚Äôm not telling you that because I want you to drink. Just expressing how I‚Äôm feeling also. 

Me: I know and that‚Äôs fair and it‚Äôs part of what sucks and makes all of this even harder.

OK, so that‚Äôs a pretty supportive and honest text chain from her. And yet for some reason, it makes me feel even more isolated, alone, and unsupported. I‚Äôm not even sure why. 

I‚Äôm just riding this roller coaster right now, alternating between bliss and regret and anger and sadness. And my one word / emoticon answers were very atypical of me as I‚Äôm typically the communicator of the two of us. But I just didn‚Äôt have a response because I don‚Äôt know HOW to respond. And now she‚Äôs home and we‚Äôve barely spoken mostly because I‚Äùm just floating here on my little island. Not in a bad mood. Not in a good mood. Not happy. Not angry. Right now I‚Äôm just here, looking ahead to a holiday where I see a lot more of this melancholy funk on the horizon and a partner who misses the fun side of me (until it wasn‚Äôt). 

BTW, this isn‚Äôt making me want to drink. It just is what it is. 

So I guess there isn‚Äôt a question here and more just a need to share with a group of folks that might understand. So thanks for being here, as always.

I'm a 20 year old female and I guess for a couple years I've been mildly concerned about my alcohol consumption. I usually only drink 2x/week where I get decently drunk, but not overly-so. In the past and especially during a rough period of my life, I have repeatedly gotten drunk past the point of normal-functioning, which I do understand was a problem. Nowadays, when I drink, it is never past the point that I cannot function ‚Äî in fact, I am the one taking care of others. 

However, alcoholism runs in the family. My dad is a functional alcoholic whose drinking does not affect his work but rather our family life. I swore I would never be like him, but as I've been living alone the past month, I have been drinking \~4x/week. It does not interfere with my social nor academic life (I have a strong social circle and perform well academically), but I know that I kinda exploit alcohol because I'm unhappy with my life (undiagnosed depression) in a way that I assume is similar to my father. I look forward to the weekend so I can drink and now that I'm living alone, I don't even wait until the weekend (as long as my assignments are completed). 

I was hospitalized for excessive drinking (to the point of passing out) two years ago and received an MIP one year ago. The lawyer who I consulted (for precaution) insinuated that I could be an alcoholic, which really upset me at the time, making me wonder if I am, in fact, an alcoholic. All my friends insist that I'm not, but I look at my previous actions and really start to wonder.

I enjoy drinking and would ideally not like to completely cut it out of my life, but wonder if I should cut down. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8675552010536194}"

Every ""sober bender"" I have makes me feel like I'm closer and closer to not drinking. The first few times I tried to stop, I just convinced myself I didn't really have a problem and who cares if I have a few beers after work every day and at least a dozen over the weekend? I ignored the fact that I couldn't stop then. 

At the beginning of this year, my husband showed me a photo of me passed out on the couch with my mouth hanging open. I don't know why, but that was the turning point. I was fine forgetting conversations we had the past night. I felt bad that I would initiate sex and then fall asleep after a few minutes, but it was better than not initiating (since my libido has dropped from drinking), right? But to look your own demon in the face was wild. My husband, this generous amazing soul, has had to live with a goblin for two years. 

A goblin who acts crazy by the time he gets home from work. A goblin who eats all the food and then accuses him of finishing off the leftovers. A goblin who doesn't remember what happened the night before, but is apologetic in the morning, or worse, pretends they remember to make themselves look better.

All of this is to say I've been getting closer and closer every time I start my sobriety journey this year. I started seeing a therapist, I picked up This Naked Mind book, and this week I've started listening to podcasts so I can feel like I'm part of a sober community. I feel really good today. But also so weak.

I haven't had a drink in very close to 18 months. My decision to stop drinking was partially driven by reading this sub. I wanted to report out on some of the positive developments in my life since then.

* Lost 70ish pounds
* Started running a lot. Started out with the goal of just losing weight but have gotten really into it and progressed in a ton during that same 17 month period. For reference I started out on day 1 when I stopped drinking and barely covered 3 miles in 30 minutes. I am going out to run a 5k next Saturday with a goal of 15:30 seconds.
* I had a second child. I can't imagine trying to balance a toddler and an infant while drunk and hungover. I feel like I am a better father although I would like to think my drinking never got in the way of my parenting given it was typically an after-hours affair.
* Sleep and general life satisfaction is much better.
* Any issues with my marriage have largely cleared up. Wife and I are on MUCH more stable footing.
* Switched jobs and am generally much happier and motivated at work.

In short, my life is so much better than it was 17 months ago. I feel healthier, happier and more optimistic about the future. None of this would have been possible drinking to the extent I was drinking previously. Alcohol really is an evil substance.

First post here but I've been following for a year or so as I've been trying to quit for a while now. I'm currently on day 12 and seeing as I live in the middle of nowhere thousands of miles away from friends and family‚Äîand haven't seen friends from work since March bc of the pandemic‚ÄîI felt the need to vent some of what I'm feeling.

I had an epiphany the Friday before last. Usually I'm not someone who puts much emphasis on my birthday, but something felt... different this time. It hit me that I've been out of college over a year now and working full time since 2019 like a full ass adult. I guess I just realized that I *am* a full ass adult now. When I had this realization my desire to drink became nonexistent, and I haven't really thought about drinking since that last half bottle of wine 12 days ago.

I've been blown away by how good and simultaneously awful I feel. Strangely, I'm full of energy at night and feel incredibly anxious and foggy in the morning/afternoons. I had ""only"" really been drinking in excess for 2 1/2 years, so I figured after a few days or maybe a week tops I'd be good. Nope. I guess I was doing way more damage to myself than I thought.

I had never even tasted a drop of alcohol my first two years of college, it just didn't interest me. Things changed when I got into a relationship with an alcoholic right before I turned 21; that lasted for two years, most of which I don't remember because I essentially became his drinking buddy. Throughout that time I lost my peace of mind; I lost the intelligence and sharpness of mind that got me to where I am today; I lost friends; I lost the body I worked hard for; I made a fool of myself I don't know how many times by blacking out and being the messy one at the gathering or party. More than anything I completely forgot who I was and what I cared about before I started drinking‚Äîthat was probably the scariest thing.

I've been tapering off alcohol slowly over the past year, going from about a bottle of wine a night to a half bottle. I tried to convince myself that was reasonable, but now I realize that was just denial. Tomorrow will be day 13, and I'll be turning 24. Things will be normal: I'll work from home, I'll work on my hobbies, and I'll make myself a nice, healthy dinner all to myself. But this year I won't be drinking. An overwhelming feeling of grief's come over me in the past couple of days, because I can't believe I treated myself like garbage for nearly three whole years. And I can't even remember half of it.

My brain's struggling to pump out happy chemicals at the moment, but I'm trusting that this too will pass. Even if it's a sad birthday from an observer's perspective, I think I've decided to give myself the best gift I could have given myself this year.

I want to make it clear that I am sober. I haven't had a drink in about 4 months. Not a sip. my mind feels clearer and I'm glad to be rid of the hangovers. 

I've been feeling better, but not much. I've been extremely anxious and depressed, not drinking related, just everything else. I also have ADD and have been prescribed ritilan for years. I'm not sure if it really helps with anything. I could never focus at work and I'd end every day hating myself for getting nothing done. 

About 2 weeks ago I started snorting my ritalin. Which I have never done before. Then I started taking more than I was supposed to. Sometimes 2 or 3 times as much. The horrible thing is that it has been effective in helpiy me get work done. I have been much more productive.

But I feel horrible. This feels very similar to drinking. But it is something I was prescribed. But I am using it improperly. 
What do you all think? Is this just me exercising the same dangerous muscle? Should I talk to my doctor? Should I reset my counter?

Most everybody recommended that I seek medical care sooner than the physical I already had scheduled with my doctor in December. After another week of hemming and hawing, this morning I finally took some scary first steps and got in touch with my medical center. I'm now scheduled to see my doctor tomorrow morning to give her the full rundown of what's been happening and assess the damages. 

I have to admit, I'm absolutely fucking terrified. I have been for a long time, which is why I've been putting this visit off for as long as possible. But not knowing whether or not I have some life threatening ailment is eating me alive, I just can't do it anymore. I know I'm only 22 and 3 years is rookie stuff around here, but having an anxiety disorder on top of some worrying symptoms has not been fun at all. All I know is that I fucked up and I just really don't want to die, which is something I wasn't actually aware of until all of this came to a head. Part of me is also kind of excited though. No matter what my tests come back like, there will be at least some relief in knowing one way or the other. The agonizing wait I've been putting myself through will be over once I get my results, and I'll be able to determine next steps from there.

I learned how to make a perfect macaron. I went to school and obtained a license to begin a new professional career. I lost over 20 pounds. I bought a house. I learned how to use a sewing machine. I confronted years of childhood sexual abuse instead of running away to the bottom of a bottle. I taught my dog a new trick every month and took him for a walk almost every day.

After years of struggling with alcoholism and wanting more than anything to put an end to the episodes of embarrassing myself in public, alienating the people i love, enduring truly hellish hangovers, i no longer have any interest in alcohol. Something has shifted in my brain that doesn't even entertain it as an option, knowing that i do not have the condition where i can drink in a healthy way and any alcohol is detrimental to my life. 

the hardest part for me is accepting that sobriety isn't a fix-all to the other issues in my life. I'm still mentally ill, and struggling with the lifelong severe anxiety and agoraphobia that i would usually use as an excuse to get a buzz on whenever possible. The past two months have been rocky as I've dealt with the chronic emptiness left by booze and the fear i've dealt with forever, that unmistakable terror of acute anxiety that makes participating in daily life feel impossible. But i have a wonderful set of friends and family that support me & a partner who has been nothing short of remarkable throughout this journey.

The biggest thing is seeing how proud everyone is of me. Everyone who loves me was so worried for so long that i was going to end up dead from the way i drank and the things i did when i was drunk, particularly the suicide and self-harm that would come when i was near-blackout and at the end of my rope. I don't know how I'm going to deal with the anxiety now that i don't have alcohol to cope but i know it isn't the antidote to my fear, it's the poison that keeps the fear fuelled and burning.

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about this milestone and what it means. Especially around the holidays. This Thanksgiving I won‚Äôt be paranoid that the bottles in my bag might clink and give me away. This year I don‚Äôt have to worry about sneaking away to my childhood bedroom to chug more booze throughout the day. I am looking forward to being fully present and not drunk or hungover, the only two states I ever was in the past. 

A lot has changed in the last 6 months. I never realized how much energy I expended on alcohol. Trying not to drink, planning my next drink, tying to hide it, trying to get more, trying to seem like a normal drinker, trying (and failing) not to drive after drinking, trying not to worry about the damage I‚Äôm doing to my body. My brain is so much clearer in a multitude of ways. I no longer have the fog of alcohol or a hangover but I also no longer have this oppression of the constant worry about my next drink. 

In the last six months I‚Äôve lost weight, I haven‚Äôt thrown up once, I‚Äôve rebuilt my friendships and family relationships, and I‚Äôve discovered I can do all the things I used to do sober, and they‚Äôre just as fun. Sometimes it was scary. Everything I did involved drinking. I didn‚Äôt know how to hang out with friends sober. I didn‚Äôt know how to watch a movie sober. But I tried and realized it could be done and sobriety and clearheadedness made things so much better. 

The main thing that changed is I realized I couldn‚Äôt do this alone. I needed help to get sober. My friends, my family, all of you, have kept me sober for 6 months. It was maybe the hardest lesson I had to learn, that it wasn‚Äôt weakness asking for help but strength.

I'm 3 weeks into my adventure of drinking, not drinking, etc. In April 2020, I was doing 18 2oz shots a day + a couple beers (I mean exactly 2, just as a sipping chaser). I was in bad shape, I could not go a day without waking up next morning and within 6-12 hours I'd get sick, shaky etc. I'd have to pound a beer at 5pm to 'level out' and carry my until I could hit up the rest later in the evening. 

Well, that stopped as about a couple months ago, I weened off and no longer get sick. 1st week, that was rough - but I went 5 days, then the weekend hit and I had more drinks. The next week, I had 3 sober days, Mon Wed and Thur (2 in a row!). Then friday hit and I had drinks fri sat sun. Then I went dry again and that was yesterday.....planning on rest of the week. 

The point I'm making here is I have found that if you \*START\* throwing in sober days, I find myself thinking about it more and more and it's become easier to do so. I've also noticed that sleep sucks first night and gets a little easier each night which is motivation to not drink. I'm not perfect, but I'm seeing progress. I'm starting to see sober days like I did drinking - I can't wait to do it. That is.....weird to me. 

Anyway, if you're reading this and maybe relate hey cool. I had quite the battle with this crap, and getting to this point is good for me. I'm going to continue with it this week.

This morning as I was driving into work I was thinking to myself how grateful I am that I am feeling better.

I was irritable and moody, check. I was even worried that people thought I was drinking, hell a few mornings when I woke up I thought I had been drinking. That is a whole other weird feeling.

The first month was the hardest. There were days when I thought I was going to lose my mind. But, as it turned out, sobriety was another habit-forming thing, too. After a while, it became a habit to not drink as it was a habit to drink.

I'm not going to lie by saying that every day got progressively easier after the first month. There have been ups and downs, and I imagine that that will be a recurring thing. On some days, though it didn't get nearly as bad as it did get during the first month, I did find myself wishing that I could have \*just one\* drink.

One aspect of drinking that was kind of a relief was that it helped me come out of my shell and not be so quiet in social situations. Knowing that person is inside me somewhere baffles me as to why it takes a poison being injected into my body to bring him out. The funny thing about this person is that people like _the talkative and joking person_ that is drunk me. I need to figure out how to tap into that part of my personality that is hiding deep inside _while not drinking_ and make that the _normal_ me. If I can make this happen I think the anxiety around social situations would decrease and the desire to drink in order to _loosen up_ would be gone (or at least less). I know I can't handle being a casual drinker so... unlocking that potential _while sober_ is the way.

And then there were these unbelievable superhuman godlike sobernaughts that made it a year and more ... I myself had reset the counter, in shame, a number of times and could never understand how being sober that long was possible. 

&#x200B;

But even so... You inspired me. All of you. 

&#x200B;

The first days were sooo hard! My body and mind were a complete mess. I sweat like a waterfall and my mind was bouncing like a can tumbling loudly down a spiral stair. I had awoken an nefarious troll inside me and it was on a path of war. It was thirsty and demanded to drink.

&#x200B;

All of you, SD, convinced me to take one day at a time. 

Sometimes a second at a time. 

Sometimes a minute. 

You taught me I had to win the small battles to slay the troll.

&#x200B;

When I reached the one week milestone I was still battling but I was also radiating with joy and pride. I had tears in my eyes and was so grateful for the strong companionship from SD. 

&#x200B;

But Christmas was near! ""*A ""dangerous"" time to avoid alcohol*"" The troll roared. 

\- I told it that every day had it pitfalls and it didn't matter what time of year it was. 

\-""*You also have a big party coming up and a rock concert. And New Years Eve And...*"" 

\- *OH SHUT TF UP YOU EFFING TROLL!!!*

&#x200B;

Days passed and became weeks. Weeks became months... And the battles had become easier. But I was still fragile and had to be vigilant. Take one day at a time. Reading the struggles and victories here on SD was my biggest support and weapon. Then Corona came... and the troll went absolute bonkers!

&#x200B;

It barked malicously ""KILL IT WITH ALCOHOL!""

But I calmly answered ""Return to the abyss, nefarious evil. IWNDYT""

Summertime came. The first wave of Corona had been beaten and I had given the troll a good  6 months if ass woopin'. It felt gooooood! And suddenly the year mark milestone didn't seem that impossible. I had learned a lot and I enjoyed being sober. I enjoyed feeling healthy and light.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't say that the last six months have been a walk in the park. But it has certainly been easier. A sober life feels natural and my surroundings (Friends and family) has accepted and embraced that I don't drink.

&#x200B;

The troll is still a part of me. And we have our arguements from time to time but I am much more comfortable and calm when it roars. Yesterday we had a fight in the supermarket. I was walking by the liquor department and suddenly I found myself with a beer in my hand a voice in my head that said 

""*You can celebrate your* ***one year*** *with this! You've done good.*""

I shook my head and firmly placed the beer to back the shelf

**""O**h **N**efarious **E**vil! 

**Y**ou **E**ffing **A**ddiction, 

**R**emoved!""

&#x200B;

Thank you SD. I couldn't have made it without you.",49,{'rona': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8510987758636475}"

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning SD,

&#x200B;

""Stop complicating your life so much."" -Jim ""Hobo"" Stobe

""Your white sheet of paper, it's really an adventure playground, isn't it? There's no such thing as a mistake. A mistake is an opportunity to do something else."" -Ralph Steadman

""Grace is what matters, in anything, especially life, especially growth, tragedy, pain, love, death; about people, that's what matters. That's a quality I admire very greatly. It keeps you from reaching for the gun too quickly. It keeps you from destroying things too foolishly. It sort of keeps you alive; and it keeps you open for more understanding."" -Jeff Buckley

""Frustration is thinking you can't win."" -Joey ""Coco"" Diaz

&#x200B;

What are some quotes that speak to you? Have you found something in your sobriety journey that has been helpful? Or is there a saying that drives you totally nuts? I'm always humbled by the collected wisdom of those of us who are choosing, as Steadman said above, to see the mistakes as opportunities to try something else.

&#x200B;

I'm reading *The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion* by Jonathan Haidt. It's pretty interesting and features hot takes such as ""anyone who values truth should stop worshipping reason"". He argues very persuasively that we have to accept the fact that everyone's morals are built in and are mostly intuitions for which we use our supposedly higher facilities of logic and reasoning to construct supporting arguments. I'm geeking out hard on the philosophy in it. I wrote my master's thesis on some stuff about David Hume so I'm just delighted to run into old Hume in what I thought was a random pop psychology type book. He mentions Hume quite a bit so on the off-chance that anyone reading this is also a Hume fan, check it out, haha!

No, I haven't started *The Queen's Gambit* yet. It's next in line for TV! Anyone else see it? Is it triggering, alcohol wise?

This year has been the hardest of my 30 years on this planet.
I suffered a breakdown in November 2019 and I lost everything.  My job, my confidence, my SO (we're back together and I could not have survived this year without him).

After a couple months in hospital I was sent home and fell apart. I started drinking a lot and it got worse from there. I cut myself off from everyone and just drank at home because it was the only way I could deal with the anxiety and depression along with a dump truck full of other issues.

I've been drinking since I was 13. Over half my life. I hate it! I don't even enjoy the feeling of being drunk I just  couldn't cope on my own.

The last few weeks I've been cutting down and today, with help from medication as my symptoms are severe, I am officially alcohol free.

I don't remember the last time I was this excited for life.  I keep thinking of awesome things I want to do that I have been too unwell due to alcohol to even contemplate. I can't wait to go bushwalking, swimming, the list is endless!

I know I have a long way to go and it won't be easy but I am finally at the point that I never want another drop of alcohol ever again!

Thank you to everyone here for inspiring me and showing how wonderful life can be without alcohol!
I have so much love for this community!  Thank you for helping me to see the light.

I start to remember my drinking as more fun and pleasant than it was. But when I associate with other alcoholics I remember the pain of drinking. More importantly, I remember the joy of sobriety.

Been a long time lurker, and this is my first post here.I got nobody to talk to right now, and for a while I told myself I would post here on my one year sober anniversary, I know it's tomorrow, but  I have nothing to do right now, so I got to writing.

One year ago I was a functional alcoholic, and had been for almost 10 years.

I was drinking myself into a coma almost every night.

I would drink alone during the evening(on a work day, all day on weekends) and watch a movie/T.V. Series/Youtube videos/etc, and then down 6 Benadryl pills to go to sleep, wake up at 3am to pee and not be able to go back to sleep. This would make me show up at work like a zombie the next morning when I could even make it there.

&#x200B;

The amount of time I said that's enough and never again is ridiculous, I must have thrown over 1000$ worth of booze in the toilet telling me this was the last time, only to pick it up 3 days later.

Once in 2015 I spent a month sober, but passed in front of the wine section at the grocery store and told myself it's been a month, I got control on it now, what's one bottle gonna do?

2 weeks later and I was drunk every day again. I know now that I can never think I got control and that I can drink only a little.

I can never touch a drop of alcohol again.

&#x200B;

I eventually had a doctor's meeting, I told her I was an alcoholic and depressed, she ask how much I drank, then she immediately scheduled me to get my liver and kidneys checked through blood work.(Spoiler alert, I'm lucky, all still working well.)

She gave me depression medication that I could not take with alcohol and signed for time off work.

I had bi-monthly meeting with a social worker.

&#x200B;

Also I had high blood pressure, and in 3 months time it came back to normal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So how did I stay sober? : Shame, the shame of telling my friends and family I was a drunk all the time did it for me and I stopped, and will never look back.

I read a lot of post of people here struggling after 3, 5 or 7 days.

My advice is tell your doctor and your family.

Tell your friends.

&#x200B;

And the next time you think about drinking imagine telling your friends and family you drank again, that stops me right there. I hope it helps.

My life is all better now.I lost 35 lbs.

In one months time my chess elo rating went up 150 points!!!

&#x200B;

My wallet is fat! (Alcohol was expansive yo!)

I talk to my mother more!!

I have reconnected to one lost long ago friend.

This summer I cycled 600km to another city and then back! (took 10 days 1200km total)

&#x200B;

I have dreams of long distance cycling a lot more now.

Maybe one day I'll even get a girlfriend.

That person didn‚Äôt feel like it was me, but it was who I‚Äôd become when I was drinking and I had to clean up the aftermath and mess that followed.

So around the begining of october knowing i couldnt go inpatient due to the pandemic i needed to quit.  still do.  so i tried tapering for the millionth time and for some dumb luck reason i made it.  i got sober without going into withdrawals.  i was super happy and i did even make it three whole weeks before i drank again.  When i started drinking i remember it started slow at first but escalated to huge binges very quickly.  im a student in an upperclassmen dorm.  no one talks to each other and i was kind of just able to scoot by for another three weeks of being absolutly plastered 24/7 doing stupid shit like stealing halloween candy.  nothing crazy, but it always escalates.  finally on saturday, my heart felt like it was gonna cave in.  im a heavy smoker and even moreso when i drink.  my heart was pounding, i instantly vomited so loudly im sure the rest of the floor heard me. i knew i had to try and bring this to an end, but having polished off a whole bottle of whiskey the preceeding few nights my body was shutting down.  i was/am dehydrated, shaky, anxious, nauseas.  

So saturday i went to the liquor store and picked up some shitty beer to stave the shakes and hopefuy stop the vomiting.  it didnt so i had to go buy some whiskey, a small bottle, justs because i was physically unable to hold down beer or water so it wasnt stopping anything.  Got a little tipsy by accident and tried to sleep a bit. something i always struggle with when getting sober.  i tossed and turned until about 6 hours or so and woke up around noon.  the hangover i was hoping to sooth only 1% better from saturday morning and proceed to puke bile.  i had been avoiding my parents but my drunk ass made sure to text them late at night several nights in row before sunday so they absolutly blew up my phone until i answered.  i came clean and told them i fell off the wagon again and we talked for awhile.  when i got back inside my anxiety skyrocketed and i spent the next few hours trying to not shake and slow my heart rate.  finally after nine o clock (when they stop selling whiskey here) i couldnt take it anymore and bought a 12 pack of beer and tried to drink slowly.  ive been in withdrawal too many times to know the dangers and risks of a cold turkey stop.  I managed to get some food down i wasnt just running on beer and whiskey fumes from days ago.  so without sleeping by 5 am 9.5 were gone and i tried to fall asleep for my day today.

i fucking hate mondays.  i gave up on trying to sleep around 10 am or so.  i had to pee so just said fuck it and was instantly awake.  i was still nauseas but no puke.  and anxiety was again through the roof.  could not help myself.  I slowly drank the 2 beers left and sadly the flat leftover one, and abaded the shakes only slightly.  luckily i had a break inbetween classes and i was able to go for a walk and talk to my mom for awhile.  but alas within an hour of finishing the beers, my shakes came back and i was anxious again.  hot and cold sweats.  i dont like withdrawal at all.  now i have an exam due at midnight and all i can think of is going to the store and buying a 12 pack just in case for tonight incase withdrawals kick in hard in the middle of the night when i dont have access to beer.  i dont want to but honestly, ive freaked out in withdrawal and walked to the ER too many times to know this is the case.  I dont want to waste precious time and materials in the ER on some guy who needs to stop.

Sometimes we just need to vent. 

 I am 29 years old and have been a pretty heavy drinker for the last 10 years. Granted, there are definitely people that drank more than me - the last few years specifically - I felt awful about my drinking habits. 

Over the course of the 10 years I have had far too many black out, fucked my life up , events happen. Including but not limited to things like...
 
- Open bar welcome reception to my first out of state work conference after receiving a promotion. A night of drinking with my new bosses and corporate head quarters employees of my job - in Savannah GA. I blacked out, sang karaoke and then fell into the brick streets , bashing my face into the ground and waking up to half of a front too and cuts all over my face. I had to go to 3 days worth of this conference meeting people from all over the world and of power within my large company, with a jacked up face

- Drinking so heavily and blacking out at my local dive bar and being forced to be driven home by another local. When they asked me where my home was, I took them to my neighbors home and told them I couldn‚Äôt find my keys. So , naturally, I broke open the living room window and made myself comfortable in their living room. My neighbors found me passed out in my own vomit on their couch and thankfully did not arrest me but had me taken to a hospital with I believe almost 3 times the limit. 

- My most recent black out included drinking 5 margaritas and twisting my ankle and completely cutting up my entire leg. Could barley walk for a month (this June) and looked like I got attacked by a shark if I wore a dress or shorts. 

On July 6th of this year - I had my last beer. I went for a week or two with out drinking which wasn‚Äôt uncommon - but after two weeks I realized, I started something that I needed to finish. From then on... I made the conscious decision to not drink. 

The first month was difficult. I would wake up feeling hung over or would randomly get the taste of tequila in my mouth. While my partner still drinks, he has cut back immensely with me not partaking. I have found a new confidence in my decision to quit and find it to be something I am proud to be doing. It feels so good to have feelings and to not be hungover. 

Saturday my girlfriend was having a 30th birthday celebration. We were to meet at a local cidery at noon and followed was a night at a house she had rented out. The main ingredient- alcohol. I knew I was ready and I couldn‚Äôt miss this day for her. So I offered to be the DD and I put my best smile on. The cidery was fine because there was food and soda and no one really noticed. But I did find myself craving a drink so bad. They all looked so good. 

The house party got a little more intimate. But we played cards against humanity, listened to music and I had myself a great time. as the night got later and the drinks were flowing, I could almost sense a bit of envy coming from some of my friends (maybe it was all in my head) . Just as they started to feel crummy with their stomach full of mixed drinks, ciders, beers - I was chugging waters and still having a great time. I was still confident, still funny and better yet, I felt great. The best part was that normally when the booze would start to run low, I would have been panicking.‚Äò I was that girl that would drink until the sun came up if I had enough. But there was no need to worry about that. Plus - I had to have saved a ton of money . 

The next morning I woke up and was pretty exhausted from all of the social interaction that I am no longer used to but I didn‚Äôt need to puke or eat a 4 lb greasy cheeseburger to make myself feel better . Lol

Anyways, I‚Äôm happy to say I survived and I am happy to say I am still proud of my decision. I don‚Äôt know if I will ever decide to have a drink again - but I am so glad to know for certain that I don‚Äôt need alcohol to have a great time or to feel comfortable in a social setting.

I don't live by the idea that I can never drink alcohol ever again. Going by my track record I know that I am likely to drink again and I can see exactly what will happen and it frightens me which is why I don't do it. I don't resent not drinking. I'm thankful that I don't have to. 

Here are a few positive things I've experienced since stopping drinking.  


1. Career has improved without trying - Worked as an I.T. contractor for some of the biggest companies in London.
2. Rediscovered old hobbies - Love playing retro video games and building computers. I've reconnected with my younger self. 
3. Ran every single day at least 1 mile since 1st December 2015 for a total of 21,000km / 13,000 miles. 
4. Become more compassionate towards animals - For some reason, I really like rabbits now. No idea where that came from. Brain drying out from all the booze probably. 
5. Ran 1050 miles in 38 days across UK for charity. Met some wonderfully kind people. Faith was restored in humanity.  
6. Ran 300 miles in 18 days across The Netherlands. Pioneered an unfortunate new running technique which involved vaping marijuana and running 5 miles north at times when I should have been running 5 miles south. Dogs could see I was being a bit of a punk and came at me with force. Could've been the weed. Or the wheezing. Or the music coming from my Bluetooth speakers in my backpack. 
7. Lived confidently on my own in many different countries across Europe. One of the best times was in a small city in the Czech Republic called Liberec. I ran up Mount Jested almost every day and was brought apple pie for breakfast by my Airbnb host.  I've been subject to some terrible Airbnb reviews from my drunken years when I would not clean up after myself, but I got this one from my host there (translated from Czech)  ""Matt, thank you for your visit, I had great chocolate for you, so you'll get it on a visit again. I keep my fingers in the fight with addiction, I wish happy life and many beautiful walks through mountain peaks. Hana""

Am I sober? Probably not in a lot of peoples eyes. I stopped drinking by holding some crazy ceremony with the universe, taking 3 LSD hits and going on a 5 mile run around one of the most densely populated and crime-ridden suburbs of North London. It was during that experience I felt empathy for myself for the first time ever as I thought I was bleeding beer out of my liver and could feel it trying to burrow its way out of my skin. 

I've tried substituting weed for alcohol and it's never really worked. I was anxious about money, so I wanted to switch off. Buying weed costs a lot of money, therefore my anxiety INCREASED. We all have the natural capacity to deal with any issues we experience in life, relying on anything external to function normally risks becoming a problem over time. 

My condition has nothing to do with a disease and is more to do with the human condition in the 21st century of being introverted and lacking a tribe. In fact, I'm functioning normally in a diseased society and therein lies my problem.

I can definitely do better with life.  Most if not all outside drugs are not helpful including caffeine. Religion is probably not helpful either. We're told to embrace reality AND to entertain strange notions of afterlives, creator Gods and objective morality. The reality might well be that we're confused little apes on a cold dying planet with no inherent purpose other than to do the best with what we have and to not kill ourselves or others through our own selfishness. 

Do better today than yesterday. Do not pick up the first drink. Do not take yourself too seriously, your genitals hang off you like string-cheese skin from a burn victim.

Whenever I stop drinking I get very depressed as all I do is work with no joyous outlet, and I know it is also unhealthy to just work and never experience joy, how do I maintain my well being without alcohol given it is my only source of happiness?

\-------

I am really lonely and stressed out. I work a full time job where I am currently in the prospecting period for my employer. That means I am taking multiple tests per week, learning new things every day, constantly under scrutiny by new supervisors, and operate under high pressure situations where I have to explain legal liability to many different people while it's being recorded so I can't make any mistakes.

I get 0 in person human contact because of covid since I have to WFH and I will be WFH until at least the summer. I only have 1 friend I see very occasionally and am essentially a 30 year old virgin. I had sex once with a girl 7 years ago and the sex was shitty at that.

The only thing I can do for human interaction is go to the gym, which I like to do, but that also makes me feel bad as I see beautiful women every where and it's a tease as I want to be romantically involved with one yet am reminded of the stinging pain of how badly I want to experience sex and how much it hurts to have not had sex for the past 16 or so years of my sexual maturity.

This brings me to my overall point, I used to get drunk every weekend to feel some sort of pleasure/joy in my life. I have stopped drinking for the past 10 days and plan on continuing to abstain as it interferes too much with my new job, plus for health benefits, (I want to lose weight and improve my mental health).

Without alcohol I have no source of joy/play in my life. I feel as if it's unhealthy to constantly be working and have 0 time for joy.

I wouldn‚Äôt do yoga or meditate at night. I‚Äôd be too drunk. I‚Äôd just pass out.

2020-11-16 17:08:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jvgdcq/two_alcoholics_one_marriage/,"Two Alcoholics, One Marriage","Silly title reference aside, Hey SD, its good to be here.

I post here once in a while, when I get fed up and take a break from booze, but never really with the mindset of this is forever, but I feel differently this time. Here's a little backstory, and I apologize in advance for my rambling story. 

So I'm a guy, in my 30's and I'm married to a wonderful wife that I love very much, and we are both alcoholics. I have a hard time saying that about me, and not so hard of a time saying that about her. She is currently in a treatment facility for her second time in under a year, so you know, SHE is an alcoholic. I never went to rehab, I never lost a job, I never had any of the stereotypical consequences, so I'm fine. I've had my issues with drinking before, but I've always been able to rein it in when I have to, so its simple, she is an alcoholic, I'm not, we're fine! 

\-WRONG!

I have a problem, and I need to admit that if I want to keep my family together, or if I want to keep myself together. After my wife got out of rehab the first time I said no alcohol in the house, and I stuck to that, for a while. She said she didn't mind if I had a drink after work with coworkers here and there, or if I went out with friends which I rarely do, but just not to have it in the house, and to not be drunk around her. These are all really reasonable requests and ones I agreed to in her recovery plan, but a drink after work was nice sometimes, but you know as time went on I wanted a little more, so I'd have  3 beers instead of 1, then when I was particularly stressed out I got a bottle of liquor so I could have a little more alcohol when I got home. This turned into me hiding a bottle in the house, and not to excuse the actions, but I wasn't getting really drunk at home, just a few drinks, but hidden away, and then I started to really look forward to that daily. I'd chew gum or something similar to mask my breath because I was ""really good"" at hiding it. But I wasn't, especially to an alcoholic who wanted nothing more than to drink right then and was fighting with everything she had to stay sober. so one night when I had been drinking she said she was going to sleep at her parents because she knew I had been drinking and didn't want to be in the house if there was alcohol and that smelling it on me was making her uncomfortable. I felt so ashamed, I promised I wouldn't do that anymore and really felt awful. But did I stop? NO good reader, I didn't, because I'm an alcoholic who was in denial. We move on, I slowly started again, we also started to have a really big relationship problem that was completely unrelated to alcohol and my fault. So then one day I start to get a feeling that my wife has been drinking again, and I wasn't sure, so I waited, didn't want to bring it up because A) she's been upset with me over something else B) I feel hypocritical talking to her about drinking and I know I will be held accountable too, so then I finally asked her and she said she had been, she started when she was cleaning and found a bottle I had in the house and it all started again right then, it's not fair that I get to drink and she doesn't, etc. 

Fast forward to 2 months of her steadily drinking more and more, until she checked herself into rehab again (I'm so proud of her, she made this decision all by herself without anybody suggesting it, she really has made a lot of progress in the past year and I'm really happy about that). I keep being told to not blame myself for her drinking, and I know that it isn't 100% my fault, but its definitely partially my fault, like I didn't make her do it, but I definitely made it super easy for her by making it available, and fueling her secrecy and resentment. When she went, and the few times I've talked to her she has been optimistic about herself, but not so much about us, and I can just hear it in her voice. I feel like she has made the realization that its either sobriety or me (she doesn't trust that I'll ever be part of the sobriety plan), and that is terrifying. I know that if things stay the same, I will lose my wife, and I really don't want them to stay the same, but its really hard to admit these things and then start to take these steps that I need to take. 

I've always considered myself a heavy drinker, but not an alcoholic. Even though I've googled ""am I an alcoholic?"" many times over the years, I've been lurking and sometimes posting here for a few years, I've had a few people close to me show concern about my drinking, but like I said early I was always able to stop when I needed to, before anything bad happened, but now something bad is happening. I don't know if this is my rock bottom, but it sure as hell feels like it. It's just weird to me because I haven't been getting trashed (I mean here and there, but not consistently), I have a decent job, I'm usually the person that holds the family together, I've never drank in the morning or at work, I just always felt that those are the things that tell you ""you are an alcoholic, you need to stop"". 

But

 I am an alcoholic, and I need to stop. It's that simple. Alcohol has been more important to me than my wife. Alcohol has stunted my emotional growth for the past decade. I'm overweight, my health is not the best, I spend too much money, and maybe I don't drink ""that much"" the fact that I consistently have to say to myself that I don't drink ""that much"" should have been a red flag a long time ago.

I'm here for it, I'm ready to be done. I'm also terrified of being done, drinking is just such an integral part of my life, from having a beer after work with my coworkers, to meeting up with my buddies to try a new brewery. Drinking is also how my Wife and I started dating, and what we did for most of our relationship, and I'm afraid of what that will look like without alcohol, but I have to face that, because it's either find out what that's like, or find out what divorce is like. Luckily I'm not physically dependent on it, but I'm scared because I've been able to quit any time I've told myself I was going to in the past (That old cliche ""I can stop anytime""), and I go strong for a month or 2, but I usually figure one or two beers with my friends is fine and it is, but then I slowly get to where it's every night.  I'm also just ready to move on with my life, I have a lot of emotional scars that I have not worked through, but I'm ready, I've started seeing a therapist and I'm excited about that, I'm ready for some real progress.

So if you made it this far, thanks for reading the ramblings of somebody that has reached some hard truths and is willing but scared to take the next step. I'm not sure exactly what that step is aside from not drinking and posting here. Do people do meetings now with covid? even if there are meetings I work full time and have to take care of 2 young boys with minimal assistance now that my wife is in treatment. I just feel like I could really use some type of assistance but don't know what that is or how to find the time to get it. 

But I'm here pledging to post here daily, and to stay healthy and sober, at least for today.

I'm 27, FTM. I wasn't a big partier in high school, or my early 20s. I'd binge some weekends but it never raised any flags. 

Then one day, for no particular reason, I just started drinking more. I love being drunk, it's my absolute favorite feeling in the entire world. I just know that I should start worrying about my liver now, and I hate the feeling of regret in the morning. My sex life with my fiancee has almost disappeared because I'm too drunk every night. I know she's getting tired of it, and I'm scared about that too. 

I can go a night or two without anything, but once I have one drink it turns into many. I don't have a shutoff switch anywhere to be found. I guess I'm posting in hopes to get some motivation or encouragement, because nobody in my real life knows except for my fiancee. It doesn't affect my work or my friendships, so I never bring it up or ask for help. 

I just feel lost, and scared for my relationship and my health. I know I just ""need to stop"" but it's so hard. I can't sleep sober anymore. If I don't drink one night, I need to smoke weed or else I won't fall asleep until 3-4 in the morning. 

Quite a few months ago I went a whole week without drinking, with no withdraw symptoms at all. So I thought, neat, I can do this!! Then the pandemic started getting worse and I spiraled and I'm back to drinking nightly to excess.

After many weeks, I'm back here again on this subreddit feeling like shit, and feeling all the more motivated now to stop drinking than I was for my previous attempts. Maybe it's the persistent acid reflux. Maybe its the weight gain. Maybe it's the horror stories I've read on here in the last few weeks detailing loss in liver function, kidney loss, or hepatitis. Maybe it's a desire to be something different, in spite of all those mistakes I made, and there have been A LOT of mistakes. In any case, I just poured out about a liter of vodka I had stashed away and a thermos I'd been hiding with vodka and mixer combined.

I don't know what kind of lasting damage I've done to myself because of alcohol abuse. I don't have any withdrawal symptoms, as far as I can tell, so that's at least one positive, but I don't know what my immediate future holds beyond my desire to not drink today. To that end, I'm coming to Reddit for a little support, and some more advice. In particular, how to jive with meeting when you're not really engaged with the discussion, the testimonies, the big book (though there are exceptions), or the current online format most use these days.

When I started drinking to cope, I was 15/16 and had clinical anxiety. I kind of glamourised it in my head - I liked the 'tortured artist' trope. When I first mentioned my drinking to my friends, it was partly asking for attention (I'd drunk text them a lot, but I think I was trying to ask for help really).


I was influenced lots by singers with addictions, and especially by songs they wrote about addiction (even if they were in recovery at the time). 


Now, I'm watching The Queen's Gambit on Netflix. I haven't finished it yet, and I love it - but I feel it glamourises addiction. At the beginning the main character is a young orphan who is given pills to keep her subdued. She saves them and uses them to hallucinate games of chess on her ceiling. Later (as a teen/young woman) we see her using pills again, as well as drinking in excess.


I'm still trying to understand my relationship with alcohol and control my drinking, and I'm only 19, so both of those factors mean that this show left more of an impression on me. But not a good one - I crave a drink when I watch it. I'm not abstaining, just cutting right down (I buy 2 ciders during my weekly shop, and don't shop otherwise).

I would typically drink a couple Saturdays a month and always got super drunk and blackout only to wake up Sunday and start drinking right away to keep that drunk feeling. Those Monday‚Äôs were so awful with regret and the worst hangovers which I had to haul myself into work with. I was taking 2 steps forward 1 step back in my personal life and career and the step back was always due to alcohol. I have just had enough as a 26 year old trying to be a responsible adult. I had no control over how much I drank even when I said ‚Äújust a couple with the guys‚Äù, I always started buzzing and would just drink into oblivion and embarrass myself in front of friends or family and whoever else I came across. It‚Äôs not who I want to be and my year goal is something I‚Äôve been looking to do for some time. After about 8 years of irresponsibility with alcohol, losing friends at times from being a drunk ass, losing out on accomplishments I could achieve sober, it‚Äôs time for me to grow up and give myself the gift I deserve. What better time then now! 

That brings me to this weekend, Saturday i worked out in the morning then I kayaked and had dinner with my parents. Sunday woke up early worked out and then studied all day. Meal prepped at night and then watched a movie and had ice cream. Monday I woke up, ran, and had all my food already made. Much different from what some of my Mondays would look like where all the drinking caught up and I‚Äôd have to take my shaky, nauseous, ANXIOUS, dehydrated, tired self to work. Get behind on work and avoid people/responsibility all while having all time depression/low confidence after all my serotonin had been artificially released from the booze.

I can do it, you can do it, we can do it, Yeah! üí™","500 days ago there was a kind of spell in me, seeking a space of numbness or escape- I wasn't sure then and I am not sure now. A force that had me giving up on myself and my ideas far before putting any effort in... Throwing up my hands in frustration at the most menial setback. We all have our reasons to avoid obstacles and challenges. What I have noticed is that lately I started to like to try to solve my problems. 
I find my mental health is much better when I run. At least a couple times a week. This year I have an average of 8 miles a week running. I can see a consistency that I have never had before. The swings are just much milder. Some weeks 0 and some 15, but typically I get back out there and give it my best. I feel like that is new for me. I would go weeks or months without running. And then finally psych myself to get back to it. 
What I see in the mirror is a different person who sets boundaries and can say no. Recently I made a decision when I don't like a pair of socks or a shirt, I get rid of it. I don't know why, but I have a whole closet of clothes to go through. It may be a metaphor. Lot of stuff I have accepted that I didn't want or need. And now, I am shedding it. And I feel confident. I know myself better. I am not ashamed, I know I need work. It is ok. We are all works in progress. 

What else? I follow recipes now. Yep, it seems like an easy thing. But I never did. I would just wing everything and refuse to learn something new. Now I like to read multiple recipes and sometimes watch a YouTube video and really plan it out in my head and then try. And I have been so successful! It is actually not that hard. Just takes a little decision making, planning, and follow through. Things I struggled with (and of course still do) so much. 
TLDR: I take care of myself much more than I ever have before. And that self care has caused an incredible amount of self growth.

2. Still lacking some motivation but getting a bit better.
3. As an avid reader I have discovered books that I have read while drunk and I do not remember reading them. I remember major plot points but not the finer details. So far I have re-read 7 Books that show in my Kindle as being read. That was fun.
4. AA Is not for me. But there are other groups where I lurk and find peace. 
5. Keep at it. I do not have any real desire to drink. No need. Especially in lock down.

I have been largely dealing with this on my own so I'm so thankful to have found you all!

I started drinking in high school. My high-school bf's family were a bunch of high functioning alcoholics, so we would drink on the weekends, or if we had a bad day, or holidays or, whatever. One time his mom and sister got me trashed just so I wouldn't be able to answer all of the riddles that they couldn't lol.. Then when I graduated, I definitely flopped right into the party scene. From about 16-23, drugs and alcohol were the only way I knew how to cope. (""I feel bad now.... but if I am fucked up, I feel good..... until I am sober again and hungover and burnt out..... but if I just get fucked up again....."") I started bartending at 21, and my drinking got out of control. I had just gotten out of an almost 4 year relationship that turned abusive and toxic. Even though my mom was a pretty heavy alcoholic when I was a kid, and I swore I would never be like her..... I turned exactly into that haha. I would black out probably at least 3 times a week. I would maybe go 1 or 2 days a week without getting drunk. 

Now I'm 24. I quit drinking in June after I went out with a coworker and blacked out and made a scene in public and then broke my foot walking home. Now that winter is starting to creep in, I can feel my seasonal depression starting to wake up as well. Especially with how stressful this entire year has been, I am trying not to dwell on the fact that in 6 years of trying to cope, I shot myself in the foot because now I have to not only learn how to cope.... I have to learn how to do it sober!! I feel confident-- this summer I took up a lot of spirituality and tackled a lot of internal struggles that I think lead me to drinking and whatnot. But I still feel very anxious about having to sit down and conquer... well, me, I guess, after drowning her for so long.

This post isn‚Äôt meant to demean the idea or anyone that has experienced Rock Bottom but I do feel like it is an idea that can sometimes do some harm. I feel like Rock Bottom is something that can get built up and used as a way to feel that you haven‚Äôt reached the end of your Drinking. There are many posts here that have people wondering if they should stop because they haven‚Äôt hit a bottom yet. 

I was a bad drinker for a long time, it nearly ruined my life and at several points over the years I continued to drink because I didn‚Äôt feel I had hit a bottom. I‚Äôm lucky enough that my wife stuck it out but she still isn‚Äôt completely over the shit I put her through with years of drinking. 

But to my point, my end with drinking wasn‚Äôt all that remarkable, even my wife as fed up as she was found it odd that my last bad day of drinking was so tame, maybe it says more about what I put her through but I didn‚Äôt finally stop drinking on the low I thought I would have to reach. 

Just don‚Äôt think you need to hit a bottom to stop, don‚Äôt look at what you‚Äôve gone through and think that things need to get completely awful before you‚Äôre finally done. If you‚Äôre here and considering stopping you probably should because you don‚Äôt want to get to the point you hit bottom. You‚Äôll probably never find someone that will say they stopped drinking at the perfect time, just about everyone I‚Äôve talked to wishes they had stopped sooner.",24,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9925543665885925}"

One thousand days sober and healthy.,"Okay, so technically my one thousandth day free of alcohol was a couple of days ago, but my life is blissfully busy (even during a pandemic), and to be honest, I kind of wanted to double-celebrate on my cake day. Especially since I joined Reddit for the express purpose of finding an online recovery community. So happy to be here, in so many ways.

When I was about three or four months into this journey, I went to a recovery meeting in Denver (far from my hometown), in which the chairperson said he'd just gotten 1,000 days. I looked at the guy like a total rock star, someone who really had his shit together. A thousand days! Was it really possible? Sure, I'd met people with ten, twenty, even more than thirty years in recovery, but I found it difficult to connect with them. They may as well have been sober extraterrestrials from the Crab Nebula, as far as I was concerned. A completely alien species. But a thousand days? Whoa. Days I could relate to. I was counting days, myself. Days meant something to me. They still do.

And now, here I am. Everything is different, and yet nothing is different. I didn't see a burning bush or hear a booming voice from the sky. Life didn't become magically wonderful all of a sudden. But looking back on where I was when I started, it's difficult not to see how far I've come as nothing short of miraculous. Life isn't perfect now, but it's pleasant, for the most part, and I'm not fighting so hard against anything and everything. I'm not so desperately sick, sad, alone and terrified.

A thousand days ago I was waking up in the morning with the shakes, gagging and dry heaving, and that awful, inimitable feeling of ""impending doom."" The only thing that could make me feel even remotely better was a 7am trip to the corner store for a pint of vodka and a sports drink. I'd look in the mirror and didn't recognize the person I saw in there. It was like looking into a fun house mirror, everything terrifying and distorted: my red, swollen face, my scarily skinny frame, the constant look of fear in my expression. Pitiful and incomprehensible demoralization, staring right back at me with my own yellowed eyes. 

Every day I stay sober, I'm immeasurably grateful that I found a way off the infernal merry-go-round that was my drinking life. As they say, ""Recovery didn't open the gates of heaven and let me in; it opened the gates of Hell and let me out."" Life isn't perfect after a thousand days, but it's at least manageable, and often joyful. Thanks for being there for my recovery, friends. This community has been a wonderful constant over the last thousand days, and I have no doubt it'll continue to be so in the next thousand days and beyond.

And if you're just starting out, don't worry about making it a thousand days. Don't worry about a hundred days, or even ten days. The only day that matters is today, and that's how I made it here: One thousand days of day one. One foot in front of the other. Every day is new, and every day is a fresh start. You can do this. I believe in you!

Your friend,

Turtle

I've been drinking for about 25 years, pretty much every night, to greater or lesser degrees.  Some nights it would be 4-5 beers, some nights it would be about half a 750ml of vodka.  In the mornings I would feel tired, hungover, irritable, etc. but could still function throughout the day.  

I read all of the great things that were supposed to happen when you stopped drinking like having more energy, more focus, better memory, weight loss, and on and on.   Truth is I don't feel a hell of a lot better.  I get up in the morning and I'm still tired, my back hurts, and my head hurts.  I haven't lost any weight, I don't feel like I have any more motivation or focus.   

Has anyone else found that they really don't feel better after quitting?  Has it just been not enough time and eventually I'll feel better?   Obviously liver damage isn't a great thing but I've gone 25 years and only have moderate damage, and I probably only have another 30 or so on this earth, so I'm really wondering if it's worth it.  

Sorry if this doesn't belong here.

I checked in daily, and got so much wonderful support and encouragement.  As my own days started racking up, I began supporting others as I had been supported, and it was really a great place to be.  A couple of little things came and went--people couldn't help being people-like sometimes, and over time, I just felt like I...outgrew it? or something.  A ""final straw"" with lack of enforcement of the very few rules, and I took it as a sign that it had served its truly awesome purpose of setting me onto the sober life highway, and now time to spread wings a bit and leave for new pastures.

I found this sub early on, and while it didn't have the connection for me the first site did, I've been a lurker and a poster for a while.  Lately, I've been checking in almost daily, reading every day, coming here often, and I am loving it.  I love the support, the encouragement, the care everyone shows for each other.  It's proof that people can just flat out be nice to each other and understand that we are all in this together, whether it's trying to stop drinking or just trying to live life in an incredibly stressful time.  The other day, I was having a weirdly ""weak"" moment in time that scared me a little (some fading effect bias and forgetting why I stopped drinking) and when I asked for support here, it set me back on the straight...and I was blown away at the generosity of spirit of people here.

And yet, when I was offered a beer, I took it. 
Then, when offered a second, I took that too.

Then I stopped. Which is all fine and dandy if you don't have alcohol problems. But I certainly do. I'm worried that this two-beer evening will turn into a full relapse. Alcohol is a drug and by putting that drug back into my body on Saturday, I've affected my brain again. I'm also concerned that I'll start regarding Saturday night as a moderation win. My best friend even referred to it as that when I brought it up to her. I did tell her that it's not a win, because my goal was not to drink.

I am not able to moderate 99/100 times, so it's easier for me to not drink at all. I've always been a binge drinker.

 I learned in recovery to strive for balance in my life. I also found out how powerful gratitude is, so I blogged daily about what I was grateful for. I began that on 2-12-2013. I knew it was life changing, but I do not know what it felt like.

The subtle changes occurred slowly and over several years. My brain, simmering in problems and depression, needed the slow improvements daily gratitude afforded me so I could adjust to the changes. Years later, I came across an article detailing how a suicidal person goes through with their plan because their brain is drowning in negativity. Their problems overwhelm them and they can only see one way out.  

I can relate to that because I have been suicidal twice in my life and took pill overdoses on both occasions. I give thanks to say both failed, but my point remains. I understand the drowning in negativity outlook. I could not see any other way out of my problems. And every thought I had reminded me of more problems I did not know how to resolve.

Determined to find solutions reading about recovery, I learned our brains are like sponges. No different from a sponge saturated and dripping what it soaks up, our water-logged brains drip positive or negative thoughts. It does not distinguish between what is good or bad; it contains the chemicals our thoughts produce. Our emotions and our instincts tell us whether something is right or wrong, except for the lies our abusers pounded into our heads.

If you have felt that, you know it is crippling.

So by changing my brain's environment a little every day with my daily gratitude, my fog lifted. I could feel a positive difference, so I kept going. 

Looking back, I can‚Äôt remember when I developed my self-awareness. Maybe acceptance came first? I recall working hard to accept what worried me and feared back then because I knew of no other way to change those fears into anything positive. I had to accept them for what they were: an integral part of my reality. My fears are part of who I am. By facing and accepting them as wounds on my soul, they heal.

Developing those three qualities brought me the farthest. The only one I did intentionally was my daily gratitude. The others followed in a natural progression. 

That is why I encourage people to address their emotions; when we resolve our emotions, our own logic develops because that area of our life heals. For me, my logic unfolded into my self-awareness and the acceptance of problems I knew I had to address. I saw firsthand in my day-to-day life how trying to understand why I did what I did came easier as I addressed the painful emotions that fueled my depression and crippling complex ptsd I did not know I had until 2017. 

Because of the trauma I carried around, locked up inside me, I had no logic or common sense. As I faced my emotions, slowly and over a long time, my thinking straightened out. I faced what I needed to face and accept based on my thoughts. Mine, my thoughts and no one else‚Äôs. 

Our brains and our emotions let us know what we need to pay attention to, what we need to address. If you do this, start with what problems are uppermost in your thoughts, with the guidance of a professional if you are not familiar with the process. Our thoughts, our pain, our emotional wounds lay out the map each of us needs to follow to be whole as genuine, authentic individuals. Do you know anyone else who has the same wounds you do? No, their path is specific, custom-made to their needs. That is because each of us is unique. 

So, what can you do for yourself to find your gifts, your talents, your uniqueness? What does your brain tell you? What do you think your path would be if you added gratitude to your life?",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9698986411094666}"

It has not been easy, so hard at times all I wanted was a drink but I did not have one.  2020 has tested me to the limit ...the death of my father, my dog to cancer, my job and my best friend due to COVID and my 7 year relationship ended. I have gained EVERYTHING ... my self worth, self respect and self love back, my health. a new career,  loss of  negativity and toxic things in life and genuine happiness.  I have also saved $7,780 as of today.. I put away $20 a day (average of what I normally spent on Happy Hour at the bar, beer or wine at home). I figured if I would willingly spend that money on booze why not save it.   
I used every excuse ... (wine with dinner is fine, oh just a few beers, sure lets have a shot .. we are celebrating!, OK sure moderation is fine...blah blah blah). I finally had to accept the fact that once I started drinking... I could not stop.  Alcohol was not allowed to touch my lips anymore no matter what. After trying many times to stop the past few years because I felt I HAD to ... I hit the realization that I finally  WANTED to on my 55th birthday.   
Watching that money build to sure is aHUGE help! I am planning my dream trip to New Zealand once the COVID restrictions pass with my savings.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

Good morning, my lovely friends,

&#x200B;

I remember seeing posts here where this one member would share what they were listening to that day. I loved that peek into their world, and a chance to listen to something new. It made this place feel more real, less like a random corner of reddit. It gave me a boost of confidence to share some of my life here, and I'm so grateful for that little push, and my confidence has grown in ways I find almost impossible to describe... but I can tell I've grown, and it's very satisfying.

&#x200B;

At some point last month, I realized that I hadn't seen their posts in a while... the sinking black pit of dread opened up beneath me, and I took a deep breath, and tried to find them. I finally said to myself ""Well, oh shit, I have no way to know if they're okay or not. This fucking sucks so hard. Maybe they're just in the hospital... I'm sure they're fine, everything is okay, everything is fine, and \*even if it isn't, there's not a damn thing you can do about it\* Fuck."" 

&#x200B;

I found out a bit ago that one of my earliest supporters... and the one who called me out on my alcoholic bullshit in no uncertain terms... passed away and it's had me thinking about loss. I was reminded of the advice from another old timer ""Buy a suit. There's a lot of funerals..."" I appreciated his unvarnished suggestion, and damn if he wasn't right. Echoes of the 3 Drinkers Outcomes (or whatever they called this trio...) play in my mind \*jails, institutions, or death\*... I might not escape death forever, but the jails and institutions I'd really like to avoid. Quitting drinking upped those odds quite nicely that I shall remain a free Fox. 

&#x200B;

The work we do here is vital to our success in sobriety. This is not a ""1-2-3 hurrah I'm cured!!"" kind of deal (yet...) so sometimes we hit a ""high bottom"" and question the validity of choosing to abstain, sometimes we hit a bottom so low it kills us, sometimes we keep staggering through life ""moderating"" or ""functionally"" pickled leaving a trail of wreckage, sometimes we rack up countless day 1s, sometimes we put down the bottle and never return to it, and sometimes we never have a day 1.

 We all share, to varying degrees, at least one common core idea: drinking for us, the drunks and drinkers, is life or death.

&#x200B;

You do matter.

You are loved.

And you never have to do this alone.

&#x200B;

it started casually enough, a few beers with friends on the weekends when i was 18. As time went on i moved to liquor and harder partying with blackouts and questionable behavior here and there. i figured it was normal since i was young. it was fun being 21 and going out to bars and clubs, or just getting a few drinks with dinner.

it went on like that until i was 25, when i tore cartilage in my ribs. it was the worst pain i‚Äôve ever experienced. i lived by myself in a one bedroom apartment and i started drinking tequila after work to numb myself. then it was a shot before work. then it was a shot on my lunch break since i lived 5 minutes away from my job. i didn‚Äôt see the problem because i was functioning like a ‚Äúregular‚Äù person.

i got my first DUI and things really started to spiral. Soon after i lost my job and had to move back in with my parents. I didn‚Äôt learn my lesson and got my second DUI a few months later. I ended up going to jail for 36 days and then another 4 months of house arrest. there were legal fees and court-ordered group therapy sessions. when all that was over i still continued to drink.

I‚Äôll be 28 in january. this year really kicked my ass. it started with me moving in with my girlfriend and getting the best job i‚Äôve ever had. things were looking up. i lost my job back in march, and the quarantine had me drinking all day. it put such a strain on my relationship that she broke up with me after almost three years of being by my side through all my hard times.

i‚Äôm back home with my parents, again. I still hadn‚Äôt learned. i wound up in two different psych wards because of my secret drinking at home. i‚Äôm ready now, and i know it won‚Äôt be easy. i‚Äôm tired of feeling sick and i‚Äôm tired of disappointing my family and friends.

First time in my adult life making it a year.  I have been wanting to stop drinking for the last 10 years or so. I have had a few dry months here are there since then, but I never worked a program and would eventually burn out from resentments. I just couldn't stand other people who were drinking when I was not.    

More than a year ago, I moved to a new city by myself. Alone, I spent many nights at the bars whenever I could, drinking too much. This led to a very unstable period of my life where I was drinking more frequently than I ever had and was genuinely worried about losing the job that brought me to this new city. I remember waking up with the shakes, which was the first time for me. My hands and body in general had less functionality.  And it all felt like a bad dream. One night I got really drunk and got really high. I got myself so disoriented that when I got up to go to the bathroom I stumbled uncontrollably and crashed into a window. Luckily my shoulder hit the window, breaking it, and I somehow just bounced off the window with no injuries.  This was my wake up call.   

That night really shook me up. For a couple of weeks in meditation, it was hard to not think of how close I came to a disaster as any part of my body could have hit that window. I started working a Buddhist-based recovery program before eventually making it to AA. Got a sponsor, worked the steps, did a lot of therapy. 

Life is far from perfect now, but at least it is much more manageable. I feel like my brain is emerging from the grips of alcohol. It is so much easier to read and comprehend. Or sit there and listen to someone and be present. It is also really interesting to see how I am not reacting so strongly to what I do not like.  I used to get in so many petty dramas with friends, family, ex-partners, whoever. My anger would get the best of me and I would say ignorant or malicious things. Crazy enough, I was usually convinced that I was right, too, even though I was the common denominator. Now, I try and spend more time understanding how I feel rather than react adversely to something I  don't like. Sure, I still make slips and say things I regret. But, it feels much different to sit with some issue and try and communicate how you feel in a way that is truthful and compassionate.

I can‚Äôt explain the weight that is being lifted as I speak, and I feel like getting sober was one of the first steps down this new path. I have even been able to stop smoking weed for the last several months as part of this pursuit, literally the worst drug I have these days is the caffeine in my coffee. I am finding more and more that these aren‚Äôt needed, and now that I am getting out of my current career field I have even less anxiety.

I‚Äôm not sure if I have a message coming through with all of this, but just know, you may find something you weren‚Äôt looking for if you go sober for a year. A year, that was what I initially set out for, but nowadays I just try to think about it one day at a time.

You fine fine fine people of this community for helping me through a very difficult time.

Observations:

Sleep experience will vary.  Some nights are sleepless.  Some instances you sleep so deep the world shuts off.  

I started to eat better almost immediately.  Instantly cut off the fast food.  On the second day I was already craving green leafy stuffs, veggies and less red meat.  I had red meat almost daily.  This week I only had one meal that contained red meat.  Proteins was fish, chicken and turkey.  Very little pork.

I'm much less tired and can carry on the entire day without feeling too sleepy.  Not entirely, if it's a boring webinar it's tough to keep the eyes open.

My bowels are happier.  hehe!!

Way more motivation and concentration levels are deepening.  I'm able to soak in what I read easier.  The kitchen is clean daily.  I will actually cook breakfast, lunch and dinner and the kitchen gets cleaned immediately after every meal.  I know I know.....I should have been doing that to begin with, but drinking would have me saying, ""meh, it can wait till later""

Emotions were out of whack, big times.  Not so bad the first couple of days but right smack in the middle of this thing, I had a really really hard time.  Thank you again to you supporters that helped me through it!!!  Then I had a really really high day.  I was in a great freaking mood the entire day.  Then these last couple of days it kind of evened out.

What I've learned:

Sleep when your body tells you.  A couple of afternoons the sleepiness is so intense that I have to sleep.  No other way around it.  But, it's only a nap.  Truly a nap of around 15 minutes.  Helps take that edge off, and not so much that it won't allow me to sleep at night.

When dealing with highs and lows another redditor here suggested to remember when you are high, try not to be too high.  When you're feeling low, try your best to avoid the triggers that push you into a downward spiral.

I found out that I may need some vitamin supplements.  Being that I'm over 50 I should have already been doing that.  But, just know, how ever old or young you are, you may need to start to take vitamins here in the beginning of your journey.

I learned that sticking to a routine is easier.  I've always wanted to learn to meditate.  I've started breathing exercises in the morning and throughout the day when I can.  I believe that this is helping a lot.

Anyway, I just wanted to share a couple of things with you.  Really to keep track of my progress, but maybe it will help someone out there.

I'm happy that I made it all 7 days.  On to number 8.  Goodnight all.  Love you!!

2020-11-15 21:17:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/juyluc/weekend_warrior/,Weekend warrior,"First time post here, but I think it‚Äôs time. So I‚Äôm tired of being the weekend binge alcoholic. I know that alcoholism isn‚Äôt black and white, there are so many shades of grey and types of alcoholism, and you can‚Äôt just lump it all into one general category. I‚Äôve been sugarcoating it in my brain for years and allowing myself to believe that since I don‚Äôt feel the need to drink daily, that I am just not an official alcoholic. Well that‚Äôs a crock. I may not drink during the week but what good is that if I drink a week‚Äôs worth of alcohol every Saturday? And refer to Sunday as my hangover day? 
Today I‚Äôm so hungover that I‚Äôve legit been in bed all day. Its been gorgeous outside and I have so many things I could be doing, but I‚Äôm laid up in bed like an invalid, not even able to eat bec I thought it was a good idea to stay up til 4am drinking. It‚Äôs disgusting and I‚Äôm so tired of it. I turned 39 on Friday (not that I needed a birthday to justify a drunk weekend). I really want my last year of my 30‚Äôs to be one I‚Äôm proud of. I have so many goals and I am an ambitious person but my weekend benders set me back. They‚Äôre taking all of the progress that I make in a week and pushing it backwards so that I have to start over again, the next week. Like my weight and health, specifically. It keeps me from exercising and eating well and doing my art and all kinds of things that I truly enjoy and gain happiness from doing. And for what...one day of drinking to achieve a state of false happiness? 
It takes until about tues or Wednesday every week to really feel my energy levels getting back to normal from my Saturday binge (I certainly don‚Äôt bounce back as quickly as I did in my 20‚Äôs). And I even say to myself, hey, this is it, I‚Äôm done with this, but by the time Friday night rolls around I‚Äôm already thinking ‚Äúyay tomorrow is beer day...‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôd sure enjoy a scotch right now...‚Äù I‚Äôve tried moderation and while sometimes it‚Äôs successful, it‚Äôs certainly difficult for me to achieve a ‚Äúnormie‚Äù amount of drinking without taking it to the next level. It‚Äôs nearly impossible actually. To the point where I don‚Äôt even drink unless I know I can tear down hard. There‚Äôs no in between for me anymore. Never was, I suppose. 
So I guess what I‚Äôm doing is saying that I‚Äôm ready to commit to not drinking anymore. I‚Äôm too scared to say that I‚Äôll never drink again, I WANT to be able to say that, but I feel that I‚Äôm not quite there yet. I do want to get there tho. I really want it. 

Starting small...I am saying this: I will not drink next wknd. I will make that vow. And I will go from there. One weekend at a time. I want to experience a Sunday like a normal healthy happy human being. I‚Äôll let y‚Äôall know how it goes.

But I think my issue has always been something much sneakier.  Disordered drinking is probably the best way I can put it. I'm sad?  Have a glass of wine.  Stressed? Glass of wine. Bored? Glass of wine? Afterall, I'm a 40-something white woman. Wine is my birthright. 

Except it was never just a glass of wine. It was a bottle. Or more depending what I had on hand. We have a wine rack that I used to keep full. But during quarantine i found it was just too easy to go grab a bottle in the evening. I have nothing else to do! I don't really have to ""get up"" for work in the morning anymore since I've been working from home since March. Why not have some wine? So i stopped keeping it around the house thinking easy accessibility was the issue. Except I didn't stop buying bottles one at a time every time I was at a gas station, or got groceries or was out for any other reason.  And I started to notice during the day that my mood would be improved if I knew I had a nice bottle of rose chilling in the fridge waiting for me when I finished working. 

I just don't want to live like that anymore. A bottle of wine shouldn't be my motivation for getting through the day. Mostly I just want to prove to myself that I don't need alcohol to have a fun and fulfilling life - something that I have believed since I was 14 and took my first drink. 30 years of disordered drinking.

Most of the people I play golf with were there along with girlfriends and wives. Before I quit drinking I was probably the biggest drinker of the group. When we played golf, people knew im the one who had a flask full of crown and extra beers in my bag. So I show up later to the party. The party started at 8am this morning. I arrived about 11am on purpose. Sure enough there's plenty of food and tons of whiskies and beer. Everyone is buzzed and having a good time. Hardly anyone is watching golf because DJ is running away with it so people are just having fun. Shots were taken everytime someone had to use the restroom. If you walked by the coolers you had to get someone a beer. They were having a blast. Couple of hours later a guy shows up with 3 girls he met at a local bar. The girls were not shy is how I will put it nicely. The party went from a 6 on the party scale to a 9. They immediately started bartending and making drinks for everyone. I'd be lying if I didn't think about breaking my streak and joining the fun but I persisted and was successful in keeping my sobriety. The urge to drink didn't last long and I was  actually able to have a good time without getting hammered. Day 26 in the bag.

I wasn't sure where I belonged, and didn't think I was at the point of joining AA..but  I wanted to find a support group. 

I'm 32/f, newly divorced with 50/50 custody of a 2.5 year old little girl. Ive always drank, socially and alone. It has caused issues throughout my life, but surprisingly nothing legally or otherwise super dangerous to my health other than depression and alcohol making it worse.

I liked to say I was a wino, and would enjoy 2 to 3 glasses a night a night if I was drinking. A could go a few days without drinking any, but liked to relax with a glass. Im pretty active and go to the gym 3 to 4 times a week. Ive been trying to date again recently and I've found that has thrown my drinking into overdrive. A glass or two getting ready, probably 2 to 3 drinks on the date, and then depending on the mood when I got home, even more drinks then. The next day was always a hangover. 

I didn't think I really had an issue, and that I could cut it off anytime I wanted. Thats what I told myself at least. At least 4 or 5 times in the last couple months, I have drank OVER 2 bottles of wine at home by myself. Sometimes I wouldn't even remember and would just see the empty bottles the next day. Ive called out of work due to hangovers.

There was a guy I was seeing recently. He knew I had a wine membership and had ordered 8 bottles of wine, one night he was coming over to drink a bottle with me. I had to go to total wine and I bought 4 bottles of wine because I had already drank the 8 bottles in a 2 week span and didn't want him knowing.
I'm so sick of it all. I have depressive tendencies and I find when I get drunk, I start having irrational thoughts. Thoughts that I'm worthless, thoughts that nobody cares..thoughts that my husband left me, and no one would ever love me. 

Last week I snapped. Im over this, its not healthy. Its not ok. Its not normal. I admitted to myself, and my therapist and a few close people that I have a problem. 

Id like to try 30 days at least. Swearing off completely seems like I'd just be setting myself up to fail. I'm not sure where dating would fit into this, since its so nerve-wracking to begin with and EVERYTHING is so focused on alcohol.

I first posted here about a week ago, and I have not had a drop of alcohol since that time. Overall it's been a little strange, but I've been mostly OK. Anxiety has been a little higher than normal, kind of hard to get to sleep, a few times I've had thoughts of drinking but have been successful at swatting them down. And actually last night I did dream about drinking, but read here that's apparently normal. 

But now, I'm more tempted to drink again than I have been in the last five days. What brought it on is that I just learned that an ex-girlfriend of mine (who left me in part because of my drinking) is now engaged to another guy. It's been a couple years, I thought I'd moved on from her, but still it hurts a bit. And even though I rationally know drinking is the last thing I should do in response to this, as I don't ever want to lose someone again because I can't control my drinking, part of me still is highly tempted to get a drink right now. And it feels harder than it was before to fight that.

So I guess my question is, how do you do it? When and if a stressor or ""trigger"" comes up in your life that makes you want to reach for the bottle, what kind of self-control mechanism do you use to stop yourself? Is there something else you do as an alternative, something that scratches that itch? Do you just try to tough it out? Does it get easier over time?

I drank way, way too much Friday night.

It was a year of a lot of hurt, and I drank to cope. The following year, I changed jobs because I was hugely unhappy as a high school teacher and there was not a middle school job available. I ended up teaching online and it was a high stress job with deadlines, quotas for student contact and communication. I felt a lot of pressure to meet deadlines - homework graded, tests graded. Instant gratification trying to meet the needs of over 200 students, and I was the only 6th grade math teacher. I realized I was drinking almost everyday again, and I set myself a goal to not drink during the week. That Monday was a DOOZY. At that point, I pretty much had my son 100% of the time except for one night a week. I verbalized to someone in passing, ""I am trying not to drink during the week."" They said, ""You picked the wrong day to do that!""

That was not the only time I was given permission to drink as a teacher or a mom. Hell, I was encouraged to drink to cope with a hard day of teaching. When they found out I was the single mother of two, ""Oh my god! I would be drinking, too!"" How did one meet people or go on dates? At a bar or restaurant of course. I had a built in babysitter with a 13 year old daughter. But, it never went beyond 2 or 3 and I never blacked out. I remember going to bed. I remember conversations and hanging out with my kids. I only went out once or twice a week and I really didn't drink at home. But, this is when I started using alcohol to relax. 

And this is how I explained it to Brayden today. Was I an alcholic? According to what I think of as an alcoholic - drinking morning to night, starting my morning with a drink, drinking at work, I was not. Did I use alcohol to relax or cope with my anxiety? Yes. Did I need it to relax or relieve my anxiety? Yes. That is when my problem with drinking started. I explained to Brayden this afternoon that alcohol is a drug. People can drink and it be just fine, but when you start using it for a purpose of something else than just a drink, that is when you have a problem.  If I had waited till I was an alcoholic or what I and society deems an alcoholic, I would have lost my job and my children and my relationships. Those of you that have been reading this blog for a while know that I was on my way to that just that - losing my job and my family. I had done a number on my relationships and am rebuilding them. 

In 2017, when my job was awful, I left that job because I was using drinking to cope. I had gotten blind drunk at the bar and don't remember getting home because I was dealing with the trauma of my physical safety being compromised in the school where I was teaching. I could change the job, but it wasn't the drinking that was the problem. It was the stress of the job. 

After I left, my drinking improved. Then it became daily and my way to cope with the stress of being a mom and a teacher. It didn't help that my relationships after my divorce were with heavy drinkers, and we hung out and drank at bars. I left that relationship because it was the relationship and the other person that was the problem, not the drinking. 

But, I was drinking, a lot. I couldn't go get my nails done without my diet coke being spiked with whiskey. I deserved to relax and enjoy that hour for my toes and nails, but I couldn't relax without that drink. It had been that way with me and my nails getting done for a couple of years at that point. That spring, I drank so much and became so dehydrated, that I had alcohol poisoning. I had lost so many fluids that I had to go to an IV bar (yes, those are a thing) and get an IV to recovery from that hangover. 

I reevaluated and quit drinking for two weeks. I was doing great, and then that Thursday night, my student's mom was murdered in their house while they were there. And I couldn't handle the grief. My other student had found his sibling when their brother had committed suicide. That caused me PTSD from when I had lost my student the year before to suicide in the same way. By the time we got to that Friday, I couldn't figure out another way to get through that day. I deserved to drink after those two weeks. I can see myself sitting on that bar patio, talking to my good friend, and coping by drinking. I can remember the decision to drink the drink that was placed before me. 

I spoke to my doctor for the first time about my drinking in the summer of 2019 medication appointment. I stopped short of getting help because I was a teacher and a mom. I couldn't admit I had a drinking problem. I didn't drink in the mornings. I never got that drunk again that I needed IVs. I could handle this. I didn't get help. 

I did find Emotion Code. And I used that therapy to help with my daily drinking and things did improve. There is a book on Amazon that goes into the therapy more in depth, and if people ask, maybe I will write more on that because it has played a huge role in my recovery. But, I was with someone new where a lot of what we did was hang out and drink. I never felt comfortable drinking at home and only drank at the bar. It was only two or three. It didn't matter it was everyday after school. I deserved that me time. These are all things I said to myself as I used alcohol everyday to unwind. I was a better mom because I decompressed and didn't go to my son all stressed out from teaching. My new job (3rd school in three years) was amazing and I was crushing it as a teacher. But, I was still drinking everyday. So it wasn't the job. I thought I had it under control. Then, Covid hit. 

I began drinking everyday being stuck at home. The district turned teaching over to a platform and all I did was check for assignment completion. I was going stir crazy. I started experiencing my daughter withdrawing from me naturally as she graduated from college and was no longer dependent on me. This caused an identity crisis, and I didn't know where I fit in her life. This was a huge source of anxiety. Drinking caused me to forget that I had committed to be there for Sean one morning to give him a ride from the mechanic. And that caused a huge rift in our relationship. I blamed being overwhelmed with school and commitments. No way it could've been because I was drinking when he asked. 

These are the beginnings to everything unraveling in July. My unease and unsettling of my relationship with my daughter contributed to the anxiety I was feeling as I left her on her birthday putting me in an anxiety ridden alcohol state at the 4th of July party I wrote about last week. My therapist calls alcohol anxiety in a bottle. Laura McKowen says drinking is like pouring gasoline on your anxiety. 

The night of Brayden's birthday,  I left to drink is because I was feeling anxiety about the rebourgeoning of my relationship with Sean. I felt I needed to be there to assure him I am there for him too. That night went sideways, and I came home drunk to my son after friends dropped me off at home. I can still see my son's face when he asked me, ""Why did you go to the bar on my birthday?"" Bottom line, I felt anxiety about maintaining all of my relationships and only alcohol could make that better. That is what my addict brain thought. It took a weekend of drinking and failed attempts at moderation for me to realize, not I cannot moderate. I cannot be who I am when I am drunk anymore. And like I posted last week on my personal Facebook page, ""I quit drinking because I like sober me better than drunk me,"" The end. If I had waited till I was the alcoholic portrayed in AA, I would have lost everything. 

The question I ask myself is, ""What if I had listened to my brain and heart any of these other times I knew I had a problem with my relationship with alcohol?"" What if you listened to yours? You don't have to wait for the quintessential rock bottom. Nothing says you have to have a rock bottom to pick up your toys and go home when it comes to alcohol.",4,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981091022491455}"

I live with bipolar II and my paranoia is out of control today. I'm terrified, and I'm worried that my brain is turning to literal mush. I had lockjaw this morning. I've felt awful all day.

It reminds me of why I started wearing a bike helmet. I rode around the city for years, no helmet. I'd been in a number of accidents, and had my fair share of close calls, but always came out okay. Until one day, I decided to carry my lock over my handlebars. The lock slipped down, jammed my wheel to the side, and I careened into a parked car, denting it with my bare head. I couldn't blame anyone else; I couldn't blame bad drivers, or roadwork, or rain. It was my fault, and I needed to protect myself from myself.

Not because I drank but because I can‚Äôt drink. Because I can‚Äôt control it. I was thinking about our family holiday plans coming up, a trip we (optimistically) have planned for next Spring, and just a pretty fall weekend in general that seemed to beg for golf course beers and patio margaritas. 

And then this morning I hopped up at 6am to go meet some friends for 18 while my wife was still sacked, completely hungover from cocktails with a couple girlfriends. Got home around lunch to her still on the couch, dying. I grabbed the kiddo, went to pick up the groceries, took some to my father-in-law, washed both cars, meal prepped for my week, and made dinner for my daughter. 

I am now relaxed on the couch feeling really tired in the greatest I-accomplished-a-ton-and-am-tired-because-of-a-productive-and-active-weekend and not because of making really stupid, shitty choices. 

I realize I need to work on acceptance of my condition. The last time around when I went nine months, that did remain something that popped up on occasion - always in anticipation of things on the horizon that were typically times for me to really throw em back. 

But days like today and yesterday really highlight just how fulfilling a life I can lead without reaching for the bottle. And rather than simply surviving while somehow telling myself the godawful hangovers were worth it for all the ‚Äúfun‚Äù I had, I am instead thriving as a husbandX dad, and friend. I will take that.

I'll say this, I would have a LOT more money in savings were it not for the price of my addiction.

The hardest of which was realising I was in a codependent relationship with my closest friend who decided to ignore me as punishment for not drinking at her party (and not giving her the heads up that I wasn‚Äôt drinking). 

But with the help of my therapist, close friends and boyfriend, I have been able to work at being a happier version of myself that is honest to herself.

One thing nobody tells you about going sober is, how real everything starts to feel. When I was drinking and doing drugs, I had anxiety and panic attacks but it was often buried in a hazy cloud of substances. Now I really have to sit in the feelings and accept that I am prone to over thinking and fits of irrational panic (and that‚Äôs fine).

The greatest, albeit, shocking revelation was when my therapist helped me realise that contrary to my beliefs, I have very low self esteem. Not the kind that presents itself as a body dysmorphia or thinking I‚Äôm not attractive enough etc. But, the kind that has you making snide internal comments like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre really useless/ annoying‚Äù and ‚Äúno one will ever really want to know you/ you‚Äôre not very interesting as you are‚Äù.

I quit 3 and a half weeks ago and I was not drinking enough to experience any physical symptoms of withdrawal, but mentally it is a BITCH. I know I have alcoholism and dementia and cancer in my family, but that doesn‚Äôt feel like enough of a deterrent when I‚Äôm craving a drink, if that makes sense, because all my family members drank WAY more than I did and could not control how much they drank. I don‚Äôt understand it. They would pick up a drink and it would be game over, whereas with me I HATE feeling ill so I would never ever drink beyond my predetermined limits I set years ago. I never developed a tolerance either, the limits stayed the same. So I feel like all I got from drinking personally was less anxiety and no negative effects. I struggle to keep myself on track because I can‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt miss it, I miss everything about it.

The opiates have never been a constant thing, I'd abuse them for a while and then stop for a long time and back at it. I'm now withdrawing from abusing a prescription I had and I'm really scared about the way I'm feeling, I'll explain in a sec.

&#x200B;

I have pretty much drunk every night for 5 years. Sure I'd take some days off every now and then but I'd normally go 4-5 nights in a row, sometimes more and take a day off. I've tried to stay away from hard liquor so I mainly drink IPA's, but I'm sort of fooling myself cause I buy 9% beer, so I drink 5 of those and it's equivalent to 9 drinks smh. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, I've been trying to quit for a long time, with no real success. I've noticed I begin feeling anxiety after 7-8 pm if I don't start drinking, I know it's all in my head. I don't get shakes or anything. But basically I freak out because I've gotten used to drinking at that time of the day. I've been better the past 2-3 months, I've managed to drink every other night and then taking 3-4 days off a lot too. 

But let me explain why I'm so scared of how I'm feeling. I've never understood how people can drink during the day, and in reality I still don't. I still think I'd never do that but I do now understand how they feel, I'm betting people feel this anxiety I am feeling right now. See, with opiates I would be high ALL day, so now that I'm off them and plan on never touching them again I have this horrible anxiety going on, during the day. I don't know what to do with myself, the thought of time going by scares me, like it does at night when I don't drink. I'm in the middle of a mild wd so I know this anxiety is opiate induced.

See my fear is that one day I will feel that same anxiety I feel the nights I don't drink, but during the day. I had never even thought of that as a possibility, till now. I used to be completely fine waiting till 7-8 pm to drink, it didn't bother me one bit, I could still enjoy my day and everything was fine. Now, I'm struggling, because of the fucking opiates. I keep on thinking, I can be awake from 10 am to 8 pm and be completely fine, no anxiety, but after 8pm if I don't drink I freak out, it just makes no sense.

My experience with being sober for a week has led to some subtle but very beneficial changes to me. 

- The first noticeable change is that my confidence is back! In the past month when my drinking hit an all time high I was feeling anxious very often and I felt far more insecure about things than I normally do. This was very strange for me as I‚Äôm normally a very confident person but I am happy to say that this personality trait is slowly coming back and I feel far less anxious and insecure about things after one week. 

- My eyes are slowly beginning to look less tired. I‚Äôve been on a relatively routine sleep schedule this past week and it‚Äôs really helped my complexion and most notably the dark bags under my eyes. It‚Äôs a small difference but it‚Äôs noticeable. 

- I feel far more awake and mentally alert. This used to be one of my favorite qualities about myself was my wittiness in social situations but during my peak drinking last month I sort of lost that edge and my brain just felt like it was stuck in a fog bank. 

- No feeling of anger. I‚Äôm a pretty chill guy and typically don‚Äôt get angry very often however in the past month I‚Äôve had two very angry public outbursts that have cost me friendships and a relationship and after a week I can already tell that my spirits are up a bit more than previous weeks. This is probably due to me feeling less anxious and less insecure about things.

2020-11-15 11:54:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/juozu4/our_cosmic_comedy/,Our cosmic comedy ...,"I read a story recently in this sub from a man whose brother drank himself to death during the pandemic. As he described his drinking habit I was frightened as if I'd just been nearly hit by a car. And then again I was relieved because I'd been¬†doing the same thing but stopped. I started this journey of sobriety one month into the pandemic on April 15th. Somehow I'm still on this road 7 months later.

It's not that my drinking habits were remotely close to what I'd say are normal prior to the pandemic, but I was¬†functional. I lost my job on March 13th and started writing from home the next day. But with the new found freedom I started drinking non-stop. At first, as you'll remember, many on social media were talking about day drinking all the time. There were memes everywhere and after two weeks it was dangerously normal for me.

I began slugging vodka straight out of the bottle in the mornings prior to having my coffee. And the rest of the days were downhill from there.¬†

I'd been a heavy drinker all of my life but this was the first time I'd felt utterly hopeless and afraid. I'd come to accept that all my childhood dreams were never meant to be. I felt deeply sad for that little boy because he deserved better.

It was a fight with my wife that ultimately pushed me over my edge leading me to¬†get honest with myself for the first time. I admitted to myself that I was an alcoholic while sitting with a can of Heineken in my hand next to the Mississippi river.

I honestly don't know what made it click this time but I did do something a little different. Over the years I'd done stints of 30 days every now and then but I'd always had these time frames that I was operating under. When I made it to the goal I'd drink in celebration and carry on because I thought I'd proved to myself that I had a handle on things. I mean if I could go 30 days, then I could quit whenever I wanted. Or so I thought.

What's different this time was that I didn't give myself any rules other than I was not going to drink for 1 day. I couldn't handle the thought of committing to a lifetime of something. It felt too big. Thinking about it, I doubt I'd have made seven months if I set out with that as a goal.

On this journey I've allowed it to be open ended which technically means I could drink at some point if I wanted to. But I don't anymore. I've picked up too¬†many treasures along the way.

I never went to AA and I've kept my journey private so far. I told my brother a couple days ago, but up until then only my wife and children knew. I've chimed in on this sub a few times; and reading it has given me hope and wisdom along the way. It has helped me so much to know that I'm not alone. And instead of drinking poison, now I read books relentlessly - like I did when I was young.

I suppose the only right way is the one that works for you.

Not drinking during an election year in the middle of a pandemic has been a wild ride. And with the utmost respect, I honor each and every one of you wherever you may be on your journey in our cosmic comedy. To me I've found the pull of drinking to gradually diminish; while navigating my emotions becomes the bigger task. In searching myself I've learned that avoiding them was the root of my addiction. Whatever yours may be, I cheer you on as you grow in the knowledge of who you really are. \~ J

I'd been thinking about quitting for a long time, but this particular day finally did it for me.

It wasn't a bad day. Nothing traumatic happened. There was no straw that broke the camel's back. We had actually had a really good, fun day as part of a Florida beach camping trip. We'd ridden our bikes mid-morning about 8 or 9 miles from the campground to the first restaurant/bar with football games on TV, where we sat and pre-gamed waiting on Auburn-Georgia. Now and then we'd walk out onto the back deck to enjoy the sun, wind, beach and ocean views. Or perhaps next door to the gift shop. I was never without a beer in my hand. It has always been beer for me, not any other type of alcohol.

My friends know I'm a bit obsessive compulsive about anything I do... I've ridden my bike over 30,000 miles in the past 7 years or so. ... When I discovered craft beer in Austin, Texas, in 2002, I had to try every different one I could find. Then I started brewing my own. I got to where I'd brew 4 different styles in one brew day. I entered competitions and ended up winning Mid-South Master Brewer of the Year.

... all-or-nothing ... can be a good thing, can be a bad thing...

We sat at the bar and watched the game that day. Yuengling was the best craft beer they had, but I didn't care. I told the bartender to keep them coming.

I didn't remember the bike ride back to the campground. This is what had been bothering me most lately...¬†

""A rapid rate of increase in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is most consistently associated with the occurrence of an alcoholic blackout.""

""An alcoholic blackout may be complete (en-bloc) or partial (fragmentary, or grayout). An en bloc blackout is complete amnesia for significant events otherwise memorable under usual circumstances. The defining characteristic of a complete blackout is that memory loss is permanent and cannot be recalled under any circumstances. Fragmentary blackouts occur more frequently. In fragmentary blackouts, recall is usually possible and can be aided by cueing. Although initially the subject may be unaware that memory is missing, reminders usually help the subject remember forgotten events.""

I wasn't a daily drinker. I'd had a doctor explain to me one time that the body needs 4 or 5 days or so after drinking alcohol to flush toxins out of the liver. So my pattern was generally that. My dad died with jaundice in his eyes and a liver blistered with cancer. I guess I thought my liver would be ok.

But the real problem is that when I did... I'd drink too much, and the not remembering was becoming more frequent. .. It was a very bad feeling.

For a long while, I had been following r/stopdrinking, and many of the stories told there resonated with me in a big way... I was also inspired by IBTAT on youtube. He'd hit rock bottom several years prior, quit cold turkey and began long distance hiking. This guy was a total bad ass, and he wasn't diminished a bit to admit that that he couldn't live with alcohol. He is still a huge inspiration to me.

Back at the campground, in the middle of the night, I went for a very long walk. Racked with regret and self loathing... scared.

I got on my knees and prayed for help.

My life is much better today, without alcohol. I generally feel better. I sleep better. I remember. I'm accomplishing more constructive things at home in my free time. There's so much less heartache.

I still have regrets about the stupid things I've done and said. I still have cravings now and then, especially when I see my biking buddies gathered, and I can't hang. But the cravings do pass.

I can't say I'll never fail, because as soon as I do, I will. But I'd really hate to set that counter back to zero. Seems like such a trivial thing... the counter widget on my homescreen... but seeing that number continue to increase means alot to me.

I'm thankful to my wife for not drinking along with me. No doubt, it makes it much easier for me than it would be otherwise.

My poison of choice is Vodka Martini's, shaken, not stirred, with a couple of olives and a teaspoon of brine.  I never desire one of those, or anything else before 5-6PM, and if I make it to a third, I don't stop until I eat a big meal or am asleep.  There used to be a lot of nights I never had that third one but with un-employment, lockdown, and watching the decline of a housebound parent with dementia for whom I'm the primary caretaker, I've been slipping deeper down the hole.  Because I'm not a day drinker, I didn't consider myself an alcoholic until recently, and that thought that I could not remember the last totally sober day struck me.  

I resolved myself that I would not drink the next day.  I'm not a very religious person, but I begged God for help when I went to sleep that night.  I thought of how much my mother depends on me, how much I love my daughter, my girlfriend, and even my Ex-wife who I remain very good friends with.  Low and behold, I did it, and it wasn't to terribly difficult.  No withdrawal, just tired because I didn't sleep much that night thinking about it.

When I made up my mind I would quite drinking alcohol 100% of the time and I would do whatever it took to not drink again that is how it worked for me.  I decided and committed to the rule.  It was of course hard in the first couple of weeks but I stuck to it and didn‚Äôt decide anything else just that I would not drink 100% of the time.  I could do anything else that I wanted, eat whatever I wanted be lazy and watch whatever I wanted.  Go for walks and wake up early and feel good every day.  

When I started this on June 20th it was not easy at all.  My husband and I have a place up north where we party a lot with a bunch of different people.  Everyone drinks.  I didn‚Äôt tell anyone except my husband.  I walked around with a cup of power aid and just sat and listened and observed everyone else and thought I will feel good tomorrow.  A neighbor of ours I was talking to said ‚Äúwe made shots you have to try it you will love it‚Äù so he went and got one, game it to me and I looked at it and said ‚ÄúI think my husband would like this.  Not something my husband would really want I gave it to him and he drank it.

Anyway, my point is I decided a d committed it to my self.  Everyday I kept that promise the stinger I became mentally able to say no way do I want that poison anymore.  

I sure do hope this thought helps someone out there.

Alcohol lures you in, deceiving you into believing it‚Äôs the magic potion for social events and relaxation. It slowly but surely pulls you into its deadly embrace, all the while you‚Äôre completely oblivious to the true nature of the situation.

It slaps you around a bit and you feel physically horrible the next day, but you put up with it because you think you need it; you think that there‚Äôd be something lacking in your life if you didn‚Äôt have it. Therefore you indulge every single night, slowly but surely killing yourself at the hands of this poison. Eventually, you start to realize that this is happening, but it‚Äôs too late. 

You‚Äôre drawn in. Alcohol has virtually ruined your life, but you can‚Äôt walk away. The dopamine rush when you‚Äôre spending time with it feels so good, IT makes you feel so damn good.

It's that time again for Shape Up Sunday - the SD community thread where we can talk about our fitness & exercise goals, weight loss or anything else that helps us improve our physical and mental well being.

Getting into doing some form of exercise can be daunting if you have not done any for a long time. Many people who don't do any exercise are not lazy, many have a genuine fear and a feeling of dread at the very thought!

The fear of looking like an idiot I think is a big one and hard to overcome. I think the vast majority of people are very supportive of new comers to gyms or simply do not even notice or care. When I am out running or cycling I always nod or smile or say hello to other people out getting some exercise and from my experience most gyms are filled with people of all shapes and sizes and fitness levels who are there for the same common goal, to improve themselves. Some people are just arseholes though - whether they be on a bike, in a gym, driving a car or wherever. Ignore these people!

The fear of pain or injury. I think the best way to start is slowly, baby steps. The important thing is to build the habit and if you try do too much too quickly the chances are you will get put off. They way I see it is any increase in activity level is good no matter how small. Small increases in physical activity can positively impact your health and be accomplished by making minor lifestyle changes and by making minor lifestyle changes over time these will add up to bigger changes and new habits will form.

The fear of failure! Let's not set the bar too high or give ourselves un-realistic goals. We can be our own worst enemy when it comes to diet and exercise. Let's ditch the guilt and do our best. You have to start where you are, not where you want to be or where you once were. I have reset myself to zero so many times over the last 15 years and each time I start out I compare myself to where I was before which isn't helpful. I tell myself I may be out of shape again but I can always get myself back into shape. Always. All of us will have times when we stop exercising - it‚Äôs inevitable. We are where we are, it is what it is, even the longest journey started with a single step... that kind of stuff!

http://imgur.com/a/3u0aye5

You all have inspired me this week! I have read so many post of people who have been increasing their activity levels and feeling proud of themselves. Walking/hiking, yoga, couch to 5kers, running, biking, gyms, weights, home aerobics sessions.... well done everyone you have done awesome!

I was feeling kind of meh this week myself. This covid stuff is slowly grinding me down, constantly throwing curve balls at us. I've got customers with it, kids off school because of it and my wife's work place shut down due to it. My motivation for exercise has been low but seeing all you lot getting out there pushed me to get out and run and I always feel better afterwards. I have been trying to pay attention to the effect on my mood and stress levels before, during and post session and there is definitely a marked improvement on the days I do exercise to the days I do not. I have managed 4 runs - around 25 miles for the week and I'm trying to find a weather window in this drizzle we have going on to get out on the bike. It's windy too and I hate windy days on a bike! I've also been trying to purchase a turbo trainer to add to my indoor equipment but they are out of stock everywhere currently!

That's enough about me, let's find out what you have all been up to or are thinking of getting up to. If you have questions then ask them, there are no stupid questions and we have a wealth of knowledge and experience here in this community that is best shared.

Symptoms are constant dull pain in stomach, bloating, fluid retention, sweatiness, mental confusion, fatigue ..
**but no** signs of jaundice, itchy skin, nausea, vomiting,  swelling in legs or dark urine. 
  
Has been incredibly hard to fall asleep and just generally be comfortable due to the stomach pain which has been ongoing for appproximately 4 days. It all began after probably my biggest drinking session in years.   Been trying to wait the pain out because I am opposed to taking any pills as I understand all of it is an extra stressor on the liver. 

I know even if there are doctors here no one is going to give a diagnosis online especially with the lack of information, but I am just interested to see if this rings a bell for anyone. Also am interested in hearing peoples own stories regarding liver cirrhosis/alcoholic hepatitis, what symptoms you experienced, etc. 

I have gradually lessened my alcohol usage in the last 4-5 years to this year where it has remained constant at around 10std drinks a day with the occasional binge of 20+.
 Before I reset the badge I read now it says 1028 days next to my name, it's very discouraging to know that I have been attempting to kick this habit for that long, especially when 1028 days ago I distinctly remember having this exact thought.

I suppose this is the kick in the ass I needed to take this problem a little bit more seriously, it is demoralizing when I think back to having the same thought many times due to the buffet of other problems that have arisen in my personal life from alcohol abuse. 

Sometimes I wonder how much choice we really have over our lives and if willpower is only an illusion we experience when our lives are  either going smoothly or falling apart. 

Regardless, I hope IWNDWYT. Thanks for reading, let me know if you're interested in an update as i will go to the doctor on Monday.",15,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9944302439689636}"

Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning/evening lovely SD, and welcome to this week of DCIs, hosted by the excellent House of Fox!

""Honesty breaks the power of a secret."" 

&#x200B;

I've been trying to remember that saying for a while now... I figured sooner or later it would pop up in some ""Quit Lit"" or other lofty place with fancy credentials, or perhaps even somewhere in the amassed wisdom in the halls of SD postings. Nope, I stumbled across it during a lazy reading of a thread about midnight raviolis. The universe works in strange and wonderful ways, thank you, Great Magnet! 

&#x200B;

So, about that honesty... for me, it's knowing that I can be honest and deal with whatever may come of it. That the veil of booze no longer keeps me separate, a prisoner of secrets and lies, is a freedom I relish. Sure, it's not perfect, but as long as I'm still here and breathing, I've still got a chance to do this thing called living in recovery. It's a good place, and I hope I stay here a long time... because I just came back in from that other place not too long ago and surprise! it still stinks ""out there"".

But I am running into a problem.  I've researched a couple ways to taper.  The HAMS website says to reduce by 2 drinks a day until you are at zero.  I found another guy on YouTube who reduced by one a day, staying a certain levels sometimes for a few days based on comfort, eventually going to zero.

My challenge is this: these approaches seem to assume a person is doing all their drinking in one stint.  So maybe you start drinking at 5pm and then drink until bedtime.  But that is not my drinking pattern.  I drink mostly for help with sleep and I ALWAYS wake up in the middle of the night.  Drinking is the only thing that puts me back to sleep.  

So my typical day might be like this: wake up 4 hours after I went to sleep, maybe around 3am.  Have two doubles to put me back to sleep.  Wake up at 11am.  Have 3 - 5 glasses of wine throughout the day, just sipping and not very much at one time.  It will typically take me several hours to finish a bottle.  Then stop drinking until bedtime, when I have 2 - 3 more doubles to get to sleep.  So the trick is, when I start reducing units, where do I remove them from?  I've tried reducing the middle-of-the-night stuff and all it gets me is that I don't go back to sleep and now I have the worst of all worlds: I drank a little alcohol but don't get back to sleep so I am groggy all day.

Anyways, sorry for the big ramble but I just wondered if there was anyone out there who successfully eliminated middle of the night drinking while tapering?  I've actually thought that maybe the best thing to do during the taper is to make it a goal to eventually eliminate all other drinking *except* middle of the night...but then that's not really a great habit to cultivate and one of the reasons I want to quit completely it to try to heal my sleep schedule.

I was just fumbling around online and had a nice realization‚Äîtoday is 80 days for me, and I wasn't even really thinking about it. 

For what it's worth, I couldn't even go 80 minutes without thinking about a drink let alone that amount of days. Then one day, I stopped drinking. It took many years of pain and sorrow and eventually a final stop at rehab (and thankfully no further), but I stopped drinking and ended what had become less of a habit than an obsessive lifestyle that would have eventually led me to either death or jail, most likely. 

So today I want to make it clear that a number like 80 days‚Äîwhich would've seemed futile to me in my  worst moments of drinking‚Äî*is* possible, no matter how bad things might seem at this given moment in time. 

My last two pennies: This process/experience has not been miserable, intolerable or anything of the sort. I hesitate to say this (and this is my experience only), but it hasn't been ""difficult"" to remain sober given the immediate and continual daily benefits of remaining alcohol-free. My life has improved in effectively all areas, and though recovery hasn't been without its fair share of challenges and moments of discomfort, the lessons contained within are worth their weight in gold. I dare say I've learned more about myself in the past few months than I have in the past decade, and I owe it to my making the decision to cut booze out of my life. 

Casually recognizing that I have 80 days and greeting this notion with a subtle smile has been the reward of the week for me. It signifies in my mind that I am moving in the right direction and not simply ""white-knuckling"" it to stay sober. I'm not counting days quite like I was, but now, it's kind of like this streak that I don't want to break, like a video game or something.

I got this game as a gift from a friend and I found myself bringing it with me to every party! Drinkopoly, it's called, and It's so much fun, and it helps me drink a lot! To begin with, it was fun, but then I found myself drinking more and more and more, I'd pull out the game, draw a few cards, and soon I'd be naked in my home alone, all the cards gone through multiple times, multiple rounds around the board, and bottles of empty liquor around me. I was fired from my job because of it. I had to bring it to work, I couldn't go a day without going around the board at least once, and when my boss caught me doing it, he fired me on the spot. I find myself begging for money for more booze to play this game yet again. The more I play the more I enjoy it. My bills are coming up and I'm going to be evicted at this rate. I lashed out at my fianc√© the other day and she said that I'm not the man she fell in love with years ago and she left, blocked me, called off the wedding and said she never wanted to see me again.

I am through the first 48 hours without a drink and that's the longest I've made it in over a year. A year ago I made it one whole week and then immediately started day drinking daily afterwards. I'm in restaurant management so it isn't seen as any sort of big deal... but obviously it isn't healthy and has some sort of effect on my work, even if it goes unnoticed. I don't even know how many shots per day I'd have over quarantine... but once that ended I'd wake up to about 3-4, then wait until work was done to start up again with probably 8-12 shots before bed. The past 2 months I've made a conscious effort to only have 1-2 upon waking, then no more than 8 before bed. I decided to just stop 2 days ago. I've been offered drinks multiple times already, managed to say no just fine. I feel like I was mainly drinking because I get bored of doing the same routine every day (and it was something that started after I got off of painkillers, so definitely used it as a substitute.) 

I was scared of possibly having withdrawal symptoms,  but I haven't even had the shakes, which is a surprise because I'd get them part way through my day when I was still day drinking. My energy level is up and I slept like a baby last night (feel like I will tonight too.)

I'm sure it will get more difficult later at times, but for now I'm feeling good and positive about it. I don't want to drink myself to death and that's what I'll do if I keep that old act up. If I could quit painkillers like I did, I can definitely do this. 

My partner also drinks like a fish, and usually drinks more than I do. I am trying to get him to quit with me and just really hope he at least chooses to stick to staying cut down...

I was deeply depressed. I increased my antidepressant which only exacerbated the problem(s). I hated my existence, all the time, for months. I had intense suicidal thoughts for a few weeks that became very urgent and turned into plans. Nobody knew. It was very, very dark. One Tuesday morning I woke up, eyes swollen from crying myself to sleep. By some miracle, before I even sat up straight, I committed to the fact that I was going to get help by whatever means necessary. I called my best friend who left her office and took me to the hospital. That day is my day one.

It is so difficult for me to even fathom that two, three, four months ago all I wanted to do was die, that I woke up every day wishing I didn't exist.

I think the longest I've gone without drinking in the past 10 years is 5-7 days.

1. A lot of quit-lit and posts I see here make reference to the fact that alcohol doesn't, and never truly did taste good. This is not at all my experience. Beer is my poison of choice, and expensive, pretentious beer at that. Double IPAs brewed with lactose, vanilla, and fruit. Wine or whiskey barrel aged imperial stouts with coffee. Crushable, refreshing vienna lagers with a nice toasty finish. This has been a real struggle for me. I honestly miss the taste of alcohol.

2. I still have the desire to drink. I keep telling myself, just go a bit longer and then we'll try drinking again, but luckily the ""bit longer"" keeps getting longer. Recently the temptation has been greater. I've been single for about a year now, and have been full-time work from home for almost 2 years. To say it gets lonely is putting it lightly. I often go days without speaking to another human. My bedtime is as early as 8PM some days because I just have nothing better to do. With coronavirus tearing through the country, there's not much to look forward to these days.

3. The one thing that has kept me on track more than anything else is counting calories. I've been an on/off calorie counter for a few years, but have spent most of this year tracking. The amount of calories in beer is absolutely insane. There's a formula you can use to get a rough estimate: (2.5 * ABV%) * ounces. Those 9% double IPA pounders I use to slam clock in at about 360 calories each. At my worst, I was *easily* clearing 2,000 calories a day just in beer.

4. I've been eating better and eating more. I've always eaten healthy foods, but it's debatable if I was actually *eating healthy*. I found myself skipping meals and snacks to make up for the calories I was drinking, and at the amount I drink, it's laughable to think that made any difference. Now I find myself cooking a lot more and enjoying foods that I otherwise would have skipped if I was drinking -- ice cream, cream in my coffee, breads, sweets, etc. I can have these foods in moderation as part of a healthy diet.

That's about it. Not really expecting any replies, it's just nice to throw down some thoughts that have been swirling around my head. IWNDWYT",48,"{'rona': 1, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9921900629997253}"

Yeah, my depression is still a companion, but it's quieter without alcohol fanning its flames. I've found my spiritual path and am rediscovering my love of learning!

I've been waiting ages for this very pleasing sequence on the badge, and here it is at last...

Last night my partner and I joined in on a Zoom call with some of our work colleagues for a socially-distanced Friday Night Piss-Up (how very 2020), which was a novel experience to say the least...

(Some background: I'm from England, my same-sex long-term partner is from Northern Ireland, we currently live in the Republic of Ireland and work remotely for the same company, most of our colleagues are Irish and so drinking a lot and 'having the craic' is a popular pastime here as you can imagine!)...

My other half is one of those weird people who (these days) drinks about twice a year and leaves it alone the rest of the time, and going by the detritus in the kitchen this morning, got through most of a bottle of tequila and most of a bottle of cointreau to himself last night... 

I bet he's going to feel terrible when he wakes up... (*smirks smugly*)...

One lady, who had evidently started early, was clearly plastered and talking nonsense for a while before abruptly leaving the call, presumably to go and have a much-needed lie-down, bless her...

There was a lot of over-sharing, gossiping and much recounting of quote-unquote 'hilarious' drunken escapades - people getting arrested for drunk and disorderly behaviour, having bar fights, falling down the stairs after too much poit√≠n and needing stitches for a massive head wound and so on...  

I couldn't really relate to any of that myself incidentally - all of my drunk stories go something like '*I drank until I couldn't see, then toddled home to bed, the end*,' or in later years the much more efficient, '*I drank in bed until I couldn't see, then passed out, the end*'...

(I preferred to leave all of the getting-arrested-and-causing-havoc to the amateurs as that would have interrupted valuable drinking time, after all!)...

At no point during any of this was I even faintly tempted to join in with the drinking and didn't feel remotely like I was missing out on anything worth having; even the *smell* of Ethanol hanging in the air is pretty revolting these days...  

I had a couple of Aldi's excellent non-alcoholic IPAs, listened to them all waffling on until it got boring, then left them to it...

I don't envy any of my colleagues who will be waking up with 'The Fear' this morning, with throbbing heads and a mouth like the bottom of a birdcage, feeling sick and desperately trying to remember if they said or did anything embarrassing, not at all!

I'm also so grateful to have been sober during the pandemic, I can't imagine how stressful it would be if I was still addicted to alcohol - I used to need to go to the shop every day for my 24 hour supply, if I'd tried to stockpile I would have ended up drinking ALL of it on the first night and would probably be dead by now!

I'm also celebrating that's it's been just over a year since I stopped smoking and switched to one of those newfangled electronic jobbies, after 20 years of smoking like a burning tyre factory, so that's nice too... 
 
Recovery is possible folks, if you're just starting out then please keep going, it's worth it!!

Big shout-out to all my friends here on SD too, I couldn't have done it without you - THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

In the beginning I found it really challenging and I would come here and read for an hour or so and feel A LOT better.

They are VIVID and they lead to me having a very terrible morning/day because I feel hungover. I will be sweaty, my head hurts, and I feel guilty and anxious for at least an hour, with the rest of the day feeling off. Slowly as the hour of laying in bed goes by, I start to have rational thoughts again of ‚Äúokay last night you were with a friend and you got sushi and you went home. The person you were with wasn‚Äôt drinking and neither were you.‚Äù And I‚Äôll start to feel better. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Additionally, I mean vivid in the sense of ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù.

Last night my wife in her infinite wisdom went to the liquor store and texted me (again, wisdom) ‚Äúdo you want anything?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt even dignify her text with a response. She knows my stance and my goals. She doesn‚Äôt agree with them because it makes her feel some combination small or insecure.

In her continuing wisdom, she invited her friend over to our house equipped with a handle of Tito‚Äôs.

After reaching this point I'm ready to get fit and healthy! I binge ate sweets and junk to cope and have put on a ton of weight ugh. 

What are your tips for getting healthy? Did you lose heaps of weight? How?

Also, when does the emotion level dial down? 6 months? A year?

I knew for a long time that I am an alcoholic and that I need to stop drinking but could not get past day 3. I am not able to control my addictions without some external help (or push or lever). Until recently. 

Lately my hangovers have become just too much for me to handle. 3 hours of drinking (I only enjoy maybe 1 hour of it) leave me with 2 days of heavy suffering. My head hurts like crazy, I puke, shake, feel dizzy and disoriented, I can't even go out. These ongoing hangovers literally made me afraid of drinking. Even the smell of alcohol makes me scared. I don't know if this is my age or some medical stuff but I not intend to suffer anymore. I'd rather sit and stare to the wall for 3 hours than drink and experience a heavy hangover again.

And I was like wow I wish I could join her. 
But then I has this dream that I had half a drink. And I was wandering around a party super social for five minutes. And I realized what I had done and called all my friends in the program and no one answered. I have 9 months and I was so sad to have to start over. I was wailing and crying. 

And then I got to wake up. I got to wake up sober with 281 days without drinking behind me. I can be a little jealous of people who drink normally, but I just can‚Äôt without blowing my life up. 

It‚Äôs also a good reminder to get back into calling women from the program. My unconscious reminded me 
A) that even if I feel like I want a drink, I don‚Äôt actually and 
B) I need to maintain my strong network of sober women so they‚Äôre there if I need them.

I posted here not too long ago saying something similar, that I was ready to change, and kept drinking. Nothing big, nothing I'm ashamed of, but I'm noticing that even a single drink is making me feel like shit.

I've been seeing personal trainers for a few months now (on and off depending on COVID lockdown rules). At first it was just outdoors stuff with no access to weights or scales, all body weight exercises. Then we were in the gym for 2 weeks, so we did my measurements. Then back into lockdown for another 3 months.

Cut to Monday just gone. Back in the gym. Another measurements session.

I've lost a slight amount of muscle, gained a slight amount of fat, and lost a little bit of weight. Nothing to write home about, but with nothing going on in my life except working from home, exercise, and food... it's easier to see the impact that my life is having on my life.

I'm not beating myself up about it... we're in 2020 after all... and the change in muscle & weight is minor. Maybe 1kg each way.

What I've clearly noticed is the days where I drink (any amount) cause me to sleep poorly. Which causes me to eat poorly. Which causes me to have a bad day. Rinse & repeat.

It's actually great having nothing to focus on except myself.

So, when I got the most recent measurements & identified that what I'm doing isn't aligned with what I want to be doing... something clicked.

I've had a few really boring nights this week. I'm an early riser. Normally I'd walk to the shops, get some booze, and have a couple before bed. This week was different. I sat with my thoughts. I paced around the house feeling uncomfortable until the feelings went away. I did everything I needed to do to not be on auto pilot.

It was hard. But it got easier.

Fear of Missing Out, or FOMO. This is a big issue for many people when it comes to quitting drinking, and much has been written and said on the matter. We worry that we'll be missing out on all the fun if we're not at the bar drinking with our friends. Or that watching the game, or the backyard barbecue, just won't be the same without drinking. We look enviously at people who ""can drink normally"" and wish we could too. But really, why? I'm sure we all know people who will be stuck in bed today nursing a hangover. Friends, family members, perhaps even your spouse or partner. It is such a strange place to be in when you have gotten sober, and you look at these people who you may be close with, you might love even, and see clearly how much better things are without alcohol. Perhaps they are not problem drinkers like us, but just occasionally tie one on. But nonetheless their day today is wrecked because of all the ""fun"" they had last night.

&#x200B;

I have a friend who is a daily drinker. He drinks a bottle of wine a night, sometimes more. But he gets up and does his workouts, and goes to work and therefore sees no problem with his drinking. But he complains to me all the time about how terrible his sleep is. I've tried to tell him that if he'd quit drinking, he would sleep better. And his response is always, ""I can't sleep at all if I don't drink."" He has also said to me on several occasions that he gets bored when he doesn't drink. I have another friend who loves outdoor activities such as mountain biking and snowboarding. But he also loves weed and beer, and on his days off, more often than not the weed and beer pull rank and he ends up glued to his couch all day, alternately napping, watching Netflix or playing video games. He also doesn't see his drinking as a problem because he is ""fully functioning"", and in his words, ""you can't have a problem if you just drink beer. It's the hard stuff you have to watch out for."" Another person I used to know who was battling depression would always say, ""I'm not depressed because I drink, I drink because I'm depressed,"" when I suggested that their drinking was perhaps the cause of the problem. He would spend entire days in bed depression sleeping/sleeping off hangovers. And another guy I know, who is brilliant and hilarious, is practically burning his life down with booze. His girlfriend of 15 years is one hair's width away from walking out the door. And even my sister who is a ""normal drinker"" by anyone's standards has admitted that the day after drinking just 2 or 3 drinks, she just feels ""kind of blah.""

&#x200B;

We all know people like this whose drinking habits vary across the board. But one thing that all of the habitual drinkers I know have in common is that *they are missing out when they drink*. There was a time when I thought drinking helped me sleep, and that it cured my boredom and my depression. I believed that it was a fun way to spend a summer afternoon, that it made cooking dinner more fun, that  it was a blast to go out to the bars around the ski resorts here and meet people. When I first quit I was scared I would be missing out. I wouldn't get to sit in the sun and have a beer, or do shots at a concert, or get hammered at a party. And I wouldn't have the ""pleasure"" of spending my evening sitting alone for hours on the balcony drinking and smoking while watching some show or movie on my laptop. But I was *already* missing out!  I know now that if I drink I will be missing out. I'll be missing out on my sweet, sweet sober sleep. I'll be missing out on having energy and motivation in my day to do the things I really enjoy like, running, walking, yoga, cooking, drawing, having clear, interesting conversations with friends, reading, etc. I'll be missing out on whatever show or movies I do watch, because I won't remember them. I'll be missing out on laughter and joy. I'll be missing out on the very simple, basic pleasure of *not feeling horrible.* I was missing out on *so much* when I was drinking, and I couldn't even see it. And now I really don't want to drink, even when an urge does hit, because I don't want to miss out anymore. I wish I could somehow implant this knowledge and understanding into these people's brains that *it really is so much better!* I want to shout at them sometimes, ""You are missing out, not me!! Trust me! I've been there, and now I've seen the other side! Come over here, and you'll see!"" But, of course it doesn't work like that. They can't imagine life without a drink, and they believe that to not drink is to miss out.

&#x200B;

Do you worry that you're missing out by not drinking? Have you discovered that you were missing out when you were drinking? What would you be missing out on if you did drink? And do you have friends or loved ones who you wish weren't missing out?

&#x200B;

I'm so thankful to be hangover free this sunny Saturday. The day lies ahead full of possibility and I'm not going to miss a minute of it. I hope you all fully enjoy your day as well!

&#x200B;

I love you all, and I will not drink with you today!

Long [VENT].,"It's insane. It's unbelievable. It's crazy. To think that I would stumble in the same way my father did (over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over). I'll never forget the anxious nights wondering where Dad was from 5 yrs old on. Confused why my Mother was angry and anxious that Dad wasn't home from work by 11 pm. No understanding of the issue then. All the phone calls to him unanswered as a 7-year-old. Hundreds. Fear. The few that were answered: ""Daddy are you going to come home?"" ...""Yes honey I'm coming home."" Sadly almost all lies. I remember one time he actually DID come home early and sat down with Mom and me. With tears in his eyes, he promised me he'd never ""do this"" again to us... Promises never kept. 

Well, sadly, I understand now on a personal level.... it wasn't that he ever lied. It was because he  COULDN'T hold that promise...Hell, probably before he even spoke the words he knew he couldn't hold that promise... He knew. He wanted more than he wanted air to HOLD TO what was coming out of his mouth..... but GOD DAMN that next drink.........

\*\*I had my first drink 'Just to try it' at 18.\*\*

Up until I was 20 I couldn't possibly fathom such irresponsibility. Such disgusting negligence to me and my mother.... until.... man...Jack Daniels... actually seems to be a bit more than just some weekend fun with my girlfriend....what if... I just write my next paper a couple of shots in..?

I remember thinking as a 7 yr old: ""I just don't UNDERSTAND. Why would he do this? Why? How could he make promises he doesn't keep?? Why would he make Mom and I worried?""

Present: ""Understanding from personal experience-- he was out drunk (If I didn't make it clear..I didn't understand that as a kid. I just knew something made me and mom feel terrible at that age)."" 

Then: ""Wondering why he didn't want to be with us? Why he didn't love us enough to be with us and why he would want to make us worry? Why would he do such a thing?""

Now: I know. I understand because I've wanted the same thing just as badly. Booze.

It's so crazy and FUCKED I understand now at 23. Unfortunately, and most unexpectedly (Or expectedly because thanks to genetics), I understand from a personal level. Thought I had it under control for the first 3 years. I probably did by society's standards. ""Ah they're just YOUNG! Let them get crazy! They'll learn from their young, drunken mistakes."" But, oh, did I learn. I learned I couldn't FUCKIN manage my priorities-- just like my father.  Oh a great job interview tomorrrow? Ahhhhhhhh FUCK THAT!! DRINK and forget it...figure it out later!! Amazing girl?!? Well-- lead her on and manipulate her to believing that you 'kicked that old habit' any LETS GET MARRIED!! 

I'm 23 now. I'm married to literally the woman of my dreams for 2 years in January. I am making the exact mistakes my father has. Keeping her up worried. Hurting her..over and over and over and over because of my use. And for what? The extra drink? YES. I want it more than I want her when I want it. Its SO FUCKED WHY!?!? I know that I love her so much more than this garbage in my veins. But I just can't kick it WHEN I WANT IT!! I just want more in me! I feel like I'm happier and a better man when I have it in me. I am watching it all crumble before me in an almost prophetic fashion.  I want out. I want out. I want out. 

A fucking dichotomy.

I don't know why I love going and picking out beer. It's always been so easy for me to go and walk down the isles of booze. Wine, beer, liquor, and mixers are so fun. It's was hard to make the decision to get kabutcha instead of beer. I know it's the better choice. I am going to take my kids out to breakfast. My husband will be hunting in the mountains. I have tried so long and have had many good long runs of not drinking. I always come back to it, like a fly to the fly zapper. I would like this time to have more then 90 days. The day has been rough, work was stressful. Any advice to conquer the cravings. Make the wine witch go away? Cause my mind always finds a reason to get drunk. I would like to break the cycle!

Secondly, how do you deal with being rejected by who you thought were your very good friends? 

I'm sober for almost 3 months now and I've noticed I get invited less and people find my not drinking uncomfortable. Even though I still drink non-alc beers etc. In the summer, in larger gatherings maybe it wasn't as much of a problem but now we're in a partial lockdown and yesterday one of my friends said they won't come over to my house because I don't drink. 

"" .. if you were drinking, I'd come over and we'd hang around and talk and since you're not, I'd feel I have to stay at home and do something useful instead too :)) like read a book""

I mean, I can still TALK?! I know it probably sounds like they have a guilt or whatever problem with me being sober and them drinking, but this particular person doesn't even drink that much! They'd have 2-3 beers/glasses and stop anyway. Why is this such a problem, it's not like our perception would be massively different as they wouldn't even be drunk anyway. 

I feel hurt and rejected. It's already hard with the Corona isolation and the few friends we can still see saying something like this doesn't feel good at all. And yes, I would consider them one of my best friends, not easy to just ditch and move on :(",14,"{'lockdown': 1, 'rona': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9970340728759766}"

Tomorrow is opening day and I really have been wanting to go all year. My anxiety is through the roof. Last year when deer season was coming in I sat at the bar until 2 am and then went back to a friends house and drank until 4 when we had to leave I had planned on this and put a fifth of wild turkey in my backpack the day before so I wouldn‚Äôt be hung over. My mother in law saw it and said ‚ÄúI hope your civil at dinner.‚Äù Tonight I can‚Äôt sleep because I am genuinely excited. I am really looking forward to hunting in the spot I put so much work into these last couple months. I‚Äôm not gonna feel like garbage and I‚Äôll actually have a chance at succeeding this time around. I don‚Äôt have anything to worry about with my attitude or my being too drunk to use my stand. I look back in how absolutely insane it was for me to be drunk with a high powered rifle. It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm very proud of and I never want to do it again. I hope one day to share this love of the outdoors I have with my kids and I don‚Äôt want them to associate it with alcohol. I feel like I did the first time my dad ever took me deer hunting. Funny story my dad has never killed a deer in his life and is not much of a hunter himself I absolutely love it and have such a passion for it. He only went with me the few times I went as a kid because he knew how much I enjoyed it and he wanted to support me. My grandfather was more of a hunter and he passed away in June. I miss him every single day. I was given his old hunting knife. The blade is rusty it will barely take an edge now but it‚Äôs in my pack and I was talking to my wife about not bringing it and I started to cry and I couldn‚Äôt do it. My usual reaction to grief or tears like this would be ‚Äúlet‚Äôs have a drink for him‚Äù even though I never saw him drink a drop in my life and he wouldn‚Äôt even allow alcohol in his house my addicted brain would think it‚Äôs ok he gets it. Instead I sat and looked at some old pictures and remembered him and all the good memories we had. I finally have found the happiness and joy I thought I had lost because I was always drinking while doing things I loved. I‚Äôm not saying I will never have another drink of alcohol the rest of my life because I don‚Äôt know what the future holds. I do know that if things keep going like this and I am able to share the enjoyment with my son and daughter the desire will never come back. I got my soul back and my happiness in these last 4 months and this community is one of the main factors that help me stay that way. Thank you guys so much.

Today is day 94. Three weeks ago I experienced my first evening feeling the feelings and sitting with them. I cried. I sobbed. And I didn‚Äôt numb it with alcohol.

Today started out pretty good. I woke up a little bit early and had my time to enjoy my coffee. I got a text from a friend who is just over a month clean from drugs. We have been cheerleaders of each other‚Äôs journey. Today he was talking in circles and had begun to self harm. I approached it as I would anyone who was strugglinn trying to remind them of the good things they‚Äôre achieving with being sober. I thought I was making headway and the conversation ended. I started the school day with meetings. They went pretty well.

Then miscellaneous tasks. Office Hours to answer questions. 5 kids showed. 3 asked questions. The session even went 15 minutes over time! Wow! 

While I‚Äôm teaching, my daughter texts and has a pretty imminent crisis and need $700. I don‚Äôt have $700 and I told her I couldn‚Äôt help. My stress level was increased due to the frantic nature of her texts. 

After that calmed down,I stepped out and helped an old family unused to teach. I had fun thinking creatively on how to help this young man understand fractions. I recorded for an hour. I sent home an update to families about homework that was due. I was assaulted with messages of confusion and inability to find things in Google Classroom. I decided to just hold another office hours. 

They started at 2:00. While I was working with students coming in and out, I got a message about a student who‚Äôs mom went from having cancer to dying and possibly transitioning to hospice. And 15 minutes later, my friend from this morning texts me that he‚Äôs in the hospital for a suicide attempt. He admits he lied to me. I‚Äôm shaken. Did I not pay enough attention? Why didn‚Äôt I listen more or read between the lines. Why did I believe his words? 

And my day began to spin. The exhaustion from working continuously without lunch and constantly being ‚Äúon‚Äù for those hours, not sleeping well the night before (insomnia is still a thing), my student‚Äôs mom dying, and my friends attempted suicide and how I had missed his cry for help. 

I still had students meeting with me and working. I‚Äôm reaching out tmutual friends to check on his landlord and see if they‚Äôre okay. I‚Äôm rereading messages and see what I missed. I‚Äôm talking to my sober buddies to get supper and verify that this has truly turned into a ‚ÄúWhat the Actual Fuck?!‚Äù kind if day. 

And there is still not a meeting at 4:00 on a Friday. And I realize I‚Äôm not going anywhere today. My last stint a year and half ago to rethink my drinking ended the night my student‚Äôs mother died suddenly. I can‚Äôt leave. And normally, I retract when I‚Äôm having a hard sobriety day. Today - I kept talking to Sean. I explained my day to him. I explained my day to my two sober teacher friends. I explained to my friend Olivia who has been my supporter since I got sober all the way back on day 1. They all said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lot.‚Äù It is a lot! It‚Äôs a mother fucking lot!! 

I sobbed. I sobbed some more. I texted. I talked. i prayed my friend would get the help he needs, and decided I am not the one to support him in this journey. And I didn‚Äôt drink. And this time, I felt better faster. I rested more. And, I didn‚Äôt worry about my house. And I didn‚Äôt drink.",24,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9904938340187073}"

Just over a month ago I developed a UTI and immediately gave up the booze with the understanding that was necessary for it to go away, assuming when I was fine again, few days tops I thought, could go back to my 'habits' which I didnt perceive as harmful at that time.

Took me much longer than I'd expected to get over the UTI! Weird, I was sweating like a mfer and feeling awful in ways that I assumed meant I had developed a full blown kidney infection but then without medication it went away after about a week. 
I was withdrawing and didn't realize. Now I do. I don't want to do that again. I'm not going to justify using alcohol, it really is an easy way out and an excuse to avoid facing my problems and I owe it to myself to foster courage and resilience rather than escapism with a harmful substance.
I've stopped using everything else over the past month, been exercising almost every day, started volunteering and in general been excited to start my days. My feelings still get out of control sometimes but I have faith in myself to come out the other side. Even if I lapse.

To be honest I'm kind of nervous about  what life will be like alcohol. I feel like I'm at a crossroads in my life right now. For so many years alcohol  been a crutch for me. When I'm sober I'm  reserved , cynical and have low self esteem but when I drink I turn into this character who is sociable, bold, and  I find myself laughing more. I think deep down I've carried the thought that alcohol makes me a ""better person"". This belief is why my previous attempts of quitting alcohol have been half hearted. I've gone to AA, and a couple of AA alternatives, and would stop going after a couple of meetings. I've been drinking heavily since I was about 20 ( I'm currently 30). I feel like I've been living a double life. My friends and family know that I like to drink, but I've been able to conceal the extent that I drink ( I drink the most late at night when I'm feeling alone/depressed). What scares me is what my life will be like if I continue this path. I'm living with my parents which is an insecurity of mine, but instead of making a plan to leave, I've just numbed myself with booze, while cycling through jobs that I've hated all through my 20s. I left a dead end job in pursuit of a career switch in the spring and with the combination of quarantine and the uncertainty of the freelance world, I've found myself drinking more heavily on a daily basis. After waking up with a hangover this morning I've decided I've had enough. I'm deciding to take control of my life and work towards my goals as well as  take  accountability for everything that I'm unhappy with in my life, starting with overcoming my drinking problem.

Some people need AA to stay sober. For me the idea of a staying sober for a higher power makes me want to drink more. I'm not drinking because it is just an outward manifestation of my death-urge. 

Something about drinking and being alive is contradictory. We use it to attempt to escape and find void. When I was drinking I thought about my own mortality all of the time, compulsively made jokes and references to how we're all dying. And it's true that we are all dying and closer to death every day, but that neglects the present part of the picture. All that should matter to me are the choices and actions directly under my control. It is my choice not to drink. 

I'm going to go shotgun a LaCroix (its really fun, and has a weird instant gratification high, I recommend it) and spend the night drinking tea and working on a physics paper. If you're just starting to think about getting sober, I recommend it. 666 days have flown by, and suprisingly few of them have been in boring sober agony (I used to feel like being sober was  just like staring at a cold wall for hours until they become years. That's the subliminal defeatist Christian AA attitude permeating culture).

He has his own substance issues right now... he has been a daily pot smoker for maybe a decade now. He also drinks and that has increased to nearly daily lately. He had a momentary lapse in judgement recently with harder drugs but I believe that is over. His behavior has been completely checked out for months now. To the extent that he is always outside or in his shed when he is home. It‚Äôs modeling bad stuff for our three kids who have gotten used to all this. A lot of the major stuff because super obvious a few months ago when I managed to stack 60 days and then the stress of all this family stuff and I drank again... 

Anyway, this time around I told him I‚Äôm going to quit drinking again and I needed some space and to back up from him and the relationship needs and issues in order for me to focus on just not drinking and taking care of the kids. I feel like that is a healthy boundary to set with him right now bc he has neglected the needs of our relationship for YEARS AND YEARS for no reason and I have very healthy and important reasons for having to back up right now. He is taking this boundary as very hurtful. He recognizes that he has not been doing well for his family and will agree with me on most of the issues I bring up (initially he gets defensive but after thinking it through, acknowledges the points I bring up).

Crippling alcoholism, detox, sober living, apartment. It took me 10 years to finally take lasting action. I had to severely damage some close relationships, accidently hurt myself a handful of times, the whole shebang. I've always gotten a few months under my belt and gotten cocky, using any excuse i can think of to justify picking up a bottle of new amsterdam and some grapefruit juice. I LOVE alcohol, my birth family has a history of substance abuse so I definitely inherited some of these cravings I have. 

I had tried kava a handful of times but never considered it a replacement therapy until I went with some guys to a kava bar after an AA meeting. It works so well because it doesn't give me the wild euphoria that drinking does. It's mild, it's relaxing, I don't hallucinate and shake like a chihuahua when I don't have it. I could take it or leave it, something that a lot of us are completely complexed by when we see ""normies"" having one or two drinks.

I really hate being sneaky and dishonest with him when he's been so loving and supportive throughout my whole ordeal, but you know how it is with addiction. Last night I dreamt that I was finding unopened wine bottles all over the house that I never knew were there, and MAN was I disappointed to wake up. Boozy dreams always make the following day 10 times harder for me as far as cravings. 

It's only been 5 days since my last slip, (had a good streak going before that though) but I was so close to giving in. I had just gotten dressed, and I sat down to tie my shoes so I could go. That's when my boyfriend's LEAST social cat comes sprinting into the room. She's usually pretty cold to me, and because I recently moved in, I thought she was hating me even more because now I'm impeding on her territory and owner. I was expecting her to see me and quickly leave like she usually does, maybe meow at me for food if I'm lucky. 

Instead, she VERY uncharacteristically jumped up onto my lap, purring happily and giving me that little closed-eye kitty smile. I was so bewildered, almost like a star-struck kind of feeling. She then hunkered down and snuggled up to me for a nap, purring happily as I held and pet her, trying to hold back tears. Not even 10 minutes prior, I was asking whatever powers that be for some kind of sign or strength. I quickly realized that I was stuck in that chair: I'm a huge cat lover and there was simply no way I could disturb her, especially during this unprecedented show of affection. It's like she knew I needed her, she stayed there cuddling with me for a full hour when I was lonely and vulnerable, and prevented me from going anywhere. 

I know that at the end of the day it was still ultimately my choice to not go to the store for booze, and that's something I can be proud of, but without that crabby little cat, I almost certainly would've chosen differently. During that hour I had the chance to deeply think about my situation and how far I've come, and how I owe it to myself and loved ones to stick this out. I'm very agnostic, but this really did feel like a sign after asking the universe for one.

I wanted to post because reading others posts helped give me the confidence to quit and has helped me with my strategy so far. 

I always liked to drink, I always liked to party, but I never thought of myself as an alcoholic. I didn‚Äôt drink during work, I didn‚Äôt get the shakes if I skipped a day or two, I wasn‚Äôt begging for money to get a buzz, so I COULDNT have a problem, right? 

I always really enjoyed going to breweries and trying new craft beer. I always was the one to lobby to meet at a bar and at the bar was the one to buy rounds. In my mind, i wasn‚Äôt an alcoholic -  I was an enthusiast! 

Obviously, I wasn‚Äôt honest with myself. I have a problematic relationship with alcohol. I love to feel drunk and that‚Äôs why i drink. Period. Yeah i do like visiting new breweries but that isn‚Äôt why I‚Äôm up at midnight after going out to the bars, sitting by myself drinking beer. That‚Äôs because I‚Äôm addicted. 

My hangovers were getting worse and my body was telling me not to drink and i just wouldn‚Äôt listen. I thought it was okay because I can drink and be relatively fine, MOST of the time, and hangovers happen. It wasn‚Äôt like i got mean or nasty or put myself in harms way, I just got drunk...most of the time. 

Here is the catch - once or twice a year I‚Äôd do something really embarrassing or dangerous or idiotic and guess what ‚Äî i was always drinking when it happened.  Always. Without fail. I would always drink with moderation until the times when I didn‚Äôt, and i realized I can‚Äôt avoid these without being sober. Some people can, but not people like me. 

I finally had enough. I was tired of it, bored with it, and through. I realized if anyone or anything treated me the way booze did, I‚Äôd have kicked em to the curb a long time ago. Alcohol was not helping me be the man i want to be. I‚Äôve not yet woken up regretting my choice to not drink. I‚Äôve become more energetic and happy and patient.

As Annie Grace has said, when her daughter was learning to walk, she fell down a lot, but got up and started again. She never let falling down stop her from learning to walk, and eventually she did. 

Few of us experience instant sobriety when we decide to quit drinking. Most of us stumble and fall and fail and get back up and try again, and maybe fall and fail again and again and again. But we get up, dust ourselves off and hopefully  take what we‚Äôve learned, and try again.

I think my biggest trigger is success but truthfully it‚Äôs all a trigger for me. The thread that was posted this week about a GF explaining to her BF why she drinks sums it up well for me as it did most of us on here I‚Äôd drink for everything if I was left to my own devices. I had hit bottom in July 2019 when I first made up my mind to quit for good, I was fresh out of a divorce and gotten a DWI, I lost my job and knew I had to rebuild, so I did, I got a new job, bought a house, found a girl who I love to pieces, married her, and everything was going great. Last weekend (Monday actually) I was sitting around on my last day off and I was happy, I had done it, I was back on top! But then I thought you know what, ‚Äòalcohol‚Äô, and in 5 minutes I had a plan I was out the door and at a store and purchased some boxed wine and it was a write off, the first two I had a buzz but it wasn‚Äôt enough so I drank two more and it hit me like a steamroller. I did a lot of damage Monday, I broke my wife‚Äôs trust, I broke my trust in myself and just hated myself. I‚Äôve been reading these threads sporadically over the last year and today I came across one that was talking about needing to forgive yourself and look forward. I‚Äôm not going to forget my past but I am going to be working on forgiving myself for the past and look forward to the future. This last year of sobriety was nothing short of amazing and honestly the only thing I shorted myself on was not embracing my sobriety, anytime someone brought it up I tried to down play it or change the subject and partially because I hoped in the back of my mind that one day I could drink normally, I think what helps me is looking forward and building and tomorrow I‚Äôm looking forward to 5 days sober. It‚Äôs a battle, I think it will always be a battle for me but every time I stumble I learn more about myself and how to keep myself sober. I made a promise to myself Tuesday, I will never stop building sober days, on the bad days I will vocalize that it‚Äôs a bad day rather than tell myself I‚Äôm being weak and internalizing my feelings I‚Äôm going to reach out rather it be here or a meeting, or a friend.

At the end of the day, the cost benefit analysis that occurs ends in my drinking even if later I convince myself that the drinking needs to not be worth it. Every time the drink is there, I seem to take it up.

I don't know how to change that cost benefit analysis. I don't know how to change the long term cost versus the current enjoyment.

I also vowed to be kinder to myself, avoiding critical self-talk. I came to the realization that nobody was going to take care  of me but me.

Under high recommendation I started the book This Naked Mind - which was already bringing up the same questions I had been pondering of my relationship  with alcohol. I'm a rational guy and really like evidence-based information and to know how things work.

At  that point in time going 7 days without a drink almost seemed like an unimaginable goal. With the week behind me, my mind thought -- well  there was no way I could enjoy a movie without a drink, or physical  intimacy without a pre-game cocktail. I continued to unravel and test all these false assumptions I had made and found being sober wasn't as scary or boring as I had thought.

Within the first week I was already sleeping better. Even on nights where I didn't get a full 7 or 8 hours, my restful deep sleep was at least a  quarter of my rest. My energy and productivity have increased and I feel like I have an extra two hours in my day.

I'm a guy who lives in a city where craft beer culture is on every street corner. I appreciate the history of beer, and am even a home-brewer myself. I graduated from beer on to whiskey and scotch. Although I never regarded my drinking as problematic, I can clearly see it for what is  -- an expensive hobby that takes more from me than it gives.

Very few in the craft beer community talk about the negative effects: alcoholism, or even suggesting moderation for that matter. Craft beer festivals at 10am with unlimited ""tasters"" are the norm. Spending time and money chasing the newest hyped up beer releases. Average 7% ABV IPA beers, which by standard definition each count as a little over two standard drinks, but a seasoned drinker could put away 2-3 in a session without judgement or a second thought.

The paradigm shift has been huge -- I kept a lot of depressed ""drinking buddy"" relationships around that didn't have very much depth, or emotional fulfillment for me. It has opened up a lot of optimism to pursue my passion of photography and while I always believed alcohol made me more creative, I now know it just makes me not care as much about my art,  and settle for less than my best. The best advantage for me is being present. Being able to be complete in the moment and fully take in an awe-inspiring sunset, and then capturing an amazing photograph to share.

I have lost 8 pounds in the last 2 weeks with no diet modifications -- only cutting out drinking :)

My official sobriety anniversary was on the 11th of November. Although I am someone for whom words typically come easily, I have struggled to put down exactly what sobriety has meant for me. Because the truth is, it's changed my entire life in so many ways that it's difficult to capture it all.

By the time I quit drinking, I was well past the point where I knew I had a problem. I was drinking daily, drinking when I didn't want to, hiding my drinking, lying about my drinking, justifying my drinking and was just plain terrified that I really couldn't stop and that this was the life I was doomed to live. I felt like I was in an unending series of Ground-Hog Days - waking up anxious and dehydrated and achy and miserable, wishing I hadn't drank at all.

Like many of you, I'd strung together a few brief periods of sobriety in the previous years - a few times even making it over 30 days. But, I always went back to drinking because I felt entitled and bitter. Why should everyone else around me get to enjoy drinking? Why can't I drink normally? I'm successful and intelligent and I deserve to drink fancy craft beer on patios. I'd fool myself into thinking that I could be successful at ""drinking responsibly"" THIS TIME because of whatever reason I'd made up to convince myself of that.

I owe my success to this subreddit. I lurked here for years, resetting my counter many many times, and reading all of your stories and sharing my own. It was this subreddit that suggested ""This Naked Mind,"" ""Alcohol Lied to Me,"" and ""Alcohol Explained."" I bought these books as audiobooks and I listened to them over and over again, walking my dogs, driving to work, cleaning my house. And through this repetition, I was able to begin to change the way that I viewed alcohol.

Here's the truth - as best as I can tell it. Alcohol is an addictive, toxic substance that acts as an anesthetic in humans. This means that it does one thing and one thing only: takes you closer and closer to unconsciousness as your blood alcohol content increases. It does this by disrupting your Central Nervous System - which in turn slows both your physiological and psychological processes. The symptoms of drinking that we've all experienced such as tipsy-ness, slurring, stumbling and so forth are the desperate attempts of your brain to fight against an overwhelmingly toxic substance that is overtaking your body.

Alcohol cannot do any of the things that we ascribe to it. It doesn't make us funnier, more confident, sexier, playful, braver, less anxious or any of the other things we tell ourselves. How could it? You have ascribed these attributes to alcohol through years and years of personal and social conditioning. By watching movies where sexy people get a bit tipsy and let go, where the tough guy slugs back whiskey to shore up his courage, where people drink to steady their nerves before a big battle, and so on. And you've had some good experiences with alcohol, nice days with friends on a sun-soaked patio, romantic evenings with your spouse, bonding time with your family.

Have you ever heard of the placebo effect? Our brains are so powerful that simply suggesting to someone that taking this pill will cure their terrible migraines actually works!- even though they are given only sugar pills. Studies have shown this time and time again, even when people KNOW they're taking a placebo, they can STILL feel positive effects. Alcohol is your placebo. And every single good thing that you think it does for you, you can do on your own. In reality, you are doing them on your own.

Once you stop romanticizing drinking, you can begin to truly free yourself from it. I won't pretend that there weren't days and times in the last year that I really wanted a drink. But when you understand that drinking has never given you anything good and that it's certainly not going to start now, it's easier to push those feelings aside.

The first three months, I must have checked my Sobriety App like 10 times a day. By six months, I checked it occasionally, and by nine months, drinking was just a thing I didn't do. I am no longer jealous of those who are drinking - I actually feel a bit sorry for them, wasting their money, energy and precious time on such an awful thing.  Quitting drinking gave me the confidence in myself to take other positive steps that I'd been wanting to take. Because if I could overcome my addiction to alcohol, well, there wasn't much I couldn't do.

Sobriety delivers everything that alcohol promised me. I am happier, healthier, less anxious, smarter, more successful, calmer, and better able to deal with my daily life. My marriage is better, my relationship with my family is better, I'm a better boss and friend.  The only thing I regret about quitting drinking is that I didn't fully commit to it sooner.

If you're struggling - it gets better, so so much better.  A year ago I never could have believed I would be writing this post. I lived in fear of what an alcohol-free life would look like. But now I know what it looks like, and although it certainly isn't perfect, it's more beautiful than I'd dared hope. There's freedom over here, friends, and I know that you can find it too.

Thanks for always being here, r/stopdrinking. You saved my life.

Edited to add: Thank you for all of your kind words and awards. I'm so humbled and happy to have given anyone a ""leg up"" in this fight. [Be as kind to yourself as you have been to me](https://youtu.be/VwtAjv04pt8), and realize that sobriety is the best reward for a job well done that you could ever give yourself.

Lessons?
1) routine is important. The doctor‚Äôs appointment was early so I didn‚Äôt do my usual meditation first thing, and I didn‚Äôt post on the daily check-in. So I was vulnerable.

2) HALT: I didn‚Äôt eat before my doctor‚Äôs appointment and didn‚Äôt pack a snack so I unconsciously put myself in the position of needing to go to get something at the shop. Another vulnerability.

3) instincts are powerful but conscious thoughts can be too: thinking through the craving, recognising how odd and illogical it was, and talking to myself through it really helped. I even made myself laugh by using the classic schoolteacher line: ‚Äúmaybe you‚Äôre right, maybe no-one would find out if you did drink right now. *But you‚Äôre only cheating yourself*!‚Äù

Happy Friday, folks!

&#x200B;

Surprise! It's me Trumie again, and I'll be your host for the next two days. It's always a pleasure and an honor to host, so I hope you all don't mind a little unexpected switcheroo. (Homer is fine, by the way, he just has a busy weekend and asked if I'd take over.)

&#x200B;

Today, let's talk about surprises and the unexpected. Both good and bad. I first managed to start stacking days earlier this year starting in February. When I finished my first week I was amazed. After trying so hard for so long, I finally did it. I surprised myself each time I hit a milestone, double digits, two weeks, three weeks, a month - WOW! a month?!? - and then on my 40th day came a huge surprise. Covid. The whole world around me shut down, I lost my job and plans for the coming months that my newly sober, post-breakup self was looking forward to like lights at the end of a tunnel were cancelled. The anxiety that I felt was screaming inside me, and I could not bear it. More accurately, I did not *want* to bear it. So I told myself that I had done 40 days, I could drink ""just this once"" and get right back to sobriety. Easy peasy, right?

&#x200B;

Now the next part will come as no surprise to many of you, but it came as a big surprise to me at the time. In fact it's not an overstatement to say it absolutely shocked me. It wasn't easy peasy, and it wasn't just that once. I drank that night and woke up in the morning with the same unbearable anxiety and a hangover, so I drank again that afternoon. And before I knew it I was right back where I had been and *completely* taken off-guard by how fast it happened, and terrified that I would not be able to get back to feeling good like I had been when I was sober. When I had started out in February, I had things to look forward to that motivated me, but now? How was I going to do it again with such a bleak outlook for the coming months? And the alcohol in my brain was telling me that I'd never feel happiness again, even if I did stop drinking. But after 10 days, I did it. I had another day one. And I was surprised again to find that within a few days I was feeling calm and optimistic and even happy again. Almost three months later I had another relapse that lasted just about as long as the previous one, although I would say it was worse, and harder to overcome.

&#x200B;

And this leads me to one of the most wonderful and amazing surprises of my life. And that is the love and support of this community. I had no idea, not an inkling, of the love and camaraderie that I would find here, and that it would be one of the greatest gifts of my entire life (so far). Both times when I relapsed, I was almost paralyzed with fear at the thought of coming on here and resetting my badge and having to tell everyone that after all my empowered, uplifting talk, over-the-moon enthusiasm for sobriety, and absolute assuredness that I would never drink again, that I had in fact not only drank, but gone on a bender. Everyone would be so disappointed in me. This fear was especially strong the second time when I had gotten to know quite a few regulars, and I had even hosted the DCI. How does someone with almost 90 days, who has hosted the DCI end up drinking again? Well, surprise, folks! It happens, and it's happened to better people than myself with more time under their belts. But when I came back I was met with *nothing* but love, compassion, understanding, support, encouragement and warmth. Hands down, one of the most precious gifts, and I never saw it coming, or even dared to dream of it. I tear up every single time I think about it, and I probably always will.

&#x200B;

In the months since my last relapse I have faced more surprises and challenges, but they don't derail me like they did. I have been pleasantly surprised by my own ability to cope with things in ways that I never would have when I was drinking. I often have that feeling that I had as a kid the day my dad took the training wheels off my bike, and in spite of my fear that I would crash, and couldn't ride without them, at some point my dad let go of the back of the bike, and lo and behold, I was doing it! I can hardly believe it sometimes, but I'm doing it!

&#x200B;

This life is just full of surprises. They come in all shapes, sizes and forms. Some are wonderful and some are tragic, some are big, some are small. I've been surprised by conflicts with loved ones, surprised by good news and bad, surprised by how many gifts sobriety truly has to offer, surprised by what my emotions feel like when I really feel them, surprised to find that some things that would have terribly upset me before barely phase me, and vice versa. But most of all I've been surprised to find that I *can* cope with all the surprises that come my way without needing a drink.

&#x200B;

What about you? What surprises have you faced on this journey? Were they good? Were they bad? How did you handle them? Have you surprised yourself?

&#x200B;

Thank you for having me as your surprise host. If any of you has over 30 days and would like to host, please let u/SaintHomer know.

&#x200B;

I love you all, and I will not drink with you today!

In June of this year, I finally hit my wits end with my drinking and went to a doctor for help quitting. They gave me some meds that really helped me get over the hump of the first week. I put together a streak of 87 days sober and was super proud. 

In August, the wheels fell off. My mother was involved in a serious car crash and the stress of her being out of state and being the only next of kin to handle her care and other affairs really broke me mentally. In addition, I had been having unrelenting pain in my hips and legs that the doctor couldn‚Äôt seem to solve. So I cracked, and made a liquor store run because maybe it would help with the pain, stress and lack of sleep. 

To call the next two months a bender would be an understatement. I was going through 20+ nips of cheap 99 proof liquor and it was a completely different experience than the last time I was hooked. I couldn‚Äôt go more than an hour and a half without plunging into withdrawals, violent shaking and such. I was waking up on the hour to slug down another shot just to get through. I also had the most bizarre change in my perception of time. Everything seemed to be in slow motion, I was constantly in a confused fog and everyone I interacted with seemed to be drunk along with me. 

Fast forward to the end of October, the self loathing and terrible feeling hit a breaking point and as I got in my car to run to the liquor store the second they opened, something in me just said ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù and I just didn‚Äôt drive there. 

Now I don‚Äôt recommend this, but this time around I didn‚Äôt seek medical help (dumb in hindsight, I know). But I knew what I was in for and what the time frame for detox was, and I just gutted through it. First three days were hell with the shakes and sweats and pissing out of my ass. Zero meaningful sleep, nothing but super shallow dozing filled with absolute nonsense ‚Äúdreams‚Äù. But by day 4, I felt, dare I say it... good!

I‚Äôve still got a long journey, but I‚Äôm back up to 16 days sober and counting. Luckily, the cravings are non-existent, as a matter of fact, I‚Äôm revolted by the thought of drinking again. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of my strength and energy back and have been super productive around my house and it feels fantastic. I never ever want to fall back in that trap again. It stopped being about feeling buzzed and carefree, and became just about maintaining enough use to not have to face withdrawals. I feel confident that was my last relapse and I will NEVER drink with you again. 

Thanks for reading! Anybody else that feels like you can‚Äôt do it, you can. I‚Äôm very weak willed and have practically zero willpower, but I‚Äôve managed. 

Bonus content:  If any of this sounds like you, here‚Äôs what worked for me both times. 

I highly recommend seeing a doctor if you can and be honest about your intake. They can usually help with medication in a controlled way that will make the withdrawals much safer and easier to get through the immediate stage. 

Take your willpower out of the equation. Find a loved one or friend/confidant that you can open up to about it. In my case, I gave them the reins on my access to money. I gave up my debit card and asked to use it when I needed gas/groceries etc. Even gave them access to see my transactions. Enabled location sharing on my phone, so that even if I wanted to go get booze, the fear of embarrassing myself kept that in check. 

Just understand that you will have a rough few days initially. But I promise, once you get through that, you‚Äôre gonna feel a lot better. 

Sober apps are your friend. Most will show you how long it‚Äôs been since you quit and also show you how much you‚Äôre saving and how much poison you‚Äôre not pumping into your body. Also many show you some of the typical milestones for health benefits as you get further along. 

Vitamins and water help a ton too!

2020-11-13 00:08:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jtb58j/why_i_want_to_quit_drinking/,Why I want to quit drinking,"My roommate and I went out this Saturday night to our friends place to celebrate them moving into nyc. The night started like every other time we were going to drink. We chugged a couple of seltzers and then played some drinking games, and then started taking some shots.

The last thing I remember that night was looking at my phone at 11:30. The next morning my roommate and I woke up in the hospital. The nurses began to fill in the gaps, my roommate and I, around midnight, tried taking the subway back home. He fell down the subway stairs and cracked his head open. I have a very vague memory of me holding his head on my lap, covered in his blood and puke, and trying to call 911. Honestly I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôd be able to sleep if I could actually remember what had happened.

My roommate is about a foot taller than me and always held his alcohol better than I could. Whenever we went out together, he was the one that would make sure that I would drink water before going to bed, he‚Äôd put a backpack on me so I wouldn‚Äôt choke on my puke while sleeping. I‚Äôve never had to take care of him. He had never once blacked out throughout college. The one night that I had to take care of him and I was also black out drunk. I can‚Äôt stop thinking what would have happened if I had taken one more drink, and I wasn‚Äôt fast enough to hold his head, to call 911. Or if I was the one that fell and he had to take care of me.

The morning I woke up in the hospital and went to his bed I remember how horrible he looked. He had a neck brace on, he was still bleeding from a cut on his forehead. I sat there as the nurses stitched up his forehead and put staples in the back of his head to patch up the other gash. Speaking with his girlfriend and mom as they came over to be by his side that day was brutal.

I‚Äôve gotten so accustomed to blacking out when I drink and then just waking up with a slight hangover the next day. That was the only consequence that I knew until this weekend. I just can‚Äôt take those odds anymore. I called my parents on Monday after my roommate got released from the hospital (he‚Äôs going to make a full recovery!) and my mom understandably broke down. She‚Äôs seen me black out drunk on two separate occasions and both times I could tell I was breaking her heart. I‚Äôve never considered myself an alcoholic. My biggest ego boost is that I don‚Äôt like the taste of beer and would never casually drink one during the week while eating dinner, or something along those lines. But I‚Äôve come to realize that blacking out almost every time I drink and feeling invincible can lead me down that path as well.

That‚Äôs why I have decided to stop drinking. I haven‚Äôt had alcohol for 4 days now since the incident and I am going to try to take it one day at a time from now on. I promised my mom that she‚Äôll never get a call from the hospital at 2am and I‚Äôm going to do everything I can to stick to that promise.

I'm doing great here, it feels odd that today one year has passed without hangovers. I feel much better and I'm way less stressed now. One year is quite a long time and yet, it doesn't feel so long somehow. Over the last two months or so, I began to think about booze less, though in retrospect, I spent a lot of time thinking about it this last year, even months after stopping. Actually, I was surprised to see how much I was thinking about it, especially given the fact that I didn't consider myself to be a hard core drinker.
Eventually, I'm happy that I have found some sense of stability and I can feel like I have started to develop again, in contrast to the semi permanent hangover haze of before.

Most of my friends tend to drink less now, we're going on 30 so I guess it's a different stage of life as well. In any case it's making things easier for me, we do less of the ""sit and drink"" sessions that we used to do a lot.

Today was....err......kinda sucked!!  Well the morning was.  Yesterday evening I received some bad news.

But now looking back on it it wasn't bad news at all.  It was actually good news.  My best friend, in which I have feelings for, found someone new.  Someone that makes her happy.  My initial emotional response was hurt and pain.  Because, well I was being selfish.  I didn't even consider her feelings until someone on here asked me if I was happy for her.  And yes I am happy for her.  Very much so.

In my last couple of posts I spouted a lot of words of sadness, anger and pain.  Very colorfully too, lol.  Truth is that I knew deep inside that we are not compatible with each other.  She saw it a long time ago and always was careful around me.  Careful to not lead me on but at the same time didn't want to lose my friendship.  She is an amazingly intelligent woman both mentally and emotionally.  I've always known about the incompatibilities but I couldn't help myself get wrapped up in the ""what-if"".  I'm the one with the intelligence of a doornail when it comes to emotions.  Maybe now, with her new found love and my new found sobriety I will be able to break myself from all of that and start to love myself instead.

I apologize to those that have responded to me that may have thought that I was having some sort of mental/emotional breakdown.  I'm a man, I'm not used to sharing my feelings.  I just kind of spew nonsense if you've followed any of my posts.

But, the main thing I want to say is that I feel good.  I've been selfish like this before in similar situations with her and it took me wayyy too long to get over it.  You guys really helped me though a difficult time.  I will forever be grateful to you for that.  Thank you.

I know it's not completely over  though.  As emotions are like waves in the ocean.  But I think I past the biggest wave and I'm ready to tackle the rest of them.  And I did it this time without alcohol.

I will never drink with you.

I found I drank more over time, that I was emotionally dependent, that it stopped me from doing things. It was making me fat and mentally cloudy. While I continue to be a fan of selected microbrew non-alcohol beer, I cannot fathom why anyone would add alcohol to it. 

If you are ""dry-curious"" I suggest not waiting for the new year to begin. Kick off 2021 with success behind you. I found occasional AA sessions to he helpful, if only to admit I had a problem. A key insight for me was remembering that as a young boy I could have piles of fun without alcohol. I adopted the expression, PLaTYO, Party Like a Ten Year Old.

But here is the best reason. I believe that alcohol suppresses the brain's natural ability to produce joy and creativity. There was a dark streak when I first quit, but then my brain insisted on experiencing joy. It fired up my dormant creative circuits and I began drawing and painting. Alcohol is like fireworks in the brain, blasting the circuits. Sobriety is a steady beautiful joy. I would not trade back.

I drank beer and occasionally mixed drinks.  Lots of extra empty calories - mostly at night - going until I fell asleep.  Over time, the weight gain and the loss of libido started weighing on my sense of identity and confidence the most.  And I didn't have to wonder why - it was pretty obvious what was causing it.  So when I stopped, one of the things I told myself - one of the things that kept me on track - was that I was going to notice a difference in myself.

Except it hasn't really happened.  My weight stayed pretty consistent and even went UP a couple of pounds this week.  Which makes NO sense.  I might be having 2 sugary beverages now per day to mix things up from the bubbly water, and I'm not eating more.  I have to be taking in less calories than before... but nothing is happening.  

I'm starting to exercise again, maybe that will finally push things along.  Hopefully \*that\* will make more sense.  I know trying to exercise before always seemed doomed to fail when my body wasn't able to recover enough to make any real progress.  If that is still the case, I'm gonna have a hard time with this.

I've realized for some time now that the main reason I drink every night is because the thought of going to sleep sober is somewhat terrifying to me. I don't know where along the past 20 years of drinking that it started, but I want to say it was somewhere in the last year and a half of very regular nightly drinking...so I know there was a time when I used to be able to face going to bed sober, but I just...can't seem to remember it.

Often in the past year and a half I haven't even really *wanted* that drink (or 3, or 4) but I think of lying down at night without that soporific aid and I just...like a reflex, I head for that drink. Lately (as in, in spurts since the start of the pandemic, and definitely in the past couple of weeks) I have felt palpably increased levels of anxiety overall, which is undoubtedly adding to my troubles. It seems clear to me now that I've been self-medicating. I've noticed that while sometimes the urge does seem to hit me out of nowhere, it is often when I start ""worrying"" that I head for the fridge (while eyeing the clock and doing the mental math of how much do I have, will it last the night, etc....exhausting.)  

*Anyhow* I'm into my 5th day without alcohol right now, looking forward (/s) to my 5th night of trying to sleep without it. Everyone, let me just say...it's been horrible. Sleeping without alcohol. I lay there for hours feeling anxious. So tired, but I can't sleep. Last night I tried 3mg of melatonin and I don't know if it was a coincidence but I actually did worse. The images in my head were more vivid, way weirder than usual (typically random-image-phase is a pleasant phase of pre-sleep for me) and flipping through my head like when you flip through the pages of a book of images. Terrible! I kept feeling myself falling asleep then being jerked back out of it miserably, I don't know why. I had a terrible vivid nightmare about alien invasion (I don't usually have nightmares **or** vivid dreams) and ultimately was so panicked I took an ativan at 2:30am, which I don't like to do, but I was desperate.

I still feel better in the morning after a sleepless terror-filled night than when I wake up with a hangover, so I'm clinging to that feeling. If alcohol, and its absence now, is what is putting me through this then I hope dearly I can clear myself out and feel what it feels like to sleep, wake, and live without the poisonings every night. But I admit it's hard sometimes knowing that if I just drank 2 beers (if only it would go no farther than 2), I'd fall asleep fine.

I have so many questions. I wonder if regularly drinking only 3-4-5 drinks every night for a year and half (with only I think 2 short periods where I tried to dry out, then caved) would change my brain/body chemistry such that I might still be adjusting 5 days into detox? And this could be what it feels like? 

If you've made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time. I have found so much strength and hope in this community and I'm hoping you'll be willing to share with me your experiences on sleep through detox, sober sleep, what you've tried that has helped, if it gets better...

I had a consult with a LADC yesterday and he recommended a detox program. Either 21 days inpatient or a scheduled of 4 days per week/2 hrs per day gradually decreasing in length and frequency, total of 16-24 wks. Honestly, I don't have time for either one. I work full time + part time job and would basically have no time for anything but job and recovery. My husband doesn't work because he's in DBT for BPD so it's only me - I can't cut back hours. I'm also doing kind of OK reducing my consumption on my own. I binged a ton at the beginning of the week, but since then I've been slowly cutting back by drinking White Claw instead of liquor (bc I find White Claw gross and it's hard to drink much more than 4 or 5 a day)

So, idk whether I should do this program. I'm already seeing a counselor 2+ times per week, who doesn't think I have a problem but that's another story. And it is true that my drinking is situationally motivated by my spouse and our relationship issues.

Anyway, I am having serious headaches, really tense feelings in my jaw/neck, and sometimes my lips tingle a bit. I also have body aches - after I walk the dog my legs are super tired, and my hips are achy. Is this normal as I cut back?

I have decided in the past to stop drinking for the most part but would allow myself drinks every-once-in-a-while which quickly turned into waiting for the next one and spiraling out of control.

I blacked-out last week on the floor, for the first time since my daughter was born. About a year ago when I decided to cut back, it was because I had blacked-out, broken my nose, and had to go to the hospital in an ambulance for being overly-intoxicated; it was not a good time in my life.

My wife does not deserve this and neither does my 6-month old daughter; the thing that keeps resonating in my head is how scared my wife was and when she brought up the idea that my daughter could one day find me black-out drunk on the floor. This scenario is something I pray will never happen, although I probably would have said that about blacking-out in the first place, let alone in front of the love of my life.

**I'm going to quit now for good.** I am tired of putting my health, my wife's well-being, my money, and now, my daughter's well-being on the line.

With what I've put my stomach through in the last few years, I'd say it's pretty strong, but I was throwing up all night and am experiencing the worst headache of my entire life. I feel like death. I've taken a sick day. I'm just so disappointed with myself. And in so much pain. 

I really just needed a community to reach out to, as this one helped a lot earlier this year. I can't drink anymore. It's terrible for me, it doesn't pair well with these meds, and I can't feel like this anymore. My anxiety and depression are worse than ever and I'm sick as dog.

He does know more about my struggle: my attempts at rehab, my AA journey, my mental health impacts. And, now, he even knows about my recent relapse. I thought it would send him running for the hills.

Instead, last night, he sat me down. Said that he loved me. Told me he wanted to support me. Let me know that we are still planning a life together... ""things get better.""

Then, he shared his exact sober date with me. 

He now knows mine.

Obviously, this has to stop. I‚Äôve made a commitment to stop drinking, at least for a while. A wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm an alcoholic, but I clearly have a problem. Once I start drinking, I will not stop until I completely black out and usually wake up fully clothed.

 - When seeing friends (on Zoom at the moment), what is a good substitute for drinking alcohol?

 - Does ceasing drinking actually improve your mental health?

 - Is it possible for someone like me to have a normal relationship with alcohol, if I retrain my relationship with it?

I took out a journal that I filled out on day one (and haven't filled out since as I have a natural aversion to helping myself) and found I had written amongst other things the following cons that I was experiencing as a result of my drinking:

Shame, self loathing, intense anxiety, increased depression, agoraphobia, bloating, awful diet, smoke like a trooper, financial suicide, angry all the time, exhaustion, repetitive intrusive thoughts, shit parent, shit partner, dread of work, close to tears constantly, failing health, sweats, heart palpitations, not in control, not clear headed, avoid family time, hate appearance........

Insane to think when I read those back that I have been doing that to myself for over 20 years! 

Anyways, I can honestly say that after 150 days the majority of the above have improved dramatically. But I have to keep reminding myself that it took years to get myself into this state so it will take an equal amount of time to get to where I want to be. 

To all those struggling, It takes time, not everybody experiences the ''pink cloud'' for sustained periods of time. Sometimes it can be just a fleeting moment of clarity or an intense feeling of joy while your standing in the shower one morning. 

I hold onto the belief that those moments will increase as time goes by. At the very least you can look at yourself in the mirror when you are feeling low and know its not because you are drinking. 

It's also worth remembering that issues that may have caused you to drink in the first place don't dissappear but the cons I listed above do and as a result you are more equipped to deal with your other shit. 

Anyways keep going it will be difficult but ultimately worth it.

I have been sober for 18 days. These nearly three weeks have been 8 months in the making. I know I must sound like a total noob to the sober Gandalfs on this sub (in my eyes, you're basically a wizard if you have been sober for a year or longer), but discovering that sobriety doesn't just happen like they portray it in Hollywood has been eye opening. For me, the road to this point has been very broken up and non-linear, fraught with failed attempts at quitting and messy relapses. I first sought professional help in February and did a detox. I fell off the wagon shortly after and did another detox in June. But this time feels much different... I finally feel like I have the commitment, desire, and foundation to do this for real.

Problem is, I really want some sober support. My partner is not sober, and does not understand addiction. For the first time, I do not crave alcohol when he is having his nightly beers (thanks to equal parts Gabapentin and will power). And most of my friends aren't sober. The one friend who is ""trying to get sober"" is not at the same stage as me on this journey and seems to post on social media about ""relapses"" for sympathy and validation which I find very gross.

Are there any sober social networking sites where I can make friends with other sober people? Or instagram accounts that inspire? I really want to make sober friends. I feel like it's the missing piece that will keep me on this sweet sweet sober road.

And doesn‚Äôt that damned wine witch think she‚Äôs got party rights here? Every day there‚Äôs a little whisper about how romantic it will be to sit with my hubs and a drink on the beach watching the sunset. How fantastic the rum is touted to be there. How it is unimaginable to not drink with our new ex-pat friends. On and on she drones- you get the idea because you‚Äôve all been there to one extent or another.

While this scares the chit out of me, at the same time, I feel a little more secure than I ever have over the past year of sobriety attempts. 

For every one of those taunts the bitch throws my way, my mind automatically counteracts with thoughts of:

(1) how absolutely scary it would be to find myself drunk in the jungle. What if I get lost? I‚Äôm terrible with directions stone-cold sober. One or ten drinks in, forget it. Someone has to take me home.

(2) the horrific effect island rum could have on my gut. Imagine puking right in front of these new face-to-face friends. These are folks I‚Äôve gotten to know online for a year, and we‚Äôve looked forward to meeting in person. Am I going to drink and throw up to ‚Äúcelebrate‚Äù - whaat?

(3) let‚Äôs pretend I don‚Äôt get lost or get sick. Maybe I have just one bottle of beer. *(I already feel that struggle. ""I want another beer. No, I can't have one more. But I WANT one, dammit.)* What will happen the next day?

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens‚Äîgood or bad‚Äîand invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let‚Äôs not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves.

There¬¥s been quite a few posts about cravings this week, so I wanted to share again the tool that made all the difference for me: HALT.

Whenever I wanted a drink, I would stop and check if maybe I was really Hungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired (some add an s for Stress). I usually was. The best solution for me was to stay one step ahead, by always being hydrated and keeping a piece of fruit or a light snack handy. Whenever I would foresee or feel a craving coming, I would drink water or juice or eat something and that would take the edge off the craving.

Personally I was delighted to learn that after 40 days that voice in my head nagging me to drink went silent. After some months, the sudden cravings were few and far apart. After a year, it was mostly bigger blows that made me want to drink. The urge to drink has been like a stormy sea calming down; the waves are fewer, slower, smaller.

Do I miss riding the waves like a crazy Captain Ahab? Sometimes, yes. Do I miss drowning in them, surrounded by spray, debris and wreckage? NO. Big NO. BIG - no. Calm seas are underrated.

Many cookies (Chessmen of course), fizzy waters and some helpless Swedish fish were consumed in the process, but not a drop of alcohol!

I‚Äôve been a big fan of the show for a long time now. If you watch or have watched the show, I‚Äôm curious to know what your opinion is of Kevin as he deals with his alcoholism. 

Kevin is my favorite character. Probably because I find his character to be so relatable. The way he depicted the despair, loneliness, and struggle of addiction was very real to me. Then seeing him work on himself and meet sober milestones definitely were good reminders for myself to keep going. Like we‚Äôre growing in sobriety together. 

Tbh it can be bittersweet to relate so much to a fictional character in a TV show because it‚Äôs a harsh remind of how real my addiction was/is. And at the same time I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs portrayed in an American sitcom because I‚Äôm not alone in this. Addiction is more common than many acknowledge. 

Anyways idk what the point is of this post. I don‚Äôt wanna give any spoilers about the most recent episode. But it really got me thinking...

Mental health holding me back,"Short story: **seeking advice re: alcohol use and BPD and relationships** : I want to quit drinking so badly for a plethora of reasons because it's making me fat and insecure and poor, but i feel like my BPD and possibly even my partner are holding me back. how do i move beyond the excuses and take control of my life??


Longer story: never used to drink (well, drank once every two months or so. 2 to 3 times a year I'd go to a bar with friends/coworkers. That's it). Got diagnosed with BPD 3 years ago. Started dating my bf a year and a half ago. He didn't drink much but then started drinking more and more and idk how it happened but I followed along. It went from never, to once a week, to a couple times a week, and now in the last six months it's been basically 5 to 10 drinks every day. Sometimes more. usually 2L of coolers a day. My bf is at like a bottle of tequila a day. Or sometimes like 12 coolers per day. 


Main problems are as follows:


- my bf doesn't have a car so often on my way home from work he'll send me money to pick him up drinks. I am so weak going into a liquor store and I end up buying for myself too if I'm there. Sometimes if I hesitate to stop or tell him I don't think it's a good idea, bf will even say he'll send me his money to cover my own drinks too... Very hard to resist. (He walks/skateboards to get his own drinks often, but it's been getting colder and sometimes it just doesn't workout. If it was anything other than booze I completely wouldn't mind a quick stop on my way home.)


- big problem: i absolutely hate my body now thanks to drinking. Have tried so hard to lose weight, eating 1200 calories per day and attempting to maintain a calorie deficit with food, but I know it's all down to the drinking. When I met him I was 5'11"" and 130 lbs (kinda underweight but I felt decent. Just needed some muscle tone)... Now I'm 180+ lbs (too scared to step on the scale now) and getting stretch marks in the last month. I feel like crying when I look in the mirror or try to get dressed. I've always had body/confidence issues but it's getting so terrible.


-  it's draining my money!!! I want to get more tattoos, travel post-covid, buy new furniture and adopt more animals and such... But I can't save any money when I'm spending $70 to $100 per week on alcohol!!! I make barely above minimum wage.


- I have an autoimmune disorder and a whole host of other mild to moderate health issues, and I'm sure alcohol is NOT helping my healing and probably exacerbating my issues. but it's the only way I've found to numb myself and my BPD mania/mood swings


- I'm almost down my bachelor's degree and have plans for getting a masters in anthropology. I want to save money for this. I also want to get healthy, and workout/get fit for the first time in my life. I want to have a passion for living. I feel like alcohol is exacerbating my depression and BPD, and holding me back. I want to take my responsibility for my life and health, and I want to encourage my partner to do the same!

I was going back through old posts and found one about my reaction to the election 4 years ago. My reaction was one of dread, like a mountain I'd never be able to climb.  I was about 2 years in to my sobriety at the time and the task at hand seemed impossible.

Fast forward to today, not only did I make it through (still sober), but I honestly feel at this point that I could make it through just about anything.  The last 4 years taught me more about becoming stronger through struggle, through not necessarily getting my way, than I ever could've imagined.

My elementary school aged kids have been remote-only learning for 3 months of last school year plus this entire year so far. 

When the pandemic changed our lives, everyone started drinking with a free pass. We claimed that we had nothing better to do, that we were too stressed to do it sober and that it was ok because everyone else was doing it too. By comparison with my friends, I felt suddenly like I didn‚Äôt really have a problem. 

The thing is that my bubble of support during our lock down was just finally catching up with my already established excessive drinking habits. Daily drinking, sometimes beginning in the morning and sometimes lasting into the next morning was my norm. I was sometimes unable to walk by a bottle of vodka without grabbing a swig. It was exhausting and irresistible. 

When it was clear that school was not reopening this year and I became excited at the thought of us at home during the day together working and learning and spending quality time, I knew I was lying to myself about that vision even being possible. With the way I was living I was going to just barely get by and miss really being part of the day so I decided to quit in order to have the energy to spend on something worthwhile and create what I hope will become good memories of this difficult time in our history. 

At first the plan was to get sober to start the school year off on a good foot but as time went by I didn‚Äôt see any opportunity worthy of breaking my sober streak. 

Here I am sober for the single longest stretch in 8 years. 

It worked!!!!

When I think about that warm feeling that comes over me mentally and physically after the first drink, I am not impressed. I can immediately feel that helpless, lead in my blood feeling and I don‚Äôt want to feel like that. 

Now that I can see how my drunk self lied to me about how much I needed alcohol to have fun and be confident and have good sex, I don‚Äôt want anything to cloud my experiences. I want to know how I really feel and react to the world around me. 

I want to be sober and I‚Äôm doing it one day at a time.

Why can't I just let her go already?  I don't know how many times I have to get my heart broke to make myself stop.

I had already gone off the round of valium for withdrawals, I felt sick and disgusted the last time I drank. I continued to take kratom for anxiety for 5 more days. The first day with no hangover from any drink or med, my cat collapsed. Ironically, both the extreme increase in drinking AND the frantic wait for medical attention to quit safely, was a reaction to his diagnosis of illness. Said illness was REVERSED a week after he was diagnosed, but I'd already leaned into drinking, and kept drinking for two weeks. When I quit, as I have in the past, the dr told me based on withdrawal symptoms that I should wait to get a medication to quit or go to rehab - rehab is MUCH easier said than done. Hell, I was supposed to start outpatient intensive rehab this month but my addiction counselor took several weeks off work. 

It's three weeks since Sebastian passed. I had laughing gas at the dentist yesterday and actually got through the day with minimal grief but still woke up 2 hours too early for full-sleep, I can't sleep past a certain amount of hours since he passed, no matter what. I accepted that he did NOT get into anything poisonous that day, so I remembered what I'd been struggling with before the vet threw poison as a possibility before ruling it out - that I had spent the last two hours of his life saying no because I was trying to get him to eat every 8 hrs instead of occasionally 6 and he was NOT having it. And that day, possibly the last time I held him pre-collapse, I thought ""this is the last autumn he'll ever have."" I affirmed two days ago that a medication I've been on for a couple years was really affecting my bond with him, and I actually was off of that med (and others, in fact, the lowest in years) for four hours that day but I told him, in that weird, melodrammtic way the universe has ""I have to go away now, but I'll be back soon."" Because I had tried going off Lyrica before but found that only after going off ANOTHER medication that my pain tolerance had increased and it seemed doable. It is a long, unsafe path to going off Lyrica ... I knew it affected me, I just thought I had more time with him. I thought I had time to sober from alcohol safely, and I thought I had time to be strict about eating. I told him verbally I was going to feed him after a walk and that we would spend months cuddling since I had repurposed my life to isolate for the winter. All this time, I thought my boy could understand me telepathically, but it was me who could not understand him. I told people I had two dreams that week of him asking to be let go but they poo-pooed me. I had the thought ""this will be the last autumn he ever has"" but didn't think the universe is so f\*\*king literal. I don't think I can get through 2021 without a cat, I have lost a ton of weight since he passed and it's affected me medically. The good news is I must have held him 2 or so hours a day, since he passed I weakened. The bad news is because Lyrica messed with my memories I don't recall it. The silver lining? When I skipped a dose the last two days, I remembered those 4 hrs and I KNOW he was happy at least for those 4 hours ... because I was happy.

Please tell me I can have a bond as strong with another cat someday, because he was my soulcat, and when I began struggling in recent yrs I told myself I would NEVER forgive myself if he passed before I righted myself..we made it less than one day. Does that count? The last words I said to him pre-collapse was ""no, in twenty minutes"" and he meowed with a broken  heart and sad eyes. So yeah, I cant eat or sleep but I'm sober....why I'm sober, I don't know. I lost the only thing I had left in my life, and the purest most unconditional love I'd ever experienced.

I lost my job due to the virus on April 1.  April 4 was my birthday and my husband didn't bother to get me anything.  April 12 he decided that he didn't want to be married anymore, and kicked me out.  My husband of 18 years.  We'd been together 24 years, since I was 17.  I was completely devastated.  I had no idea what to do or how to do it.  I moved in with friends for 3 weeks while I looked for a job and a place to live.  I still didn't drink during this time.  After 3 weeks, I got a job back at the post office where I had been before I got the new job.  I found a fully furnished house to rent and moved in.  Got to see my son again and arrange shared custody with my husband.  Got a lawyer and set things in motion.

Then I started drinking.  At first I justified it by thinking ""I've had an awful time, I deserve to drink after dealing with all of this"".  Then I stopped trying to justify it.  I just drank.  I would get home from work and immediately start drinking.  And weekends were the worst because my son goes to his Dad from Thursday to Sunday, so 4 days of no one around.  I went to the doctor a couple of months ago, but the doctor that helped me last time had left, and the doctor I saw this time told me he couldn't do anything for me until I'd been alcohol free for at least a week.  So I didn't bother.  To me that just showed how hopeless it was.

But Monday, it feels like a switch flipped for me.  It was a crappy day all around.  My husbands (I suppose I need to get used to saying Ex-husband) birthday, organising our son to get him a present and see him, my dog went missing, my sons phone broke.  And I was so damn busy I didn't have time to have a drink.  I got my son to see his Dad, I organised a new (used) phone for my son, and my dog came home on her own.  I looked back at the day and realised that if I had made one different decision, if I had decided to have a drink after work, I wouldn't have been able to do any of that.  So here I am, back here.  I'm going to get my week sober, and go back to the doctor.  And I am going to live.  IWNDWYT.",175,{'virus': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994491934776306}"

But here's what really helped me get through those last eight days, and what I intend to hang on to for the next several weeks: 

I told myself that all I have to do right now is four things: eat, sleep, go to work, and not drink. 

As long as I do those things, I can count my day as a success. 

And I don't mean ""eat healthy"" and ""go to sleep on a good schedule and get up early"" and ""catch up on all your backlog at work."" No. That's, like, Sobriety 2.0 for me. I'm sticking with the extra-simple version right now. As long as I show up to work and do as much as I can, as long as I eat some kind of food, as long as don't drink, nothing else matters to me right now. If I need to order delivery food, I can. If I want to nap on the couch for two hours or spend the evening watching TV (not something I normally let myself do), I can. If I'm eating candy, OK. Fine. As long as I'm doing those four things, that's all I'm holding myself to. 

So it's like I'm stripping my life down to the simplest level, and it's helping. At some point I'm sure I'll be beyond this, and will be able to start cooking more, or maybe taking a walk after work instead of watching TV, or maybe start my day with some yoga. But not yet. For now, I just have to keep myself at the simplest level of functioning, and not drink. Because that's enough, and I don't feel like I need to complicate it any further.

Honestly, life is pretty great. Since being sober I have managed to stick to a diet consistently for the first time in my adult life. I have reduced my weight by over 30kgs (64 pounds) to a healthy weight. I have started a new business. I no longer feel anxious all the time. 

But I have started to slip into thoughts that maybe I could have a drink and be fine. The only thing stopping me is the line I drew in the sand, that I will not drink today.

Last week I had to travel for work. I didn't realise how much my routine helps me stay sober. There were multiple occasions where I was hanging on by my fingernails. The conference was held at a gorgeous NZ winery - free wine tasting of course. Our AirBnB had left a free bottle of bubbly in the fridge. I had none of my usual alternatives to drink to hand. I really enjoy the odd heineken 0%, or I will have kombucha or even a coke at home to be an alternative to alcohol.

At the conference I felt really out of place, out of my comfort zone professionally speaking, and just overwhelmed by the day. I am genuinely proud of myself that I played the tape forward, and realised how disappointed I would be had I slipped. I stayed sober, sipped my water while others drank their wine, and then enjoyed a great NA mocktail at the restaurant for dinner.  But it was a hell of a close call!

I used to use alcohol as a social lubricant and even after nearly two years, I feel vulnerable in some social situations without it.  I am more reserved, quieter, and probably a good deal less fun than I used to be, but at least I don't wake up in the morning trying to figure out what I said that could have been inappropriate for the occasion.

r/stopdrinking has been instrumental in helping me in my sober journey, and I want to say thank you to all of you for sharing your stories.

I find for me, sobriety gets somewhat easier on the day to day routine, but it can still rear it's head and it needs to be respected every day.

I wake up feeling fine. We meet my brother in law at a park (where they also serve beer, wine, burgers, etc).

I had plans to spend the day with my son but the hangover had different plans.  I took him to daycare and spent the rest of the day nursing myself back to health.  

When my wife came home, we sat around the dinner table and I stated I was done drinking.  She was supportive but a little incredulous.  I couldn't blame her.  Drinking was a part of my identity. I drank nearly every day since we met seventeen years prior.  Hell, it was almost a part of our identity.  We used to keep a liquor bottle next to our bed in college and would sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and get a buzz together.  

Black out nights and liquor were long gone from my life by then. They were replaced by quality beers and wine.  I rarely became extremely drunk anymore choosing to stay in a state of buzzed purgatory never really being sober but also functional. 

I had an amazing wife, a toddler, family, friends, and a solid career.  Yet, drinking had an insidious hold on my actions.  Vacations and weekends revolved around the next drink.  My sleeping patterns were wrecked by alcohol, although this would be something I only realized later.  It just felt normal at the time to always feel tired.  

I had joined r/stopdrinking years prior after seeing someone mention it in an askreddit thread.  Drinking was now reminiscent of a chore instead of a good time.  I read your stories on a daily basis.  It was eye opening.  People actually didn't drink and enjoyed life.  I promised myself that I to would quit one day.  

That day was veterans day 2018.  The last two years have been the beginning of my second life.  I have learned more about myself the last two years then the thirty six year prior combined.  The determined choice to not drink has been relatively easy.  The consequences of that choice have not always been so.  

It took time for my brain to heal from its daily habit of forcing dopamine via the bottle.  There were periods of bleakness where the world seemed grey.  This slowly started to improve and by the end of the first year a solid trend of positive growth was established.  

This growth was helped tremendously by a member of this sub mentioning a course called mindfulness based stress reduction.  I found a free online course and took the eight week class.  It opened my eyes on an alternative way to approach the now and how to be kind to oneself.  This newfound love of self helped me grow in other ways both physically, mentally, and even monetarily.  My relationships with my wife, my son, my family and my friends have also benefitted.

I knew that I drank too much but never saw it as much of an issue. I never put anyone in danger, or drank to the point that it effected my work, or even made me unable to function after drinking. 

That said here is my story: My wife and I are expecting our first child in February and as part of that I applied for life insurance for the two of us. The wake up call was when I got the quote back from the insurance company and it said that I was being denied coverage because my GGT levels were 880. I am in otherwise great health, and these numbers were off the charts. 

I immediately decided to quit drinking. I haven't touch it since. I have told my wife, and a few coworkers that I have quit, and I am going to discuss this journey with my therapist later this week.  I am doing that so I have people who will help hold me to it. So I am also posting this as another part of my accountability, and to hopefully have an additional support structure.

I‚Äôd done this at my (sober) parents‚Äô house before, so I already knew all the tricks: a plethora of ready excuses to go to the store, how to hide the bulky boxes, how to angle my glass under the spout so the noise of liquid pouring wouldn‚Äôt give me away. Etc. 

I‚Äôm not sure what exactly triggered me to stop this time, but I‚Äôm so intensely grateful for it. Within a month of secret drinking, I‚Äôd ramped up to my usual proto-bender pace (a wine box every 2-3 nights, give or take). I was so hungover, every day‚Äîmy face was permanently bloated, covered in zits, and I couldn‚Äôt think straight enough to read (not great for someone studying history and English, lol). I‚Äôd thrown hundreds of dollars that I don‚Äôt have away on cheap lukewarm wine I didn‚Äôt even like. I hadn‚Äôt started drinking during the day again yet, but I could feel it coming, especially as the hangovers worsened. 

Anyway, today is Day 3, and I‚Äôm feeling good about it. Both my roommates happen to be out of the house, so while taking the trash out, I also grabbed an extra bag to finally collect all the hidden boxes, mini bota boxes, and other bottles from my room. No more incriminating evidence! And this time, they won‚Äôt immediately be replaced.

I have a job lined up at one of the most prestigious law firms in the world.  One of my best friends will be graduating with me, and then working at the same firm as me, albeit in a different office.   Life could not get any better. 

We are warned in law school that this profession is extraordinarily stressful, and that it comes with one of the higher rates of drug abuse and alcoholism.  My friend and I laughed each time we heard this warning.  We had been kicking ass all our lives and assumed we wouldn‚Äôt‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt‚Äîbecome just another statistic, like those \*other\* attorneys. 

It‚Äôs 2017.  My friend and I are billing an average of over 2,500 hours per year.  We work nights and weekends, and our personal lives are taking a toll, but we push forward.  I‚Äôm drinking more and more, in both frequency and quantity.  Unbeknownst to me, so was my friend. 

It‚Äôs 2018.  A senior attorney at our firm tells me that he found my friend passed out in his car in the firm‚Äôs parking garage, with bottle of scotch on the passenger seat, at 8am on a Saturday morning.  My friend goes to rehab.  

It‚Äôs the 2018 holiday season.  I am, as usual, sitting in my office.  My phone buzzes.  A message from someone I don‚Äôt know.  My friend was found earlier that morning in his home, dead from a heroin overdose. Heroin!  He and I had always enjoyed having a beer or two, and on rare occasion split a joint, but heroin is something else altogether.  

It‚Äôs the beginning of 2019.  The loss of my friend is taking a very significant toll on me.  I am drinking daily and heavily.  I fly to his funeral and get a DUI when driving home from the airport after.  

It‚Äôs the middle of 2019.  I‚Äôm trying to stay sober, but I‚Äôm struggling.  My 3+ year relationship with my girlfriend, who I am living with and intend to marry, is in a bad place.  Not entirely due to my drinking, but my drinking is making everything far worse. 

It‚Äôs the end of 2019.  My 3+ year relationship with my girlfriend, who I was living with, is over.  I‚Äôm now living alone.  I‚Äôm drinking, daily and heavily.  I hate my job.  Worst of all, I hate myself and who I have become.  I can‚Äôt stand to look at myself in the mirror.  

It‚Äôs the beginning of 2020.  I decide I cannot continue like this and I sober up.  This website helped a lot.  My ex, with whom I‚Äôm not speaking, decides for some reason to contact my parents and tell them I have a drinking problem and had gotten a DUI about a year ago.  I‚Äôm very upset by her decision to do this, but determine to be open and honest with my parents.  

It‚Äôs the middle of 2020.  I‚Äôm still sober.  I quit the job I hate and join a smaller, more lifestyle-friendly law firm.  

It‚Äôs nearing the end of 2020.  I‚Äôm still sober.  I‚Äôm happy at my new firm.  But I think about my late friend and ex-girlfriend each and every day, and remind myself why I don't want to drink today.",60,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9963741898536682}"

The bad news is that I'm not used to this at all anymore. I feel fucking awful. This is one of the worst hangovers I've ever had, and it's just because I don't know how to handle it anymore. It's not the norm.

Didn't drink or smoke Mon to Fri so I could function at my job. Had a week off 2 weeks ago and ended up going on a bender for 5 days. At the end of it I felt SO rough I actually thought I was going to die. I decided to give up and ended up pouring 2 litres of vodka down the sink and snapping up nearly 2 packs of cigarettes and throwing them away. I knew that if I carried on drinking the way I was I would die from it and knew I had to give up one day so I decided the time was now.

Now: In about an hour I will have been sober for 2 weeks. Feeling great about it. I was not tempted by alcohol during the first weekend because the sickness was still fresh in my memory. Weekend just gone I was tempted a bit on Friday and a fair bit more on Saturday but I resisted. I had a relaxing evening on Saturday evening and thought ""a drink to supplement this would be really nice"" but I rode out the urges as they were only temporary. It's a good job I tipped the vodka I had away otherwise it would only have taken 1 minute of weakness for me to poor a glass. I feel in good health and improving, sleep is so much better.

A few stats I have been tracking:

Calories saved through not drinking booze: 8716

Money saved from not buying fags and booze (aka my Treat Fund): ¬£118.20

Money spent from Treat Fund: ¬£222.90

Net Treat Fund: negative ¬£104.70

So yoiks I have overspent on my Treat Fund so far! Well I treated myself to a Samsung Tablet, a PS4 game and bought a few things to brighten up my house and make it look fashionable so it was money well spent. I also want to buy a few more furnishings so I expect to go further into the negative. But then I think spending on treats will go down in future weeks so I will get back into positive figures within a month as I am saving about ¬£60 a week.

That is one map we can follow. And it is our privilege to live and heal that route because along the way, we find and nurture our unique selves. Also, we can share our experiences with others and help them heal also, once we are ready to share and once they are ready to work on their own route.

Our abusers trashed our lives with their hatred. The painful wounds that keep playing out in our heads points us in the direction we need to go to heal those wounds and remove their obstacles. Those obstacles nag us because they are not a natural part of us. They aren‚Äôt at home; if they were, they‚Äôd chill out and settle down. 

Our one of a kind soul is trying to kick them out. So, what bothers you the most is where you start. No one has the right to tell you any different. 

For me, I had to begin by facing my monstrous family. I had to face the pain they buried deep inside me that haunted me, that drove me to drink, drug, act out, and overeat that still bothered me decades after I severed ties with them in late 1979 or early 1980s. I changed my location physically, but emotionally my path, covered in seething anger and bleeding, went with me everywhere. 

Back then, I didn‚Äôt know the extent of brain damage and emotional hurdles I faced. Being fragile, I needed the time to heal and gather my thoughts. I think in spring 2011, I began with my then therapist, and having recorded the sessions, I listened to them at home, alone where I could cry, uninterrupted.

In the past, I worried about hurting someone if I allowed myself to feel what I ran from. But I didn‚Äôt; when I accepted my pain, I cried and it hurt. But I got through it.

I saw and felt better firsthand. Not a huge amount, but better. The tiny voice inside me suffocating under the cruel lies and bleeding, hurt wounds that caused me to live my life in lies, distorting everything I did, breathed a little stronger.  So, encouraged, I kept going. 

Looking back, I see how my path is unique to me, just as your path is unique to you. The events that shape us will vary. Our perspective will be ours alone; it will differ even from our siblings. No one sees our world the same way we do. It is individual to each of us, alone. 

But the emotions? The emotions will be the same; shame, humiliation, embarrassment, isolation, and the rest we share. 

Our unique selves are suffocating underneath that pain. So, for our beautiful, one of a kind genuine, authentic selves to breathe and thrive, those obstacles need to go.

Because pain that nags us, desperate to go because it is not at home inside us, never gives up on receiving our validation so we can release it. Our soul, our inner self, is doing its job. It is looking out for our wellbeing and urging us in the direction we need to go so we can heal and live our life, the life we were born to live, including the pain we overcome and healed.",10,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9651429057121277}"

For some reason reading other people‚Äôs stories moved me enough to text my partner and tell them I will not drink today. 

That small commitment has turned into day 3 without tossing a 12 pack in the shopping cart without thinking, three days without calling my partner on the way home from work to see what kind of bottle we want from the liquor store that night. Three days without wondering how we‚Äôre going to move money around or return things in order to buy the last case of beer we can afford before pay day. 

It‚Äôs turned into three mornings where I don‚Äôt have to watch my gait at work in case someone notices me staggering down the hall. Three mornings of packing a lunch for the person I love before doing my self care and arriving to my job prepared, on time. 

Three days of thoughts that my mom would be so proud to know I‚Äôm sober, that she would be so overjoyed and supportive if she knew. 

I‚Äôm only a few months into 21 but have already lost so much to drinking. I‚Äôve damaged relationships and friendships that meant the world to me while destroying my reputation and integrity to plenty of other people along the way. 
This Spring I was two months away from graduating from the best nursing program in my state with a 3.7 and the entire world at my feet. Instead, I scored a box of cheap red and a bottle of good gin from a sleazy older tinder date and drank from 5pm until my life fell apart the next day. I was kicked out of my program and checked myself into a psych unit while in the ER once I detoxed that .322. Four years working my ass off to do what I love placed on indefinite hold, all because I thought maybe this time a five second pull from the bag would get me further away from my pain and self loathing. 

Even though I haven‚Äôt been sober since then I have been slowly waking up. I have gained traction against an eating disorder that has crippled me since age 15. I went from 90 lbs at 5‚Äô5 to 118 (!) I met my current amazing partner and we live happily together. I found a job that I love that will keep me ready to go back to school and allows me to live fully on my own for the first time. I‚Äôve given myself some of the tools I needed to regulate my mental health and I‚Äôm finally back on medication that works. 

Now I‚Äôm finally ready to lift the veil and remove the catalyst for my disease and all of its associated suffering. Day three no alcohol and I‚Äôm excited to see what more I‚Äôm capable of. IWNDWYT!",6,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8179121017456055}"

This time I am more prepared though.

This is the measures I have taken to help me cope when I get back. Wish me luck

- Joined a gym (but my country is back in lockdown so it's a no-go for now)

-started tracking my weight. It is strangely how motivational it has been  seeing my weight loss over the previous 2 weeks.

-ordered 1month worth of food. If I don't have to go to the grocery store. I don't have to get tempted by the rows of beer.

- Bought new camera equipment. I need a hobby to take me outdoors and away from my habit of gaming drunk. 

-sold my gaming rig and playstation. I realized this was a major trigger for me. Immersing myself into a fantasy world while drunk to escape the real world

- installed the ""I am sober"" app to track how much money I save. And remind me that alcohol was taking me down a route to soon financial ruin.

Planning on finding a support group with online meetings to join. Any and all tips it is appreciated.

I don't know why I wrote this. Mostly for my own motivation I guess. :-)

Update: Day 2 of willpowerd sobriety. Achievements so far.

- Started tidying up my apartment.
- went for a walk with my new camera.
- measured a healthy blood pressure for the first time in over 5 years. 125/77

-tried to go for a run. Managed 1.5k steady jog followed by 3k of brisk walk. Average heart rate 163bpm, max hr 197. I litterary fainted for a few sec. when I sat down in my apartment.

- posted a headset to get it fixed... 6month overdue.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens‚Äîgood or bad‚Äîand invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let‚Äôs not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn‚Äôt:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I have a magical artifact in my livingroom. It¬¥s chest high, black, mostly iron, some glass, and in the mornings and the evenings there¬¥s a colourful display radiating a gentle warmth.

Yeah it¬¥s a wood stove. The magic? A few years ago I cut down a 30 meter/100 feet pine in the yard, and slowly, inch by inch, fed it to the stove.

*It disappeared.* The whole tree disappeared.

There¬¥s a stove in my mind too. For a long time it was fuelled by alcohol. I shoved so much stuff into it and it would just disappear, albeit leaving a mess of ashes and soot. After I quit alcohol I have become more aware of all the stuff I used to burn. It¬¥s here, but I can deal with it now, look at every item before I put it in, or put it aside. I¬¥m not just burning everything recklessly, or choking the fire. I¬¥m handling the bad stuff better, and keeping more of the good stuff. It¬¥s a lot less messy. It¬¥s magical.

Do you have means to handle stuff? A friend, a run, a workshop?

I‚Äôve quit before. Earlier this year, I went 21 days without a drink as part of a fitness-centered lifestyle challenge that demanded it. It wasn‚Äôt so hard. I have no DUIs. When I read people‚Äôs stories of how bad alcoholism has fucked up their life, I‚Äôve gotta say, I‚Äôm just not there. I‚Äôve argued pretty passionately with my wife, once or twice in front of our children, and those have been very ugly. But our marriage is pretty strained by other issues that have nothing to do with alcohol. I wish I could say, ‚Äúwhenever I stop drinking it‚Äôs like the sunshine is a warm smile on my face and life feels good, and blah blah blah,‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt feel that way to me.

2020-11-11 01:22:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/js2yoy/then_there_are_the_better_days/,Then there are the better days.,"My relationship with sobriety is complicated. It's not staying sober that's the problem, it's the experience of sobriety itself I struggle to cope with. So. With 1.5 months in I realise it's early to paint the state of sobriety with a broad brush, but it's the only brush I've got.

 A couple of weeks ago I had a small flute of white wine, you see. I wanted it, I was curious about it, and I knew that if I had more, then in a few hours I wouldn't be able to drive home.

*Two sips in* I'm sitting there with the warming glass in my hand listening to the head of my college department give the closing speech of his art exposition and think ""man, drinking this thimbleful of wine is a fucking chore."" And so I put  the glass down and got water instead, because I've come to realise that for me it's the ritual of drinking something and holding something in my hand that's a *huge* contributor to why I drank. I seem to possess a slew of OCD-adjacent behaviours and I've got ADHD so all of these rituals, and the numbing effect of alcohol are what I've used as an adult to 'ground myself'. So now I know what to do. Get myself some water to keep the hands busy and oral fixation satisfied while I navigate a social situation with a lot of 'noise'. 

I don't need it anymore. I'm not gonna tempt myself anymore either, but it did give me back some semblance of a sense of self-control, that for once in my life I can put the glass down and not be thinking about it all night. It's important, and I don't consider it the 'reset of the counter'. In fact, fuck the counter, I'm not gonna play myself into setting myself up for failure like that, sobriety isn't something I accumulate, it's simply a state of being that I refuse to try and count.

What I wanted to get to, though, was this: I find the sober world loud and overwhelming. And I'm no shy violet, I may be introverted, but I live very outwardly, and boy do I enjoy a raucous party. At first it was like fucking spikes to my brain with no alcohol to help, but I've been slowly getting used to it. I can  start and hold a conversation with people again while sober (even if I do stumble over my words a lot - I had a much easier time speaking fluidly without losing the train. Anybody else experience this? Suddenly not being able to speak in coherent sentences?). I try to find joy in small things such as not waking up with hangover. Not hiding flat 1/4 fifths of spirits in my mattress or pockets of pants hanging in my closet. Being able to drive. Not wasting time - I feel like days are slowing down and where at first it felt insufferable, was I not always pissing and crying about how on the cusp of 30 time seems to pass far more quickly than it did at 20?

Sure, when you drink for the reasons I did, then there's a period of building a callus against the loud input of the world, but it's happening. I cope. I deal with all the anger I have, and it's made me an assertive, capable person as opposed to someone who just seethes and poisons the air.

*Hell,* even my voice's getting lower, I always squeaked while drunk and it took me a while to speak in a more relaxed fashion even when sober. I shower regularly, my face has slimmed down as the alcohol bloat leaves. I can drive without worrying about fumes. These physiological things matter to me as I'm less cerebral and more physical in how I tend to communicate and deal with the world. 

I asked a question when I first started out: who the fuck am I even without alcohol, given that I've never experienced real sobriety while adult. I felt misaligned, you know, like when you're hammered and seeing double, but I'm coming into focus now.

So who am I when sober? 

I'm mad as all hell, apparently, but that'll have to do.

Who would have thought?,"My, my, my, how the time flies by when you‚Äôre sober. And my apologies for the lengthy post. Sober people have lots to say I suppose...

On October 3rd, 2020, I hit 2.5 years without a single drop of alcohol. I still recall vividly the night of my 5th into my 6th day of sobriety back in May of 2018. I laid in bed, fresh from the hospital where I had been diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis. My wife, God bless her, slept softly next to me, yet rest would not come for my body nor my soul.

I stared into the darkness for hours, enveloped by the quiet of the night. I allowed my mind to wander through the uncomfortable truths that lay before me, at times embracing my anxiety as it was the only option in moments of fear. I also pondered the future, or more specifically, if there was a future given my state of health at the time. The seconds seemed to drip slowly through the space-time continuum at a pace that could only be compared to a funeral dirge, ever so quiet and heavy with uncertainty.

There I was, barely 37, caught between life and death, a long-suffering wife by my side and a two-year-old son in the next room asleep. My skin and the whites of my eyes were still yellow from the build up of bilirubin that my liver was not processing. I had just spent two nights hospitalized with severely deranged blood work and the aforementioned jaundice. No one could tell me the extent of the damage done or where things were going to go from there.

In the quiet of that night, I agonized over my past as well. The gravity of my drinking finally began to crush my ego under its weight. I had wasted so much time, I thought, and wasted the good will of others. I had become a person whom I despised, and all of this was taking place on top of the post-acute withdrawal I was experiencing. I remember thinking that if I could just make it to that 6th day...if I could just bear with the unease and push through, minute by minute, I would be ok eventually.

So, now, 2.5 years later, I am, indeed, ok. To say that the turnaround in my life has been drastic is an understatement. These 2.5 years have been nothing short of miraculous, and I can only give God the glory for blessing me with love, support, healing, and strength. The journey TO sobriety was one thing, but I‚Äôve learned that the journey THROUGH sobriety is another beast altogether.

Early in my sobriety, maybe the first year, I still thought about drinking everyday. I suppose this was more out of habit as I, like many alcoholics, had become accustomed to reaching for alcohol as a way to cope with life‚Äôs ups and downs. This mental dependence ultimately required much more work to overcome than the short time spent dealing with physical withdrawal. In fact, I dare say this process is still taking place right now, and it may very well be something I will be working through for the rest of my life.

This isn‚Äôt to say that I want to drink. No, in fact, I abhor the idea of drinking and have no desire to drink, no cravings, nothing like that. Instead, I find that I‚Äôm still re-learning ways to ‚Äúbe‚Äù without distractions like alcohol. Alcohol only served as the distraction because of its availability. If it wasn‚Äôt alcohol, it would be something else. It‚Äôs an age-old bit of understanding that addiction to alcohol or anything else is often due to feeling incomplete, as if there is a hole that needs to be filled.

This seems to be common in alcoholics and may explain why some people become addicted to alcohol and some do not. There is a missing puzzle piece, and alcohol fits into the hole perfectly at first. Over time, however, that replacement becomes worn and jagged, its edges no longer conforming. Before long, the replacement puzzle piece that is alcohol begins to warp and shift the entire puzzle, throwing the picture out of alignment and confusing the details.

Today, I try to embrace the imperfection that is life, and this allows me to be more content when things fall apart. Instead of trying to control everything and keep a death grip on my sanity, I allow the process to work as the process works. I can‚Äôt control everything. In fact, there is very little I can control; however, I can make choices about what I put into my body, and I can determine whether I give in when times get tough. I can also choose to be educated as to how those things affect me and those around me. This is not new knowledge, but the idea of caring about myself, caring FOR myself, is still a fairly new concept. This is the work I am putting in.

Regarding my health. I have never been given a diagnosis of cirrhosis, but I did take a FibroSure test a year ago that indicated I had F4 liver fibrosis, which is stage 4, end-stage liver disease, meaning advanced scarring and cirrhosis. My blood work continued to recover, but that F4 result left me very troubled.

Last month, I had another ultrasound done, and while the results stated my liver was very course and stiff, a followup FibroSure test now said my fibrosis score had dropped to an F3, which is still not good news by any means, but it shows that healing has taken place. With God‚Äôs grace and my continued attentiveness to my health, I believe I can continue to improve. My lab work has also dramatically improved with liver function being restored to almost normal levels across the board. The few things that are still out of line are very close to normal, so once again, I believe that through prayer and a dedication to healthy living, improvements will continue. I have cut out almost all sugar, no fast food at all, drinking coffee every day, cut way back on the carbs, eating whole grains and fresh fruits and even added in some spinach...that kinda‚Äô stuff.

I do have to meet with a liver center to discuss a transplant, and that is not something I want to have to do. I‚Äôve been told by my gastro doc that he doesn‚Äôt believe that I need a transplant and that I likely wouldn‚Äôt even be considered for a transplant at this time because I‚Äôm too well; however, he wants me to meet with the team WHILE I‚Äôm well given the possibility that I could become sick and be in need of a transplant in the future. I suspect that this is because of the relapse rates among alcoholics, so the idea may be to show that I am and have been sober just in case there is a question if a transplant becomes a necessity.

That‚Äôs one frustrating things about recovery. Short of taking blood tests or a Breathalyzer test throughout the day every single day, there‚Äôs no way to PROVE to anyone who doesn't live with you that you haven‚Äôt been drinking. Therefore, despite sobriety, I will live with the stigma of alcoholism and the outlook by medical professionals that I am likely to relapse at some point. It‚Äôs unfortunate, but the statistics back up their thinking, so I have to go along with it. All I can do is remain sober and do my best to take care of my body, mind, and spirit.

As for my mental, emotional, and spiritual health, I‚Äôm enjoying the return to living as I was designed. It‚Äôs interesting because I feel like it‚Äôs not until someone knows what it‚Äôs like to live abnormally that living normally then becomes a blessing. People who have not experienced addiction may not know just how nice it is to wake up without a hangover, start the day without feeling sick to their stomach, plot and plan throughout the day as to when the drinking can begin, and then try to find the easiest and earliest excuse to have a drink.

The simple joys of spending time with my wife and son are overwhelming at times in just how nice and calm those moments can be. It brings me back to my childhood in many ways where ordering pizza and watching a family movie on a Friday or Saturday night was such a treat. There is goodness and wholesomeness in those moments, and I don‚Äôt think I could appreciate the time as much had I never known what it felt like to exist within a world of alcohol-induced chaos.

In any case, I am thankful. Thankful for this forum to read from and learn. Although I rarely post, I still read on a regular basis. Both as a reminder that I‚Äôm not alone, but also for a chance to pray silently for all who are afflicted by addiction, that they may come to know sobriety and enjoy all of the amazing benefits that it brings with it. I know what it feels like to be addicted. I have been there. I am still a work in progress in my recovery and rehabilitation as a human. I don‚Äôt take that for granted.

For anyone struggling with the idea of getting and staying sober, know that you are not alone. That can be difficult to actualize from an Internet stranger, but it is true as evidenced by the multitude of Internet strangers all sharing their struggles and triumphs. Sobriety for me is path. It has not always been easy, and it has forced me to make many changes in order to become who I am today, but I much prefer the sober me to the alcoholic me. Perhaps you will feel the same about the sober you.

So far 12 days. Did go about a month without drinking back in August, and for four months further in the past. I do feel more serious about quitting for good now. Honestly, after all of these years drinking - I think I finally better understand why I really want to quit now - sure I don't want to chance groping any females, but it's really because I hate having to think about drinking all of the time - even when I limit my consumption it controls my thoughts, my weekends, and robs me of my peace of mind. 

I am concerned about how I'll cope with my friends and co-workers that drink, but I am seeing some folks start to quit which is promising, and at this point I don't care about any social ramifications that may come from not drinking.

It's a small accomplishment because I've done it hundreds of times over but at least it's somthing.  I woke up this morning and I felt good.  I only had one drink this past Sunday so yesterday was my first, truly sober day.  Past two nights I've had plenty of rest and sleep so I woke up feeling pretty good today.  I woke up and sat on the side of my bed and I breathed.  Slowly.  Breathed in and hold for just a few seconds and breathed out slowly.  Listen.  I listened to my breathing and I can feel the tension in my shoulders lessen.  I did this for three to five minutes and I was ready to start my day.

I did everything I normally do in the morning except for a couple of things different.  I didn't look on social media or any news or anything while I got ready.  Took my shower and listened to the music in my head.  There's always music in my head as soon as I get up and around.  Does that happen to you guys too?  I made my breakfast of sausage and egg with wheat toast and a glass of water, another thing I don't usually do.  I usually make breakfast to take to work or don't eat breakfast at all.  Then it was off to work.

I did things differently at work as well.  Thoughts and reflection on what I'm trying to accomplish were present and loud in my mind.  The thoughts of quitting drinking are heavy.  I came home for lunch instead of rushing though it at work.  

After work I went and bought a couple of ready made meals that are more calorie conscious than I usually eat.  I eat bad.  And I eat worse foods when I drink.  Today was breakfast.  Then a green salad with bbq chicken breast for lunch.  And a shrimp and pasta dish for dinner.

My friend invited me to hang out with her tomorrow after work.  This will help to distract me as well.  She will not be drinking and that's a good thing.  So, hopefully I will have a good day tomorrow.

I just wanted to write out my day so I can reflect on it.  It's 8:30 and I'm already getting sleepy.  Headed for bed soon so I can get an early start.  I woke up late today and I'm going to shift the waking up a couple of hours earlier.  I want some time to myself in the morning to breathe, think, prepare for my day.

Thanks for listening.

When I first joined AA, one thing that worried me and made me wary was wondering if I would be expected to forgive all harms in order to be a ""good"" sober person or even to stay sober. My early experience with sponsorship was with someone who did believe strongly that in order to remain sober, we must all find our fault for every resentment or harm done to us and we must also forgive those harms. To them, this was a very black-and-white matter and there were no exceptions. And that worked for them!

But that way of thinking did not work for me in AA. I'm a survivor of rape and abuse. My abuser has never shown remorse, and as such I have no interest in forgiving him and don't believe he deserves it. For me, forgiveness must be earned with amends, as I'm taught elsewhere in the program. I also do not accept the idea that I must find ""my part"" in being abused or raped. 

Luckily I fell into a different sponsorship line populated by many survivors. This new sponsor instead suggested that instead of looking for ""my part"", I look for areas where my reactions to situations are still outsized or undersized due to that trauma. Instead of aiming for forgiveness, I could aim for letting go. I pass that on to sponsees as well.

Do not let anyone tell you that finding where you are at fault for abuse and forgiving abusers is necessary for sobriety. I'm here, five years in, to tell you it is not.",57,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988014698028564}"

I have now spent 6 months climbing out of the terrible hole of alcoholism and digging further and further down the delightful twists and turns that comprise the Coffee Snob Rabbit Hole. I've spent around $400 on specialty beans, fancy drippers and brewers, and one **very** nice hand grinder, and I've done it with maybe half of my alcohol budget.

Plus, the coffee makes me more productive, and it's a fun and enriching hobby that I can share with others. Alcohol was about me literally choosing not to experience the next 18 hours of life, and I was deeply ashamed of it. I still have moments where that sounds like the best thing in the world. And now, when those moments come up, I take the thirty-or-so dollars I might have spent on a handle of cheap liquor and I throw them at some natural process Ethiopian beans or a new brewer. That has worked every single time.

I've been sober for 4 years as of yesterday. I see many people in their 20s posting here who are either sobering up or wanting to. I'm 29f and sobered up at 25 and I promise all the young people that it is so worth it! For the longest time I told myself I was okay because I wasn't physically addicted and could stop anytime. But I was not okay, and it was not easy to stop. When drinking became my preferred method of self-destruction, I started hitting the bottle hard.

I've always been on the depressed side, battling some issues with abuse from my childhood. I drank to self medicate. I never drank every day, but I ALWAYS wanted to and could get really irritable if I had to go several days between binges. When I did drink, usually a few times a week, I almost always blacked out and made stupid decisions. My life began to center around drinking and counting down to when I could drink again. I would drink, throw up, and then throw back a few more shots. I would wake up in the mornings in fear of what I might have texted to people the night before. 

After one extremely terrible night, my boyfriend refused to pick me up from the hospital the next morning until I begged him enough that he gave in. He wanted to break up, said he really wasn't happy with me anymore but wanted to give it a few more days. We talked about it again, and he said he didn't think leaving me would make him happy either. He said he just wanted me to get better. And said if I drink again then he was definitely gone (this was after I made several attempts to sober up but couldn't go a week or two without caving). 

So at first I sobered up trying to salvage our relationship. But as I managed to get some real sober time under my belt, I stayed sober for me. I actually started to deep dive into my problems to see how I could work on resolving them and becoming a better person. I started to lose weight and I've lost 50 pounds overall. My physical and mental transformation has been nothing short of amazing. It was seriously the best decision I've ever made. I still struggle with urges from time to time, and sometimes I can get so consumed with thoughts of drinking that I feel paralyzed, but so far so good. I just try to ride out those moments.

Today was Day 1. I made an account here and joined this community (after a year of lurking) and I‚Äôm so happy with all the resources and support I‚Äôve already gotten. 

Day 1 wasn‚Äôt fun. I‚Äôm brutally hungover, but I didn‚Äôt have that ‚Äúhair of the dog‚Äù drink. My stomach is killing me and I‚Äôm dry heaving every couple hours, but I didn‚Äôt have a greasy fast food meal and I cooked something relatively healthy with the groceries I had. I‚Äôve been drenched in sweat all day, but instead of laying in bed I cleaned my house and did the laundry. The anxiety has been overpowering at some points, but I took out the garbage and broke down all the empty cases of beer I had accumulated. I made my bed. I talked to a friend I hadn‚Äôt in a while. I‚Äôm going to read a book before bed. I downloaded the Headspace app, and posted for the first time in the daily check in thread. 

It was a productive day, I reminded myself of all the things I can do when I‚Äôm not drinking. It was a hard day, and I anticipate many more hard days. I know I won‚Äôt always be this productive, but I know that I won‚Äôt be drinking.

Sadly I knew so much about health and wellness I also knew exactly what to do to destroy myself. I didnt want to take others with me and statistically if you kill yourself 5 people who know you will be so heavily affected they will also attempt suicide. I wanted to heal the world not take people down with me. I had myself convinced id be doing the world a solid in some weird way.

At least I'm out of bed, started the day on my terms, and gave myself the opportunity to meditate. I still feel terrible and tired, but every morning I do this is accumulating into my completely drained and deficit treasury of energy, willpower, and happiness. Soon, on this path I'll have enough to fully support myself, my family, and eventually I'll have enough to share with everyone else, to build our communal treasury of joy and combat suffering, which is truly my greatest desire.

I went to bed fairly early (10 PM) and even had a bunch of water and a banana. I woke up just crushed by a lot of feelings, mostly driven by my depression which was in a lot of ways fueled by my drinking. I had hit a wall, again. I called into work and decided this was my day 1, for real. That day sucked. I could hardly get out of bed, and I felt ashamed. That week crept on, and so did the following weeks. About 3 weeks in I knew I had turned a corner.

I now have a call every two weeks from my psych nurse to monitor me. Last week I had a particularly bad day at work after a couple very stressful weeks, I bought some alcohol on my way home but I managed not to drink it. I told my nurse about this as it's the first time I've given in and bought alcohol since being sober, but it's also the first time ever I've bought alcohol and managed not to drink it. She told me I've done well but then she asked me whether I wouldn't want to have a drink once in a while. Asked me ""but don't you feel like you're missing out, though?""

I don't want to rant about her in particular but just about that way of thinking in general.

Growing up there was always the peer pressure to drink. Since we were 13-14 people would be drinking every weekend, my group of friends didn't drink at the time but they started a couple years later. Once I was 18 even my mother was encouraging me to start drinking despite my father having been an alcoholic since he was pretty much a teenager. Once I was in my 20s people would tell me I should give it a go as soon as they found out I didn't drink. I could understand this to a certain extent given the drinking culture in some places. But it baffles me that anyone would imply or straight up say I should give drinking a go *after* having a drinking problem for two years to the point where I was drinking every day and I was showing up to work with a hangover more than once. Especially when I make it clear that I know myself well enough to see that ""one drink"" will never be just one drink for me.

With some people there's always this attitude of ""yeah drinking can be a problem, but you could always have a drink here and there socially, maybe have a beer on weekends"". I understand people can enjoy and have a good time drinking, and to be clear I have no issue with that, I just want to be left alone in my choice not to drink. I can handle those comments, I'm confident in my decision to remain sober for the foreseeable future, it's not like I'm going to be persuaded into drinking. It just gets a bit annoying to keep hearing that kind of stuff.

Do I feel like I'm missing out on anything? Not really. Would I enjoy one drink? Yes. But is it worth it? Absolutely not. I know a drink is a slippery slope for me, I've had a drinking issue, there's a history of alcoholism in one side of my family, my liver is already slightly damaged from drinking, I'm on medication with which you shouldn't drink. I have no reason to drink.

I didn't decide to stop drinking the last time I drank. I didn't want to stop. I was aware I was destroying myself and I was fine with it. I just happened to end up in ICU the next day and then in a psych hospital. I obviously couldn't drink because I was inpatient, I had no choice. Then I started to get better and for the first time in my life I wanted to be alive and I had some hope, so it became clear to me I couldn't allow myself to drink again once I was discharged.

For the first time ever I have my mental health under control, I have a clear diagnosis and effective medication, I have energy, I'm able to work full time and to do well at work, I'm able to enjoy doing things, I don't have to constantly fake being in a good mood, my liver function has slowly been getting better. I'm just happy to be alive and to have a future. It's taken me a lot of effort and hard work to get to where I am after hitting absolute rock bottom. I couldn't go any lower than where I was and I'm not going there again.

So I have a boss who likes to call me to complain about everyone at work. At first this was very lighthearted and I was thinking, 'Great, he just wants to confide in me.' But now he's started complaining about ANYONE who has had mental health issues or drinking problems, saying that essentially those issues don't exist and anyone who says they are suffering from either is just being soft or dramatic. 

I am personally offended by what he says (and I guess offended on behalf of the other people)... He knows I don't drink, and has been asking me for a long time why I don't.

In April 2020 I was doing 18 2oz shots a day, sometimes beer on top. Daily. Next morning, I'd be sick throughout the day until I had a beer after work to calm down the shakiness. I decided at that point to start cutting back, I went from 18 to 12, next day still got sick. I got it to under 10, next day still got sick, however I stuck with it and got it to 4-6 - \*just enough\*. Over time, I got to last month and finally had a morning where I was not sick, a tiny bit shaky. I kept it going, up down up down, sometimes 3 sometimes 7 etc. A couple weeks ago, I finally was able to not have anything and went 5 days. Last weekend came, and I had drinks with my SO one night, and on Sunday as well. Nothing hard, just some wine and a couple beers. 

Monday (yesterday) and I didn't get sick, didn't have any shakiness (freaking awesome!). 

Now if you were as bad as I was, or worse, or even half - you KNOW how things are right? Are you TIRED OF THIS CRAP? YEA? 

Take a break. If you can do it without getting sick, shaky  - DO IT. Don't make excuses like ""I need it to sleep"" that's what got me. EVERY night I was scare, nervous about sleeping. I was so freaking OBSESSED ON IT. I'd save a double shot or more just before bed for it. Just stop it. 

You're mind will see things. It will make it easier to stop in the future. Right now? I could not EVEN IMAGINE stopping. After I had a 5 day run, I was ok with having some on the weekend, and Monday came and I was like ok cool we good. Maybe you're mentally not there. I get it. I was too. Justifying your mind to have something because A) you worked hard all day B) you did something and 'deserve' it. c) someone pissed you off, and you need it. 

All the excuses are just that. Excuses. There is \*ALWAYS\* going to be something that you think warrants a drink. ALWAYS. The sun is up. The sun is down. Your team won. Your team lost. It's a blue sky. Now it's night. The water is cold. The water is warm. The dog ran off. The dog came home. You got a new job. You lost a job. Your carpet is dirty. Oh now it's clean......just stop it.

Now, if you are stressing about sleep - I feel you. First night was not great. However, I was able to turn off all the lights, read a book and get tired. If you can, read in bed - be fully ready to go to sleep. It took 3-5 days before sleep was like a few hours straight then having issues waking up and going back to sleep. Take a few days off, try 3 at first. Someone said by that 3rd day, you'll be so tired you'll sleep better. They were right! It wasn't GREAT but it was like hey, I can wake up in morning and not be a dumpster fire.

Regardless if you are planning to fully stop, or intervals or whatever. Give yourself a break, and see what you see. You'll be surprised.",18,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9952399730682373}"

Last Friday at 5:30 AM, I pulled into my driveway with three kids to conclude a two week, 2,956 mile trip that included 45 hours of driving. I got all of their homework from school, I used my hot spot for my step son to do virtual learning in the truck, and I took them to see their grandmother one last time. 

About this time last year, my grandfather was in the same situation. Instead of loading the kids up, I left them with my wife and flew by myself. It was easier that way, I didn't have to drive, it was cheaper, I could drink on the plane, yadda yadda. I spent about 10 days visiting grandpa, and spent about half a day total sober. I sat next to this dying man, a recovering alcoholic of 30 odd years, chugging Black Cherry White Claw out of a 7-11 Big Gulp, telling everyone I had grown a new affinity for Sprite (I drink soda about as often as I \*used to\* pray, never). I told myself I was spending time with him, but in reality I was my usual selfish self, only worrying about maintaining a functioning level of drunkenness from wake to sleep. 

I am 63 days sober tonight at 9:45 PM. I told my family I was checking myself into a rehab facility a few months back, so grandma knew what I was going through and expressed her pride in me constantly. Unfortunately, some marital issues arose during the trip so I was distracted quite a bit, but last night when I got the news she had passed, a thought popped into my head, ""at least you were sober, at least you'll remember being with her, at least you kissed her good night that one time instead of being busy sneaking a drink, at least you played that board game with her three times in a row, at least you cared enough to drive 22 hours, one way non-stop with three kids so that they could see her one last time."" I will remember seeing my grandma one last time and I know that bringing the kids to see her made her day for those two weeks.

63 days ago, that would not have been me. This isn't my first two month chip, but it's the first where I have actually allowed myself to embrace spirituality and the AA methodology. I'm discovering so many more joys now that I'm focusing on something other than just not drinking. I wasn't always the best person drunk, but instead of drowning in remorse and regret, I am embracing the six years of my life I drank away because the memory of that absolute pit of despair and fuckedupedness makes every day I actually remember an absolute gift.

I‚Äôve always had a special skill of being able to drink more than most. More than anyone I‚Äôve partied with. 
I was always the last man standing at sun up. 
Wine, tequila, sambucca, vodka, gin, jaeger, bourbon, scotch, beer, cider, mead, anything and everything. 

I‚Äôve been self medicating since 15 when my family, friends and the school had me admitted to an institution for drinking too much. 
I got out and just ramped it up for 25 years. 
Weekends from age 15-20. 
Every second day from 20-30 then boom, every day since then. 

I‚Äôm now 40 and I drink 10-15 beers a night. Every night. Sometimes many more a night. 
The only days I have not had a drink was after a 20+ drink event. 
Maybe I‚Äôve had 10 alcohol free days in the last 5 years. Maybe. 

I‚Äôm a functioning alcoholic. I always worked (up until covid). Always had money, family and friends. 

Life is actually awesome. I‚Äôm healthy that I know of. Doctor says I‚Äôm fine. 

I just know that it won‚Äôt last much longer. 
I‚Äôm thinking of booze at midday then trying to delay that first drink. 
Most days I give in and hit the bar at 3pm latest and drink non stop for 7 hours. 
Alone most of the time. 

I‚Äôm rarely hungover. 

I‚Äôm really good at this. 
Too good. 

So today is day one. 
I will not drink at all today or tomorrow. 

Any info on what to expect from now would be greatly appreciated. 
Withdrawals, coping tips, potential triggers.. 

Thanks all. Hoping I can sleep now and I‚Äôll see you all, sober, tomorrow.",173,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9935426712036133}"

I am lost and could use some words of encouragement/advice. I'm 29F and applied for a group psychotherapy last year to deal with my social anxiety. I got in, but they wanted me to start working on my alcohol use with another therapist first. So I did that. Yesterday, they informed me that they were shocked by the severity of my addictive behaviors and that they were not letting me into the group therapy anymore, unless I dealt with my addiction first. They said I have a thing called 'intermittent addiction', whatever that may be, and that it's one of the most difficult types of addiction to battle, because of the behavioral aspect. This means that I have to start therapy at a more specialized facility.

I am angry, sad and hurt that they are taking away my group therapy. I only drink on weekends and I can't shake the feeling that it 'isn't this bad' and that they are overreacting. On the other hand, the mere thought of no more alcohol scares the shit out of me and makes me nauseous. I feel like a 'fake' addict because I'm 'not that bad' and while I know their intentions are great (I've had other therapies with this facility before and they are seriously the best), I'm just so so so angry. 

What do I do now? I'm considering dropping the group therapy but I REALLY want to do it, which means that I have to quit drinking. Can anyone offer some insight?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.994813084602356}"

2020-11-10 09:31:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jrlxfk/im_a_single_mom_and_i_need_help/,I‚Äôm a Single mom and I need help,"Well, I‚Äôm a single mom. I left their father 2 years ago and that‚Äôs when it began. The twins were 9 months, we moved from Las Vegas to Dallas and things went down hill and fast. I began drinking in 2017 and it progressed into an addiction that led into other addictions. I never let any of it get to the point of needing rehab and when I was binging, I always made sure the girls were at my moms or sisters for the night. But recently I had a night where I felt so emotionally drained and wanted to be completely done drinking. 
In 2017 I became depressed with the ‚ÄúBaby blues‚Äù. It was many of things that added up. Ex: I gained 130 pounds during pregnancy, my husband was unhappy because I was so done being pregnant, I was done with his abuse, mentally physically, and spiritually. I was broken down to the bone during the end of the 2nd term. After they came out the feelings of anguish guilt shame regret were all still in full swing and I picked up Quervo gold and he‚Äôs always loved me. I drank myself into a dark angry hate filled pool of dreaded depression and along came anxiety. 
I finally left their father in December 2017 and things were not ok. His mom died so we sold the cat and condo to move back to Minnesota to be with his dad(which added to my onset) and a long story short, my kids and I ended up in another city in the same state at my moms. 
My moms and I relationship has never been good, so as I‚Äôm trying to leave my husband and raise 1 year old twins with no job I let drinking go and became a nanny. That went well until the end, my nanny family used to keep wine in the fridge and my last 3 months I would sneak a cup here or there. After being a nanny to her 1 year old and 10 year old and bringing my girls to work with me everyday I finally popped. 
I pawned the kids off on my mom and sister and went out and drank it up for about 14 months straight! Everyday no breaks I would wake up and get to it. Finally I gained control and went back to work as a preschool teacher and left it alone for about 3 months, then corona came and I didn‚Äôt have anything to do with my life. Me and the kids were in a hotel and barely making it alone. I was stressed but kept the will power to not give in. 
Fast forward to last Monday, I got day drunk and my kids were in daycare. I had to figure out how to pick them up. Luckily a friend was available to help. I was obliterated. I was embarrassed. I was even more ashamed now then I had ever been during my ‚Äúwet spell‚Äù. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I still occasionally drink but last Monday I got wrecked! For no good reason. Why? If you ask me it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm an emotional junkie but In reality I‚Äôm and alcoholic. 
What should I do? how should I handle this? I‚Äôm sick of losing my battle. Besides a therapist or a BFF who can I vent my stories to, to get all of this trash from my past off my back. I often find myself looking back. Saying things like ‚ÄúI remember..‚Äù or ‚ÄúI had...‚Äù or my personal favorite to say is ‚Äú did I show you the pictures of when...‚Äù 
I want to let it go because all of those memories stir my emotional integrity and I turn to the bottle, just for me to make an ass out of myself. Every time. 
I‚Äôve lost everything I‚Äôve earned from 19 to 27 I sold my house and car. I gave my dog to a rescue. I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to do this parenting thing on my own. I want to let it all out and stop drinking about it. What do I do? My kids mean the world to me so why am allowing myself to fail,repetitively? Am I overwhelmed or overreacting?

Hide how much I drink from my wife, although I have made it a point to stop lying when she asks me at least.  I know I am hurting my body.

At this point in my life, I have been struggling with binge drinking for maybe 6 years now? But the past 4 years have been filled with some terrible experiences. 

After each blackout I feel extreme anxiety. I also have anxiety and take medication for it, which intensifies everything. I always vow that it will never happen again, never actually saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never drinking again‚Äù because that scares me too much. 

It‚Äôs easy for me to not drink a drop on the week days, but as soon as Friday comes around and I have plans already set up, I lose all my strength. 

I think last week I said I would not drink liquor anymore and felt so confident about it ‚Äî and then Friday came around and I get tunnel vision going out and everything goes out the window. It literally doesn‚Äôt even cross my mind. It‚Äôs like dissociation. 

Because of that, it‚Äôs starting to look like ‚Äúmaking a plan‚Äù or ‚Äúnot drinking liquor‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to work for me and I need to abstain altogether. 

My ideal self is someone who is healthy on the weekends, can wake up without still being drunk / feeling terrible and go live their life. How cool would it be if I could make this change on my 25th birthday?

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens‚Äîgood or bad‚Äîand invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let‚Äôs not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn‚Äôt:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

So, yesterday was quite the confident boost for me. None of us are immune to life - on the contrary, that¬¥s why we¬¥re here, isn¬¥t it?

Several years ago I felt unappreciated on my job. But, many of the clients I worked with gave me very good personal feedback, and I began to save those emails. I even printed out a few and hid them between all the other stuff on my pinboard. My favorite was the gentle nun and the infamous rock artist next to eachother, expressing their gratitude, one with a blessing and one with profanity - both equally heartfelt.

This taught me that appreciation comes in many shapes and colors. It also taught me that at that moment in time, someone truly appreciated me and my work. I did it, and I can do it again.  Noone can take that away from me, not even a rainy day with isolation, piled up work, cold coffee and mold on the cheese.

And you know what? Noone can take away from you your sober day. It¬¥s all yours. Wear it proudly. I will not drink with you today!",139,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.980621874332428}"

I can do this. I need to keep reminding myself that I‚Äôm not punishing myself, I‚Äôm rewarding myself and my body so that I live long with my amazing husband.  Also starting to think about certain friendships that I may need to reconsider for the sake of my sobriety, not just because they‚Äôre drinkers but also because some of my friends behave in a way which isn‚Äôt necessarily in others‚Äô best interests and it makes me feel that I ‚Äòneed‚Äô a drink. I think this is could the hard part, anybody got experience with changing/ evaluating their friendship groups for the sake of sobriety?

I've tried typing it up a few times but kept on deleting it. I'm just going to word vomit it this time.

I started drinking at 18. Prior to college, I was too sheltered and socially awkward to be exposed to alcohol. When I first tried it, it was practically a miracle in my eyes. I went from being a forever-alone poster child who was literally too awkward to order pizza on the phone, to cracking jokes, making friends, and even chatting up women. The best part was that everyone else was doing it, so by fitting in, I could have an easier time fitting in. Win-win, right?

As college went on, my social life and drinking habits both both took off. At the time I figured that I was getting better at socializing, and a byproduct of that was more partying. I joined a fraternity and partying once a month turned into partying several times a week. My entire junior year was a drunken haze, and I didn't care because I felt like I was living in a Van Wilder movie. And underneath, there were some obvious signs that the entire thing was being held up by the crutch of alcohol.

Around that time I ended up in my first serious relationship. I was head over heels for her, and felt a tremendous amount of pressure because she was a popular athlete and I was the former high school loser. I had insecurities from the start, and in particular, performance anxiety in bed. I'd start worrying about not getting it up and then get too anxious to get it up. It wasn't much of an issue before her because I was drunk almost every pervious time I had had sex. I spent a lot of sober time with her but somehow didn't see the booze/anxiety connection.

After that relationship ended, which was a decade ago, my partying increased exponentially. At first I figured that I was taking advantage of being an undergrad with few bills and responsibilities. I could clean up my act and get serious in grad school. So I'd do what little homework I had early in the week and then hit up bars and parties in the remaining 3-4 days. Well when I got to grad school instead of cleaning up my act, I found even more drinking buddies. Now I was drinking with my cohort between classes all day, and drinking just as much at parties and bars at night. I had a wider social circle so I could find a crew to go out with every single night of the week.

I was starting to get sick of my lifestyle, but legitimately felt trapped. I did not know how or who to socialize with without alcohol, and behind it all was the specter of anxiety. I felt like I could only hook up with women drunk, and if I tried to stay in for a night, I'd get some hardcore FOMO and find someone to party with. I'd drink before presentations to deal with my nerves. I promised myself that once grad school ended, I'd get my act together and act like an adult.

It worked for a time. When I graduated I moved to the city to start a new job and no longer had people pressuring me into getting blasted every night. I'd drink 2-3 beers by myself most nights, telling myself it wasn't a problem because it wasn't like before. I'd go on dates and get tipsy or drunk because it was the only way I knew how to get lucky. Yet again, I started surrounding myself with people that liked to drink. My lifestyle also caught up to me. I broke my foot while wasted at a 4th of July party and started experiencing unbearable heartburn on a regular basis. I missed an entire day of comicon because I was too hungover to move away from a toilet. I blacked out and somehow broke a sink off of the wall in my apartment. I got kicked out of a nightclub and can't remember why. I blacked out for an entire concert.

That brings me to 2020. This year I've probably drank less than any year since I was 21 but that's only made the negative impacts of alcohol all the more salient. Somehow the 3-4 bad hangovers I've had this year have caused me more shame than any of the crazy stuff I did before. The consequences somehow feel more real, even though they're minor in comparison. For example on Saturday I slipped up and drank 3 beers and felt sluggish the next day. That bothered me so much more than the aftermath of a 14 day bender back in college.

At the same time, I'm also feeling more hopeful. I'm more motivated than ever to achieve the sober life I want, and I'm starting to find other people that don't want to drink. I've been taking SSRIs for anxiety for a long time, but in the last year or so I've made a more deliberate effort to handle it. Currently, I'm dating a woman that is sober and I haven't used alcohol as a crutch during sex. I'm on day 2 now and know day 3's are hard, but I'm excited to push through it.

I've achieved small periods of sobriety, but never more than 100 days (except for my period of incarceration, but I really didn't want to quit, they just didn't let me drink).  So, my last drink was around this time last week.  The last drinking spree I was on landed me in the hospital for the third time this year.  I lost another job.  I apparently stole a bottle of vodka from the liquor store, and now have another criminal charge (which I won't get jail time for, just a fine and court supervision).  I also, and it breaks my heart to admit this, pawned my kid's bicycle.  Her mother and I are divorced, and I got it for her for her birthday, and kept it here for her.  She didn't ever want to ride it, and wasn't very interested in it, but maybe she would have later.  It was absolutely abhorrent for me to do such a thing, and I have been contemplating suicide until today.  My mother has always been extremely supportive of me, and understands the disease of addiction, but I just can't admit what I have done yet.  I know that the truth will come out, and probably sooner than later, and I can always buy her another bike when I get my tax refund, but I am sickened by my horrible, self-centered, drunken decisions.  So, I ended up in the hospital, in restraints, with close to half of my blood being alcohol.  I got out last Monday, and there was a quarter bottle of vodka left in my bedroom that my Mom overlooked when she went through my apartment.  I drank it, and I want that to be the last drink I ever imbibe.  So, I got into counseling, both for substance abuse and mental health, I'm looking into support groups, and I'm trying to be open to suggestions.  I know that this struggle is endless, that I will fight this for the rest of my life, but I want to fight it, and I never, ever want to hurt those I love again.

Anywho, she knocks on my door and just barges right in (I've given up on masterbation at this point).

She sits on my bed and we chat for a few minutes, and she named my short plant Sophia Petrillo because the one right next to it's name is Dorothy Petrillo because of how tall it is.

It's colder than a witches tit in a brass bra in here!""

She asks me if I'm warm enough at night because the insulation sucks and it's an older house. Then she asks me if I want to take some of her strawberries to work with me in my lunch. She said she'd even cut them up for me and put them in a little container! Then she gives me a long hug and lots of kisses on my cheek and I can feel her rough little Nana chin hairs on my skin. I will never get sick of any of it. (Except the barging in aspect because along with the not drinking for 41 days, I'm pretty sure that's how long it's been since I've had alone time with myself as well, and that is NOT something to celebrate)

I mean I'm laughing my ass off because it should really be a reality series, my family. It's like Rosanne meets The Golden Girls up in here

I meant to get into that staying sober for the holidays guide but haven't really gotten to it yet. I am reading a terrific novel, however, called *The Vanishing Half* by Brit Bennett. I read probably 20 or so novels a year and usually only 4 or 5 of them really really grab me and this is one of them. 

I'm a lifelong bolter by nature and this is a story of people who run away to reinvent themselves so it is especially relatable and fascinating to me, though the characters are running from (and toward) things that are much more serious than most of my life's issues. The writing is very absorbing and I don't want to put it down once I've started. I was so mad when my lunch break ended today!

As for TV, all I'm watching is *Fargo* lately. Not a lot of drinking in Fargo which is kind of nice. This season is excellent just like the prior 3 seasons. Glad I'm not drinking or I'd not be able to follow the many complexities of the plot. Great acting and super well written as usual. Chris Rock is totally believable in a serious role here.

This past weekend I told my friends I would DD for them. I'd already been flirting with the idea of quitting drinking and I thought this would be a good time to do something nice for my friends while having a sober weekend. After what happened I don't ever want to touch alcohol again. 

The night started out pretty normal, we hit a few bars, played some pool, had a good time. By the second to last bar things were starting to fall apart. Trying to herd them out of there was like herding cats, most of them were clearly drunk and stumbling around and not hearing me. We made it to the last bar and one of my friends wasn't allowed upstairs at first because he was too drunk. When closing time came he was yelling at the bouncers and trying to get into the fights that were happening outside the bar, one of the other guys was missing and wasn't answering his phone, and his girlfriend was telling me she wanted to rape me, while I was trying to hold up another guy who couldn't walk. It took us almost an hour to get back to the car that was a block away. 

When we got to the car my boyfriend and a couple of his friends decided to walk back because we still hadn't found the missing guy, drunk girl decided to go with them. I knew it was a bad idea, the scene outside the bar had gotten bad but my boyfriend and his friends were mostly sober and I was too busy holding up the other dude. Shortly after I heard shouting. Apparently this guy had come up to my boyfriend and asked for directions, he was being followed by a black car of his friends telling him to get in but he wouldn't listen. I guess he leaned in too close to one of my bf's friends and he hauled off and punched random dude to the ground and took off running back to us. The guy got up and showed his gun and him and the car chased them all the way back to us shouting. One of my drunk friends approached them yelling escalating the situation and they heard him cock the gun. The people in the car pulled the drunk girl down and started beating her in the face. I took cover behind our car with the guy who couldn't walk.

I guess some of the closers from another bar pulled up and helped my boyfriend pull the girl away from them and told them that the cops were coming and they got in their vehicle and drove off. 

I thought we were going to get shot, and honestly if my boyfriend hadn't been trying to de escalate the situation and those other people hadn't showed up I don't know what would have happened. The dude with the gun was drunk too. It just solidified everything I had been feeling about alcohol lately, and it also made me realize that even if I'm the sober one being around that environment can still put me at risk. 

And what absolutely baffles me is some of their reactions. The drunk girl and her boyfriend (who I guess wandered around downtown black out drunk until he came to and found a phone) didn't even remember, didn't realize the danger we were all in, and laughed about it the next day when I saw them. And tbh they'll probably pick up another drink next weekend and not think twice. Alcohol is the most dangerous thing because it takes away rational thinking and then makes you forget that you were in danger, so you can do it again the next weekend without realizing just how bad it was. I'm never drinking again, I never want to be what I saw that night.

I was doing really well with checking in here everyday.  Think I made it a couple of months sober.  But, then I slipped and started again. Figured a small bottle would be ok and then discovered it lasted three days.  Kept with the smaller bottles and got to the point they lasted at most a day and a half.  I did 'reset' my counter a couple of times and made it a few days dry, then slipped again.  As before, I thought I was hiding it really well, but I've been married for close to 30 years...I can't hide lack of sobriety from my spouse, no matter how clever I think I am. She asked me two mornings ago if there was anything I wanted to talk about. I broke down and admitted I had slipped again.  I made a commitment to try again and she encouraged me to come back here as I had been doing since it was working. 

So, I'm back, and I'm sober. Nice to wake in the morning and not feel sick AND remember everything about the night before.  The not remembering is probably what scares me the most. Alcoholism runs in my family, on both sides.  Dementia runs on my dad's side, and he has started showing signs that it is taking a hold. I don't believe that alcohol will make it more likely to get dementia, but I can't imagine it keeps it at bay either.  I'd like to remember as much as possible and having gaps caused by drinking scares that tar out of me every time.

Unfortunately our Sunday Funday quickly soured after I reached my point of no return. My husband recognized the signs and cut me off, which infuriated me.

I scroll when I don't feel right and I find a piece of myself in all of your posts.  The positive vibes here are endless and can salvage any bad mood I find myself in. 

I hit half of a year in sobriety today - 6 months apart from a long dark stretch of self-loathing and self-destruction.  I wasn't happy where I was in life and my solution was endless food, pot, and booze.  Once I was able to remove myself from a detrimental environment and find peace, I dove head first into recovery.  With a sober mind, I was able to understand how substances never worked as a solution even though I was using them as such since I was 15.  They just pushed emotional pain further down the line, silently multiplying exponentially.  And when life got really hard, I tripled down on my usage and smashed my world to bits.

With the dead wood burned away, I was able to see that life can be beautiful with a sober mind.  I don't have to be anywhere that's imposing on my mental health or feel tied to anyone who isn't like-minded.  I can live life on my own terms and pursue my interests and lifestyle as I see fit.  I just had to remove the substances to gain the confidence to work towards it. 

Life is fucking hard, it's a struggle, and bad shit happens all of the time.  So I remain sober and will continue working on myself in order to be prepared for the tough times ahead.  I found my favorite place to be is inspired by the endless beauty of everything while I work on myself - my desires, character, and values. 

I like myself now.  Drinking, pot, and unhealthy eating made me constantly anxious, depressed, self-critical, narcissistic, selfish, insecure, angry - ha and they also acted as temporary relief.  I am still all of those things, but I have awareness and an opportunity to consistently work on them one day at a time.  Add in all of the marketing, cultural and societal pressure from friends family and work, that try to tell you that you're just not doing them right.  I understand myself enough now to realize they don't work at all with my personality and desires.  

I am forever thankful to be able to read here from all of you wonderful people spitting your truths and bleeding your honesty as it helps me reinforce my own thoughts and experiences.  It makes me feel less alone.

In my mind, I had November 9 as my 90 days, but when I opened my sobriety app, I realized that I suck at math and calculating days. (Yeah- some months have 31 days, dummy). THis is my longest stretch of sobriety since i was 14 years old- thats over 30 years (hope all you 20 somethings let that sink in). 

BUT- it made me realize a couple things. 

1) The first week of sobriety, I was counding the time in 12 hour increments.

2) I then started looking at the days. (ooooh, 6 days! 9 days 14 days!)

3) Around day 30 I nearly caved as my obsession with days was a sneaky way of the disease getting ready to tell me ""30 days! if you were an alcoholic, you could never go 30 days!"". Some very wise people on this sub coached me, and helped me realize that there is indeed a downside to counting days (as well as upsides), depending on how your mind works. 

4) I stopped counting days, but I knew Nov 9 was 90 days (see above). The not counting or obsessing has helped.

In the last 90 days- 

I went to an outdoor music festival and drank water and seltzer- still had fun and no one cared or even asked why I didnt have a beer. 

I have not stepped on a scale, but I am down 2 belt notches (three some days). 

Skin on my cheeks and nose is no longer red, and the puffyness is gone- i noticed this between 45 and 60 days in, which was longer than I expected. 

Went to my birthday dinner with family last week and had a Sprite with my Surf n Turf- and get this - I drove my family both to and from my own birthday dinner. Y'all will get that significance. 

My kids no longer smell my drinks before stealing a sip (this probably should be number 1).

I'm 21 now. I fear I have damaged my body by not staying hydrated and binge drinking for a good part of 3 years. When I was 19 I used to drink vodka with my friend at his house all day because he was an alcoholic, but I didn't realize this at the time and just wanted to get drunk, and I kind of fell into the same trap because the people around me were all getting drunk as well and going to shows and partying and when all of that slowed down I was just at his place with him drinking vodka.. when I had enough of that, I felt like I needed to distance myself from him.

But I didn't leave the drinking at his house this time.

Most days I would have been eventually drinking beer by noon every day, or vodka from the closet.  My mom would just keep buying the vodka and didn't think that I had a problem.  I didn't either.  This enabled me to drink even more.  I would then start to drink when people weren't looking so they wouldn't say anything about me. *\[Not all of this is completely linear but I was kind of drunk the whole time so..\]*  when I turned 21 I started going to buy my own liquor and that's probably when things severely got worse and I was drinking hard liquor and beer all day just to feel numb.

I mostly have isolated myself because of the coronavirus pandemic and this has made things a lot worse for my mental health and I was just able to stay home and drink all day.  Eventually I would drink several drinks in the morning, afternoon, then a larger amount in the evening maybe around 7-12 drinks a day.  I would tell myself I didn't have a problem by drinking beer but still buying the highest ABV stuff i could get my hands on but wasn't gross and make me hungover.  Once I started getting hung over and drinking the day after to feel better, then being hungover the day after, and drinking to feel better again is when I realized I was going to die if I kept doing this to my body. I was sick of looking at and walking through the empty beer cans scattered across my room and neglecting myself and responsibilities only making my life worse.  I hope my heart and liver will forgive me from the damage already done.  I know this may not sound like a lot to some people but I know that it is still not good on your body.

I feel like I have no one to talk to about this because I have cut off those who are still alcoholics but my other friends seem to have no problems with alcohol or are able to cut back when they know they have been drinking too much.  I feel like I am coming out of a fog but I'm still struggling with no one to talk to and I have been avoiding the thought of AA being only 21 and the coronavirus pandemic.  I have reached out to a therapist but I have not told her the extent of my drinking yet.

I Feel like I have more to talk about but it is hard to talk about without becoming sad and confused. I've struggled with ADHD depression and anxiety my whole life and I know that I used booze to cover up my problems.  I feel like I try to communicate to every person around me so that they could help me but not everyone understands what kind of place I'm in.",39,"{'rona': 2, 'virus': 2, 'pandemic': 2}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976523518562317}"

The emotional injury is like a physical injury. And just like a physical injury, we need to take care of for it to heal.

But what happens if no one teaches you to do that? Or if the people around you badger you into stuffing all your feelings, belittling you, saying your feelings are not important. I remember one of my sisters telling me I was too sensitive. Back then, my mother and two sisters abused me. As an adult and searching self-help books for answers, I learned that in my 40s.

To me, my sister criticizing me is saying I am not important, which is cruel and mean. And it is something most raised in broken homes experience all the time. Plus, stuffing emotions time after time doesn‚Äôt help our common sense or clear thinking. Something happened that upset us; not being able to process it to understand what happened impairs us and messes up our thinking skills.

So cruelty and discounting leads abused kids to years of emotional wounds stuffed down under the surface, crippling us, making us weak and fragile. We avoid events, locations, people, and anything that triggers those wounds because they remind us of the pain we self-medicate to avoid.

I understand that firsthand because I avoided everything I could for decades of my life because I knew no better. I hadn‚Äôt asked what to do because I feared my emotions would overwhelm me and I would do something hateful and angry. So, I stuffed more.

Once I got into psychotherapy, I learned I could recognize where my behavior went off track, that I could correct myself and try different things. I got a lot of problems resolved and out of my way. But I reached a place where I got stuck. I did not understand what fueled my self-destruction.

But I knew the time had come where I had to face those emotions because if I didn‚Äôt, I would drink again. I had to sit down and face the pain I fought, drugged, and drank to avoid.

Certified in hypnotherapy, my therapist suggested hypnosis. Frustrated and sick of my constant failing and repeating behavior I swore to myself I would never do again, I agreed. I purchased a voice activated recorder and brought it with me on my next session so I could listen to the sessions at home. I wanted to get the pain moving and out of my way as best I could.

The hypnotherapy got me to the places where my cemented, padlocked pain had been out of my reach.

Over the following weeks, as I listened to the sessions in the privacy of my home, I cried buckets and it hurt, but I got through it. My psychotherapist guided me through it and I felt better. I felt happier and wanted to get through more painful memories because I saw the difference it made in my life.

That encouraged me to keep going, to keep writing out my fears as they popped into my head, facing, and accepting what I was afraid of. I accepted what isolated me and what made me push people away.

On October 17, 2012, I first blogged about ‚ÄúWhy Overeat in the First Place?‚Äù The following day, on October 18, 2012, I blogged about ‚ÄúOvercoming My Fears‚Äù.

With those initial blog posts, I embarked on my journey to understand my fears and overcome them because I knew what scared me triggered my need to overeat. I knew no other way to comfort myself. What I wouldn‚Äôt know until recently was I had never felt secure. I did not know what safety felt like.

Also back then, I experienced flashbacks even though I did not know they were flashbacks, and I am sorry to say my therapist didn‚Äôt either. She did not diagnose me as having complex ptsd, which another therapist diagnosed me with years later. There were many signs, and she missed every sign. Also, she neglected to keep detailed notes of our sessions. Because of that, I have no records of my milestones except for what I blogged about, and I went to her for 8 or 9 years.

Now, I do not let that hold me back. I work hard to better my emotional issues to heal as much as possible. Because of that work, I get to experience the benefits firsthand.

One really important one is seeing my twisted up thinking straighten out. My common sense and logic are miles better than they were before I made great strides in therapy. It is easier for me to problem solve and make decisions now. And I haven‚Äôt been in therapy since December 2017.

Another important benefit I see is I realized when something traumatizes us, the trauma and the emotions tied to it knot up inside us. So those thoughts and emotions are fragile and easy to set off. When something triggers any of those emotions, the trauma tries to surface, unless we can contain it.

But when we work to heal that trauma, those emotions heal and behave naturally. Those emotions that frightened us no longer do, and when necessary, we can think about what we can do. And it is WONDERFUL to go through my day, seeing how much better I manage situations that used to make me run and hide.

So, that said, I know I have a ton of work still ahead of me, even though I have been working hard to heal my emotional wounds for over 8 years now. But, I keep putting one foot in front of the other and do everything I can to keep going, healing and pacing myself along my way. Life is much better than it was, and I have several health challenges and am deeply in debt. I have times where I have to stop and face old wounds now surfacing. So, I detour for a while and try to take care of my wounds and my healing.

I think there are first-order reasons to stop drinking as well as second-order. First-order are the ones I imagine a lot of people have like:

* Save money
* Better health and level of fitness
* More time to do the things you care about
* Make fewer regrettable or not well though out actions
* Be hungover less
* ""Show up"" for life in job/personal life
* Spend more time thinking about things from a sober perspective (literally) ‚Äî as in hungover/drunk brain doesn't consider things realistically
* Maybe live longer
* Be respected by peers, friends, and coworkers more
* Have control, or have more self-control
* Not get cirrhosis and die a shitty preventable death
* Heal faster from cuts/scrapes, and have stronger immune system
* Sleep better
* Feel reseted and more energized during the day
* Probably be more hydrated
* Better skin health
* Lose weight if diet follows suite ;)
* Consumer fewer empty calories from drunk snacking
* Have a cleaner house/office/shop because less time being drunk and lazy
* Spend more time awake/alert in the mornings (morning are more powerful than I give them credit)
* Take fewer unnecessary pain killers (NSAIDs strain kidneys and heart)
* No opportunity to get a DUI from drunk driving
* Break fewer things (example: pissing on my TV in a sleepy/blackout when going from couch to bed)
* Better memory! Blackouts are terrible for my brain, short and long term memory could be so much better
* Be more prepared/competent. Big art project in 2019 only worked because I was so on top of it for 3 months while i was sober.
* Accomplish more things
* Preventative measure against a confluence of negative side effects from alcoholic behavior meaning I already ""peaked"" in my 20's before I became a drunk
* Actually feel things and process them
* Possibly feel less depressed, happier, and more accomplished day to day
* More mental resilience when crisis comes along. Alcohol just exacerbates my anxiety

So, that's a lot of first-order reasons to stop drinking. Now let me describe the second-order concept that I've been considering for some time but never articulated. At its core it comes down to integrity. Integrity to myself and making the most of this life. I owe myself the best life I can have; nobody else is going to advocate that for me, or give me ""the best life"". In my experience there are no handouts, and if anything there are people out there with poisonous ideology and rhetoric who will try and convince me I should not have the best because they don't have it. I'm artificially suppressing myself with this self harm of alcoholism because I've bought into the lies and am putting myself down on their behalf. Maybe this sounds hand-wavy and I'm not actually taking responsibility for why I drink, or for not stopping. Regardless though, I owe it to myself to not be an alcoholic and to have the most unencumbered life I can have.

I want to have more integrity with myself, a stronger character, more moral turpitude, and to hold myself to my own standards of conduct.",8,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987490177154541}"

I have three distinct triggers for drinking:
1) stress
2) hunger
3) habit

These triggers all play off each other and are intertwined. When I get a craving, I acknowledge the craving and then categorize it. This helps me understand what is happening in my body. 

I‚Äôve been using NA beer as a way to quell extreme cravings. I know this doesn‚Äôt work for everyone but I‚Äôve learned that I really like the taste of beer but I don‚Äôt need the alcohol.

I did not post yesterday, day 1, because I was too anxiety-ridden to even do anything but sleep.

I have a lot of things have stacked up that I have been avoiding, and have hidden a lot of my life from friends and family. I am asking for support going forward and unpacking these things, and laying out my heart for those I love. I thought I loved alcohol. That couldn't be farther from the truth. I made a pledge to quit drinking hard liquor a few months back, after I realized it made me angry, irrational, and destructive. I've been pretty good with it - I slip up sometimes, but I mostly stick to beer and wine. But I've realized that even those are too much for me, and I need to do away with all of it if I can ever move forward.

&#x200B;

I hate what alcohol does to me. Both before, during and after drinking. First, I feel the need to drink and go spend (read: waste) money on it. Then, I drink and get happy for a couple beers, and it declines rapidly after that - haziness, embarrassment, fucking crippling heartburn, belligerence, injury. Chipped teeth. Bruises. Then the day after, I have to sit and let my body try to clean out the filth I poured into it. Headaches, nausea, malnourishment, anxiety. Then I go do it again because I think it'll make me feel better. Fuck that.

&#x200B;

I've been reading a lot of your posts, and they are all so inspiring and meaningful. And I will keep you guys updated on my struggle. I love you all.

I kept trying and kept falling in again and again. Eventually I was able to figure out what I was doing wrong and after a few more tries I was moving past it pretty quickly. I'd get stuck along the way on other things. I'd get frustrated....I try again and figure it out. Eventually I passed the level. Then it struck me. This is like getting sober. I used to get stuck on day 3 but now day 3 isn't hard to get to and I do it all the time. Then it was a week....shit.....why can't I get past a week sober? After many many tries eventually a week was not a big deal. I was now sober more often than not. Then I kept screwing up a couple times a month. Right now I'm working past that. But you know what a couple years ago I was a daily drinker. Now I am fighting the last battle to cut it out completely. So if you are on day one again don't beat yourself up because maybe it's your last day one.....or maybe you fall into the hole 3 more times. The beautiful thing is if you keep trying eventually you will figure it out! Peace and love to my sober brothers and sisters.

As I have said, I don't drink to drown my sorrows, I drink when I am happy - to increase my buzz.   This week has been largely a very happy week and ordinarily I would be adding alcohol to it to increase its happiness.    But I have been taking antabuse for the past week so I literally can't.   In fact, I had a spoonful of dessert on Friday night that had some sort of sherry or liqueur in it and even that one spoonful affected my stomach.   So what I am grateful for is that the antabuse is taking away from me having to make any decisions - I simply CANNOT drink.    And some people may see this as a cop out, and not having enough self-discipline so I need to rely on drugs.   But the truth is, that is right.   I don't have the self discipline.   I would have felt happy on Thursday or Friday or Saturday and adding alcohol would have seemed normal,   But because I just can't do that with antabuse, I realize a couple of things:

\- I don't actually need that alcohol to increase my happiness / my buzz.   I can actually feel quite buzzy and happy without alcohol at all - who knew?!

\- Some of my behaviours - that I thought alcohol were causing - are not alcohol related at all.    I like staying up until 3am and falling asleep on the sofa - alcohol or not;

\- I like midnight feasts after my partner has gone to bed - alcohol or not.

I like staying up late because some times I just feel happy and I don't need alcohol to prolong my feeling of happiness.    I was happy with or without alcohol.

So I guess I realize that I am somewhat of a night owl and a food pig (:)) and alcohol doesn't cause that.    Alcohol just makes me more messy.

Anyway, just my musings.   I find it really cathartic to write about this.   Feeling grateful for this sub, grateful that my choice has been taking away from me with antabuse, grateful for having a better understanding of myself with and without alcohol.

Happy Monday to all.

I've strung together up to two weeks but then I fall back off the wagon because I can't seem to remember why I stopped in the first place.

I'd say I drink 2-5 drinks/day, about 4 days a week. Certainly unhealthy, but has resulted in very few negative consequences (at this point). I hold down a great job, strong marriage, outwardly ""got it all."" But when I wake up in the morning feeling less than 100%, I know I can do better. I know I'm capable of acheiving more. I want to learn to be present for all my emotions. We are considering starting a family soon and I want to be the energetic, fully present parent. I doubt I would be able to even manage parenting with a constant low-grade hangover.

I barely trust myself anymore. One moment I'm gung-ho on sobriety and the next it sounds like a great idea to have a margarita on the patio with my partner. I feel like my brain is broken. 

I've tried reading the books, attend the Luckiest Club meetings (which I love) but never speak. I know I probably need to give it more focus.

For 17 years, I‚Äôve been a drug and alcohol abuser, although the drug portion didn‚Äôt creep in until the past 7 years. But what has happened over the last 17 years has been marred with school failures, career failures and relationship failures. At the end of 2019, I had finally gotten good health insurance. Well, my wife is a drinker to and she recognized before I did that we had an addiction problem. So, I told her that when January 2020 hit and the insurance kicked in that we would go to the doctor. We did and we started the process of finding out all of our ailments. We started with bloodwork. When the results came back, my liver enzymes were high and the doctor asked if I was a drinker. I told him that I was.
Note: I‚Äôm a strange type of drinker. It‚Äôs never been an everyday thing for me. I averaged 1-2 times a week. But boy oh boy, when I did, I would binge for up to 18-20 hours and I could go through an entire liter of hard liquor. And yes....I had also formed another nasty habit, cocaine. These two drugs mix so well that you literally have no idea how drunk you are because there  is this powerful stimulant keeping that party going. Yea, that‚Äôs me and that‚Äôs really badly been me for the last 7 years.
So the doctor told me that I should not drink for the next 3 months. I told the doc, great! I needed a reason to stop drinking. And I did! I stopped for 3 full months. During that time, I started seeing a therapist and we started the process of discovering me and who I am. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve just started getting to know myself for the first time in my life and things were great! They were great until my wife started developing a panic disorder.
Note: My wife is also an alcoholic. She stopped drinking when I stopped. 
However, what happened to her has been an absolute nightmare. She developed a panic disorder. It‚Äôs like the fear portion of her brain wouldn‚Äôt shut off. So we had to rush her to our doctor. The doctor put her on some really powerful medication and the adjustment has taken its toll on both of us. I started getting our lives better. I started cleaning the kitchen every single morning. I made her coffee everyday and would bring it to her in bed. I created a household budget and was doing so well with my job that I received a promotion. But, the nightmare of what I was living with started to really make me feel unloved, alone and resentful. For the last 4 months I have been a caregiver. 
So I cracked and cracked hard. And this is what happened to me. My brain started telling me that hey, you need a break buddy. You‚Äôve been doing good work. You deserve to go with your friends and connect with others. When my wife found out what I was doing and I wasn‚Äôt there at the house, she became really angry at me. You see in the last 3-4 weeks, I have gone out drinking 3 times. And the last time, this past weekend, I cracked mentally. I basically threw a bomb in my relationship. I felt unappreciated and not understood and I was tired of being treated like garbage when I had been doing a really good job of taking care of my wife. I deserve to go and connect with others and if I want to do that ever so often at the bars, then I should have the right to do so.
This is a LIE! It took me telling my wife that we were over and almost completely ruining my marriage just because I felt I had the right to do so!?!? I had no right to break my sobriety! I am thankful that we have really good friends that all came over to our house because we had both just broken mentally. They mediated for us and told me some hard truths that I still didn‚Äôt get until everyone had left and my wife had gone to bed. I sat in the living room all night that night typing in my journal trying to put my thoughts down to try to see what had happened to me over the last few days. My conclusion was that I was indeed an addict. I am an alcoholic. Why I was in such denial about this problem, I don‚Äôt know. But I do intend on finding out and I start my treatment today. I had my first meeting yesterday and was able to get a sponsor. We are heading to the doctor this morning to get some additional guidance. I have taken the next 10 days off work. My poor wife. I love that woman! Why she has stayed with me only love knows. But by admitting to myself that I have a problem, it has catapulted me into action and I will NOT let this insidious, lying, demon in my brain trick me again. I can‚Äôt do it. Because I know that I was standing on a slippery slope and had I fully slipped again, I would be dead before I was 40.

Don't get me wrong. I definitely would NOT recommend you have a glass of something as an experiment. We all have read the stories (and have our own) of thinking you can moderate and ending back up right where you started.

I've been drunk almost every night for the past 15 years. Things have gotten worse during the lockdown to the point I was generally drunk by 9am. I get really defensive with ultimatums, but when my wife said she would take the kids and leave if I drank again, I wasn't upset. I knew she 100% meant it, and I genuinely wondered why she hadn't yet. I went online and bought her a brethalyzer for $10 and told her to use it if she suspected anything. She said ""I don't need it because I can tell if you've been drinking"". She didn't understand that it was for me more than her. I can't tell a brethalyzer it's crazy, or overreacting, or in a bad mood. Long story short, you can't gaslight a brethalyzer. 

That was 15 days ago and I'm 14 days sober today. If it helps anyone (and you should keep in mind I'm only 2 weeks in) this is the mindset that helps me.

1: I'm not bad at turning down the first drink, I'm terrible at turning down the second, and I've never turned down a third. As such, I can drink as much as I want as long as I don't have the first. (If this doesn't make sense to you, it shouldn't. It registers with me for some reason I don't really understand)

2: I can't promise tomorrow, but I'm not drinking today. (I stole that from you guys)

3: I'm not doing this for my wife or kids, I'm doing this so I can spend more time with my wife and kids. (this is another trick one,  but generally if I'm doing something for someone else I'll resent the fact they are asking me to make a sacrifice. If I'm doing it for myself there is no resentment) 

4: This is (for me) a game of exceptions. I've tried to slow down/quit a dozen times. I'll go a few days then there will be a social event, or a football game and I'll rationalize a couple glasses of wine won't hurt. Then the next day there is a half bottle of wine on the counter, and you can't just throw that away, and it's not enough to get a decent buzz. So I get another bottle etc, etc. So, I can't make exceptions. No birthdays, Super Bowls, Christmas, etc.

2020-11-09 10:15:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jqzdod/sharing_whats_on_my_mind/,Sharing what's on my mind," Hi everyone,

created an account only for this post. I'm writing this to open up about whats on my mind. I didn't tell my family or friends about anything of this.

I don't know if this fits in this sub perfectly but drinking is one of my problems so I just have it a go. 

I have the feeling that I'm at a very low point in my life for a few years now. The past years I mostly did pot, a lot. When I tried to quit I shifted to alcohol. Also when I didn't have pot, I drank. I finally stopped smoking earlier this year (that felt easy tbh, I didn't really enjoy smoking anymore, but it was better than being sober), I was able to go for one week without doing anything, but then started to drink. Only one or two beers a night at first, but it got more pretty fast. 

Since then I don't go one day without drinking. I think the longest break was 3 days. I usually only drink in the evening, but when I know I'm alone for some time I have 1-2 beers at noon/afternoon.

Most of the time I drink like one bottle of wine. I don't get absolutely hammered, but thats mainly for the reason that I'm not living alone and don't want people around me to see in the morning that I drank. If I would be alone I would drink more. I'm worried about that I don't go 1-2 days without wanting to drink.

When I was living alone back in 2017, I drank more, daily it was like 1-2 bottles of wine, maybe some beers too or half a bottle of whiskey/vodka.

I also crashed with my moto cycle 2 years ago, slightly drunk and a bit high on weed.

Drinking is just one of the problems I have. I know this sub is about stopping to drink, but I also don't want to give you only half of the story. 

I also don't do anything all day. I'm just watching stuff on youtube, pretending to work. I'm not even watching videos fully, just clicking through them. I don't answer messages on my phone. I played video games a lot, but stopped doing so because I thought I was wasting too much time. I don't play guitar anymore, don't draw anymore, and seldom do sports. I could do stuff for my degree, but I always postpone it until the last moment possible. My days consist of not doing anything and in the evening, drink.

Also I'm craving for affection. I didn't have a girlfriend in 4 years or so, and in that years never received any love (except hugs/words from family). I have dreams sort of someone just hugging and holding me tight, and I wake up thinking, that felt wonderful. But I don't think I can date someone again before I don't get all my other things sorted.

I don't really have things I'm looking forward to. I have no aims in life. I don't know what to do after finishing my degree. Every day is just like the last. Right now I think the right thing for me to do would be to get professional help, psychotherapy or drug counseling. But that scares me, it's like to admit how much of a problem I have and how low I have fallen. But I think it's the best thing for me to do.

I am almost into day 17 which will be a personal best for the year. I feel pretty good about that and feel like something clicked and this time it's forever. So on to the question. I have lots of things I could do or maybe even should do ...... But nothing I really have to do right now. I've been feeling pretty content and cozy just hanging around the house getting chores done and watching tons of movies. Reading posts here alot and reading books...getting outside here and there and just doing small things when I feel like it. I have sort of a guilty feeling like I should be doing more. Exercising more or hussling for my business. I don't feel bad physically or anything..but doing dishes and making a good breakfast and small stuff like that will make me want to lay down on the couch and zone out afterwards. I just feel like hanging around. What is a good amount of time to give myself ..... without feeling guilty.....to just chill and focus on being sober and like that for now is enough. My work can be a bit stressful. I can not work without repercussions if I choose too right now which I'm very grateful for. I want to set maybe a timeframe for focusing on recovery without the guilty thoughts in the back of my head. Allow some rest and recouping. I guess my question is what is a good time frame? I'm sure it's different for everyone but looking for recommendations and advise. Thanks for reading and any comments seriously appreciated.

2020-11-09 09:41:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jqyrd7/thoughts_on_30_days/,Thoughts on 30 days!,"I haven‚Äôt gone this long without drinking in...I honestly can‚Äôt even remember. 10 years maybe? I was pregnant but I would have a small glass of wine or beer maybe once a month or so....I know it‚Äôs been at least 7 years though. So there‚Äôs a few things I‚Äôd like to remember at this point.
1. I went to my doctor and got my meds changed and I think that‚Äôs made all this possible. I didn‚Äôt realize the reason I wanted/needed to drink everyday was largely a mental health issue that had gone untreated.
2. I thought I‚Äôd lose weight, but I‚Äôm about the same. However, I eat whatever I want whenever I want and if I did that while drinking I would have ballooned. I had some weird water weight fluctuations at the start +/- 4lbs the first two weeks and then it evened out. Actually in this month I‚Äôve lost 5lbs from where I started, I‚Äôd ideally like to lose 10 more but that will require work.
3. I drink a literal fuck ton of water/sparkling water a day and I pee like a racehorse...I really want water all the time I just can‚Äôt help it. 
4. My fianc√© and I haven‚Äôt had a serious argument/fight in the last month. Not one. We‚Äôve had 2 emotional convos where we talked it out and they were over with in 5 minutes. It used to be every day when we were having screaming matches. This is probably the craziest part.
5. Skin is awesome like everyone says it will be. Sleep is amazing and we‚Äôre going to bed when the kids do and wake up fresh as a daisies at 5-5:30am.
6. It‚Äôs embarrassing to think about the amount of money we‚Äôve saved (or used to spend rather) and I use that figure every time my fianc√© asks why I‚Äôve gone through another Costco case of sparkling water....at least it‚Äôs not beer!
7. Distance learning is easier and the transition for 2/3 kids back to school after the past 2 months (being evacuated for weeks at a time due to wildfires) has been much less stressful than it would have been.
8. The BEST part is that I was sober for my daughters 7th birthday and with all the COVID stuff happening we gave her the best birthday we could, and I was sober to see everything. I wasn‚Äôt tired and snappy at the end of the day and I didn‚Äôt pop a bottle at 8am to celebrate me pushing out my baby. We got up at 4am, had coffee, decorated the fuck out of the house, made a cake and breakfast and when the kids woke up they were shocked over the balloons and decor and it set the tone for the whole day. We saw friends and had dinner where everyone was drinking except me, and I put out little fires between little people and hosted a super fun sleepover! I am ridiculously proud of being sober for her day. This is the best part.
9.I am shocked at how no one has made a big deal or asked any further about why we aren‚Äôt drinking. It basically goes ‚ÄúHow many wine glasses do we need? Aqua will you have wine?‚Äù I say no. They say ok. That‚Äôs where it ends. No sideways looks, no one asking questions, nada. Only one friend asked a little further and is bummed we don‚Äôt drink together more but they don‚Äôt push it and respect my choice. I thought everyone would explode if we didn‚Äôt partake and now I‚Äôm realizing how mostly, people don‚Äôt drink nearly as much as I thought and sometimes they are relieved to just get tea or water with me. It‚Äôs really not a big deal.
10. My body feels ok but my fianc√© who used to drink partially due to a physical job and body pain is really feeling the pain now. The way he feels on his head is so much better and he‚Äôs going to the doctor for bloodwork and tests and to see if there‚Äôs anything he can do to get healthier or if he has allergies that could fix some of his issues. I‚Äôm so proud of him for taking this seriously. We never decided to do this together, one day I just told him I couldn‚Äôt do the fighting and didn‚Äôt like who I was so I was going to stop for now and he stopped right along with me. He tapered for a day or two but we‚Äôve largely been alcohol free together, by our own individual choice.

I‚Äôd like to get to my bday in March, that will put me at 160 total but my goal right now is sober thanksgiving, then 60 days, then sober Christmas.

My drinking typically consisted of 2-4 beers or glasses of wine every night and feeling like crap in the morning. I'd wake up with heavy, tired, and puffy eyes, that I never thought could have been from only a measly 2-4 drinks. At one point I thought I might be dying because the pressure behind my eyes was so intense, even after a ""good"" night of sleep. 

I talked to my mom, who has 30+ years sober, about my drinking after my hangover. She said while I'm certainly not the worst she's seen she does think I'm on the alcoholic spectrum. Which is something I've known for years but until last Sunday - throwing up, crying, and almost dying from choking on my own vomit (my wife heard me and came downstairs and literally saved my life), I never really had a reason to completely stop. And I don't know if I'll completely stop right now. However, I can tell you, or anyone that might be lurking on here, that alcohol is evil; it will slowly drain the happiness, comfort, and enjoyment from your life. 

I want to never pick up a drink again. But my job in sales, and friend circle I've built up, makes me afraid to commit to that because I don't want to fail. I can say that after my fifth day of not drinking, I began noticing improvements. The heavy, tired, and puffy eyes were gone. I've spent some serious quality time with my 2.5 year old daughter, and now hitting the work week with excitement. 

Lastly, I've been on reddit for six months. Always just scrolling the main page to look at memes and random stuff. In that time I never saw anything about this sub. Well, as the universe works in mysterious ways, a few days after that talk with my mom, this sub randomly popped up. I've been lurking multiple times a day, drawing strength from everyone's honestly and successes. 

Thanks for randomly showing up and helping me through these last eight days.

I've had issues with alcoholism for a few years. It progressed rapidly within the last 7 months to the point where I was day drinking, and had the shakes.

I went to inpatient rehab in July, in fact I arrived July 1st and left July 31st.

I came home and each month since I arrived home, I've slipped up once.

Fast forward to Oct 3rd. My husband came home, and I was in a slip up. I had drunk after twenty some days. Again. He ended up beating the absolute hell out of me because I was home alone with the kids. Fair enough. 9 days later I develop a severe migraine.. it lasts for five days. On day five, I lose my speech.

My dad takes me to the ER. After the CT scan, they order Fentanyl and I knew something was very wrong. Then the doctor comes in to tell me I have two brain bleeds, and I would have to be life flighted to another hospital for emergency brain surgery. I instantly freak the fuck out.

Needless to say, it has been a really rough 3 weeks. I lost all my hair when they shaved it all off .. I had to relearn to speak, type, text, read, walk. Everything was difficult the first week. I couldn't name my kids, husband or anyone. In fact, when they asked me.. everyone's name was ""December 7th"" haha. And no that is not a significant date.

I am 3 weeks out from surgery now, and 90% back to normal. I am sober now, and the last thing I want is alcohol to take me out again. So I'm going to utilize this board with the hopes that it will give me some tips other than sheer willpower. I do go to AA, but have intrusive thoughts when I'm alone.

One day at a time, i guess.

EDIT : I know he was abusive in this situation, and it took a lot I'm sure to cause this type of injury. I am contemplating my next move.

Today is Monday, I feel like ass, but nothing compared to previous adventures.

I needed a reminder I guess. Before, I enjoyed drinking, this time? It was bothersome and annoying. That is a first in my life. I guess what I'm trying to say here is, it's ok to mess up. Maybe you \*NEED\* a reminder of why you don't do something anymore. I don't regret what I did, I spent time with people I love and what not, but this daily thing? Nah, I'm good. I'm going dry for the week again, which is good because I never did that before. Just the ability to do it right now, is awesome. I could not do it before (get physically sick).

\*edit\*

The more I think about this, yes, I still don't regret this decision. It's very \*good\* for me to be annoyed. Before I was like ""when is it 5p? I can't wait, I need it now"" to ""This is dumb, I don't want this"".  I think if you stop for a few days / week, you'll find hopefully you'll start thinking differently. Maybe you're an inbetweener, I feel like hey, daily is not good. Maybe occasionally? Sure, or maybe not? Mileage varies. I'm happy with where I am at. Instead of hitting it up daily, 'saving' it is fine too. The \*KEY\* here is to not make up for it, don't think ""oh I missed out on 5 days, I better hit it hard and fast"" NO. Don't do that!

This is purely to serve as a reminder to myself but making it public and bringing it to life on the internet rather than keeping it buried inside of my diary is going to make it more real - or so I think.

&#x200B;

Alcohol was always a big part of my life, short stops on the way but I have started slowly drinking at around age of 14. Who didn't do cheap beers and almost-wines in the bushes behind the hill with school mates. Bonfires with girls you did not have courage to talk to before you have had your fix. It was ok, it is normal part of growing up, being rebellious, being fun, not being different.

Then I have moved out of my family home and home town when I was around 18 to pursue my need of earning my own money and living my own life - did work and school, lived with flatmates in rented apartment - was doing really good...with alcohol still being big - maybe biggest part of my life. 

 I am grown up (at least physically) now having 32 years on my neck and thousands of litres of alcohol processed by my poor body starting to realise that I am not teen anymore. I am living with my wife and 2,5 years old, beautiful daughter in our own apartment (well, bank owned to be precise but hey!).

Cutting everything short - I am not working today. Day off due to Covid19 and my workplace saving work hours to be able to stack up work so everyone will have something to do and no one will have to be fired. I knew I am not going to work today so I allowed myself a little bit more beer during the evening yesterday. Normally I would have 2-3 beers if work is due next day but yesterday evening I have went to the shop and bought myself a solid 4-pack. Should have known myself better after all those years with my weirdly wired brain and just stop. Instead once little one was finally asleep (it's oh so quiet) and when my wife asked if I can drop to the shop to buy something for her I have realised it's a great opportunity to sneakily get a beer or two more for myself - and so I did - drinking one on my way back home and hiding the other one to have once my wife goes to bedroom.

It's around 1 or 2am and all beers are gone. Me eating instant noodles (healthy af) and other crap food (knowing that my stomach is going to disapprove it in the morning again - regular part of my schedule it is - breaking my body to pieces) I have got the most perfect idea ever - go to our storage, grab can of coke, opened bottle of vodka and fix myself with couple, maybe few small drinks before sleep. After all I don't have to drive tomorrow. My wife will drop our daughter to the nursery on her way to work. So I did fix myself with 3 decent sized coke-vodkas.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today morning - and there is no big drama if anyone was waiting for it. No blood, no mess, no arguing, no shouting, no violence and weirdly no hangover.

Today morning I did wake up around 10am. Not normal for me. Normally I am early bird. Not feeling bad physically but my mind is shattered. I have realised what total waste of space I am...

 I have cried like a baby when I woke up and found out that I have slept past my wife and daughter leaving the house. I didn't wave goodbye. I didn't walk them to the car. Did not give them a kiss and didn't say that I love them. I did not hold my baby girl and did not cuddle her. I did not tell her she is the most beautiful and smartest girl in the world.

Worst thing is she is still totally going to love me not realising what kind of person I am. She is still going to cuddle me when she is back home. She is still going to say how much she loves me and smile to me and call me super dad. 

There is so many more mornings coming but this is the morning I have wasted and now it is lost forever. Never going to come back. And I am writing this to always remember - to the end of my life that I have robbed myself of it for the sake of late night sitting, drinking alcohol and eating junk food.

When I got up today, it hit me how quick I went from just drinking occasionally on the weekends (maybe once or twice a month) while going out with friends, to drinking alone and almost everyday, sometimes starting early, when noon hit. I NEVER would‚Äôve thought I‚Äôd become a daytime drinker. I was so good with alcohol just 3 years ago! It happened in a matter of months, so I just want to say... if you‚Äôre a lurker and been thinking to yourself ‚Äúoh wow the people in this subreddit - they drink way more than I do, I can still control it, maybe there‚Äôs nothing to worry about‚Äù - yes there is. This goddamn thing is so insidious. What annoys me the most is how bad I sometimes feel the next day in the morning but then... I manage to rationalize by the evening.
And the worst thing is... my father is an alcoholic. Not a massive one but he‚Äôs got major issues and all my life I despised him for it. Yet there I was, just a few months ago, smashing 4 beers most days of the week while being a tiny woman (105lbs). Insane. 

I‚Äôm in a better place currently. Trying to keep my drinking down to 3 days a week and not more than a couple of glasses/pints. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, but I have made progress and refuse to beat myself up. Also, I have to admit that the thought of quitting forever still terrifies me too much, so telling myself that I will not drink today is good enough and actually works better than trying to quit altogether. At least I‚Äôm cutting down and I feel like that‚Äôs leading me in the direction of being ready to quit for good!

Also, thanks to everyone in this thread! The more I read, the less I drink.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens‚Äîgood or bad‚Äîand invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let‚Äôs not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn‚Äôt:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Saturday after the election ended I decided to go out and celebrate with my boyfriend. What started out as a good day ended up in a complete disaster. My boyfriend said something just about leaving and I took off by myself with a dead cell phone. I ended up at the park across the street with people gathering and someone let me use their portable charger. In this time I told my mom to never speak to me again and she called my best friend to come find me. I found my boyfriend on the side walk just in time for me to want to slap him because he was upset with me (rightfully so). My best friend got me and him home and I spent most of Sunday too depressed to move. 

I‚Äôve of course apologized profusely to everyone involved and was told over and over again that they were all just worried about me because that was so out of character and wasn‚Äôt sure what was going on. I really don‚Äôt have an excuse for my shitty behavior but I can say that the fact that they‚Äôre all still here amazes me. My best friend brought me to tears telling me I‚Äôm a good person and offered to come just be with me. 

I‚Äôm so mad and angry with myself. I‚Äôm appalled by the way I acted. I‚Äôm appalled I did that to the most important people in my life and I‚Äôve made the decision that enough is enough and I need to stop drinking. It breaks my heart to be forgiven and was told they still loved me when I felt like I didn‚Äôt deserve that. I‚Äôve been coping with my dads suicide last year and being a nurse in NY during covid. I already had one inpatient mental health stay this year. I‚Äôm clearly not confronting anything I need to but I know getting sober is the next thing to work on. 

I told everyone involved and they support me 100 percent. I want to do this for myself most of all. I have a meeting with my therapist at 9am and was able to use fmla to stay away from work for a couple days until I can get my head screwed on straight. 

Other than just not drinking, I have no idea where to begin. Groups like AA sound promising but I‚Äôm not sure how that works with covid right now. I feel like taking on the homework of doing the 12 steps will overwhelm me with depression when I really just want a place to share and find other people who might relate to me

But this year with covid and all, I was reduced to drinking just once a month (some beer and pizza) and the number of times I fall sick has been significantly reduced (fell sick just 3 times ignoring things like gastritis). My experiment confirmed the well-known fact that alcohol consumption suppresses the immune system by several mechanisms‚Äî the most important is that alcohol is toxic to the white blood cells and the bone marrow, the place where they are produced.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

I have a hard time asking for help or support. It's not my first impulse, it's generally not something that even occurs to me, and when I'm under a lot of stress I tend to shut down and withdraw. Life has been a bit of a shit sandwich for me lately, and I have done a bit of falling into my old patterns of shutting down and withdrawing. 

My AoK this week has been to myself. I realized that I could extend myself some compassion and worked on that. It has helped a lot, just spending some time conciously trying to reframe my thoughts so I'm being as nice to myself as I would be to someone else has helped a lot. Also, I reached out to some of the people in my life for support. People have been very helpful and kind. My sister reminded me that letting other people be of service to you is an act of service in itself. 

The little kindnesses in life mean so much when I'm going through a hard time. I gave a lead (told the story of my drinking and recovery) at an AA meeting on Zoom tonight. One of the people who commented mentioned that he used to drink with me, and with the weirdness of laptop cameras and the length of time since I've seen him, it toom me a second to place him. I did the bulk of my underage drinking at a little bar/music venue, largely because it was the only place I could get in before I got a fake ID, and he was the sound guy there. 

I'm not in touch with anyone from that part of my life these days, and I'm not particularly interested in looking up old drinking buddies. But it was incredibly nice to see him. And it was validating. I told my story, and I was heard by someone who was there. I don't know what the AoK is here exactly, except that when I stay sober I can show up for other people in ways that I don't even anticipate. And by getting sober this old buddy inadvertently showed up for me. It was very helpful to hear his kind words and to remember that there's a lot more people in the world who I have positive connections with than I tend to remember. It was a nice start to my week.

Over 20 years ago I walked out of my father‚Äôs life because of his alcoholism and it‚Äôs bottomless rage. But now I am him. Today I reject that self. Today I am no longer that man. Today is Day One.,"Friday night I was up late, drunk and browsing r/stopdrinking and r/leaves, reading post after post and just weeping quietly so as not to wake her. I knew that the election was prolly gonna be called Saturday, and I figured either way it went we were gonna want a drink. So that night I vowed to myself that today, Sunday, was going to be the day I quit. I haven‚Äôt smoked weed in a week, and although I knew that I really needed to stop drinking as well, I figured one more day couldn‚Äôt hurt. 

So yeah, yesterday the election gets called, and we celebrate. God we were in **such** good spirits, I still don‚Äôt know where it went to hell. We watched the finale of *Haunting of Bly Manor*, which was sad, so watched a couple eps of *Schitt‚Äôs Creek* to finish the evening on a happier note. Then we stayed up, drinking and talking, and somewhere along the way I became incredibly upset about something she said, and I lost all control of myself. 

I screamed at her, I threw things, I got so up in her face that was spitting on her as I roared pure, unchecked anger at her. I kicked shit across the room, I slammed my hands onto the walls and furniture with loud and disturbing force, I stomped and raged and basically had adult sized tantrum. Worst of all, I scared the shit out of her. I terrified and terrorized the love of my life.

I haven‚Äôt struck another person in anger since I was in middle school. My wife has known me since our sophomore year in high school, since 1994. We started dating in 2002 and have lived together since 2008. She knows that I‚Äôm not a physically violent person, but I managed to become so fucking unhinged that she doubted everything she knew about me. She knows me better than any other living person except maybe my mom, and in my drunken rage, she could no longer recognize me. This utterly breaks my heart.

We had a screaming/crying fight in the driveway sometime in small hours of the morning. I physically blocked the car door to prevent her from closing it and driving away. I managed to swipe the keys out of the ignition, ran back in the house to grab the rest of the car keys, and hid them. Somehow I talked her out of the car and back inside, but I don‚Äôt remember how. I don‚Äôt remember going to bed, but was completely unsurprised to wake up in the spare room this morning. Hungover. Ashamed. I couldn‚Äôt even meet my own gaze in the mirror, much less meet my wife‚Äôs.

Growing up, I spent every other weekend at my Dad‚Äôs house, split custody and all that. Sometime during middle school, his drinking started to spiral out of control. Friday and Saturday nights he and my stepmom would leave me, the oldest, in charge of brother and my step-siblings, as they went out drinking until the bar closed, and then came back the house to carry on drinking until they got into a fight, then spent half the next day in bed hungover while us kids made breakfast and figured out what to do for the day. Since my bro and I only visited every other weekend, we didn‚Äôt have our own room, but slept in the living room, which was right next them as they drank and screamed and cussed in the dining room. Seriously, not ten feet from where my brother and were supposed to be sleeping, no walls or doors to shield us from their spectacle of alcoholism and rage and depression.

I never once saw my father strike her, or anyone else for that matter. But he would punch holes in wall, throw glasses, pound his fists. I remember the time he kicked out the oven door, and I remember the time that he punched through the big fish tank and partially severed several of the cords of his dominant hand. I remember coming home from parties with his work buddies in a cop car because my stepmom got pulled over DUI with us kids in the car. 

And I remember his voice, in all of it‚Äôs impotent fury. Night after fucking night I would hear his voice, risen to the height of it‚Äôs power, roaring and raging. Screaming at her for ruining his life, threatening to leave her, threatening to kill himself. Ten feet away from me. From my little brother. And night after fucking night I would lie there, seething with hatred for the both of them, listening to his voice. The sound of it is indelibly written onto my memory, tattooed onto my brain. And I heard it again for the first time in years, last night, echoing off the walls of my own home and back into my face.

Last night was the worst night of my life. Alcoholism took my father from me, replaced him with a broken man. Alcoholism took my little brother from me, wrecked his life so hard that last year he ended it at the barrel of a gun. And last night alcoholism almost took my wife from me, or rather, took me from her. I am so fucking shook right now, I feel like one giant, raw nerve. I am awash in guilt and sorrow. I‚Äôm jumping at noises and shaking with anxiety and I can‚Äôt stop. I am fucking **SCARED**.

And I am also resolute. I do not know how I will overcome this fucking disease, but somehow I will. When we got married, I gave my wife my word, my oath, and now my word don‚Äôt mean shit to her. I‚Äôve promised her so, so many times to stop drinking or drink less, to quit weed, to get my shit together, and every time I‚Äôve broken my word. I‚Äôve lost her trust but **I WILL GET IT BACK**! It is one of the most important things in the world to me, and I swear to God I will get it back. Because I will not be drinking with you today.

My legs, back, and arms are spent. This time last week, I would have driven to the cornerstore, picked up a 6 pack of 7.5% beers, and started to drink them as soon as I could. Tonight, I fought off the craving. 
Instead of getting hammered, I: (1) cooked myself a tasty spicy chicken, potato, and saut√©ed broccoli with minced garlic and yellow onion dinner (2) was able to talk to my girlfriend via FaceTime while being my goofy self, as opposed to the dull, drunk version of me. (3) cleaned all of the pots, pans, plates, and utensils that I used, instead of letting them sit there getting grosser through the night. (4) made a list of everything I need to do tomorrow, and, finally (5) did some work for my online classes before getting into bed around 11:15pm.

I was honest with her about how much I've been drinking, how a bottle of wine started turning into a bottle plus 4 beers, and sometimes more on the weekends. For some reason I thought she was going to judge me, but she didn't. She understood and commiserated, she was accepting and told me she was so proud of me. It felt good.

It is so bizarre because, as much as we all knew this day was right around the corner, she had seemingly been on death's door so many times and turned a corner that it was almost a shock that it actually happened. Her passing came days after my three year sober-birthday, minus one or two slip ups (instances where I had one drink, hated it, and it reaffirmed my need and desire to stay sober so I don't count them as relapses or reset my sobriety counter). I find myself really yearning for a drink. Which is of course a lie. I am not craving a drink. I am craving five, six, ten drinks. 

I **know** deep in my heart and my brain that I do not actually want to drink. My life has improved in ways I could never have imagined since getting sober. I have a child now, and it is my greatest pride that she has never seen me altered. I have to support my father through this. There are logistical things to do. But none of that means anything to the sad, scared, and lonely part of me that just wants to disconnect from everything.  

I know if I can keep sober, these feelings will fade with time. My sobriety will be all the stronger for getting through this. But I am here to ask, if it is not too much, to borrow some of your strength and resolve while mine is weak. I have been too absent from this community, and I will do what I can to pay it back once I am able.

The feeling of anxiety or what you did over the weekend, what you didn‚Äôt do over the weekend, and what lies ahead of you for the week. Not this Sunday! This weekend was spent getting sober sleep, working out, spending hours outside in the sunshine and eating relatively healthy. I‚Äôve done a little bit of work tonight so I can have a more manageable Monday morning (unfortunately, I still have some more to do before the night is through). I‚Äôm hoping to get 8 solid hours of sleep tonight and maybe workout before work (we‚Äôll see though, I‚Äôm still not a morning person!). No real urges to drink this weekend, overall feeling pretty good but I have been pretty tired, even as I type this I could easily go to bed. But the tired I am feeling is better/different than the tired that comes from being hungover. Although I wish I had more energy, I am confident it will come with time. I just need to make sure I keep myself hydrated, well fed, and active (the workout routine needs to be more consistent/less sporadic). I was hoping I‚Äôd be looking better after 16 days of no drinking, but I still look worn out and I haven‚Äôt lost the weight that I thought I would have by now. But I am sure that will come with time as well. I am not complaining or frustrated. Just observations I‚Äôve noticed. Keeping a positive outlook has been key so far in these 16 days and will continue to be key going forward.

Hope everyone had a great, sober weekend.

So my friend who I haven‚Äôt seen much much because of all this had suggested we meet at a brewery that had a lot of outdoor seating and felt Safeish. At first I was really mentally opposed because that seemed like a silly way to spend my birthday. But I went ahead with it and honestly it was perfect and freezing but perfect. I happily drank my root beer and ate my burger and just enjoyed my friends company. I honestly wasn‚Äôt tempted in the least. I don‚Äôt say that to boast although it‚Äôs okay for me to be proud of that. But I really didn‚Äôt. And beer was my favorite poison. 

I just felt really committed to myself and my choices and that I‚Äôm just not a drinker anymore so it‚Äôs just what‚Äôs so, no biggie.
Anyway, it was so cool to feel solid in myself and in my skin. I never thought this day would come. I go back through my post history and just cringe at the person I was but I was doing my best then too.

But my brain keeps telling me i can. Sitting in the results of my failures and reflecting on how i blew it is the hardest thing. But i no longer have a choice. Siigh.

I originally made up my mind to quit drinking (while halfway through a bottle of vodka and crying about what my drinking was doing to my family) Saturday night. 


Sunday I was determined to go cold turkey. Sunday afternoon I began experiencing pretty bad withdrawal symptoms, which got progressively worse throughout the early evening. My wife was very concerned to the point she suggested that I take a shot or two to take the edge off. I went to the liquor cabinet, looked at the bottle, but just couldn‚Äôt do it. 


As I was lying in bed, sweating and shaking uncontrollably, my wife asked if she could make some phone calls ( to our insurance, and then to a detox facility). I agreed. She called got a hold of a detox facility, described my symptoms, and they wanted to get me in ASAP. 


The Detox facility was great, and I am extremely glad I got the help to detox safely. I refused their recommendation for a 30 day sober house (for a number of reasons) and am now back home with a whole bunch of meds as I continue the detox. If anyone is curious I am happy to list them.


Now to the questions: Has anyone had luck with the SMART recovery program? We did AA meetings at the detox facility, and while I know it works for a lot of people, I don‚Äôt think I would stick with it. A fellow detoxer had a copy of the SMART recovery handbook and it really resonated with me.


Last question at the moment, how long in your experience does it take for the damn brain fog to go away? I know the physical symptoms of detoxing can linger, but I forgot to ask the doctor about the brain fog.

So I did one of these around 30 days, and I know it helps to see where other people are when you‚Äôre just starting out and as you move along. So here‚Äôs my 90 day recap: 

I think 90 days has been easy to get TO, but tough to get THROUGH- at the same time. I have definitely been struggling a little lately, but I realized it was on my own account. I stopped doing the things that helped me in early sobriety, like checking in here, journaling, talking to my circle about my sobriety, etc. I started just living sober but not practicing my sobriety. So I am back on track with all of that!

My mind is clear. My sweet tooth has subsided. I‚Äôve gotten my diet and exercise routine pretty ironed out. 

I‚Äôve learned A LOT about myself. I learned that I was ignoring a lot of shit before. Some days have actually been a little harder for me with sobriety, which sounds awful, but it just means I‚Äôm dealing with my anxiety and life and feelings, instead of hiding and ignoring them. Of course facing things head on is going to be harder, but overall life is easier. I know that sounds contradictory, but it is true. Some things are harder, but life is easier. 

I am moody still. I still have some anger I am dealing with, but the cool thing is I recognize my mood swings now and I take control of them. I don‚Äôt let my emotions win anymore. 

My body seems to be adjusted pretty well. The overall exhaustion has subsided, I have a lot more energy. In early sobriety I was peeing constantly, that has chilled out a bit too. 

I still have some ‚Äúshame‚Äù that I am working through. Some guilt too... but my circle has been awesome and really supportive. I am really making it a point to be as kind as I can be to those that have been there through my alcoholism and now my sobriety. 

I attribute all this to dealing with my problems, finding a routine and some consistency, being kind to myself, and also taking vitamins seems to be a big helper. I also have been seeking out people I know are sober and getting help from them. Also, quit lit, Facebook groups, podcasts... they‚Äôre all huge tools in my toolbox. 

If you‚Äôre on day one or thinking about day one, I had many days ones before it ‚Äústuck‚Äù with me. Just keep stringing each day together! IWNDWYT",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7321704030036926}"

I‚Äôm not resetting my days because it wasn‚Äôt a bottle of wine plus 8 Jack and cokes, which was a more ‚Äútypical‚Äù evening consumption for me. 

But wanted to note that i didn‚Äôt really enjoy the wine. I didn‚Äôt feel a pleasant celebratory buzz. 

And I‚Äôm not hung over today but I‚Äôm feeling the high heart rate and the anxiety. It feels like (at this moment at least) that something has fundamentally shifted about the way I am perceiving ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù with alcohol. 

And I suppose that‚Äôs good and healthy because I don‚Äôt really have a desire to do it again. But it also makes me feel a little sad too, tbh. Maybe that‚Äôs dumb.

It's also not as if there aren't things for me to do; I have work that I've been taking more time with and which has been steadily improving in quality. And I have a sponsor, go to three meetings a day, and a higher power, though I'm not always able to get the sponsor or higher power on the line. I just feel kind of... Pointless. Most days I work out for an hour and then take melatonin at 7:30 so I'll go to sleep and not be bored. The only people I interact with are friends and family members I just send memes to, and people in AA who seem to feel similarly to me. I also have a therapist but I'm thinking of not going anymore because I start the session Happy and leave full of resentment at people, which is gonna screw me over at some point. 
Things that used to entertain me while drunk now feel like chores. I don't care about music books or television shows now there's so much blood in my alcohol system. I guess I'm just complaining, and I'm sure I'll discover some new hobby like basket weaving or riverboat gambling in a few years when quarantine ends.

I have tried to numb the pain caused from keeping these toxic relationships going with these family members my whole life and I don't need to do that anymore. I see the situation clearly now, I will never lie to myself about what's happening ever again. I can focus on myself now and let the healing start to happen as I rid my life of this negative energy.

It will take awhile for me to be financially and emotionally free from this situation but I am taking those steps today sober, and that feels awesome. I actually feel like I am taking back control over my life. I know that when I have cravings or need a rant I can always come to this community for support and that really gives me some extra confidence with my new found sobriety and path forward.

2020-11-08 08:52:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jqc1u1/stopping_drinking_at_social_functions/,Stopping drinking at social functions,"I have to learn how to tell people at social functions that I am not drinking. It's easy to not drink when I'm home and not buying myself drinks. It's so much harder at social functions when others are indulging or offering them to me.

This is just a recollection of how I ended up drunk yesterday and hung over right now. A memo to have access to when the holidays come soon. A note to remind myself why I cant have a single beverage, but I figured I would share it in case anyone can relate.

I had 1 beer with my parents in the afternoon around 3pm and then they offered me 3 beers to take home, which I accepted because I wasn't sure how to say no without causing questions. Everyone is so used to me being a drinker. Already having 3 beers in my trunk turned into buying a 6 pack on the way home and thinking of excuses to rationalize why I could have more. ""I won't have all of them today, just a few."" Or ""today is a special day because Biden won the election, everyone else is celebrating why cant i?"" Too many other excuses to name, but the list goes on. Of course I finished all 9 of those beers by 10pm and didnt want the night to end so I began to drink my roommates hard cider and ended the night having 4 more of those. Additionally, my roommate smokes and usually I can resist having cigarettes, but obviously while drinking I ended up having about 5 cigarettes during the course of the night because they felt so good while drunk. So all in all from the time I had 1 beer with my parents, I rationalized my way into having 13 more and 5 cigarettes by the end of the night. My night consisted of mostly just playing video games with my roommates, which I was terrible at and barely remember. I keep thinking how I could have easily played games with them sober and it would have been the same amount of fun, if not more fun because I would have been able to help more and we could have won more easily. Instead I'm laying here barely able to remember playing games with them and my body/mind feeling terrible.

I'm not sure if this will be read by anyone or help anyone, but I just wanted to remind myself that even 1 beer is a slippery slope for me. I need to learn to say no to drinking at social gatherings even if other people are indulging. Maybe posting this will help hold me more accountable in the future.

Today is another day of starting over. Hopefully I can find the strength and willpower to resist this time and stop drinking permanently.

My general plan has been to start by quitting alcohol during the week and move to reducing on the weekend. It hasn't worked, and yesterday morning I woke up depressed about the fact that once again, it had not worked. 

And it's hard to feel full of resolve and promise about Monday morning on a Saturday. But my friend pod (3 couples who meet about once or twice a week for safely-distanced meals or hanging out) had a dinner party scheduled for yesterday evening AND a theater-rental for tonight.  

Still. I felt over. it. 

So I messaged the hostess to ask if I could bring something *in addition to* the Perrier that I would be drinking ('experimenting with fixes for anxiety and sleeplessness!'). Which was not awkward at all, and suddenly I had someone I was accountable to for my morning promises. And since I'm hanging out with them tonight, I am pretty much accountable for day 2 as well.

2020-11-08 08:07:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jqbfk9/day_2_same_old_story/,"Day 2, Same Old Story","Hey everyone. Pretty standard story here. Been drinking for about 13 years and for most of that I considered myself a casual drinker. The past couple years I started drinking more, even occasionally buying an 'extra' bottle of vodka the wife didn't know about, but I still thought it was fine. I didn't drink every day. Sometimes (although less and less frequently) I'd even go several weeks without drinking anything. That meant it was still casual, right?

Then 2020 hit. I didn't lose my job, but I did start working from home full-time, with that oh-so-convenient liquor cabinet just a room away. The wife was split between telework and going into the office, and on the days she went in I'd drink literally the entire day. I'd drink slow enough that it didn't really effect my work, but enough to be buzzed. I didn't want my wife to worry about how much I was drinking, so the hidden bottles of vodka became the norm. I would drink as much as I wanted from those, then make myself an 'official' drink right before she came home so it would look like I'd only had one. Then I started mixing a little vodka into my water bottles so I could drink while she was home too. By then I knew I had a problem, but rationalized it to myself. It was just because 2020 was so stressful. Once things went back to normal I'd stop.

My wife, not being an idiot, started questioning how often it looked like I was drunk when she got home. I brushed it aside. She has a drink every day after work; why couldn't I? The fact that her drink is a quarter shot of Baileys in some hot chocolate while even my 'official' drink was at least two shots of whiskey was irrevelant. 

Last Tuesday, U.S. election day, she told me she was concerned and didn't want me drinking for the rest of the month. I said sure. Brushed it off like it was no big deal. I knew I had no intention of keeping that promise, but I figured I'd stop the 'official' drinks and cut back on the unofficial ones. As long as I didn't look drunk, she'd never know. Right?

Last Friday she went into the office for the first time since telling me to stop. I told myself I'd make sure I was sober before she got home. I wasn't. I'm not sure how drunk I was acting, but I was definitely drunk that night. A fact that hit me when I woke up at 3am Saturday morning. I couldn't even keep up the *appearance* of being sober for a single week. I spent the rest of the night frantic with worry about what she was going to say. How disappointed she must be. How I'd broken her trust. 

She still hasn't said anything. I don't know if she's going to, and I'm too ashamed to bring it up myself. But I never, ever want to feel that way again. I threw out all my 'unofficial' alcohol and have put my 'official' alcohol in a different cabinet on a higher shelf where I can't easily see or reach it. (I'm hoping having it in a different place will be one step towards breaking the routine.) I joined this subreddit, downloaded the 'I Am Sober' app, and listened to a couple of the Naked Mind podcasts.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens‚Äîgood or bad‚Äîand invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let‚Äôs not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn‚Äôt:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I used to binge every day, anywhere from half a bottle to a whole one, and this went on for almost 3 years. I've been doing a lot better since I came clean about everything to my boyfriend in September and made a serious resolve to stop. I've had a few slip ups since then, but overall my drinking is down 99%. 

Now that my tolerance is down, I got maybe 1/3 of the way through the bottle before having to call it quits. I had missed the feeling of being drunk, but it was so not worth the shame and anxiety that came with hiding this recent slip up from my loving and supportive boyfriend. It wasn't worth the headache, upset stomach, foggy brain and puffy face that I have now. 

I know I shouldn't have gotten the bottle at all, but in a way this experience has been affirming for me. It's easy to forget how shitty you felt after drinking when you've been off the sauce for a while. Even though it was a mistake, it showed me that my body is working very hard to heal itself, and has already come a long way in the last couple months. I don't want to mess that up, and I remember now that being drunk for a few hours isn't worth feeling like shit emotionally and physically. 

The rest of the bottle just went down the drain, and it didn't hurt NEARLY as much as I thought it would. I don't need that shit. I don't even want it, which is a new and welcome feeling.

This is actually something that was said to me recently whilst talking about drinking, exercise, smoking and health. The friend who said it doesn't drink alcohol at all but they do smoke and they don't exercise and they are overweight (they drink litres of full sugar coke a day) and have type 2 diabetes and now a diagnosis of copd.

It got me thinking about risk and why we use these types of phrases to justify our reasons for doing things that are proven to be bad for us and not doing things that are proven to be good for us.

http://imgur.com/a/EkpNgJ8

According to the World Health Organisation the five leading global risks for mortality in the world are high blood pressure, tobacco use, high blood glucose, physical inactivity and overweight and obesity. They are responsible for raising the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancers. They affect countries across all income groups: high, middle and low.

The chance of being run over by a bus as far as I can find out in the UK per year is around 1 in 2 million.

The chances of being killed by a shark are 1 in 300 million. Presumably this risk can be eliminated almost fully if I avoid the sea!

The benefits of exercise are huge.

According to the NHS it is medically proven that people who do regular exercise have:

* up to a¬†35% lower risk of coronary heart disease and stroke 

* up to a 50% lower risk of type 2 diabetes 

* up to a 50% lower risk of colon cancer 

* up to a 20% lower risk of breast cancer 

* a 30% lower risk of early death 

* up to an 83% lower risk of osteoarthritis 

* up to a 68% lower risk of hip fracture 

* a 30% lower risk of falls (among older adults) 

* up to a 30% lower risk of depression 

* up to a 30% lower risk of dementia

A lot of these illnesses are not necessarily instant death but carry a burden upon our quality of life potentially for many years. The WHO called these DALYs which stands for Disability-Adjusted Life Years.

I'm no Saint! I've smoked, drunk heavily, taken my fair share of illegal drugs and struggled most of my life with weight issues. Like everyone else in this community I am here trying to fix certain aspects of my life that are having a negative impact on my existence. I was not worried or anxious about being run over by a bus or being eaten by a shark. I was worried and anxious about the impact my drinking, weight and lack of physical activity was having on my health. I had high blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels, I was at risk from type 2 diabetes.

When I cross a road I stop, look and listen (thanks Tufty Club) to make sure it is safe to do so. The risk then of being run over by a bus is reduced significantly. I just need to apply this same methodology to the diseases and health conditions listed above that ARE the big causes of early death or DALYs for us humans across the globe and do what I can to minimise these risks.

Hello everyone, how has your week been? Lots of stressors I think with elections and global pandemics currently! The UK is back in national lockdown which has shut down gyms and indoor sports centres. Now also we have shorter daylight hours and colder weather so I imagine for many it has become a lot harder to find the motivation for alternative methods to exercise.

I woke up on this Sunday morning feeling fresh with the only ache from a new hobby, cycling, that I've picked up since I stopped. No hangover, no headaches, no wanting to throw up, no fear of the night before. Exactly two months ago I woke up and realised that alcohol had stopped being fun for me. It wasn't helping me be my fun, bubbly self anymore and was, in fact, hindering that. It had started to become more important than work, and a vicious cycle had started - work not going well because drinking, work not going well so drinking. I wasn't stopping (or not starting) when I should have. I was tired all the time. Everything was overwhelming me. I just wasn't myself, and it hit me that I wasn't enjoying the me I was becoming.

I never expected myself to stop drinking. Let alone of my own free will. Let alone enjoy it! I've got new hobbies, more time, more money. I feel less tired. I've learned I don't need to drink to have fun with friends. And, I think the biggest thing for me is that I feel capable and confident in my ability to manage things, in all aspects of life. Stopping drinking hasn't made my anxieties miraculously go away, but it's given me back the control, and headspace, to do my best to deal with them.

When I started on this journey I didn't know how long it would be for, or really why I was doing it, just that something wasn't feeling right. This community, reading about peoples experiences and reflections, has really helped me get my head around the whys and the hows, which in turn has helped me to stick with it. So thank you all!

Right now im in a ok place mentally so ive reduced it from daily heavy drinking to only drinking 2-3 days a week.

 The problem is: a) Since i dont have any friends i tend to get bored and alcohol helps me have a good time by myself, so ultimately ive associated it in my head with having fun, so every time i feel bored or down i drink. 

And b) i just like the feeling. When i drink i feel happy, i feel relaxed and im having fun. Right now its a nice sunday noon, i got nothing else to do and im thinking of buying a 6pack of beers and watching 2 movies but i know ill regret it tommorow. 

Another thing is i need to stop, because when i drink, i go all the way, like i wont just drink 1-2 drinks ill drink 2 bottles of wine or 6-7 beers or sth until i pass out and the worse is that the alcohol makes me hungry and i tend to eat a lot, so i cant lose the weight i want to lose. The only reason that im not drinking every day is cuz i care about my weight and my looks. Otherwise id be drunk 24/7

So what do i do? Its so heavily linked with ""having fun"" in my head that has made me not enjoy or having fun the rest of the days that im not drinking",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9700278639793396}"

I do.,"I was 16 or 17 and it was the holidays. It was a hot sunny afternoon, and everyone else had gone for a nap. I sat in the darkened living room, watching Robert Downey Junior's Sherlock Holmes and after I don't know how many glances at the top of the tv cabinet, I got up, and went to fetch my bright yellow ugly-ass plastic freezer stein. \[I wish I still had it so that I could destroy it myself as a symbol\]. It was frozen, and therefore cold, so I tipped in my nice cold coke. Then I thought to myself, 'no one even has to know'. So I picked up the bottle and poured myself a 'sneaky little drink'.   


It tasted hot, because the liquor had been above the tv cabinet for a good while and not in the fridge. I waited for it to get cold. For fifteen minutes I switched between watching the movie and watching my drink, waiting desperately for it to be cold enough. I drank it. I poured myself another. I still remember the burn in my empty guts as it settled.   


I might have been pouring my second. OR it could have been my fourth (I'm positive it wasn't more than four). My mum woke up from her nap. 'Having a drink are ya?' It was maybe 4 o clock by now, I was starting on the sequel.   
'Yeah,' I said casually. Mum sat down, watched the movie with me and checked her facebook. Then I felt like I should never keep it a secret, because that might end up bad. \[Hello, mini me-Big Red Fucking Flag here, sweetheart!\]  
'Actually,' I said, 'I've been drinking all afternoon. I just, you know, felt like one.'   
'That's ok, you're allowed to drink.'   


Now I wish I could go back in time and tell teenage me that 'Hey, if you feel the need to keep it secret, you should get up, grab the bottle and pour the whole thing out. Never touch alcohol again'. If only, right?   


Would anyone like to share their 'switch-flipping' moment?   


  
NB: I want to add, legal is 18 here, but the culture is very much a permissive one, where everyone knows someone (or is someone) who started drinking a few years early and the 'at least its under my roof' attitude is maybe a little too permissive. I get that it's harm minimization and all, but maybe buying your 15 year old an alcopop or four from time to time was a bad decision, no? Maybe pouring them a drink at thirteen (once on a SCHOOL night) wasn't setting them up for success? I hadn't even asked for a drink that night...  


I'm not blaming my parents. **If I'm addicted, that's because of my own brain chemistry and my own decision to drink. I get that. My drinking was on me, my problem is on me, my sobriety is on me.** I just kind of wish my parents had been more prohibitive about it. They aren't even alcoholics. My dad wasn't, my mum isn't. Hell, she barely drinks at all. I just think, a later introduction to alcohol might have led me into better choices.  


Maybe someone here knows better than I do and can share some wisdom. Please, share away.   


Even if no one wants to add anything or share anything, thanks for listening to me ramble. I literally have zero IRL people who I can discuss this with. Thanks.

What's the difference this time around? I truly want it. What's funny, though, is how many times I told myself, ""I don't know how much lower I can go than this.""I've been to rehab, lived in a sober living home, and in-and-out of jail. Wrecking my car and having no memory of it was it for me. The inability to drive myself to a bar stool has definitely helped this time around, but I have always found a way to end up at one with a car or not.

Before, I'd try and take the program in giant chunks just to be able to say that I was one month sober and on step five. I wanted to be that person in the rooms who found joy in sobriety.

I suppose I am proud of myself, and hopeful for the future. I feel as if, by now, I should feel more confident. Looking back it doesn‚Äôt feel like 3 months. This momentous day comes at a strange time. I‚Äôve found myself riddled with depression and anxiety the last few days. Not pertaining to anything in particular, my moods have a specific and erratic pattern that I‚Äôve grown used to. The bad shit comes on hard and fast and disappears like a thief in the night. I am proud that I no longer feel the the need to escape when things get hard. I can sit here and feel every agonizing bit of crushing existential dread. I can appreciate my existence and feel tremendous pain, knowing it will pass.

I am terrified and disgusted, that there still lives inside of me a person who wants to drink and get high. I am still working on fully accepting these are feelings that will always be here and do not define me. I will say the cravings feel farther away. I feel them but there is dissonance between the urge and my sense of self, almost as if it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs feeling inside of me. I stay guarded against feeling compelled to drink, but it‚Äôs a less persuasive whisper, a duller scream. Grateful for that.

So my 90 days is slightly overshadowed by my brain‚Äôs cyclical refusal to function properly. But I appreciate it, and hope for many more days, all the same.

My coworker showed up and could tell I was still drunk. So when my second driver showed up, I got sent home, where I stumbled into my bed and passed out again.

I awoke a few hours later in the dark, wet from having pissed myself. I felt hungover, and I was confused why I was at home when I knew I should be at work. It all kind of came back to me what happened that morning.

I texted my coworker and apologized for having him cover my shift and told him I‚Äôd pay him $40 for the tips he missed out on for the day since he didn‚Äôt take any deliveries.

I walked back to the store and talked with my boss in the office and apologized and promised it would not happen again. I got my key and drove home.

The fact that I didn‚Äôt get fired and somehow didn‚Äôt get kicked out of my sober house, or the fact that I didn‚Äôt hit anyone while driving under the influence or getting a DUI, made me resolve to never drink again.

November through February was rough. I hate winter, I hate snow, the loss of sunlight makes me bitter. I ate a lot of ice cream to get through the cravings in the first 90 days, and the first year.

In March 2017 I watched as my mom passed out on my birthday from drinking too much. She got a DUI a month later. And in October I watched helplessly as she got drunk at my cousin‚Äôs wedding and got kicked out from the wedding by all her sisters.

Those moments really made me want to relapse, but I stayed strong, promising myself ‚ÄúIt only gets better when I get better.‚Äù

After reaching 1 year sober, I decided it was time to move into my own apartment instead of living at the sober house. I came across a really nice apartment complex that I could afford and moved in February 2018.

Between February 2018 and January 2020 I went from 220lbs to 140lbs, but unfortunately since the pandemic hit I‚Äôve gained 40lbs.

Life hasn‚Äôt been perfect. It hasn‚Äôt been easy. I turned 30 earlier this year and kinda wanted to relapse but I pushed through the temptations. But life has certainly been more manageable than it ever was when I was drinking 5 days a week.

Thanks for reading all of this! Whether you‚Äôre just starting out, or have 10+ years of sobriety, I wish you peace and strength today.",81,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984373450279236}"

I am a 28 y/o male and up until Jan 1st of this year I had not been sober for more than a week for the past 10 years... and drinking daily for probably half of that time.

Luckily I went 120 days this year but I fell off the wagon when the pandemic happened. I have probably quit 4 other times since then for a week or so, but for the most part, daily drinking, mostly alone, and starting in the morning (just went and bought a half pint of tito's and had a swig). 

Last night I read the post about someone's brother who died from going cold turkey and he was also 28, and I'm worried that can very well happen to me...

The withdrawals aren't too extreme, but I'm at that point again where I need to drink to feel better every morning, and haven't been eating well or even at all, and my body and mind are obviously in trouble.

I just really need some support this time around and I don't know how much I should taper off and for how long? One less shot per day? 

I went to AA a few times last year and it wasn't sustainable for me, I would rather be a part of this online community and actually interact on this sub.

My parents are alcoholics and former drug addicts, I think that plays a big role in why I am like this.

I think another reason for my drinking is that I suffer from social anxiety and self confidence problems even though am actually pretty successful and good looking, I've always thought alcohol helps me be my true self, but more often than not it goes too far and I do things that aren't aligned with my moral values.

I went to therapy but it wasn't the right time or person, maybe I'll try again.

Most of my intimate relationships have failed due to my alcoholism. My mental health suffers greatly and I am lucky I haven't lost my job yet.

I'm scared and I need some help.

My drinking went into overdrive last time. I became nihilistic. Figured it didn't matter much. That everything was going to hell anyways. I lost a lot of friends getting drunk and spewing off to them for their opinions. I got account bans. 

I already was a heavy drinker so its not like I can blame the event. But I did use it as an excuse and to dull my brain. I even bought a timelock safe for my phone so I couldn't use it when I started drinking. Other wise I'd wake up to some truly serious regret for what I'd texted or posted.

I was drunk last night and got a seven day Facebook. Somebody not happy with the way things are going posted a homophobic slur. I mean, I definitely think the person deserved the response i gave them but it didn't need to be said. And its friggin' Facebook. What does it matter.

Anyways, I'm thinking the next few months are going to be tough on everyone. So I'm going to try and be sober for it and not be part of the problem. There is a lot to be done. And I've been too drunk, lazy, and self centered to do anything about it. I don't want anybody else feeling like I did.

Thank you so much for this site ‚Äì it‚Äôs been great to feel part of something so supportive.  Really - thank you so much.
 
I stopped drinking 21 days ago. Just woke up one morning and said, ‚ÄòRight that‚Äôs it fat boy ‚Äì I‚Äôm an ex-drinker‚Äô

To give some context (because I have a question I‚Äôd really love an answer to if possible)...
 
For the last 30 years (I‚Äôm 50) I‚Äôve been pretty sloshed by 2pm (lunches at work and pub when at home) and pissed as a fart in a lift every day by 8 (save for a few weeks on TSM). No passing out but perhaps 3 mornings a week there‚Äôd be some blanks of the evening before. During lockdown (WFH) I was downing 4 cans of 5% cider between 07 and 09 then a bottle of Prosecco for lunch and two more in the evening. Always hid the prosecco in a couple   of thermos flasks in the clothes cupboard. Kept it fizzy and slightly chilled! At the weekend this intake would increase followed by clandestine trips to the bottle bank and my garage (away from the house and used for motorbikes so the OH never goes there) was utterly full of probably 100 prosecco bottles. (Not an exaggeration.) Somehow whilst doing this I managed hours of daily Zoom meetings and still have my job.
 
4 years ago I tried spirits in an attempt to lose weight (Yep. Really) but it was obvious that I could down 2 bottles of gin a day and that was too much even for me. Was easy to stop the spirits ands avoid the horrendous hangies  
 
Thing is ‚Äì and I really hope this doesn‚Äôt come across as in any way boastful ‚Äì it‚Äôs been easy. And I don‚Äôt know why. I just don‚Äôt actually want to drink. I‚Äôve been piling into sweets and ice cream and non-alcoholic beers but of actual alcohol ‚Äì not a millilitre. Is this perhaps odd? Would lover to hear others‚Äô views.
 
When I tried TSM a few times it certainly worked very short-term but there was no real desire to actually stop. So I didn‚Äôt.
 
My OH stopped the same day as me and isn‚Äôt finding it so easy but that‚Äôs her journey of course but I think we‚Äôre so fortunate to be doing it together. I KNOW I couldn‚Äôt do it alone.
 
Sleep hasn‚Äôt changed ‚Äì still awake at 04 daily and read the paper online but energy levels are off the scale and no more afternoon combat-kipping. We go to bed at 7 or 8 now though and read which is awesome üòä I‚Äôm 17st so hopefully the weight will start to shift too ‚Äì nothing so far over three weeks which is maybe the sweets? Not sure
 
Anywway thank you for all the posts they really help and I‚Äôd love to read any comments üòä
 
Take care folks and love from England

Long time lurker, first time poster.  About 2 weeks ago I started a dual diagnosis therapy program.  It was long overdue and is the first time I've approached dealing with my alcohol abuse and mental health issues as a willing adult.  After many barriers to treatment, I found a dual diag program that was willing to accept me, I was willing to accept them and it seemed like a good match.  I'm taking a mood stabilizer, and something for alcohol cravings (naltrexone).  The therapy in conjunction with the medication has been working well so far for me.  I attended my first sober (from alcohol) Halloween party***** since I was like 14.  A friend of ours that was supposed to be at the party didn't show up.  We didn't hear from him the next day either.  After several frantic days of searching, we found his car.  And then his body was found.  He had taken his own life.  This man to me was a human labrador. The physical embodiment of Mr peanut butter from Bojack.  Always happy, always happy to see you,to introduce you to this awesome new thing he found.  When I moved into town, he made me feel like a part of a community, and did the same for so many others as well.  A lot of the gatherings in the wake of his death have been at local bars, and I haven't really had a good chance besides therapy to really grieve, and I just wanted to tell a few other people about this awesome human who meant to much to me. I'm celebrating his life today by not drinking.  By tackling my problems head on instead of continuing to drown them in a sea of alcohol.  Will you join me? I'm not drinking today.

2020-11-07 10:31:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jpsqvz/one_week_sober_some_thoughts/,One Week Sober - Some Thoughts,"Good morning everyone!

I am so happy I found this sub. I have had a drinking for years but have never really been able to wrangle it. There have been instances in the past where I have tried going sober, but as many of us here have experienced I ultimately failed in many of those attempts. Near as I can tell at the moment it was not for a lack of talking to my wife or wanting to be a better dad for my son. It is mostly due to a lack of support from people going through the same thing and probably hubris in thinking I can control this on my own. 

As it probably comes to no one's surprise, alcohol can be a very difficult think to control when going alone. Even my wife's support was not quite enough each time. Likely due to the fact that she has little motivation to drink and simply put has trouble understanding the mindset of a problematic drinker. I do not fault her for this and I understand the difficulty in understanding why I drink. Frankly, I believe most of us have difficulty ourselves understanding why we drink. It is what makes stopping such a problem. We find ourselves in a cycle that makes no sense yet is extremely hard to break.

This sub however has helped spark something different in me this time around. There is something very tangible about reaching out, even to the internet, that has helped to motivate me. So I want to thank everyone here for posting their experiences both good and bad. We are all battling something so difficult but I really believe through supporting each other and being honest with our experiences we can come out better.

In one short week I have seen amazing improvements to my quality of life. The general lethargy is mostly gone. My mind feels sharper and each daily experience seems more vivid. I am being a much better father and husband which in turn is helping me to feel better about myself. Feelings of depression or that I'm not good enough have shrunk and I can feel myself moving back to my sort of semi-cocky self. These are all great things that I want to hold on to.

Furthermore, I have started reading again. I have been a huge reader in the past, but my years of drinking stripped that of me. It is probably no mystery here, but reading winds up being rather difficult when drunk. Rather than read I would sit down at night with a bottle, play video games and then not even remember what I played when I woke up in the morning. While I might still enjoy a video game, I am so very happy to be reading again. It is a simple thing, but something I truly enjoy and I have it back. 

Of course, I would be remiss to not mention the struggles that I have had. The first 4 days of the last week were very difficult. The hangover on the first day the obvious start. But there was a lingering headache the next 3 that was almost debilitating. I do not generally get headaches so I can only attribute this to withdrawal. Then of course the desire to grab a drink during those days was there. I believe in an effort to fix the headache as well as to get my body back to ""where I wanted it."" Granted I did not truly want to be back drinking, but my body definitely was looking for something to fix itself.

But for the first time in a very, very long while I am feeling positive about future events. I do not know what they will be, but the fixation on where I can get alcohol next is slowly subsiding. That alone is enough lift me up. But through this sub I'm finding something even more than a simple pick up. It is motivation, it is belief, and it is trust in myself. So thank you everyone and keep posting! I know I will be. And trust yourself to not drink. Because not only are you able to refuse, you are absolutely worth the effort.

I still catch myself romanticizing the idea of ""just one drink"", but I know that with me it could never be just one. And if I pick it up again, I may never be able to put it down. When it comes to me vs. alcohol, I know it will always win, and the key is to not get in the ring with it in the first place. 

The cravings still bother me at times, I'm still a flawed person with a lot of work to do, and there are aspects of my life in need of significant repair. But removing booze has made it 1000 times easier to deal with those things. When I was drinking, my physical, emotional, and intellectual capacities were totally consumed by alcohol. It was the program always running in the background, and I had nothing left to give to anything or anyone else. Now I have the ability, will, and desire to deal with what the world needs from me. 

Not drinking has also given me the resilience I drowned out with alcohol. I used to be so impatient and easily upset; it's like I was looking for an excuse to drink. Now, when something uncomfortable happens I have to sit in it, process it, and work through it. Turns out I'm a lot tougher and calmer when I've boarded up the escape hatch. 

Anyway, it turns out sobriety is for me and I want to continue making the choice not to drink one day at a time. Thank you to everyone here for the encouragement and kindness you've shown me. It brings me so much joy to know we're in this together. IWNDWYT",18,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8561793565750122}"

I‚Äôve begun to realize that I‚Äôve had an overinflated sense of importance most of my life.  My friends are few and far between.  Most of them are my ‚Äúbest‚Äù friends from childhood.  I see only a couple of them once or twice a year.  The rest I only have contact with via random texts.  I always felt like the center of attention when I was partying.  I think I now have to face the fact that I‚Äôve been a secondary character in peoples lives more often than not.  An annoying drunk one at that.

The good news is this isn‚Äôt making me want to drink.  Although I‚Äôm pretty sure the fear of this realization triggered some of my alcohol issues over the years.  Instead it‚Äôs motivating me to learn how to form meaningful bonds with people moving forward.  Crazy thing is that without alcohol or work I don‚Äôt have much to bond over.

I like the discomfort this is causing for me in some ways.  I think because it‚Äôs real and it‚Äôs showing me how shallow many of my relationships have been.  I‚Äôm not as upset about wasting my 20‚Äôs and much of my 30‚Äôs as I am focused on not repeating that over the rest of my life.

Can anyone relate?  This is a relatively new feeling for me, perhaps it‚Äôs part of the process and Many others have felt the same.  Any advice on how to improve?  I‚Äôm not religious, I have a family, I‚Äôm successful in my career and as great as work and the fam are it feels like something is missing.  Where would someone like me go for a new social outlet?

I thought I'd have some kind of ritual or announcement, but on the actual one year day I was distracted and it went by like any other. 

The desire is still there but its voice is small, and annoyingly familiar at this point. I'm grateful, but tired - for so many reasons - and wondering what the next ""level up"" might be from here. 

The excitement of breaking away those first few months was intense, and enough to keep me feeling ahead of the game, in motion towards something good. But now, the clouds of all colors have passed, and it's just me here in my head, with all the things I was drowning out before.

I went through phases of starting projects and hobbies, but I'm not getting very far with any of them. Instead I just see unfinished messes everywhere. I've sought out online therapy, but technical problems have made it more than frustrating, a true disappointment so far. I'm reading and thinking on my own about ways to improve but there are so many, it is overwhelming. 

For this second year, I'm determined to be more in shape, and to finish some of what I have started. The physical things make sense, and feel at least approachable. But internally, not so much.

Confidence is low, momentum is stalled, things taste and feel good but end too soon. I'm not content, but can't pinpoint why, and it is eating me alive. 

So I want to ask you, since you've bothered to read this far, how do you find joy? Once the struggle of alcohol itself is no longer center stage, what keeps you going? Where do you rest your mind, when there's too much time to think? What does it mean, if you know, to be content? 

I'm willing to face whatever needs facing, and to do whatever needs doing, but I can't see the very next step. I have a lot of days like today, a hundred things I could do but I'm stuck the minute I try to pick one. I'm very blessed and life is good, but I don't feel good. I'm restless, overwhelmed, and nowhere near content with all that I have, which is a lot. I'm willing to travel, emotionally speaking, but not sure where to go.

Have you felt this way? How do you get past it? What works for you, to find, have, understand and really feel serenity?

I scheduled an Urgent Care appointment and one look at me and they offered to call me an ambulance and go to the ER. I drove myself (great American health care system) but made it to the ER and proceeded to have the worst health care experience of my life. 2 hours later they took my vitals for the first time, and proceeded to do nothing but that while I shook and cried in a shitty chair in a hallway, not social distanced with changing times of when a doctor could see me.

Patient compassion was non existent, my first vitals check the nurse asked if I was shaking from withdrawals or just cold in front of the whole ER. (Didn't ask me if I wanted a blanket, instead another person waiting gave me a hoodie that smelled like cigarettes, but he was nicer than the staff and that hoodie gave me more comfort than any of the triage staff). At first I thought it was a shaming thing, but then I saw multiple other nurses and staff share intimate details about other patients while total strangers were shoulder to shoulder.

4 hours in I asked how long, was told 7 hours, and I told them if I'm going to die from withdrawals Id rather do it in my car, they told me I wouldn't die if I stayed, but might if I left. The whole time the hallucinations were brutal, even closing my eyes didn't stop the visuals, and the auditory ones were painful (convos between my son and his father about mommy not feeling good, crying) I knew they weren't real, but it was hard to deal with in a constant revolving door of people smashed into a small space during a pandemic.

At 6 hours my boyfriend brought me a phone charger, some headphones and some Taco Bell, that's when I was told I couldn't eat or drink until I saw the Doctor, which was no expected to be 9 hours. I broke down crying and spent another hour shaking and crying and hallucinating.

By 8 hours I was starving and thirsty, I hadn't kept food down in days and hadn't slept in 24 hours. I went to the front desk crying and begging for water, I was told they couldn't give me water, but couldn't stop me from getting one from the vending machine. I may have gotten too emotional. I'm not proud of how I acted, I was told basically to sit down and stop crying, and a woman offer me some money to buy a water. 

Apparently my outburst worked, because 45 minutes later I got a ""Quiet room"" which I think is code for probably mentally unstable and included bars on the bed and a camera, also right by the security desk. I was seen almost immediately after that and the doctor gave me the choice of an anti seizure med or Ativan, chose the seizure med because Ativan had the risk of addiction and I didn't want to risk it. I asked for a social worker, they didn't have one, but made me promise to go to meetings again.  As the doctor walked out he said to the nurse ""that went better than I expected"". I guess my hallucinations induced scene was talked about among the staff a bit.

The nurse in the back was an angel, she joked with me, had me answer questions while the meds were taking effect, finally got me some water (best water I ever tasted). I got to go home a few hours later. I know there is a chance the withdrawals will come back before we're over, but the whole experience makes me feel a million times lighter. 15 hours later....I was home in bed, with clean sheets and my puppies, and actually got good sleep.

The whole thing has me thinking about American healthcare. How we treat addicts, how burnt out our healthcare workers are, and how much I hate hospitals.

Thanks for reading my novel. Even though the experience was painful and I could have handled things better, I'm glad I did it. Day 3 is a million times better than any day drinking. I feel happy like really happy and excited for the future for the first time in months.

Medical detox/drugs to get off drugs is something I never considered before when I started my sober journey, but I needed it. Would not recommend sitting in a chair while people puke and have seizures around you while going through withdrawals 0/10 on that part.

One day we went on a ferry ride and I stopped in at the train station grocery store to get some sugar-free Red Bulls while he waited with the bikes. As I came out it occurred to me that in the good old days I would have bought two strong beers, chugged them real quick, and opened a Heineken to cover up the two strong beers just so I could be as drunk as I needed to be without having to discuss it or explain myself.

It was an odd sensation. I didn't feel any shame about it (then or now), and I wasn't feeling like ""oh I wish I could still be secretly chugging 8.6jes"" but it was striking how obviously problematic that had been, but also really normal, like it had been the right thing to do. I used to have such a strong drive to be drunk all the time, and it was such a problem for me when I couldn't drink, that things were honestly better when I could. Like, if something had prevented me from downing the strong-beer tall-boys that would have been a real problem. Getting the red bulls, the stakes were so much lower. Being sober is just a hell of a lot easier.

Anyway when I came outside and told Husband about all that he was like ""uh that's insane dude."" Less nuanced but still totally true.

This will be my second time trying the program and probably my 6th or 7th time in the past two years to try to stop drinking.  Technically this isn't even day 1 yet.

I've known I have a problem for a long time but was always unwilling to do anything about it.  I blackout without fail every time I drink liquor.  Last year I lost my partner of 4 years, our apartment, my car, and a lot of my friends from drinking.  I started going to meetings and did 30 in 30 days, but fell off when I had to travel for work.  My city locked down about a week after that, I was laid off, and my career disappeared over night due to the pandemic.  Turned 30 the next day.  I figured then was not the time to be quitting anything. 

Weeks turned into months of non stop drinking and drugging with my roommates while we struggled to come up with the rent and keep our sanity.  

Its now month 8.  I had sworn off drugs and liquor but still drank beer.  After about a month of that I dipped my toes back into hard alcohol and, as if I expected a different result, blacked out every time.  Last night I blacked out at my friends birthday and argued with everyone.  It may have compromised the only work I had lined up in November. No one will respond to my apologies.

Its time to give it a real shot again.  I fucking hate AA and I love partying.  I can't imagine being sober forever. But I can almost see the bottom, and I'm hurting myself and the people I care about.  Wish I could be normal and not turn into a different person, but I know I can't.

He said, and told my family, it was because of the drinking and that he was just done.  
We had moved into a beautiful home 3 months prior and I didnt miraculously change right away.  He has been cold and distant, hes not the person I knew when I have actually gotten him on the phone.  I have sent letters of apology/cried, tried to be casual, I have tried everything and I get little emotion in return.
I am confused because his actions say its forever, but we have been each others everything since we were kids and his former stepmother said he sounds depressed.  I've suspected another person and the drinking is the scapegoat, I've thought hes protecting himself, ive thought hes a covert narcissist lol, so confused.  He basically pulled the wife abandonment syndrome on me- but add in my alcohol dependence for good measure to further muddy the waters.  
I want to know if anyone had their spouse leave them, sound declarative and final, and when they got sober for awhile, if their spouse gave them another chance.  I just.. cant believe it still.

My family agrees hes done this the wrong way, he says hes done, but then, when I read him something when I first got to my mothers he said he had ""a lot to think about.""

Best friends, inseparable.  2 dogs and a new house.  Is it possible he will change his mind somewhere down the line?  He never gave me a bottom line, an ultimatum, like 'get sober or get out.'

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Wow! This week has been so cool! For my last post of the week, I thought I'd talk about what is--in my mind--one of the greatest gifts of sobriety, and that is sober sleep and pleasant mornings! They're separate things, I know, but it's truly a package deal.

When I was drinking, I seldom slept well or woke up feeling good, and that really wore me down. I was irritable and moody pretty much all the time because I was *always* tired. It was hard to accomplish even simple stuff. And forget about exercising, reading, baking, or any of the other things that I enjoy! It was a miserable existence.

Since getting sober, my sleep quality is phenomenal and my daytime energy levels are through the roof! I have no trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and I wake up feeling rested. I can handle just about freaking anything now! I usually start my day off with a little music, reading meditation, and journaling. (I know that sounds like a lot but I only spend about 20-30 minutes doing it and it makes a huge difference in my day.) Then, I have a little coffee and Stop Drinking Reddit time before I go about my day. 

When I drank, my sleep was fitful, and my mornings were painful. In sobriety, my sleep is restful and my mornings are beautiful. And as long as I don't drink today, I'll have another restful night tonight and a beautiful morning tomorrow! I am so grateful for these amazing gifts!

2020-11-06 22:02:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jpja3l/sobriety_threatening_event_looming/,Sobriety threatening event looming,"Hi all. Been around these parts for some time, but started participating more recently because I have almost 4 months under my belt and really want to keep it going. Longest period of sobriety has been two 5 month stints, punctuated by months of drinking. I really want this one to last. 

Long story short, my husband, son and I have been living at my MIL's (vacant) FL house for the past 9 months. We escaped NJ during the Corona craziness, put our place on the market and have been living in here since then (with her blessing, of course) until we get our own place. My MIL has lots of health problems and at the recommendation of her doctors, has not traveled down to her FL home during the winter like she usually does.

Let's just say that lockdown was not good for my drinking. Especially lockdown in a large house with a large liquor cabinet. And wine cooler. And wine cellar. And beer closet. Ugh. My drinking reached new levels having unfettered access to bottles upon bottles upon bottles. The anxiety with the lockdown combined with the easy access to umpteen sources of alcohol was not a good combination for me. With the grace of god I was able to stop in mid July. And since I had already drank or poured out most of the booze in the house, we've been dry over here. No temptations. 

Well, my MIL tells me last night that despite her doctors orders not to travel, she's going to come down here in 2 weeks for 10 days. She doesn't know I'm an alcoholic as I've always portrayed the image of being the ""Good"" one and having it all together, etc. Problem is, she's going to want to know where all the alcohol went. We're gonna have to replace the wine that was consumed from March to July. She always has a handle of Ketel One on hand. I really don't want to be around booze. 

My MIL has a lot of great qualities, but she's still my MIL. Despite her positive attributes, she's a narcissist, is low on empathy, highly controlling and is obsessed with weight. Like, obsessed. Spoiler alert: she thinks I'm enormous. I'm not, but I have gained weight this year and definitely don't have the same body that I did years ago or before having a baby. Being around her makes me feel really uncomfortable at this point. I really do not want to give in and drink. Last time I broke a stint of sobriety was when I was triggered by her. At her house. In close proximity to her handle of Ketel. 

To add insult to injury, MIL requests that we don't leave the house for non-essential things during her stay. She doesn't want me going to any stores or indoor venues. This REALLY sucks for me because exercise and meetings were the things helping me most. I'm feeling really fucking stuck here. My husband knows I've been sober but he's not really clued into how much it means to me. He hasn't had a drink in 7 years cause he's just one of those people who can quit turkey and never be tempted again. That hasn't been my story. 

Originally my husband suggested we get another place to say so that she can enjoy her home when she's here but she was super offended by that and basically wants us to stay here and be with her. I get the sentiment but she's not the easiest person to be around for extended periods of time. I could handle a weekend at most without losing it. My husband also becomes a bit of an asshole himself when he's around her for too long. I'm just really looking for support. I just learned of this last night and feel so stuck and so demoralized and frankly scared. I really don't want to drink again.

I'm in AA but haven't really been gung ho about it. I don't have a sponsor and I haven't  started working the steps. I only have a small bit of a support network there. Looking to bolster some of that here. If you read this far, I am extremely grateful. Just wondering if anyone has some insight or just some support.

From stroke, liver failure, heart disease, drowning in the bathtub, or in a prison from making some nightmarish decision while intoxicated. 

The other math:  I fucking love my first five drinks.  They are euphoric, they are fun, they are exciting.  On top of that, I'm exciting, funny, relaxed and generally the person I want to be in life.  This isn't some illusion, it's the unfortunate truth and it always leads me to wanting more to expand on these great points!

But after those first 5 drink it changes - I change.  I get argumentative, obnoxious, impatient, cynical, depressed.  And it always leads me to wanting more to try and loosen up and get back to fun loving and exciting.

After the next 5 drinks I get sloppy, I offend people, I forget what I'm saying and I say too much and make people uncomfortable.  I also tend to contact people from my past that I shouldn't and fuck up relationships. And it always leads me to wanting more because I'm irritated and depressed and want to cheer up.

After the next 5 drinks I forget entire portions of my evening, I throw up, I fall into things and break them, and generally destroying things I actually love.  At this point I cannot physically drink anymore.

The next morning I wake up and spend most of my living day rehydrating, processing what I did the last night, feeling waves of guilt and shame, somehow getting through a day of work probably stinking of alcohol.  I deal with intense anxiety, and basically rebuild myself from the bottom of a shallow grave.  Sometimes I can make it a few days without drinking, other times I start the cycle all over again that afternoon.

When I look at this 24 hour time period, from 1st drink of the day to 1st drink the next day - how much of this time do I actually enjoy?  The first 5 drinks.  After that, it's chasing after the first 5, and then it's just depression, then I can't even remember any of it, then it's self loathing and deprecation the next day.

So I enjoy maybe 2 out of 16 hours hours of this cycle?  I'm hanging onto this thing I've convinced myself I need for 12.5% actual enjoyment, and 87.5% despair? I'm no fool, anything else in my life with this type of ratio I would cut out and leave behind me without a second thought.

Tomorrow is day 14 of no drinking after 10 years of hell.  10 years a slave.  10 years where there wasn't a single day that didn't have some type of collision with alcohol, or having alcohol be the center point of my existence. I can't think about a month from now, a year from now.  All I know is I finally have control, I finally recognize myself, and I want to hold on so tightly to it I could cry.  I'm prepared to leave my career and corporate lifestyle in the dust to hold onto this precious thing that I can actually call MY life.  It hasn't been my life for so long and I have missed myself for so long.

I quit smoking weed a year and a half ago. Picked up drinking 6 months after quitting. Guess I never actually solved that problem of dealing with boredom. 

I'm not sure I can make it home without stopping at the liquor store on my way. I'm so exhausted. Arguing with myself is exhausting too. I want to be sober. But I don't want to be bored.

Update: I made it another night without alcohol. I took the advice of a reditor and treated myself to some sugar instead. Still wanted to go get a drink afterwards, so I went to bed and put on some tv as a distraction. 

I do feel good about not drinking. It still makes me sad that I won't be able to have that feeling again though. But I need to focus on what I gain from sobriety, not what I lose. 

Thank you for your support. It TRULY helped me.",12,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9934107661247253}"

It‚Äôs a little stressful even to do this much in terms of seeking support. I stopped drinking on October 6, 2020 after another night of vomiting and passing out in the hallway of my apartment. I‚Äôve flirted with taking time off or pumping the brakes for over ten years, but the reality is that I‚Äôve been heavily dependent on alcohol for that whole length of time. 

It‚Äôs been a combination of relief and struggle, which I knew to expect. What I didn‚Äôt expect was the constant flow of intrusive thoughts. Trying to talk myself into sneaking off for a quick one before my partner gets home, then having to talk myself out of that plan. Worried that I‚Äôve lost a large part of my identity because I spent so much time bartending and working on a brewery production line that a whole section of my knowledge is devoted to booze. Fearful that the anxiety I feel is permanent and was only stifled by drinking. 

I‚Äôm glad for the resources I‚Äôve already found in this community, like learning that my sudden sweet tooth was normal. I really want to stick with it and I‚Äôm hoping to check in here periodically for support and to reciprocate it so we can all get through it together. 

Yesterday I bought a used Orange guitar amp to reward myself for one month, and I‚Äôm already in love with its tone. Maybe I can love music again now that I‚Äôll be able to remember what I come up with. 

At the same time, I‚Äôm terrified that I‚Äôll slip again. Any words of wisdom would be appreciated.

This brought me back to all the times when they were beer bottles and she'd bring them downstairs and get mad at me over them, as I would stand there and tell her it's a weeks worth, meanwhile we both knew it was one night worth of bottles. 
This time despite the fact they were baby bottles, everytime they would cling against one another, I wanted to vomit, waiting to hear footsteps to come down the stairs. It didn't happen. It was worse torture than if she came down and flipped out over the baby bottles. My brain really didn't understand wtf was going on, bottle would cling, i would cringe, but nothing happened. 
I went into a flight mode, my day went to shit, but I'd didn't so anything wrong. This is the most out of pace feeling i have ever felt in my life.
It felt like I dropped a pencil out of my hand and instead of it hitting the floor it hit the ceiling. 
Almost at 60 days, feels good, but damn do this experience suck. I'm happy that they weren't beer bottles, they're my 2.5yr olds old bottles which my wife is getting ready for our son who is to come in February.

I (early 40s) have been a binge drinker my entire life. Not every day but, on average, every week I would have at least one binge session usually with friends/colleagues. My drinking life was/is summed up by a quote from John Spencer‚Äôs character Leo McGarry in The West Wing ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want one drink, I want 10 drinks‚Äù. I love being drunk, I even enjoy being hungover. 

Lockdown comes along and, by early May, my weekly binge was now daily. If I had one day off then I would feel all virtuous and give myself a pat on the back. This continued but was having a toll on my physical and mental health as well as straining the relationship between my wife and I. 

This was unsustainable and on the 12th of September I stopped drinking. I also started a regime of proper diet and exercise. I dropped 20 pounds, ran my first 10k in 3 years, my clothes fit again...all that good stuff.

Because I had seen such a positive and marked change, maintaining abstinence was easier than I thought it would be. I‚Äôd get the odd craving but at no point did I pause by the beer fridge at the local shop and have to talk myself out of it. All good right?

Last Friday we found out my wife is ill. Further tests this week showed that it‚Äôs serious.

Tonight was the first time since this news that I wanted to drink. I had to do some shopping for dinner and that would be my opportunity to buy beer. I tossed the idea back and forth in my mind and eventually decided I wouldn‚Äôt. 

I drove to the shop and walked past the fridge, then went back, opened the door, picked up a bottle of strong beer and put it in the basket. I turned to walk away but something stopped me. I opened the fridge, put the beer back and walked away. The relief flooded over me. Yes, it was just one beer but we all know it‚Äôs a slippery slope. 

I proved to myself that, in the face of the worst stress of my life, I can stand up to alcohol and choose.

I am the child of an alcoholic who passed away without amends. Denial and shame were two of the biggest hooks addiction had in me.

The therapist I recruited early on is still with me. He is an observer who has been with me long enough to call out connections and alert me when my blind spots are showing. I had two experiences recently that he helped me connect with my personal growth goals, and there are more that I didn't bring up but will spend time writing about this week in my journal.

First, I told more of my close family members about what I went through the last few years and the changes I've made. Their response was that they didn't know I had a problem, and that I had done nothing wrong in their eyes. I was grateful for the opportunity to share with them and for their support in general, and surprised that I felt no more relief after telling them than before.

Second, I had a conversation with my boss where he insisted I take some time off work to recharge. I had already done that a few weeks before and felt more stressed afterward so it seemed like there was no point. But we went through my responsibilities anyways one by one and he ""gave me permission"" to let go of those things for some time off.

In today's therapy session we talked about how these events show where I'm at in my recovery and growth. When I told my family, I did it for myself and it did not matter what their response was at that point. I'm grateful for their love and support, but only I know the details of how much progress I've made so other's perspectives are not my source of truth. With my boss, he was acting as a helpful critic. I am working on my inner critic with the goal of working together as a team rather than getting bogged down and bothered by the constant nagging and reminding that it has done in the past. My boss showed me what I can do to check myself against reality and make decisions based on facts rather than fears. This time off has felt like a real chance to recharge and the only difference is that I gave myself permission, because my boss gave me permission. The truth is I am the one in control of letting go, and I am learning how.

Nine months ago I walked into my first therapy session and said I needed some help establishing a toolkit I could use to stay sober. I said I had managed to stop for about 3 weeks so far but knew there was a long road ahead. In hindsight, I didn't need to keep all my troubles to myself prior to that initial meeting, that was a roadblock that I  made up in my mind. That's one thing that has stayed constant, my hardest day to day difficulties are ones that I construct. I'm making progress. It's like going to the gym, consistency is the most important part. Regularly scheduled therapy, even when I feel like nothing is happening in my life, does help.

Another thing we talked about is how I watched my mother struggle with alcoholism and one of the reasons was that she could not forgive herself for past actions related to addiction. She acted in a way that was opposite her values and did not dig herself out of that hole. I have forgiven her, however I am still acting like any day I might uncover something I did myself that is unforgiveable. It's taking a lot of energy to be on the lookout for the big surprise that's going to make me topple. Instead, I'm going to sit with these feelings and seek out a way to forgive myself for my past actions. It's the way forward, and a way to honor my mom.

This is my first post to this subreddit. The title speaks for itself. Just quit alcohol for the 6th time in my life, but this time it is the last. Which really scares me. The main reason I drink,the atleast 3-5 years, is it helps me cope with life. Life overwhelms me. I've never been ambitious, not very intelligent. Academia never interested me. However, I am feeling the urgency in doing better and realizing we only have one life so it is my duty and obligation to put in effort and be responsible and be the best version of myself. Pretty much - grow up and become a functional adult. Alcohol helped me escape some of these worries/responsibility. It works temporarily but eventually it catches up to you. I had a really bad heartbreak and my very uncle passed away from drinking, at age 54 all within 4 months. It seems a little insane but when you binge drink life is blurry like a cloud but something whether it's a heartbreak or some other trigger, wakes you up and you realize where you are in life. And for me to get my life together, I have to be sober. It's the truth. I'm on day 4. Responsibility/the real world scares me because I've never been that smart nor ambitious. Don't have many skills. This is my doing I don't want anyone to think I don't blame myself for where I am. I think accepting the fact that I can't drink ever again is the first step to a better life again.

Today my life got entirely uprooted. My girlfriend that I lived with dumped me last week, and for a minute there she was stringing me along making me feel like maybe we could rekindle things. 

This morning I woke up to her having sex with another man in the next bedroom. My head was throbbing from my hangover. She'd definitely been drinking the night before, heard her come home shortly after the bars closed with some people. I normally slept on the couch but last night I slept in the art studio that she has so I could have space, so she probably thought I wasn't home. I have always been very even tempered, patient, never raised my voice to her once. And I left the house, came back and flew off the handle. Yelled at the man in her bed. Took my clothes that were still in my dresser in the bedroom. She's acted like she's done nothing wrong and I'm away from her. 

And I don't want to drink this away. I got with this woman when I was getting piss drunk every night a few months after I broke up with my ex boyfriend. I created this life that was built by bars and substances and it has caused me nothing but pain. 

I don't want to wake up hungover ever again. I want to take my life back and build myself up and stop acting like a worthless burnout.

I'm closing in on a week with my in laws. It's been a hell of a week.

His dad had a fever for a few days. They got covid tests midweek, but now want to stay until those results come back (who knows when that will be?). 

In the meantime, because the fever lifted and they ""feel better now"" (but are still coughing!!), everyone is all over the house, touching everything, going to stores, ... I'm extremely introverted and can't even normally handle more than a few days of my own family staying with me, so I'm literally about to lose my mind. I'm also back at work (from home) and finding it incredibly hard to focus on work with the constant noise and interruption, plus the fact that I'm terrified of getting sick with COVID. I've got a sore chest and some congestion, hopefully it's nothing... will have to wait for the test results to cure this anxiety, I guess.

July: things seem to be getting better. Then relapse, lost the wife and then forced into a rehab again. Jump out of the car and get sent to the psych ward. Get out, loose the wife and the job. Go to rehab number 2! 


August: divorce is in full swing. House it being sold living at a sober house.

September: captain recovery, got a job again but resentful. 

October: pick up my 2 month chip.. look at me. This is beat, fuck all them im not an alcoholic.

Relapse: October 17-18  36 beers where had. The one guy I believe in and trust shows up right as beer is being delivered. I pour it down the drain and dive in to spirituality. 

Nov 4th divorce finalized. Im blocked on everything. Like I or she were never married.. hurts but a good hurt.

In the time since the relapse, I have quit smoking, started running at least 3 miles a day. Work out 5 times a weeks and do yoga first thing in the morning. I meditate for an hour before bed. Life isn't perfect. But life is suffering, accepting that things will be hard means you are growing and becoming so much more.",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9922728538513184}"

Much like today, my mental health was somewhere between ‚Äúwhy wasn‚Äôt I just born an amoeba‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want to fucking kill myself‚Äù. 

So there I was, walking through the trees off-trail like I normally do. Stewing away in my usual anger and self-loathing, frustrated that no matter what I do I can‚Äôt relax.

Can I please just have something that makes this shit bearable? How do people do this and stay *sane*? 

Looking up I see a foldout chair and a small cooler partially hidden amongst some trees. It was apparent that the chair has been there a while, maybe a few months. The cooler, fallen onto its side, had a thin layer of green, organic material crusted over it. Looks like someone forgot where they set up their drinking hideout. Now that the leaves have fallen it was easy to spot. Wow, I‚Äôm in the middle of nowhere, and I have no plans for the rest of the day.

*opens cooler* 

Staring at me are some empty Budweiser cans, but three full ones as well. But surely they have gone bad without refrigeration. That‚Äôs great, because otherwise I might be inclined to‚Äî

Sitting on the bottom of the cooler was a flask of Irish whiskey. Just nestled there like a little gold nugget, an innocent old friend. The answer to my problems. The cure to my unease. The erasure of my torment. 

I picked it up *swish swish*, opened it *crrack snapp*, smelled the contents. Whiskey! 

*shrugs shoulders* 

Behind me in a cooler, in the middle of the woods, lay a bottle of whiskey. 

*leaves crunching underfoot* 

A bottle of whiskey that will never have the pleasure of meeting my lips.

*sounds of twigs snapping under my boots* 

Sure I‚Äôm miserable, anxious, and feel stuck. But they are my emotions. I own them. And that is more valuable than I sometimes realize.

My newlywed wife is in the process of packing her stuff and moving out this week. Told me I need to seek treatment. I went to a consult at a rehab facility to see my options. Because my son is in virtual school and I work second shift I can‚Äôt physically come in for group therapy. They offered telehealth group meetings but each 3 hour session would cost me $30 co pay every time. The whole establishment there was pretty rude. I could go into more detail. I reached out to my psychologist at the VA who referred me to something called the start program. I will be going to my first appointment tomorrow morning to see what that‚Äôs all about. I relate more to veterans anyway and all my healthcare there is at no cost. My wife and I are wanting to do marriage counseling. We were getting prepared to buy our first house in May of next year so saving money for emergencies was essential. Now she‚Äôll be living in a house for $1250 a month and I pay $1100 a month in rent at the house we have shared for the past couple years. She says this whole process is necessary and she needs to have space. She‚Äôs taking our two dogs with her too. How does she not understand that leaving me alone makes it even harder for me? I‚Äôm a transplant in the city we live in. I have no friends or family here. Being in a quiet house is depressing as fuck. This is going to be really challenging. I‚Äôm so ashamed of the things I‚Äôve done and the guilt is overwhelming, yet my wife doesn‚Äôt hesitate to remind me at any opportunity that this is all my fault. I‚Äôve been downing a half a pint or more of everclear every night for over 5 years now. And although some of the most embarrassing moments of my life were due to alcohol, some of my best memories are while being drunk with friends and family. I can‚Äôt understand people who can just have a ‚Äúcouple of cold ones‚Äù or a wine with dinner. I‚Äôm envious of people like that. It‚Äôs just better I stay away from it for good. My psychologist kind of broke it down to me pretty good and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an avid runner and I may have a couple drinks on special occasions with my family throughout the year but I have a neighbor that I don‚Äôt know really well who asked if my wife and I wanted to come over and have some drinks. I don‚Äôt see the point of revolving an entire social interaction around the overconsumption of alcohol. It‚Äôs not appealing to me.

A couple of weeks ago I got a promotion at work, honestly I did not deserve it and the only reason I got it was because my boss hated me and it meant I was no longer his problem which I don't really mind. That plus the money I saved from stopping drinking meant I was able to move out and get my own flat which I love with my best friend who I love.
It did mean I had to go back home to my house that I ran away from 12ish weeks ago. I left because my parents were alcoholics and my mum had progressed to drinking in the mornings and getting so drunk and belligerent during the evenings that she'd just scream at me, she was so defensive about her drinking that it was impossible to reason with her and she kept telling me to leave if i didn't like it knowing I didn't have enough money or resources to actually go. I ran away anyway one day while her and my dad were at the pub. Literally in half an hour put random things in a suitcase and went to stay at my best friends family home. Their drinking was my bigget trigger and while I stuggled in the first few weeks of living with Scott(my friend)s family it was so worth it. 
I got my keys for my new flat yesterday and have started to move in but it meant I had to go back to my old home and get all the stuff I left behind. My mum was sick looking, all bloated and swollen. She had clearly been staying in my old room because her pain pills and vape fluid were on my bedside table and there were brand new sheets on my bed. So their marriage ha fallen apart. i Suspect she's lost her job as her work computer and equipment were dumped on the spare bed. Ontop of all that my dads uncle who he was close with died of covid yesterday.
I feel guilty because their lives seem to be falling apart, I know that it's not my fault and I had to run away as suddenly as I did but I know doing that hurt them. I'm so proud of myself for going from drinking half a litre of gin a day to cold turkey nothing and maintaining that for so long and I was really sickly towards the end so I can't imagine where I'd be if i didn't go.

Every time I indulge and have a 2 day hangover. 
Every time I deal with anxiety and regret for days after drinking. 
Every time I spend way too much money on craft beer and cocktails. 
Every time I feel like a failure because I said I was going to have 1 drink and had 8 and threw up. 

I‚Äôm a weekend alcoholic, let‚Äôs get that out in the open. Never typed that before and have still never said that out loud. I don‚Äôt drink every single day. But my weekends and any special days absolutely revolve around alcohol and I‚Äôve gotten away with it because we go to hip places and drink hip drinks. 

My story isn‚Äôt any different from anyone else‚Äôs. I‚Äôve attempted to stop drinking for short bursts. I actually joined this sub the day after Halloween (on my main, this is a shiny new throwaway bc I‚Äôm embarrassed) but today was the icing on the stupid cake. 

I haven‚Äôt actually drank since Halloween. We went to a small Halloween gathering. It was reduced in size due to covid but still too many people. Planned to not drink much, actually went back and forth about even going for a while. But decided fuck it, I miss my friends, let‚Äôs just go for 2 hours and go home. 

Queue 2am (3am before the time change). We‚Äôre still there and have taken drinks from community bottles. Lots of people using the same beer bong but luckily didn‚Äôt do that. Drove home when we shouldn‚Äôt. Hangover tomorrow. Guilt. Regret. Same old same old. Join r/stopdrinking and say ok I‚Äôll have a dry November. The end. 

THEN TODAY COMES and I wake up feeling like shit. Sore throat, fever, sore and achey. Ok, I‚Äôm just gonna stay quiet and stay home. Then my friend texts me that they have been feeling the same. Then I get a text that the host of the party has tested positive for covid. 

If I would not have wanted to go drink keg beer this wouldn‚Äôt have happened. I saw an elderly relative yesterday (luckily we were not in the same room, just the same house) and if they get sick because of me and my poor choices I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do. I was tested today and get results tomorrow or the next day. My friend who is feeling the same as me just tested positive. 

I do everything to escape my depression and anxiety except for the obvious thing staring me in the face. I‚Äôve tried numerous prescription antidepressants that don‚Äôt work out for one reason or another, it‚Äôs time to be serious because let‚Äôs be honest, I‚Äôm not serious about getting better if I‚Äôm not willing to change. 

I‚Äôm done drinking. I‚Äôm not making a plan to just take a break like I usually do. My plan now is to be completely done. This wasn‚Äôt the first time that the decision to drink had lead to bad things happening to me. But this could kill my last grandparent because I‚Äôm selfish and have bad judgement and low self control.

Please feel free to add others you find particularly useful.

This isn‚Äôt a list of charities, organisations or support groups. I think it‚Äôs relatively easy to find the phone numbers for various helplines relating to mental health should you need them. Instead, I wanted to list some of the resources I‚Äôve used to help me manage my mental health over this turbulent year and maintain good psychological hygiene.

There‚Äôs so many resources, worksheets, portals and websites about mental health online that it can be a bit overwhelming. I‚Äôve tried so many different resources over the last year and I still feel like I‚Äôve seen only a tiny fraction.

That said, here are some I feel are the easiest to use and most helpful. I‚Äôm a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that isn‚Äôt your preference. I also find the Calm app helpful but didn‚Äôt include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit.

Without further ado:

[Mood Self Assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/)\- This questionnaire is really good at gauging roughly where you‚Äôre at and then pointing you to helpful resources based on your answers.

[Catch it](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/csd/app-directory/catch-it/) \- A simple free mood tracker and diary app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. It doesn‚Äôt try to overcomplicate anything. Especially helpful for recording anxious thoughts.

[Cove](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cove-music-for-mental-health/id1020256581) \- Helps you express emotions through music. It‚Äôs like a music mood diary. Sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves. Still needs work but cool idea.

[Iona](http://get-iona.web.app/) \- App that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises. Much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use.

[Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) \- A great aggregator and portal of mental health resources. One of the most helpful features is it lets you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources.

[What‚Äôs Up](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whats-up-a-mental-health-app/id968251160) \- This is a good one stop shop if you‚Äôre looking for something to give you immediate relief. It certainly puts substance over style but provides clear and helpful information.

[Mind Shift](https://www.anxietycanada.com/resources/mindshift-cognitive%20behavioural%20therapy%20/) \- Free app based on cognitive behavioural therapy with user friendly design. Aimed at people looking to reduce symptoms of anxiety.",7,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.6818772554397583}"

Share your good, your bad, and your ugly (or your pretty, or your future, or your funny, or whatever else is on your mind) with us below!

-----------------------------------------
**SPECIAL 2K WUW‚ÄîNever forget!**

When I was a child, I would sometimes watch an adult acting in a certain way (like saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a stuffed animal! Why are you so upset that you lost it?‚Äù), and I would realize that even though that grown up had once been a kid themselves, they‚Äôd completely forgotten what being a child was truly like. I swore that I‚Äôd try, as I grew up, not to forget.

When I was drinking, I had the same feeling‚ÄîI would sometimes watch a person with long-term sobriety acting in a certain way (like laughing and saying, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be silly‚ÄîI don‚Äôt even *think* about drinking anymore‚Äù), and I‚Äôd realize that even though alcohol had once caused terrible problems in their life, they‚Äôd completely forgotten what being helplessly caught in the death grip of booze was truly like. And I swore that, if I ever got sober, I‚Äôd try not to forget.

And things got so incredibly bad with my drinking that it‚Äôs been easy for me to remember. To this day, when I read a post on SD where someone says (for example), ‚ÄúI have gone for three days without drinking,‚Äù often my first thought is, ‚ÄúI could never do that.‚Äù Because, when I was drinking, I truly couldn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt even go for half an hour without alcohol‚Äînot even when I had to attend a corporate meeting. (*That* ended badly, a fact that I am sure will come as a surprise to no one‚Äîalthough it somehow did to me.)

So now, even though I‚Äôm celebrating 2,000 days free from my terrifying addiction to alcohol, I don‚Äôt take any of my days for granted. I know that it‚Äôs important for me, as a sober person, to recall the misery, the secrecy, the helplessness, and the stained underpants (from when, at the end, I was unable to control even my own body).

Sobriety and the friends that I have made here at SD have been a completely unexpected joy that came to me later in life. I had no idea that this happiness was waiting for me. Two thousand days ago, a doctor who had done a sonogram on my liver told me that it had so many holes in it that it looked like Swiss cheese, and that I would probably be dead within the next few months‚Äîeven if I stopped drinking that very day. In that moment, I truly believed that my life was over. I had no idea that the very best was yet to come. 

Now, after nearly five and a half years without booze, my sobriety feels solid, which is an awesome feeling‚Äîbut that nice, secure feeling doesn‚Äôt fool me one bit. I am highly aware that even after 2,000 days, I am not immune to the call of alcohol‚Äînone of us are. Instead, I live by the saying, ‚ÄúNo matter how far down the road we are, we are all the same distance from the ditch.‚Äù I am grateful for each and every day that I am upright and walking‚Äîand not once again lying face-down in that muddy, garbage-filled ditch.

I'm over 6 months clear of drinking now, and I've been here numerous times before, but not much further. So maybe this is how I always fall down. I think it is.

I'm reluctantly single, split from the mother of my 7 year old boy around 21 months ago. I'd been with her nearly 20 years. She finally got sick of my lack of attention and drinking. The first was probably caused by the latter, let's be honest. I never thought we'd split, I thought we'd grow old together.

I'm living well now. I have my shit together. I'm still blowing more cash than I should on things, but I'm moving in the right direction. That's really the only thing I haven't optimized. I realize I blow cash on things because it makes me happy. I drank, because it makes me happy. I ride mountain bikes because it makes me happy. If I could ride mountain bikes all day I'd be fine. But my 45 year old body won't take it.

The thing is, I don't have anything else. I do these things for a neurotransmitter hit. I'm a Dad, I have a job, but my life is literally empty otherwise. I have this stark realization that at my age, people don't really get close anymore. Certainly not outside of romantic relationships. The are no new close friends. People walk away from relationships so easily, every kind of relationship. But that's just not me. I'm a classic introvert - not antisocial, but I don't do acquaintances. I'm close friends or not a friend. And I think this weirds people out, or scares them away.

It just doesn't all feel worth it anymore. I'm living this clean, organized life being a good boy and all I have for it is more unhappiness. Life is easy, yes, but OMFG it's just so much sameness. I can't see a light at the end of the tunnel.

I want to be able to have alcohol in the house without going overboard.,"Hi. Okay. Sorry for the length. If no one replies it's still just good to write my thoughts down!

I‚Äôm slightly different from what seems to be the norm here, in that I don‚Äôt get sloppy drunk every time I drink. I actually very very rarely get DRUNK drunk. My problem is that i drink every single day, 7 days a week, a few ounces every few hours, to keep up a ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù buzz. Before I started ‚Äúportioning‚Äù (more on that in a sec), I wasn‚Äôt really measuring how much I was drinking (I was taking swigs from the bottle almost exclusively). But I estimate around 20 oz of vodka per day or more - I was finishing a handle every 2 1/2 to 3 days. I‚Äôm a 115 pound woman.

My boyfriend is incredibly patient and supportive, and this was my idea: he got a padlock, and keeps my bottle in his backpack, locked up. For three months now, every day, he‚Äôll unlock it when I ask and he‚Äôll pour me a smallish portion a few times per day which is then my responsibility to dole out to myself how I see fit.

We started with 20 oz, and I was beginning to drink every day at around 10/11 AM. We got down to 15, and I wouldn‚Äôt drink till 1 or 2 PM. Etc, etc, until we got to where we are now.

I seem to have hit a plateau. I now have 10 oz per day, and I usually don‚Äôt ask him for my first pour until 4 or 5:00 PMish. 4 then, 4 more at 7 or 8:00, and 2 right before bed. This feels like progress, but I know it‚Äôs still something like 6 or 7 drinks per day. Honestly, I‚Äôm not ready to give up drinking entirely; I‚Äôve never been good at ‚Äúcold turkey‚Äù endeavors (I‚Äôd like to get down to 2 or 3 drinks per day, and then consider taking longer periods of time off).

But anyway. He‚Äôs been away on a trip for three days. We decided he‚Äôd pour me 30 oz, and we‚Äôd mark on the bottle every 10 oz so I wouldn‚Äôt accidentally go over. I went over on the very first day. Had 15, plus a glass of wine.

Again, I‚Äôm not quite ready to consider quitting altogether. But this is about the 50th time that I‚Äôve proved to myself that if I have free and complete control over a bottle of liquor, I will make any justification to drink indiscriminately.

I‚Äôd like suggestions of how to make it less‚Ä¶ easy‚Ä¶ to pour myself a drink. The backpack lock thing, while helping, is obviously not sustainable long-term. I‚Äôve thought of keeping it on top of tall cabinets, putting it out in the backyard, switching to wine or beer, I don‚Äôt know. A timed safe would be nice, lol. I know this is a departure from most of you guys who seem to want to 100% quit. But does anyone have any ideas of how to make the liquor bottle inconvenient enough to access that I won‚Äôt grab it for a random swig any time I‚Äôm unattended?

I had to learn new skills, develop new ways to manage myself, and [fill up my tool chest](https://imgur.com/gpzfzBH).

There are many of us who are not doing well right now. There is massive stress and uncertainty at the global, national, and personal levels. I am not OK. You may not be OK.

But that is OK.

Part of not drinking is learning to cope with the uncomfortable feelings. There are lots of tools to use--glance through the posts on SD and you'll see many examples. That you've read this far is proof you're using a tool, whether it's distraction or engagement. 

So be uncomfortable. 

Be upset. 

Be proactive in coping with your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

2020-11-03 17:37:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jnklar/sharing_my_ride/,Sharing my ride,"It has been almost 3 years since I decided that I really really needed to stop drinking. I had been thinking, for probably a couple of years prior, that things were getting out of control. I was what I suppose you would call ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù in my daily life. I am a single parent and I work full time. I never missed a day of work. I doubt my family would have told you that I had a problem with alcohol. They knew that I liked my ‚Äúwine‚Äù but they had very little idea of the hiding and subterfuge that I undertook to keep them in the quasi-dark. I was drinking two bottles of wine each night. Just about every night. I would buy the crappy boxed wine and decant it into a wine bottle. In this way I could keep track of not exceeding my two bottle maximum (okay ‚Äì sometimes I MIGHT have exceeded it) and also ‚Äì I would make sure that the bottle in the fridge ‚Äì at the end of the night ‚Äì was half full so that anyone opening the fridge would think ‚Äúmmm I guess she had a couple of glasses‚Äù. Also boxes can be broken down and the plastic liner squirrelled away under garbage. No clinking bottles (or only a couple just to keep it real) in the recycle bin. 

You would think that just those steps alone would be enough to make me face up to the fact that I had a real problem. But no‚Ä¶ I also went to great lengths to hide the effect the alcohol had on me. I knew that with anything less than a bottle no one could really detect my inebriation but more than that would put me at risk of detection. I would start to speak too slowly and also, horrors, I might not remember a conversation the next day. What a terrible, awful, horrible feeling when I would all innocently ask ‚Äúdid you get your homework done‚Äù only to be told ‚ÄúMum ‚Äì I told you that last night!‚Äù And so I learned that if, by chance, a family member interacted with me while I was in that state, I could scribble down the topic of our conversation so that the next morning I would at least have a vague idea that I had spoken to someone and what the general topic had been. Of course it didn‚Äôt always work. Sometimes I couldn‚Äôt read the scribble. Sometimes I forgot to write it down. So I became mute on any subject other than the moment at hand. I could say ‚Äúdo you want juice‚Äù with authority because what are the chances that I had asked that the night before? I could do the present tense ‚ÄúYou look nice‚Äù... because ‚Äì well same reason. You get it. It was all so fraught! I would wake up each morning feeling really crappy, headachy, gross mouth and for the first few minutes of the day I would do inventory. Did I make it to bed properly (turn out all the lights etc. - forget brushing teeth ‚Äì that was so far down the list of priorities). Did anyone talk to me? Did the kids get home safely? (teenagers at this point). What a shitty parent I felt like. I knew that what I was doing put all of our safety in jeopardy. What if there was an emergency in the night? First of all I would be found out to be blind drunk and secondly I would not be able to step in and parent. By some miracle this particular scenario never caught up to me but it so easily could have ‚Äì it was only a matter of time. 

It was all such a nightmare. But I couldn‚Äôt find a way to stop drinking. Oh I would try. On a Sunday night I would say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it - No drinking this coming week‚Äù. And for the first couple of days I would manage it. I would even start to feel marginally physically better by Tuesday or Wednesday. That dull throb in the general area of my liver would dim. My head would feel more clear. The worry would dissipate somewhat. But then, on Wednesday ‚Äì or maybe Thursday if I was Superwoman ‚Äì I would find myself standing in the wine shop stocking up on bottles and boxes. I would think to myself ‚Äúoh the store people will just think I am having a party‚Äù. Ha ‚Äì ya ‚Äì party for one. And then somehow I would be right back siphoning boxed wine into bottles and scribbling down conversations‚Ä¶ 

I should mention ‚Äì along with the low priority teeth brushing and the dull ache in my side - I was getting progressively less healthy in many ways. My nutrition was suffering as I wasn‚Äôt terribly hungry and when I did eat it was mostly carbs and fats ‚Äì foods to soothe a damaged body and mind. My skin was parched and I had areas on my shins that were red and flaky (psoriasis it turned out). And I was fat. Not just a bit fat but really really fat. Being fat was so depressing it made me want to drink wine and eat chips. And so I did. 

Somewhere amidst all this murk I recognized that it was literally ‚Äúdo or die‚Äù. Honestly ‚Äì I mean totally honestly ‚Äì the only part about ‚Äúdie‚Äù that was unacceptable was ‚Äì of course ‚Äì my kids. Other than them my life seemed empty and sad and not much of a life at all. And the thought of not having what seemed like the only thing that helped me get by - wine ‚Äì made it seem emptier still. But I knew ‚Äì deep down and for real, that the option to completely check out was not one I could foist upon my children. 

And so, after some deep soul searching I set a date. It was a definitive date. It was a non-negotiable pact with myself. The date was 6 weeks hence - plenty of time to get used to the idea of no longer having my nightly escape. Lots of time to adjust mentally. And of course, lots of time to drink all the wine. And that I did. I know for a fact that in those 6 weeks I turned a blind eye to my two bottle limit. I even bought the more expensive wine that I loved because if I was going to lose it all ‚Äì damnit I was going to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù my last hurrah. 

And so D day arrived. I felt rotten by then. My liver hurt most days. My sleep was terrible and my digestion was messed up. I am sure I was less than useful at work and I don‚Äôt doubt that there must have been days that co-workers noticed my rheumy eyes and bedraggled demeanour. But somehow, in those weeks leading up to it my MIND had shifted subtly. I told myself over and over ‚Äì that this was a non-negotiable pact. No wiggle room. Non-fucking-negotiable. And somehow ‚Äì eliminating all the potential for weaseling my way out, by say ‚Äì Wednesday ‚Äì or next week ‚Äì or next month ‚Äì seemed to do the trick. 

I remember the first week, every single night on my way home from work I would want ‚Äì oh so desperately ‚Äì to turn left into the liquor store parking lot. But I would remind myself that the option to turn left was not on the table. Hard no. Just keep on going. And so the days turned into a week ‚Äì A WEEK! And when I hit eight days I realized that was probably the longest I had gone in years without drinking. When I got to 2 weeks I was on a roll and by one month I had found this sub and I felt I was part of a group ‚Äì no longer battling alone. 30 days is a pretty awesome milestone. And then 60 and man oh man 90! At about this time I literally and figuratively turned a corner. I was on my way to work and had just driven around the corner at the end of my block and the sun was low and bright in the sky and the ocean was calm and flat and I thought ‚Äúman I feel great!‚Äù. I mean - really great. And then I had to pull over because I was crying. I cannot tell you what it felt like to realize that I FELT GREAT! I realized then that I had been low grade hung over for probably a decade. Everything had been murky ‚Äì my thoughts ‚Äì my relationships ‚Äì my fat squishy body. But here I was ‚Äì clear-headed, clear eyed and with clear thoughts. Honestly ‚Äì it was a huge moment for me. 

The battle to stop drinking is a tough one. It is waged on many fronts and in the earlier days it is fought every hour of each day. It was really hard work to get to one day, then one week. Getting to 3 months was an uphill slog. It was just so all encompassing and difficult. I had to talk myself out of giving up on an hourly, and later, daily, basis. I could not fathom that there would ever be a time when I wouldn‚Äôt obsess for hours a day about having some wine. I embraced the terminology I learned on this sub‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWine Witch‚Äù and ‚ÄúBooze Goblin‚Äù. I absolutely loved IWNDWYT ‚Äì I mean writing that acronym had POWER! I read avidly all the wisdom of those with ten years and those with ten hours. I remember one post in particular that really affected me. I wish so much that I knew who wrote it. It was someone who had about 2 months without drinking and they had woken up early on a winter morning and had put a log on the woodstove fire and made coffee and then they sat in the quiet time before their young kids woke up. Whoever it was, was just so damn appreciative of the serenity that their new found sobriety had brought to them, and that idea, that image, carried me through a lot of days. 

So here I am. Verging on three years. And my life now is exactly the same and profoundly different from what it was some 1,000 days ago. I am 100 pounds lighter ‚Äì no not just from stopping drinking ‚Äì but from taking care of myself and eating well and having the time and inclination to exercise. I feel happy at some point each and everyday. My skin looks about 10 years younger and the psoriasis that I had on my shins is completely banished. I never even knew that drinking caused it! I sleep well at night and I wake up in the morning with no trying to piece together the night before. I have (well I don‚Äôt actually have it) $20,000 that would have been guzzled away. I am a better parent, a better friend, and a better employee.

Those around me know I no longer drink but they have absolutely no idea as to how bad it was, and how difficult it was to get to where I am today. Aside from all the health wins, and relationship wins, one really significant win for me is that I no longer think about drinking. I no longer miss it. This is such a HUGE thing to me and it is what I wanted to share. The idea of never feeling that ‚Äúneed‚Äù is the most freeing and empowering change that has happened. It is truly life changing. I know it is different for each person, but for me the idea that I would always feel like I was denying myself that drink, may have been what kept me drinking for many years. And I am not really sure when I turned that particular corner. Long after 90 days. Probably closer to 2 years. But I can categorically say that the Wine Witch ‚Äì that Wine Bitch - has no hold on me whatsoever anymore. And that however long it took to be released from her clutches, seems like just a blip in time from this side of the chasm.",17,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993124008178711}"

It was a *stash* because my kids will drink all the Spindrift they can find in a matter of hours if left unchecked. I had a bad day not too long after stopping drinking (which was itself a bad day) and about four cans in, I realized I was drinking Spindrift like I'd drink beer. It must have been a subtle realization because I did keep going and I think I finished off six or more cans at a rate that in hindsight was shocking. As I was getting ready to go to bed, I reflected on the fact that drinking like this isn't healthy for me. Not so much Spindrift, but alcohol. It was almost like my drinking was a reflexive response to stress or other unwanted feelings. Swapping cans just illustrated to me how much of a habit/compulsion it was/is. So the title... No, I didn't get a hangover from Spindrift, which was wonderful and refreshing. I did however go to bed with a pretty bad stomach ache, which, oh well. At least I wasn't sick, snoring, unable to sleep, and grossly hungover the next day. 

Also, binging Spindrift (or Le Croix, Bubly, AHA, whatever the store brand is, and even that fancy Perrier, or my favorite, Gerolsteiner) is relatively affordable compared to even bottom shelf liquor.

Since I quit I've been thinking a lot about my drinking pattern. I started as a teenager to overcome debilitating shyness and low self-esteem, continued throughout college and early 20s, but then pretty much stopped when I had kids. It's hard to take care of children and be there for them if you're drunk/hung over. I didn't drink when my husband died at 38, leaving me with a toddler and a baby to raise alone. I started again when I started dating, and it continued for about 3 years, then I stopped completely from 2000-2006. I mean I didn't touch a drop except maybe a sip of champagne on New Year's. In 2006 I met my husband, and since he drinks, I started drinking again. Not to blame him, he wasn't twisting my arm, it was just something I naturally fell into again. So, 14 years of drinking, and now I've stopped again.

Here's what I've figured out. I know I can stop drinking when I want to without much difficulty. I've done it several times in my adult life. The problem is, when I do drink, I drink too much and too often. It's NEVER just one glass of wine, typically it's 3 glasses a night, more on the weekend.  I don't sleep well, and I feel like s\*\*t the next day. So, why do it? I've gone 17 days and now I look forward to my cup of herbal tea at night, knowing I'm going to sleep well. Geez, does that make me sound like a little old lady?

The desire seems to be going away more all the time. I hope it continues. I'm 60, and I don't want to be the grandma with the ever-present glass of wine.

So fast forward. I'm homeless  checking my account balance to see what type of food I can afford to  eat. I knew it should be around $7. I was thinking which exit which stop  of the bus I'm going to get off of so I can afford the best quality  food for under $7. I check my account balance and I start crying on the  bus . Obama signed an executive order that sped up the process to file  VA claims much faster. my account balance read it actually would have  been negative it actually would have been negative I would not have been  able to eat because of a bank fee. My account balance read $16,000 and I  did not know what to do so I just cried. I immediately realized I was  going to spend all of this money giving it back to the people that I  owed it to unless I did something fast. I was already working with  someone from ssvf. It is supportive services for veteran families. It is  a company so this I don't actually know it's a c\*\*\* but I think it's a  company it's not a company it's a program that was founded because of  Obama and all of this extra love he was showing the VA to take care of  his people. I was in this program ssvf they were already trying to  assist me in finding housing because I was homeless. I had such a hard  time using the program like I'm sitting there just trying to get  approved for an apartment I've realized the only place like the only I  realized the only place I could have actually afforded would have been  in a dangerous part of town right. It would have I would have put myself  in danger to try to get whole again. I didn't do it I didn't use the  program and they kind of have a time limit so it's like if you don't use  it then they have to be like well call us back. So nothing they did was  wrong they immediately they immediately listened to me they came and  picked me up my God I know I just text but I'm crying again. Yes I don't  remember anyone's name but it was the ssvf program in Long Beach  California. Get back on my feet but not really oh yes yes and then so  Isaac another veteran listened to me period I was in dance a dance class  and it's him and I and I can tell where the oldest people in there. we  look at each other and they're just we just know that we're both  veterans and that that man saved my life. you give me a place to stay  even though because I could not because La is such a hard city to live  in I had all this money in my account and still was not getting approved  for an apartment in a place where I felt safe.

So that was a week ago and everything came together just fine.  Worked a bunch of 14h days to get all my shit done, and after a big presentation Monday and launch this morning things should be calm for the next little while (excepting the guaranteed critical issues that'll pop up over the next few days I guess haha).

Taking the rest of the day off (though work cell is definitely on) to relax, and can't help but think how different this week might have gone.  Looking forward to a lazy afternoon and I guess watching the drama that is the U.S. election tonight (from afar fortunately).

Read a few posts about people having ""successful"" planned relapses where they moderate on this board recently, and the fact that they hate it because they are 100% focused on how much they are drinking, don't even enjoy getting a bit tipsy, and are risking a binge.  This rings true in my experience from years ago, except I eventually stopped focusing on how much I was drinking (knowing I didn't even want to finish one), and it didn't feel like I was really risking a binge (at least around other people).

This last week has shown me though that knowing your triggers and having tricks to deal with urges is important no matter how long you've been clean.

My heart goes out to people who drink because they are bored, or because they are in a social situation with drinking, or any other reason where it isn't feasible to just remove the trigger.  All I had to do was ensure my life was as free of lonely stressed out situations as possible which is something everyone already wants which is easy by comparison.

I am a 29m and have been drinking pretty heavily for about 8 years now. 9 months ago my son was born, and while I love every minute of being a father, the added stress of parenting has pushed me to drink even more. A typical week for me is normally a fifth of Jack and 12 or so ipa's. But I can finish the jack in 3 nights pretty easily. Going to work with a slight headache has became a norm, but has not affected my productivity at work. At this point alcohol is not ruining my life or affecting my marriage (although my wife agrees I drink too much) but I know I am drinking too much, and I know I am consuming way too many calories from alcohol. Over the weekend my neighborhood we recently moved to held a Halloween block party. Drinks were flowing and next thing I know I wake up on my couch at 5am with a pounding headache and no recollection of what happened the night before. I don't black out often but when I do my anxiety goes nuts. I can't help but imagine what stupid things I said or did and I get overtaken with sheer embarrassment. I have ""taken breaks"" from drinking before but it normally does not last long and I end up drinking more than I did before after my ""break''. I don't think I can drink moderately, I think I'm all in or nothing.
This is my first time posting in this sub and I guess I'm just looking for a little input from everyone.

Working at home and not being in social settings have helped that. I've never felt like I had a problem but there are a few instances over the years where I was blasted... definitely not proud of those times.

I used to work 2nd shift so it was bourbon and video games all night. I then met a drinker girlfriend and nothing was off-limits. Wine, bourbon, cocktails, beer, whatever. She was a much heavier drinker than I was and it turned me off big time. I finally ended that relationship.

I moved to craft beer for a while. One day at the beginning of the year, I went back and checked my beer budget for the past 4 years(see below).

After seeing how much I spent over the years, it messed with me. I love money more than booze. I'm also 35 and in great health. I started to feel like every sip was a detriment to any kind of healthy living potential in the future.

With that being said... football season was the first challenge. Luckily my team is doing great this year but some Sundays are tough. And now this election cycle/and this day. 

I hope I can keep up this streak and be over it. I don't want to ever need it or have a bad day at work and need a drink or any number of things that could happen in life. I don't need a drink for those things.

Walk downtown, enjoy the scenes and have a nice day instead of the usual trap of walk to to gas station and back home cycle

 Not be in or fear withdrawals

 Achieve adult daily tasks with moderate ease that I completely neglected (mental health aside, of course)

Go out and vote today!!

Socialize and hang out/video chat with friends

When I was gone I went to the ER to get hydrated because i thought the stress would send me over the edge into withdrawl. I am back at home now and am making a serious life change of NO DRINKING and we are working on things but the anxiety is killing me. When I was at the ER they took bloods and some levels were slightly elevated having to do with liver and kidney. Now granted I was on a bender for about 4 days prior so my mind is saying of course labs were weird. I had perfect labs in April. It's killing me because I am googling and thinking i am too late and have damaged my whole life. I'm only 34 and no realize I don't need alcohol to have a life. I am so scared my health is down the drain. Anyone else experience this? Please I'm losing my mind!!!

It was beyond anything I've ever experienced - the mental anguish, physical pain and overall shittiness of the situation surpassed even the most vicious of sicknesses I've ever encountered.

I've never been the ""just has one and fast forward to blacking out"" typed of alcoholic.  I'm more of a slow burn kind of drinker.  The kind of alcoholic where I can justify it by telling myself (and sometimes others) that I don't get blacked out - I just drink lots of alcohol over an extended period of time.  Daily.  Not as bad, right?!

I'm 29, and work at a stressful, high stakes sales job.  I've always liked beer, but over quarantine my consumption has skyrocketed.  During the week, its 3-6 white claws per night supplemented by a few nips from the bottle.  On the weekend its developed into an all day situation where I just lose control of how much I've drank.  This past weekend, I hammered the juice starting Friday night and pretty much not stopping until Sunday night.  I went to bed at 7pm because my body just couldn't handle it anymore.  I woke up Monday morning and felt so bad I had to call into work.  Thats where I decided enough was enough.

I call this Day 1 because I had a white claw yesterday morning to try to ease the pain.  The decision was made yesterday, but today is the true start of the journey.  I'm going to try to stay dry in November and then see where it goes from there.  I'm kind of excited honestly - I've known this was coming for a long time and I know it's necessary to repair my body, my marriage, my friendships and above all else - my mind.

I have given up before in my twenties for 6 months, when I was 36 and my partner threatened to leave me if I didn't do anything about my excessive drinking,    There is no doubt that my drinking is better than it was when I was younger and my partner never complains.   But Covid has increased my drinking and I just don't really want it in my life anymore.   Except when I do want it in my life.   And that's the problem.  I can go two or three days without drinking but then I'l drink again and I love the buzz and just want it to continue - which occurs when I pass out on the sofa at 2am.  Usually after a binge feast of food that I can't even remember eating.   It just feels like same shit different day and I am quite sick of it.    I am a high functioning individual with a job, career and 20 year relationship that I can be, and am, proud to have created.  But I feel like alcohol isn't adding much to my life any more other than another ""good night"" of which I have had hundreds and they aren't that amazing tbh.     And while I am a happy drunk, I also get fairly boisterous and loud.    Why keep it in my life?    But I am scared to not drink, scared of how I will feel going out for dinners etc, just scared.    I am also someone that looks to western medicine to help me with most things.   If there is a (prescription) pill I can take I will take it (not opoids or anything like that) but antidepressants, clonazapam etc.    My doctor prescribed me  Naltrexone but that didn't help with my non drinking - in some ways in made me worse.   I could drink and drink and not get drunk so instead of passing out at 2am, I could just stay up until 4am.     Today, I have just taken a dirst tablet of disulfiram / antabuse.    I am scared because I do understand that this means NO drinking at all.   It seems very final and scary especially because this ""friend"" of mine, booze has been around me so much.

Today ....a day I'm feeling sorta bummed out ....would probably be the day I would pick up a few IPAs to drink with dinner if I hadn't made a commitment to myself to not drink. Three maybe four.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi again! Over the past couple of days, I've been reflecting on some of the things that led me to get sober and I'm feeling especially grateful that I'm sober today. I used to have *so much* anxiety because of the alcohol and things I did while I was drinking. It's weird because drinking was how I dealt with social anxiety for a long time. I drank to feel more comfortable and confident around other people, but the feelings of shame and anxiety that usually followed a night of drinking were so much worse than that temporary sense of confidence and social ease. 

I thought I'd list a few of the things I used to do when I was drinking that caused me anxiety/shame the next day as a reminder of how bad it was. Some things I used to do while drinking include... 

-Falling down in a bar or at a party and then not being able to get back up without help. This happened to me a lot!

-Flirting with someone I had no interest in. (I am happily married, but apparently I forget that when I'm drunk.) ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

-Posting stupid statuses and selfies on social media. Ugh. üôÑ

-Revealing too much about myself to an acquaintance. I have told people I just met things that even my sisters don't know about me. 

-Texting or messaging people I never usually talk to, like old friends from high school. I'd always read the conversation the next day, and just hoped I didn't say anything too weird! üò¨ 

But it's all good because as long as I don't drink today, I don't have to worry about these things! I love waking up without anxiety and shame. I can put my energy into things that really matter to me instead, like my son and schoolwork. 

What's something that you don't have to worry about by not drinking today? What does that free you to do instead?

Thanks for reading! I'm glad you're here and I will not drink with you today! üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è",151,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9735497236251831}"

I just finished journaling about it, and I felt like I needed to reach out for some support as well. This last week I've let my recovery go by the wayside a little bit. I haven't been journaling, writing my goals or gratitude lists. I haven't been to any meetings, and my sponsor is so busy all the time I'm considering getting a new one. I made the decision to move into my mom's with my kids because my significant other doesn't really help me with the kids and he still drinks regularly. I'm feeling resentful towards him, because it seems like now I've just taken all the responsibility he was ignoring anyways elsewhere and now he just has all the freedom in the world to do whatever he wants.

I spent this evening at a work event (socially distanced and observing all COVID protocols/regulations) where everyone around me was drinking....a lot. They all seemed to be having a good time, and no one got out of control. I had a good time too but it was weird to be there. I kept thinking about the old me, and how back when I was drinking I probably would've drank too much and said something stupid. Or even if I didn't say something stupid, I would've kept drinking once I got home or ate junk that I really didn't need to eat. 

I wish I could say that after 2 years without a drink, I'm completely secure and comfortable in these types of situations, but I'm not. I sometimes still wish I could drink normally or moderate, but I know that's not possible. I hope one day to be comfortable and not spend a week before a big social event thinking about how I'll manage not drinking, or what excuse I'll give for not drinking if I'm questioned. Luckily tonight I wasn't even asked about it and no one seemed to care, but I have a feeling it'll always be at the back of my mind.

For whatever reason, I hoped sobriety would be some sort of panacea for all of my problems. But obviously that hasn't been the case. I still struggle with depression and anxiety. I still have issues in my personal life and relationships. I still feel completely unsure about what I'm doing with my life and whether I'm living it well. But at least I don't have to worry about hangovers or liver disease or drunk texts or choosing between eating a meal or having enough money to drink. Life is tough, but its infinitely tougher when I'm drinking. I have to keep reminding myself of that because I know that each day poses a threat that I could slip up or give in to the myth of moderation.

For now though, I'm going to enjoy this small victory and keep taking it one day at a time. It's gotten me this far. And so have you all.

I was furloughed from my job, in April, and decided to go to my childhood home in another state to pass the time with my parents and sister. My parents were always big drinkers, and when working from the office was still a thing had been picking up fifths of Smirnoff red on my commute home everyday and never had a sober night. 

By the time I went home, we in the Northeast were a few weeks into pandemic. I‚Äôd been working from my apartment. I lived alone, in a city, with a liquor store conveniently less than a block away. Before shit was locked down I‚Äôd switch up which stores I went to so the same clerk didn‚Äôt see me everyday, but he and I talked a lot those weeks, he was one of the few people I talked to in person. 

At home with my family, old dynamics and a newish global pandemic and my worries over my job security set the stage (or at least that‚Äôs what I told myself) for a drunkenly bad night. I don‚Äôt remember the details of the fight, but I know I stirred the shit. I also remember feeling like no matter how much I drank I didn‚Äôt seem to get any more obliterated. That probably pissed me off, judging by my hangover and anxiety the next day. 

Still hungover in bed I set a goal of 100 days. That date came and went, so I decided I‚Äôd stick it out for another 100, and that brings me to today. Since quitting I moved to a whole new city for a new and better job and never waking up hungover. Here‚Äôs the part where I say nothing‚Äôs perfect and it really, really isn‚Äôt, but I don‚Äôt at all miss waking up feeling ashamed of the harmful stuff I did while drunk. IWNDWYT

I was thinking about this thread last week and how I haven't read or mentioned anything explicitly related to sobriety in quite a while now. As such, I decided to seek out something about how people who are abstaining from alcohol can cope with the holidays since they are right around the corner now and that time of the year can be the absolutely most triggering for so many of us. I found *The Unpickled Holiday Survival Guide* by Jean McCarthy. This author is not someone I'd ever heard of though apparently she's a pretty big deal in the realm of sobriety podcasts and blogs. 

I haven't gotten very far into yet but have already learned a new term from this book: patchwork recovery. Read the definition and thought ""hey! That's what I did and am still doing!""

I know that one reason I was drinking was to tap into my goofy, lighthearted self, which feels a million miles away, with Covid and the state of my country. I miss it so much.

So, I tried to act ""as if"" the other night; put on a fancy hat when hanging around the house, which was all the silly I could muster. I felt nothing. But my hope is that if I just keep doing some of silly-happy behaviors, I'll actually start to feel it at some point.

Six months ago I committed the most shameful act of my entire life.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary to go into details here, but my actions resulted in spending my son‚Äôs birthday weekend in county prison.  I thought I had lost everything; my family, my career, my friends and my self respect were gone.  I spent 10 hours walking home from prison in pajama pants and orange prison slippers because no one was there for me when I was released.

When I got home I wasn‚Äôt welcome.  There was a bag packed for me on the porch and a locked front door.  My dad was there.  He told me I could stay at his house temporarily, that he hadn‚Äôt had a chance to get rid of all the alcohol in the house, and that if I chose to try and drink anything there our relationship would be over and I would be on the street.

For the first time in a long time, I prayed before falling asleep.  I prayed for guidance, for something to hang on to and help me find a way out of the spiral of self-destruction I had created.

Over the next three weeks I suffered through withdrawal, found an outpatient program, located a sober living house with a bed open and discovered this group.  I was able to salvage my job with the understanding that I was on the thinnest of ice.

I have tried getting sober before.  I never committed to a program, changed my behaviors or tried to build a support group.  Through the sober living house I met a group of people from all walks of life, gathered in one spot with the single shared purpose of staying sober.  I started going to meetings.  I started praying in the morning and before bed every night.  I found a sponsor who was willing to take a chance on me.

Today, I celebrate six months of sobriety.  I was able to celebrate it with sober friends met through AA.  This weekend I was able to go trick or treating with my wife and kids, and I actually enjoyed it.  My wife is speaking to me.  My family is beginning to talk to me again.

I just wanted to say how truly grateful I am to be where I am today.  Being sober today gives me the chance to be sober tomorrow, and continue to discover the person I was meant to be.

I was feeling the same thing I did last time I gave up after getting a significant amount of time without drinking, that is my life is way too boring and unfulfilling to not drink. On a positive note though there was less self-loathing this time around. Last night's drinking felt like I was back to where I was before I quit last time, that it was absolutely pointless, it did nothing for me. Giving into the urge to drink doesn't even make it go away. I can't drink today because of work so the timing is good to restart (although my weekend begins again tomorrow).

I wrote on a whiteboard why I was giving in though and for some reason started brainstorming the obstacles I'm dealing with. This morning I put them into a google doc to try to come up with ideas on how to deal with each of them, then I had this funny kind of epiphany, all these obstacles are basically just symptoms of depression. This was the list - 

* Difficulties in concentrating
* Feeling tired, unmotivated, lazy, procrastinating too much
* Not really wanting to leave the house let alone get off my couch
* Feeling of inferiority, lack of self-compassion, poor body image
* Everything feeling a bit pointless, empty, way too cynical
* Feeling overwhelmed by everything
* Feeling unsettled and insecure
* My age, feeling too stuck in my ways and just coming to terms with it, also feeling less optimistic, like life has passed me by
* Getting lost in fantasises of escape

My anxiety has reduced a lot with me not drinking, but it kind of feels like with that the depression is bubbling up more.

So I'm re-committing to not drinking with the knowledge of I need to deal with this depression. Not drinking isn't a fix all solution.

When I asked him if we could lock up the liquor he said no because he wasn't an alcoholic so he wanted access to the alcohol (I now know that he is likely also an alcoholic). I wasn't drinking every day, but I was definitely binging about 3 times a week, and always with my husband who was usually drinking to the point of passing out. I only drank on those days where it wouldn't interfere with my ""adult"" life including my job and other obligations. 

Well, almost three years ago I left the ex which is when my drinking really amped up. At this point, I started drinking much earlier in the day. I was drinking on my days off pretty much to the exclusion of anything. I convinced myself it was okay because I was still able to go to my job sober, and I made sure to never drive when I had been drinking. If I wanted to sit in my apartment and drink who was I hurting. Around this time I was diagnosed with C-PTSD resulting from my relationship with my ex who was abusive. To me, this just reinforced my decision to drink. I had been through hell and if I wanted to cope with what I was feeling by drinking, I didn't see anything wrong with that. 

After about a year of basically trying to numb everything, I came across a little subreddit called r/stopdrinking. When I read the stories here it was like I was being seen. I had asked myself if I could be an alcoholic around two years earlier and now I had my answer. My relationship with alcohol was not normal and it was a problem especially because I had gotten to a point where I didn't want it anymore, but every time I tried to quit, my brain would come up with some excuse why I should drink. 

I have had little successes over the past year and a half. At one point I was at 42 days. I don't even remember how I broke that streak. I guess I convinced myself that I had gone 42 days and I was probably okay to drink now. Of course, that isn't how it works. So I've had a week here, two weeks there. I read stop drinking every day and glean little sayings that I repeat to myself to help stay sober. I guess this time is different because this time I want to contribute. I want to tell my story and support others going through the same. 

So today is day 19 and today the urge to drink was strong. There is a lot of anxiety in my life right now due to several current events as well as a current medical issue. I had even looked up a bar near me to see what craft brews they had on tap. It would be okay to drink if I just went in and had one, right?! And then I thought to myself about a story I had read a few weeks back on stop drinking about how alcoholics trying to quit end up going through the worst days over and over. I decided that I didn't want to go through another day 1. Days 1-4 are the hardest for me because I rationalize to myself that I'm not that far into my journey. I could just decide to become sober next week. 

Well, not this time. This time I stopped at the grocery store and bought ice cream instead. I may even eat the whole thing. The important thing is that I didn't buy alcohol which means tomorrow will be day 20. I'm hoping this means that I may be at a point where I become able to convince that voice in my head that drinking today is never worth it because tomorrow will not be better for it.

I was primarily a gambling addict but there are issues with alcohol. I always felt it hard to relate to fellowship stuff and the alcoholic as an illnesss. I do understand that some people have the first one and then all bets are off and they blackout. Lose all control and I have that with my gambling very much. With alcohol my behaviour was interwoven with my anxiety. I could drink 5 out of 6 times (still drank far too often) and function but that one time I got blasted, I couldn‚Äôt deal with the anxiety (I have a Generalised Anxiety Disorder)  the next day and would trigger a 2/3 day bender. So there‚Äôs no denial, it made me unmanageable and it‚Äôs not fun at all. 

So I brought a 35cl bottle, drank it, didn‚Äôt really enjoy it, but did in some ways I did enjoy a temporary escape. I didn‚Äôt buy more when I ran out despite it crossing my mind. Next day I stopped, felt really anxious, felt like I might have a panic attack in the gym, but pushed through. Now I am on day 3 again and sober.

I can‚Äôt explain it but it‚Äôs like I just the idea of being able to, even if it‚Äôs once a month, once every 2 months. The next day I regret it, hate the anxiety, it reminds me why I can‚Äôt and I start again and see it like a one day at a time thing, or that I have been sober 139 days out of 140. I dunno if that makes any sense, or if people think I‚Äôm setting myself up for failure. I like the idea I can drink very rarely and pay the price the next day, but I also choose not to the majority of the time. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs hard, I could easily drink again this week but I won‚Äôt because I know the next day is shit and it‚Äôs not worth it.

I got out of work on a Saturday and drank about 18 mich ultras. My racing heart woke me up on Sunday morning. I had blacked out, maybe even drove home (can‚Äôt remember tbh), I was sick as a dog. I had anxiety that made me want to rip my skin off my body. It persisted for hours. I cried on and off. I called my mom, my cousin, and my best friend. All the conversations went something like this

Me: ‚Äúwhy do I always overdo it??‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I control myself?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sick I never want to drink again... do you think I have a problem...?‚Äù

Them: ‚ÄúYoure fine‚Äù You‚Äôre just being too hard in yourself‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôll feel better tomorrow‚Äù ‚Äújust ride it out, it happens to everyone‚Äù 

I definitely spent time on this sub and googling ‚Äúam I an alcoholic?‚Äù It was not the worst hangover I‚Äôd ever had physically, but mentally I had never felt like such a loser. I knew I had no control over the way I drank and after spending the last year or so obsessing over moderation I knew I was full of shit. 

Six days later I went out and bought a 6 pack of white claws with the intention of only drinking those. Woke up heart racing the next day, had the audacity to wonder why I was so hungover. I tallied up that I had bought 4 more claws at the bar and stole like 3 more from someone else at the afterparty. I was sick of lying to myself. I was disgusted with my inability to be honest with myself. And that was it. I haven‚Äôt had a drop since. It hasn‚Äôt been easy, but I‚Äôve been able to make eye contact with myself in the mirror.

I agonized over the decision for at least two weeks beforehand. I was having a few friends over that I hadn't seen in a super long time. None of them drank very much and I never want to act messy in front of sober friends, so I knew that would keep me from going overboard. I was so worried that I would miss out on something by not drinking, that I figured it was better to try to drink moderately than to spend the entire night feeling miserable because everyone was drinking but me.

It all worked out exactly as I had planned. And it wasn't worth it.

The first sip of wine didn't feel at all how I expected. It didn't taste as good as I remembered and it made me feel unpleasantly dizzy. Instead of feeling like a social lubricant, it felt like it made it harder for me to carry on a conversation. I sipped slowly throughout the night, and forced myself to watch what my friends were drinking so that I wouldn't drink more than they did. Even so, I ended up having a little bit more than the person who drank the most (about 3-4 glasses). There was a little voice in my head saying that I should drink the remaining wine after everyone went home. After they left, I poured out the unfinished bottle before I could even think about it, and went to bed. 

I learned something really important from this experience. I have seen people say that when they control their drinking, they don't enjoy it, and when they enjoy drinking, they can't control it. I didn't realize how true that would be for me until I tried it. Yes, I was able to stick to my limit, but it was because I spent every moment of actively forcing myself to control my drinking. I thought I would be boring and miserable without alcohol, but it was the opposite.  I was hyperfocused on alcohol to the exclusion of all else. I was only half present in every conversation because I was counting the intake of myself and others. 

That is not drinking ""normally"".

Yes, my intake was normal, but my thought process was not. I got lucky that I was able to fight off my alcoholic brain for one night, but I can't assume I'll get lucky like that again. Today I feel more committed than ever to my sobriety. Before this relapse, I had been starting to think of alcohol as this amazing thing that I was never going to get to have, and I felt depressed. Now I see that everything I remember about alcohol is a lie. For me, there is nothing enjoyable about controlling my drinking. In fact, trying to control my drinking is a great way to turn a fun night into a stressful one.

I write this post for anyone who is considering giving themselves a night off from sobriety. Because think about it: if you go past your limit, you're going to feel like shit and might not be able to prevent a continued relapse. If you do stick to your limit...then what? We didn't become alcoholics because we looooved the feeling of having just one drink. Whether you continue to drink or spend the rest of the night resisting, alcohol will be the one running the show. Don't let it. It's not worth it.

I started a journal then, and as I'm revisiting it and adding to it a year later, there's a lot to think about. I've been seeing a therapist (waiting for my appointment to start in 15 minutes right now) and am lined up for an antidepressant prescription from a psychologist. Looking to get into a virtual (because that's all we have anymore) 12-step group somewhere and just trying to be more intentional about this whole not-drinking thing. I'm doing stuff like talking about it with my spouse, keep setting future therapist appointments at the end of each therapist appointment, reading, and trying to stay on top of work. The worst part about this all has been the depression. It seems like I've been drinking to self medicate. Okay, I *have* been drinking to self medicate for the past 20 years. And, although I've stopped drinking before, I've gone back to it in the end because I get crushed. That is, the world just seems to come down impossibly hard on me, to the point where it feels like it's either time to drink or end my life. Since being drunk is temporary, that's the simplest... the kids are used to seeing me drink, as is my partner, co-workers, parents, and siblings. They're not so used to seeing me dead. Then again neither am I. So, it's a passive ideation, but it's still there and it won't go away and that's why I'm getting help. 

Why am I posting this? I don't know. I guess it's to say that if you're feeling ~~that~~ this stuff when you stop drinking, you're not alone. I think from reading the posts here, I have a good feeling that I'm not alone. It's just a kicker that the people in my immediate vicinity don't see this because I can keep stuff together on the outside (sober or drunk) while being a complete wreck on the inside. Looking ahead, I trust that I'll feel as good (or at least as stable) as I did while I was drunk/drinking, but it's been a tough road.

Drinking dreams have always been pure torture for me. I've always had super vivid, real feeling dreams my whole life, and my drinking dreams are next level. They feel so real and like I have no control over anything.

Last night I dreamt there was alcohol in the house and it felt like I couldn't do anything to stop myself from drinking. Then, I took a moment and somehow realized I was dreaming. I told myself my cravings have been conquerable lately. I've been doing just fine. That I only feel like I have no choice in drinking because this is a dream. In real life I have control and I can make the choice not to.

Since quitting five years ago (after many failed attempts) I've worked on myself and am constantly reflecting on who I've become. I worked really hard to do well in college and was hyper fixated on being successful in life in general. Right now I'm unemployed and have been applying for everything. Bottom line is I still don't have a job and things haven't really ""taken off"" like I thought they would if I fixated on doing my best and excluding things from my life like drinking that might hold me back.

&#x200B;

Anyways, what this reflection keeps turning into is an idea festering in my head that this all was the wrong path, and that if I was the less driven, happy-go-lucky (albeit depressed) drinker I was in college things would have turned out different. Maybe if I was still drinking I would have met someone.. made some drunken connection... or have been more resilient in general. Maybe life isn't meant to be so scrutinized, hasn't really worked out for me, or at least it doesn't feel like it. 

Thanks for letting me get some thoughts out that I think could be dangerous if not addressed. Not drinking today friends. hope this doesn't come of as being ungrateful for being sober

2020-11-02 14:48:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jmup5v/im_supposed_to_start_a_home_detox_tomorrow_and_i/,Im supposed to start a home detox tomorrow and I dont think I can do it.,"This has been planned for weeks, and Ive even been asking for it for over a year, and now I finally have it; I have been given over 120 librium 5mg tablets, along with a schedule of when to take them throughout the day for a 7 day period.

For a bit of background, I drink strong 9% 500ml beers, and I probably drink around 6-7 per day. In the past. since around 14 (and im 27 now) I used to just smoke weed, then it turned into smoking weed whilst drinking all day by around 20, and then a few years later it turned into weed + alcohol + ketamine, which lead me to cocaine. I then had a year long period of serious cocaine issues, which created real insanity and madness, including knife wrestles with paramedics, police, hospital admissions for overdoses, lost jobs, relationships, debt, lost friends, everything bad that could happen, happened... and in the end I was so sure I was going to die, yet I also couldnt stop, that I got my dad to pay 7 thousand for a rehab for 1 month.. this was in january 2019.

The rehab suceeded in getting me to stop taking cociane, but during the whole process, I realised that my house where I live is my trigger for drinking, every AA and NA meeting I went to, and every person I spoke to re affirmed that, and even the therapist confirmed it was my trigger. This is due to me living with my mum who is very depressive and also not being able to move out because of finances and becuase I also have an old 11 year old dog, and ontop of that the guilt I feel for leaving my mum alone despite the fact that she is so depressive is hard, so when I left rehab and came back home, I continued drinking, thinking I wouldnt be able to stop drinking while I have to live in this house, which I still do.

Throw forward a year, and I had some issues with cocaine again but they went away because I started using Fentanyl to substitute the cocaine. SO I  was drinking all day, using fentanyl all day, and smoking weed all day.. and on some days I was also doing cocaine AND ketamine, and once even speed on top, or MDMA. It was insane.. and I was going into work and fully functioning

Then I decided I needed to stop this, so I left my job to cut my source of funds and thought I would sort out my addictions and then go back to work.. sadly I realised that now I had nothing to do with my time, which only made my addictions worse again, and I also got very depressed from having no purpose in life and nothing to do and no friends or partner, so I looked for a job, and got one ina  warehouse.

Cut forward a lot of stress, and in the past few months I have gone to my local drug and alcohol service, mainly for help getting off of fentanyl, which was completely dominating my life and how I felt all the time... Around 2 months ago they changed me from fentanyl onto a drug called Espranor (Subutex), and Im on the highest daily amount of that they can presicbe.. they also instructed me to drink at the same amount whilst my body adjusts to the change from fentanyl to subutex and then after I have stabilied then we would look into having a home detox from alcohol.

Unfortunately, being on this drug subutex all day makes me so anxious .. WHEN I AM ALONE DOING NOTHING.. if IM at work, keeping busy, I manage to actually feel good sometimes, but at home with notihng to do or think about I actually go into a panick attack from anxiety just because of knowing that im on this much medication and that I need this much, and because ive felt the withdrawls from not taking the right amount and its insanely ubearable, so my entire day is on edge and feelin super anxious... UNLESS, Im at work.

Work is the only place that I dont drink at the moment.. literally. I have also been having trouble sleeping, so I go to sleep by 8-9pm to wake up at 5am and take my Espranor, but every SINGLE hour in the night I wake up and smoke a cigerette and have a few sips of my 9% beer. Then I wake up at 5am and have a full 9% beer.. and continue to drink until bedtime again and even over bedtime.. The only place i feel I have the control not to drink, is at work... where im kept busy and doing things..

Now I was supposed to start this home detox today, and the whole basis of me being allowed to do it is that I am not supposed to go to work for the 7 days that I do it, and the nurse will even be calling me twice a day. This morning, I completely failed. I normally take my espranor every mornign whilst drinking a 9% beer, and instead I took 2 librium tablets and I literally started having a severe anxiety attack.. The idea in my mind of not being able to drink and the feeling I got sent me into pure panic.

So basically I failed the detox.

After admitting that to the nurse today, she agreed to let me try do it again tomorrow morning, but I really dont know if I can do it.

I really really desperately want to stop drinking, and I have the medicaiton here to help.. but I cant help but give in when I go into that state of pure panic.; My anxiety goes over the roof and I feel like im about to have a heart attack. It doesnt help either that im all alone and im in the very house that I created and nurtured all of my addictions. Even if I had some people around me or a schedule of what to do with my day or anything then that would help.. but the NHS doesnt fund rehabs in that way anymore, they only do this. I didnt manage to stop drinking when I went away for a full month in a real rehab and my reason for that is because I know my triggers for drinking is being in this depressive house, and I know that because if I go to my dads or anything or anywhere else then I dont even think about drinking as much.. so how am I supposed to wake up tomorrow and stop drinking completely whilst being completely alone in this place that I hate living with absolutely nothing to do.

The nurse, the drug worker and the docto.r and my family are all expecting me to do this now, and I dont think I can. As much as I want to now... the ONLY problem stopping me is that I get these anxiety panic attacks, and I dont know how to stop them. If im alone here at 6am tomorrow and like today I go into complete panic mode then I dont think I will do it again, but unfortunately this home detox is my only option. The only place I phsyically manage to stop myself from drinking at the moment is when Im at work, I dont know how I can stop at home with absolutely nobody with me and nothing to do really, and I feel maybe the best choice would be to go to work and use work to cut down each day, whilst also cutting down on the espranor, until im basically on neither. I feel like when Im at home with nothing to do then my mind just starts to think about how much espranor I need to feel normal and that is what makes me get super anxious,.. even when I am drinking I get almost the same anxiety IF im at home doing nothing, because of the espranor, so maybe its not a good idea to do a home detox with librium whilst im already on this level of espranor either.

In any case.. everybody is expecting me to wake up tomorrow and stop drinking. I have been given a solid plan for when to take my medication throughout the day, and im supposed to take 5 librium 5mg in the morning, and then again another 3 times.. Maybe that will make me feel better after I take them.. but then I also worry that ONCE I take  them, then I cant drink. I cant be on espranor, librium and alcohol cause then Ill die, so once I make that choice I cant go back, so I dont feel like I can do it.. IF I get the same panic attack I had this morning, what can I do? I almost feel like calling an ambulance when I go into a panic attack, its so so horrible.

Anyway this has been a garbled post so thank you for reading if youhave, i would just like any advice if possible. I dont feel like this whole home detox is going to work and I dont know what to do if I go into the panic attack I had earlier. My whole anxiety is general is always high because of the espranor. I feel like it would be better to come off of that before the alcohol but I also have  everyone expecting me to do this tomorrow now so how I do I go back and say I cant",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9983015060424805}"

The shutdown had resulted me working from home, a fulltime office job now running from my kitchen table - with a 5, 2 and 1 yo. Daycares shut down so I had all the kids, while working from home. The stress was too much. I caved, hard. It turned into a 5 month bender that almost destroyed me, my family and my marriage. I am 76 days sober today- largely thanks to getting desperately needed psychiatric care, my 5 yo going to school and 1 yo going to daycare. I'm still working at home through end of the year but it is now a lot more doable.

I'm currently on day 3, I'm still determined not to drink and I don't feel any cravings or withdrawal (due to tapering off gradually last week), but this is usually the point where I experience a really bad mood crash and massive bout of low self-esteem, which makes me want to grab a beer because everything seems pointless.

So far though my only problem today is a total lack of concentration. I have work in front of me to do and it's not a particularly difficult task, but my mind is all over the place and I'm finding it really hard to focus. Going to write today off and make up for lost time later in the week. I know I normally balance out again by day 5 and I'll catch up then.

Does anyone else notice they have similar issues in the first sober week? 

I've found that paying attention to the feelings in previous attempts is helping me to ride them out a bit better this time. (Normally having a bad work day like this would help trigger the mood crash, but this time I'm accepting it as a natural part of the process).

1 day drinking (Halloween) was enough for me to pass out on the couch at 7pm, wake up at 2am with a racing mind and a dry mouth. i didn't get overally drunk but still had a lazier morning than i would have not hungover. 

last week was a big break thorough for me and here i am on day 2 again this week feeling great with a new outlook on my alcohol use.

And it DOES get easier, believe me. But I think I was maybe too optimistic about being ""free"", as recently I've been craving alcohol for the first time in a while. I need some help.

I've been becoming increasingly depressed over the last few months. Depression has been a factor in my life from the age of 18 (the last 8 years of my life) but I've learned how to keep it at bay for the most part. As long as I'm taking care of myself, mentally and physically, I'm okay. Staying sober was always a part of that, and a driving factor in keeping me sober. It eventually clicked that I can't be happy and an alcoholic, so I had to ditch the booze.
There have been a couple of things in my life as of late that have thrown me off. I got out of another bad relationship about a month ago which has really caused me to question love. My contract at work is coming to an end at the end of the year. I've been looking for work the past three months and have had one interview for a job I didn't really want, and didn't get. And of course this pandemic just makes everything worse. So the combination of those things seems to have gotten me down. Now I can't help but wonder, if I‚Äôm depressed anyway why not drink so I can have occasional moments of relief?

The other worrisome thought that has been coming up quite often revolves around my social anxiety. I have been socially anxious for as long as I can remember, it is all I have ever known apart from when I was drunk. I moved away from my home town after graduating high school and have not made any lasting friendships. The only people I have felt comfortable around out here are past boyfriends, but those relationships did not last. I am desperate for connection and love, or just someone to sit around and watch movies with occasionally. Normally dating is hard for me...in fact it‚Äôs hard for everyone I imagine. But I absolutely dread it, and it‚Äôs hard for me to muster up the courage on a good day, let alone when I am depressed. And the one thing that alcohol truly did help me with was socializing. It‚Äôs not a long term solution of course, but in the past it has given me the courage to even attempt dating until I get comfortable enough with someone that I can be sober around them. And that thought scares me, that maybe alcohol could help me with this. Because I know how much trouble it brings. 

I can‚Äôt tell if the depression and anxiety I‚Äôm feeling are making me think irrationally and I need to hear some other perspectives. Or is it possible to drink again until I find a boyfriend and then quit? Please advise.

Constant battles between myself but the only reminder I keep replaying is that my wife is more worth having in my life than a poison that only loves to be consumed. 

Its not easy at night but atleast now a days whenever I see its past 2am i don't feel angry. I feel lighter like I cant buy beer even if I wanted but i don't want to and I dont have to worry about waiting till 7am for that numbness. 

Mornings are still hard because I am alone. Alone with my thoughts & demons and i still have that whisper of do it she'll never find out just hide the evidence. 

But i cant hide the truth not from myself & not from her she doesnt deserve a liar for a husband. 

So 1 week went and came. 


Ive obviously replaced alcohol with other horrible addictions but atleast i havent broken my sobriety and added onto the mess I create. 

I plan on not buying ice cream again because clearly if its in the fridge it will be eaten. No will power included in thought. 

I cant keep going to McDonald's in the middle of the night. Not only can I not afford it the food disappears in matters of minutes and Im left with nothing but shit.  

Next week will be harder this Big E is coming up and I need to be blind & unconscious after someone wins but now ill just be alive & sober & sobbing. 

I wonder how ill deal with that? I suppose just crying till i fall asleep. Working till I can sleep to cry again. I am so afraid of the future.

Waking up that morning I was miserable, lonely, self-loathing, and pessimistic. I didn't see the point of anything anymore and I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. 

I decided that I needed to make a change- for real this time. So after 3 years of trying, I finally got to a month. Then two months. Then three months. Then four. Then five. And now, six months- half a year. 

I can safely say now, that sobriety has ruined drinking for me. The life I have now is completely different in so many massive and subtle ways. 

My sleep problems have lessened. 

I've lost a 10 lbs and feel more confident in myself. 

I am excelling at work and my PhD and got an article published last week. 

My friendships have improved. I feel more connected to the people in my life. 

I have read 15 books. 

I have been interviewed on recovery podcasts. 

I made a facebook group for other sober women in my area. I have met a few of them, but after covid we hope to have more get togethers. 

I exercise consistently. 

I call my mom more. 

My moods are more balanced and I don't feel sad as often as I used to. 

My partner and I are moving into a house and adopting a puppy. 

I have started writing my novel again. 

I don't get as anxious in social situations without drinking. 

I  got rid of old clothes and have been slowly building a capsule wardrobe.

I am authentically living a life I believe in. 

There have been ups and downs (and LOCK downs) over the past few months- yet I am the most content I have been in years. Despite a pretty shitty 2020, I have gotten more clarity in my life and have actually had a year of real personal growth. I see the bigger picture now and I practice gratitude for the little things every single day. A hot coffee, a sunny afternoon, a Harry Potter marathon.

I owe so much of my journey to SD. I don't check in here as often as I used to, but my first two months I checked in here every day as part of my recovery routine. I read the stories, I wrote my own, I promised to not drink with you today. It helped fill the time, connect, and stick to the plan. From this community, I have learned to take things one day at a time. I didn't do AA or anything like that, so SD was always my safe space. 

I can't believe it's only been 6 months because it's hard to imagine a life that isn't like this. A life that is quiet, safe, and exciting. Blackouts were so common when I was drinking that I am missing so many long spaces of time that I will never get back, but I now make an effort to enjoy every moment that I can. I don't feel anxious about not remembering what I did or said. I don't fear meeting new people incase they had ever met me while I was blacked out. There's a calmness that I now have. A calmness that had been missing. 

There is so much uncertainty right now in the world, where I live we are going back into lockdown this week. Lockdown was a great time for me to finally stop drinking. I had the time and space away from people that was necessary for me to quit.  Besides working, I treated the last lockdown as if it was a rehab centre. Going on 2-3 hour long walks outside with recovery podcasts, checking into SD, preparing my own food, watching comforting movies, and getting as much sleep as I could.

Day 1: woke up excited to begin not drinking and looked forward to Halloween without booze.  Proceeded to drink and watch Queens Gambit, will try again on November 1.  Have locked credit cards and wallet in gun safe to keep me from buying shit (also correlated with my drinking).  

Day 1 Redux:  woke up hungover, got up at 7:30 and cleaned the apartment.  Did some stretches and researched grad schools.  Made octopus ceviche for dinner, had no booze, fought craving.

I'm not getting drunk but I wouldn't say I was sober either. I usually find I enjoy 1 or 2 drinks near or after work as I fool myself into thinking it relaxes me, then a few more towards bed time. 
Some days I feel fine although other days I feel irritable  and groggy  after a couple of drinks then I'm aware of it and get angry at myself for doing that. 


It affects my muaythai training and study as I never put 100% in cause I just end up feeling a bit groggy tired or  too irritable to study. 
I never wake up hangover and the next day I feel fine all day, it's late afternoon when I start tounging  for a drink.

I've hurt alot of people when i'm hammered, but this time my boy who is 5 saw me piss drunk throwing up because he was awake when I got home from my friend, I was also ranting about a dead friend of mine, who by the way died at age 28 from drinking... I promised myself that he should never see me in that kind of state, but here I am. Ravaged with guilt and shame!
This is luckily the first time he saw me like this but I promise I will be the last time..
I hate drinking, but it's been apart of coping with my life when things get to square and predictable...and maybe some childhood trauma as well....

Am I an alcholic??? My guess...yes.

Alcohol has always been an issue of mine, and on both sides of my family for every single generation in remembrance. I‚Äôm almost 25, however one of my close friends turned 21 the day before my quit date, and I took her out casually drinking with the idea of babysitting her while i was out and about. She got cut off and proceeded to blow up the bar to a small crowd of maybe 20 people. Over the walk home, I was near sober and scolded her for her behavior. She left and we haven‚Äôt spoken since, but this feeling in my gut said it was time. Thankfully, this isn‚Äôt my first time engaging with a community or rehabilitation program of some effect to get sober, but this time I have no desire for alcohol anymore, and that‚Äôs a relief. There‚Äôs the ever persistent craving from the physical and mental addiction, but I think there‚Äôs a huge difference between the obsession of drinking versus getting to the point of being repulsed or not attracted to it anymore whatsoever. I know I‚Äôll have to keep up with holding myself accountable as time passes, but my sobriety is making me smile, and I hope that the people with large amounts of sobriety under their belt can smile a bit knowing you potentially inspired me to this point after lurking for so long, and would love any advice or stories or anything to that effect.",2,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9821825623512268}"

I have a loved one in Melbourne, Australia who is in need of a temporary sponsor in a 12 step program. I'm in the US, so I'm not familiar with the channels of 12 step programs in that area. 

He's been sober before, but has always gone it alone. He recently relapsed after almost 10 months, which was the longest period sober he had. He's currently in hospital, but will be discharged soon. I'm trying to help him set up a sober support plan before he gets out as there's been zero support for sobriety while he's been in hospital. He's never tried a 12 step program, but is open to the idea of it, and working with a sponsor.

Ideally, I'd like to help him find someone local who has at least 2 years of *healthy* sobriety, actively goes to meetings (even if online due to COVID), and works the steps. It would be very helpful for him to work with someone within the LGBT community, and who is capable of sponsoring someone with mental health diagnoses. 

Also, can someone point me in the direction of some 12 step Zoom meetings based in Melbourne? Particularly ones geared towards beginners or closed meetings? The Zoom meeting list I've found online doesn't distinguish what type of meeting each is, i.e. beginners, Big Book, step study, speaker, etc.

What's the best way to help him find these things? If there's a subreddit for AA in Melbourne, that would be extremely helpful!

I haven‚Äôt updated in a couple of weeks so I thought I‚Äôd share my terrible relationship with alcohol to remind myself why I stopped.

As soon as I turned 21 I began using it to escape.  After work I‚Äôd buy a 40 oz and drink while wandering the streets of my suburb, sometimes sitting in a nearby forest listening to audiobooks.  I did it to avoid going home.  I‚Äôd eventually return after my parents went to bed and crashed on my bed.

Eventually I became so depressed I attempted suicide (I tried to cut my wrists, but all I did was scratch them.)

I was in and out of psych wards until I moved out with my brother.  We lived right behind a liquor store, and I proceeded to drink a six pack or more every day.

I stabilized as a functioning alcoholic, binge drinking every night but learning to handle the hangovers well enough to keep a job.  I even got a girlfriend.  There were days when I thought I might pass out and my hands would shake, but I would ease up my drinking for a day or two and then back to 6 packs.

I moved in with my girlfriend, and my drinking kept escalating.  Soon I was having 8 beers and 12+ on weekend days.  

One day I began having terrible stomach discomfort and a rash on my lips.  I had given myself a gluten intolerance from slamming so many IPAs.  No matter, I soon switched to hard seltzers.

8 became 10, and then I began sneaking nips before getting home from work.  I began drinking the second I got off work, hitting up liquor stores on the way home.

My girlfriend knew how much I drank, but I seemed to be taking care of everything, seeing family and doing chores, cooking... I didn‚Äôt let anything fall behind.

Then I had a hospital visit.  During vacation I got gastritis while drinking with family.  Shots of jalape√±o tequila wore away my stomach lining.

Not long after I began having chronic stomach discomfort.  I often drank on an empty stomach and my stools began to consist of yellow slime.  I learned later this was the body‚Äôs inability to digest fat due to liver distress.

That‚Äôs when I posted here, and quit 50 days ago.  

I find myself thinking that now my body has healed I could drink again.  I have to remember that‚Äôs insane and I‚Äôll wind up dead.

I went over to my boyfriends friends house. Had no intention of getting crazy or emotional. But of course in my inebriated state I let one small action be the downfall of my night. It included me crying alone at the bar to running away from my BF and his friends, only for me to trip and fall and skin the shit out of my legs. The fall still didn‚Äôt stop me and I yelled at my boyfriend to stay away. At this point the alcohol only fueled my desire to be alone and unleashed whatever anger I had to make it happen. So I said some hurtful things and intentionally hurt the person I care about. I was a wreck, more so than I ever been. I‚Äôve taken such a long look in the mirror today, and I realized I have no control. I am what my parents are. I am hurting people much like they did. I‚Äôm done I don‚Äôt want to hurt and feel guilty anymore. I‚Äôm going to be apart of the Nah November.

Man I was triggered hard, to the point of planning out how to get some booze. I ended up leaving the house, made up a reason to leave, and went to the gas station.  Somehow I talked myself out of buying booze and grabbed a soda instead.

Another beautiful day wasted due to withdrawal. Currently 20 hours in, so  I'm finally feeling good enough to type this.

Clearly I cannot.

I've gone through this many times, including just one week ago. No more. I'm done. I've lurked on this subreddit for many months, almost always with drink in hand. It's finally time. 

It had recently gotten to where I pour whiskey in my coffee just to be able to drive my kids to school without shaking, and start drinking beer when I start work in the morning. My son was counting on me to drive him and 4 friends to an event Saturday morning, but of course I wake up vomiting with the shakes. So I slam 3 beers quickly as I can to center myself and get through the day. (I know how bad that is). After I dropped them off, thinking to myself in the car, this has got to stop now. 

Not many people truly know what I've been going through because on the surface I'm successful, have a great career, take very good care of my home, taking care of my kids, no issues with work performance, etc. The typical professional who ""has it all together."" 

But I've been slipping fast. I'm also giving up edibles, as that's been a daily habit as well.

* Day 1 of not spending a small fortune at the liquor store every day 
* Day 1 of not driving dangerously

I have been debating for a few weeks to post this so here it goes. I try to only drink on weekends but fail on Wednesday always. I have about two bottles of wine on that day and around 50-60 units on weekend. The urge is so strong to drink that I always cave in. Im 28 and doing a Masters Degree, I play rugby, go to the gym, run and so it hasn't massively impacted any of that too much but most of the time I only just get away with it. 

I don't want to give up drinking all together as I genuinely enjoy it most of the time, I just want to stop drinking on my own (normally i listen to music and play games). I want to drink with my friends and that should be the only occasion. On weekends I feel I almost have to drink cos its the weekend but hate feeling hungover on Sunday (I have such bad anxiety from drinking), yet this still does not stop me drinking.

I spent the entire week dreading that night because i knew they would offer me alcohol and be extremely surprised of me refusing and i also knew that it would be hard for me to say no because the last 2 weeks have been extremely stressful for me due to being evicted of an appartment + financial problems ( Covid made me lost 3 jobs in a row ; 2 bankruptcy and 1 lockdown closure  )

Instead, when i said no and explained them that i realized i have a problem with alcohol, they got super emotional and told me that they know they have a problem too but never found the courage to go full sober. They then proceeded to tell me how they were proud that i was tackling this challenge despise my situation and we had a deep family moment together

After about 2-3 hours of Super Mario World, it was very clear that no one could play a difficult platformer while pounding wine and beer (much less hold a controller), so we pivoted to Jackbox and had a great time. As the night ticked on, our group whittled away from eight people to four because people kept falling asleep or forgetting what we were doing or getting sick. Ultimately we called the night after about six hours of gaming. 

Today I get a message from one of my friends that he doesn't remember playing Jackbox at all, but he was told ""I gave a good speech on Magic the Gathering and had a good answer on Quiplash"". He insisted he had a blast while not remembering any of it and throwing up today. 

Half a decade ago, that was me almost every weekend. I've beaten games and don't remember doing it until the next morning. I've danced my ass of at three in the morning, only to learn about me doing it via cell phone footage months later. Someone had fun, apparently. It wasn't me, though. Not to say I'm not responsible for my actions, far from that. 

I cannot fathom at all *how* I convinced myself I had so much fun and can't recall any of it. I'm glad drunk me had fun back then, but I wish they shared it with sober me instead of paying for it with an empty wallet and a splitting headache and ruined friendships and more half-hearted apologies. Same with my friend. If he genuinely believes he had fun, then sure. But he felt the need to apologize first for anything bad that he may or may not have done because he can't remember! On the outside, though, nothing about waking up to vomit and struggling to remember where you were moments prior screams fun to me.

When drinking is involved they additionally asked me if I was comfortable around intoxicated people. I told them I don't mind, which I've come to be fine with just socializing.  


Old friends on the other hand is a little bit different. I joined some at a club last night for halloween that I had mostly ever been around fairly intoxicated.

I've always experienced black outs / memory loss when binge drinking, ever since day one when I was a teenager.

But even at home, after about 5 pints my memory would be affected. Forgotten conversations, don't quite remember walking up to bed etc.

Is this a phenomenen others have experienced? I wasn't drinking any more than I had previously. Perhaps it is me reducing my capacity to drink. Or perhaps it is my brain giving up. Quite concerning either way.

I know an entire bottle is a lot for some people but there's some context to address...

Around October 2016 I started going through a particularly hard time in my life. I had just started college, and went through a break up from a 6 year long abusive relationship. Was in school full time for an engineering degree(did graduate on time somehow), working, and juggling my dad's appointments for his cancer stuff. 

Prior to this point in my life I mostly drank wine. Not too much, I would go through maybe a bottle a week. I was a member of Nakedwines and would just try out various things. Loved cheap port wine, only drank liquor very rarely. I started drinking more and more liquor as the stress of it all mounted. The night of the breakup I remember, vaguely, sitting in my computer chair with a loaded handgun in my lap and drinking shots of cheap whiskey.   
As it snowballed it got to the point where I was going through around 5 or 6 full bottles a week. I was drinking a bit at school(Drank a bottle of my favorite cheap port after finals and it didn't get get me buzzed), at work - note on this point, I did the math for how much I could chug at the beginning of a shift to have a BAC of 0 by the time my shift was over, and my tolerance was high enough that I was still able to be the best one on the shift - , and at home. 

This year I finally started trying to get better. I began drinking only on the weekends, although I was still going through 4 bottles between Friday and Sunday(I'm a reasonably big guy). Two weekends ago I went through 3, last weekend 2, and this weekend just 1. I understand how dangerous delirium tremens is, so I have been tapering it off in this way to stay on the safe side. Yesterday I drank the bottle over the course of the day, passed out on my bed, and then woke up at 7am to take my dog out. 

Next weekend I plan to keep the cravings at bay with a Angry Orchard or something because right now I still crave the hell out of alcohol and prior to this weekend, right now I'd already be several hours into getting smashed. 

I hope my writing wasn't too bad. I want to get better, and be better, and I wish I could get back all the wasted time and money.

2020-11-01 11:55:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jm5jk4/observations_from_my_first_sober_social_gathering/,Observations from my first sober social gathering,"Went to a small housewarming/Halloween gathering last night (in a city with a very, very low Covid case count -- but I accept judgment on this choice). This was my first in-person social event with alcohol since I stopped drinking. Made it through in tact and clocked 70 days! A few observations:

1) **No ""Did I eat enough?"" pre-occupation**: In the hours before going out, I ate a small dinner and was a bit dehydrated. It occurred to me that drinking-me would have been very stressed out about these facts, because I always try to make sure to eat enough before drinking and be well-hydrated. If I'm not, I get drunk faster than I want to, and am more likely to be hungover. But at the same time I am trying to leave enough room for booze calories. A constant, futile struggle. Sober me was like, oh, this is no problem! I will only be drinking water/hydrating fluids the rest of the night. And if I get hungry, I'll just eat! It won't be something greasy and gross because I'm drunk. So yeah, I indulged in some Halloween treats.

2) **No one noticed. Not a single person.** I kept thinking about what I would say about not drinking, how I would phrase it, etc. BUT NO ONE NOTICED OR ASKED. I had a can of seltzer on hand for most of the party, so people probably just assumed it was alcoholic. I declined a glass of champagne toward the end, but I was about to leave anyway, so I don't think anyone connected the dots. This was a very freeing realization -- you care way more than anyone else. 

3) **I still had fun.** Had some great conversations with friends, even over the roar of beer pong yelling. There were conversation lulls here and there, sure, but it all felt very normal? I was still at a party, surrounded by friends, with a fun alcohol-free drink, and desserts on the kitchen counter. I didn't need to constantly be drinking beer or White Claws to feel like a part of it. 

4) **Ok, I did feel a tiny bit of FOMO.** I was not tempted to drink -- that part was actually pretty easy. But yeah, when everyone had a glass of champagne for a little toast, and seeing the different craft beers people brought, I felt a little bit like an outsider. That has been a big change, the dissociation and detachment you start to feel toward booze. I will say those feelings came in fleeting moments, rather than the whole experience. Being aware of these reactions as they happen is an important step in not letting them consume you.

5) **I felt so amazing when it was over**. I did it. I felt so proud. My night routine was not disrupted; I came home and brushed my teeth, washed my makeup off, went through my whole skin-care routine.

Thank you for doing this with me. I wanted to reiterate my dedication to sobriety this month.

To those who have been sober for days or years

To those coming out of sober October

To those who drank on Halloween (and maybe even drank a little into November)

To those who just so happened to stumble here today

And to those who have lurked and never posted

To all of you who read this:

Let‚Äôs not drink together this November. If you have any concerns about any moments you may be tempted this month, feel free to share. Maybe someone will have some advice for you.

My main concerns this month are when my brother and his wife come to visit and thanksgiving. But last night I told my parents, my SO, and my other brother I will not be drinking this month and won‚Äôt be drinking thanksgiving. My dad may be joining me in this as well. I told them I wanted some accountability. Now I have that set. 

I‚Äôm excited to get my health back this month. And I‚Äôm excited to work on my happiness.

It hasn't been easy but it's been pretty simple to get and stay sober: focus on living a life I'm proud of. It's so liberating to get to focus on all these joyful numbers instead of, ""How many bottles did I drink last night? Did I hide them all?"" or ""How many days did I drink last week? Is that too many?"".

I cuddled up with my dog and went to sleep...only to wake up with my stomach at the bottom of my gut and fear in my heart. DID I DRINK! wtf! after coming to my senses I realized It was all a dream. I got a safe reality check and a glimpse into my future if I was to drink. Everyone was so disappointed in me and I gave up on myself thinking I'd never get sober. I tried to be sneaky but was caught red-handed and everyone just left me alone to drink and destroy myself. wowza

Last Halloween I went to a party in a warehouse, where I was very drunk and on ecstasy pills. I Blacked out and broke my iPhone 10- no insurance and had to pay for the broken phone for another year at ¬£56 a month.
Got home around 7AM where I have a vague recollection of drinking a beer in my living room and smoking a cigarette out of the window before passing out in bed, waking up around 12pm with the worst anxiety and depression. Didn‚Äôt get out of bed and rang in sick the following day as I still felt awful.

Anyway, fast forward a year and I‚Äôm feeling grateful that I don‚Äôt have to feel that way again. My partner is cooking us a Sunday roast chicken dinner, I have my candles lit and Lofi Fm on YouTube (highly recommend to relax to). Will have a bath later and do some reading in bed :) 

To anyone who did drink last night- please do not beat yourself up. Sometimes we need to do what we do in order to realise we don‚Äôt want to feel this way again.

Stay strong everyone,

We would go camping together, get together regularly for big dinners and always had lots of laughs, and were generally there for each other.  But oh, how things have changed in the last few years.

One sibling and his spouse became members of a certain, to remained unnamed religion, which is quite fundamentalist and has some pretty crazy ideas.  Thereafter, their daughter (and my much loved niece) came out as gay and so my brother and his wife were told by their religion that they basically needed to disown their child and not have any contact with her.  Makes everyone getting together as a family difficult, as we need to choose whether to invite my brother and his wife or my niece, and quite frankly, I invite her as I feel she has done nothing wrong and doesn't deserve the intense pain they have inflicted on her.  As a result, I have only seen this brother and his wife a few times over the last few years, even though we live quite physically close, and they seldom contact any of us anymore, including our mother.

Add to that that my other brother has stage 4, incurable cancer.  We have a great relationship, but I know he will not be here for very long.  I am treasuring each and every phone call (restricting visits now due to COVID), as I know there will come a day in the near future where they won't happen anymore.

My dad died in January of this year.  He was 88 and had some health issues that were making life hard, and had told us he was ready to go...my poor mom is now a widow after 60 years of marriage and is dealing with this f&%\*ing COVID  on top of that.

I have a great relationship with my niece and her girlfriend, and I really treasure that, but so miss the great relationship our entire family used to have.   I assumed nothing would ever come between us.

I envy those who have found ""family"" outside of blood relatives, and I guess that is something my sober self will have to pursue once this pandemic is over...not really sure how to go about it, we live rural, retired young and have lost contact/shared interests with old co-workers and are pretty isolated even when there isn't a pandemic.

Currently watching The Good Place and replaying last night‚Äôs Halloween festivities in my head. Any other year the morning after Halloween would look verrrryyyy different. I had a little over 3 weeks alcohol free under my belt going into last night. The plan was simple. Take my 4-year old to meet up with her bestie for trick-or-treating. Friendly with the parents‚Äîespecially the mom‚Äîbut haven‚Äôt really hung out in situations involving alcohol. About a month ago I had a beer with the mom at another kiddo‚Äôs birthday party, so she had no reason to think I might not be drinking. Earlier in the day she texts me to say that she‚Äôs packing red wine and solo cups for the walk but to let her know if I prefer something else. And so it begins. I suppose that would have been the opportunity to nip the issue in the bud without having any face-to-face cringeworthy moments. But I chickened out and wrote back a vague ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pack a bottle for the treküëåüèª‚Äù...knowing of course that it would be a water bottle. So not a lie but also not really confronting the issue. We get to the house, we‚Äôre hanging out in driveway. I have my big water bottle in hand. Then it happens. She gestures to my bottle and says with a smile, sooo is that ‚Äúspecial‚Äù? Meaning of course is it the road soda I alluded to bringing earlier. I instantly regret not having been upfront earlier. I say, somewhat apologetically/disappointedly, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not‚Äù, basically with this face üòï So she asked if I want something and I said, no I‚Äôm good. Then she was clearly hoping for some sort of further explanation. All I could say was, basically ‚Äúyou caught me a year too late. If this was Halloween last year it would be a VERY different story...‚Äù. Which is very true. Awkwardness established. We get going. The trick or treating is fun and we all have a good time chatting along the way. We get back to the house. It‚Äôs the grandfather‚Äôs house, because he lives in a good neighborhood for trick or treating. We never had any intention of going inside bc of covid, but he insisted we come in and warm up, etc. Ok fine, though that would have been the perfect moment to jet. But my daughter and her buddy basically dart through the door inside. Ok this is happening. Once inside the grandfather offers ‚Äúsomething to drink‚Äù and I politely decline. Then a little later he offers again...this time he starts naming things...‚ÄùWe have beer...wine....(in my head I‚Äôm telling myself, ‚Äòif he says soda I‚Äôll say yes‚Äô)....mixed drinks.‚Äù So I say I‚Äôm really fine but thank you. We hang out a little longer. Really fun conversation. We laughed about an epic misunderstanding earlier in the evening (non-drinking related). I‚Äôm not going to say it was easy, but I did it. And now the next time I hang out with her she will prob assume I WON‚ÄôT be drinking. Small victories.",128,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.989062488079071}"

Does that make sense? 

I'm a logical person, I believe in sure things and am a firm believer that nothing happens without a reason. Cause and effect. Everyone on this sub I'm sure can think of the point where they have seen their drinking become a problem due to an event in their lives. 

I'll never think I have this beat - I know this but what I do know if the EFFECT of giving in means almost certain life-changing events, of not the end to everything I know and have worked so hard for over the last \~500 days. 

500 days. To some on this sub that's rookie numbers, but there hasn't been a day gone by where I've thought of what happened that led me here. Cause and Effect and this time combined with action. It's that action that has kept me alive. 

The point of this post? Addiction mostly. I was prescribed codeine for pain caused during a motorbike accident many years ago and it's only now that my body is feeling the effects of that damage. So I take the pills of course and my brain senses that euphoric feeling. More effects due to taking action due to a cause. 

So this is my next battle, I am prescribed a month's worth of pills and for the most part, I'm running out about a week too early. Noth of the 8 prescribed pills per day depending on how sore things are or let's be honest if I fancy a shirt dopamine top-up. They aren't super strong, 30mg but enough to get the juices going. 

My blood results are good, my liver is handling things OK but I know what a knife-edge that is. I want to talk to my GP but it's another black mark, something else to add to the records. 

I need a holiday. I need some sun, isolation, and time to reflect. I need to re-focus.

Where do I start? I‚Äôve been struggling for a very long time. I have tried to quit so many times in the past couple of years, but with very little success. I‚Äôd have brief sober periods, but then I‚Äôd fall right back in to it.
Recently it‚Äôs gotten out of control (again) and I feel like I‚Äôve hit rock bottom (which I‚Äôve said before, but this time really feels like it üò¢). I‚Äôm sick, ashamed, frustrated, exhausted, and I feel so very alone. And I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt want to go on like this, but I‚Äôm scared because what will make this time different? Every time I‚Äôve quit before (or tried to quit), I really truly  meant it when I promised myself I would finally stop. But then I‚Äôd get overwhelmed, crippled by my anxiety, and would find myself unable to cope with my emotions or face situations in my life, and I‚Äôd turn right back to drinking, as it seemed like the only way I could cope. And then soon enough, it would become a habit again, leaving me dependent and drinking all the time just to get through the day. I‚Äôm watching my life spiral out of control.  I refuse to let it continue. I refuse to continue  ruining my life. I‚Äôm just so scared of failing, which is why I think I‚Äôm rambling  on and putting this all out here. Even if nobody reads this, and least I know I posted this and it‚Äôs out there. 

It‚Äôs only been 12 hours since I had alcohol. I had my last drink at 5pm this evening.

Struggling to pick up healthy habits to replace alcohol,"This is the longest I've been sober since I was 18. My life is infinitely better in every way. Giving up alcohol has been the best decision I will ever make. 

My problem lies in that alcohol created a major void in my life that I'm slowly filling with unhealthy habits. I don't crave alcohol per se but miss the feeling of ""otherness"" that it provides and I want to fill it with things that improve me, not take away. I want to want to read, write, meditate and exercise. Saying no to alcohol and other bad habits has been much easier than saying yes to to the good. 

I'm also 100 pounds over weight and that has not improved with the absence of drinking calories. I'm 40 and I can feel my health slowly declining with age and lack of healthy habits. I know what I must do but my addict brain wants the quick and easy feel good. 

Did anyone overcome this hurdle in early sobriety? How did you overcome it?

Just a few things. 

-I work from home 40 hours a week
-I attend 2 in person AA meetings a week and meet once a week with a sobriety therapist. My sponsor dumped me because I wasn't attending daily meetings but I'm looking to find another one and work the steps.

Exercise is the miracle cure we've always had, but for too long we've neglected to take our recommended dose. If exercise were a pill, it would be one of the most cost-effective drugs ever invented. The benefits of increasing our activity levels and minimising our sedentary time are huge!

Whether you are just starting out (which can be a little scary) or a seasoned fitness fanatic then this is the place to talk about it. Sharing our highs and our lows, our wins and our losses and our fitness, diet and weight loss goals can really help to keep us motivated. Everything counts here, if your raising your heart rate, breathing faster and feeling warmer you're doing it!

For the last 15 years I have been yo-yoing around 4 to 5 stone (56 - 70lbs) on a cycle of around one and a half to two years. I've either been losing weight rapidly or gaining weight rapidly and nothing in-between. Every time I have wanted to lose weight I have either stopped drinking for a period of time or drastically tried to moderate the excess calories from alcohol.

This graph¬†http://imgur.com/a/152i4QV shows the last cycle from mid 2018 to today and the zig zag extends like this back to around 2005! In all instances where I have stopped or reduced my drinking in the past my goal has been weight loss. Although I have always been willing to accept alcohol as being the primary cause of my weight gain (either directly from it's own calories or indirectly by the late night binge eating junk that would ensue when I was drunk) I have never been able to accept that I wanted (needed) to stop drinking altogether. I entered this latest period of weight loss with the exact same intention as before, lose some weight, get fit and then try to moderate alcohol again! This latest period for me though started from a much worse spot than it ever had before. I was drinking more then I ever had and I was feeling much worse than I ever had!

Since I haven't started drinking again (largely thanks to this community helping me realise that a life without alcohol is not only possible but highly desirable) I am now trying to move into the maintenance stage of my current weight. This is new to me. I have to try balance the calories I take in with the calories I am burning, only this is hardly an exact science! Initially once I had reached my goal I continued to lose weight although at a reduced pace. I have gradually been trying to increase my calorie intake and my weight has started to rise again. I think what is hard is not quite knowing how many calories I am going to burn from exercise from week to week. This last week I have only managed one 8 mile run (around 900 kcal) due to work commitments and child care commitments yet the week before I was up at 26 miles running and 63 miles bike riding (around 5500 kcal). This is a difference in exercise calories alone of 4600kcal which is around 2+ days extra of food based on a sedentery Total Daily Energy Expenditure for me.

It's blowing my mind a bit at the moment. I think all I can do is just keep doing what I am doing and keep a regular check on my weight and hopefully over time it will stabalise.

From reading SD I see quite often posts about weight gain and weight loss. Some heavy drinkers seem to be underweight and needed to gain Then there are people like me who have let the weight creep on from excess eating and drinking and little or no exercise and want to lose. I just thought I would share a bit on my story and maybe get some other input/stories of weight loss/gain, goals, struggles and all that. I wonder how many of us have flung our scales out of the window in frustration at the dreaded plateau!

I had a seizure or something at the bar tonight and EMTs came to help. It happened when I was out with a work-buddy and I had my ONLY shot for the night. I suddenly started to feel a lot of pressure in my head that at first I thought was that buzz you‚Äôd get after not have a drink for a while, but it was really uncomfortable. It grew more intense and I was cold sweating bad. I told my buddy I may need to go and got up to pay my tab. When I got to the bar I started to see stars and my ears rang. Suddenly I couldn‚Äôt stand and was losing my balance. My whole body began vibrating and my brain literally felt like a paddleball going back and forth. Patrons lend me to a bench outside and 911. The Halloween party was so rough, my buddy didn‚Äôt even hear or see what was going on. I vomited and couldn‚Äôt breathe. I feared for my life. The EMTs arrived and helped shortly after. 

I had been binge drinking essentially for weeks now, essentially not going for more than 2 to 6 hours without booze. First in the morning, right after work, sneak drinks around family, and I‚Äôd drink to sleep. I knew it was bad but I couldn‚Äôt stop, until I decided to slow down a bit earlier this last week. I stopped with little difficulties, except craving and sweating and being anxious. Until my buddy wanted a drink tonight and I said ‚ÄúOne can‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt know the dangers of going cold turkey. I didn‚Äôt know something like this could happen. It was absolutely terrifying.

I started drinking moderately when I worked at a bar then after when I graduated college and landed my dream job. Then I began drinking heavy when that company tanked and I lost my job only to not find another. And I began drinking even MORE heavy when my wife left me. All of this in about 5-6 years. 

I once tried AA and it worked, then it didn‚Äôt and I started slowly drinking again and if escalated back to this state. It‚Äôs hurt my parents, whom I help care for. It‚Äôs hurt my friends who‚Äôd try to talk to me. It‚Äôs hurt my wallet, losing countless thousands of dollars. It‚Äôs hurt my work and I fear for losing my job. I was blind to it all.

Speaking of wallets, I‚Äôm worried of how to pay for this treatment and medical help, since I spent all my money on booze. I‚Äôve forgone bills recently, just to enjoy more alcohol. I literally can not afford this, but I need it or I‚Äôll die.

I can‚Äôt describe the number of times of shame, or recklessness, close calls, anxiety and depression, anger, all of it. It‚Äôs caused me digestive issues, and I‚Äôm likely diabetic too, and didn‚Äôt even know. I‚Äôm only 32.

I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm done. Done done done. I can‚Äôt afford to go further, because the next step is death. I‚Äôm going to die. I used to drink and get so depressed about my problems I DID want to die. Now I want life. MY LIFE. Pour it down to the drain. Bury it in the ground. Burn it. Whatever you do, get rid of it from your home. 

This was all a big mouth dump I‚Äôm sorry. I just don‚Äôt know what all to say so I said all I could. But I will say again I‚Äôm DONE. 

I don‚Äôt know what my next step is other than I will have some treatment folks talk to me soon at a nearby place.

I‚Äôm 26 years old this year I went self employed with my lawn mowing business (stressfull as sht). So yesterday was 2 weeks of alkohol free in about 5 years and what did I do? I fckd up. So how did this happen and what did I notice in this two weeks

First of all I didn‚Äôt have any withdrawal signs or big cravlings when I stopped drinking. What was my drinking habbit? Well I drank all weekend every weekend except sunday (sunday is for hangover). Maaaaaybe two or three beers during the week rarely geting shitfaced. 
Now when I stopped drinking for these two weeks I had more energy, I have noticed that mostly weekends  are for chill and recharching your batteries. Mondays were much more easier. I was way more concentrated and had more selfesteem. I was also way more hungry. And bored because I didn‚Äôt know what to do with my time and the clock moved so its already dark at 17:00. 

How did I fail yesterday? So I was working on rust on my 97 Jeep Cherokee (if anyone owns one he knows what I‚Äôm talking about). After three weeks of repairing it, it was finnaly done. So I took it for a test drive went to a petrol service to fill it up. Meanwhile grab a sixpack of beer and went to my friends who were already drunk. So I thought well one beer and thats it. It was two beers and I told him I need to go because I‚Äôm driving. Ob the way home I stopped at my fellow lawn mower to have a word and he had a mini party. So I drank there also two glasses of wine. Went home and as soon as I stepped in I saw on my girlfriends face the dissapoitment and I was a bit drunk so fuck it right and we went to her sisters. And what did she had a mini halloween party. So lets get shitfaced right? Stupid me. Wake up today thirsty, hangover,shit taste in my mouth, regreting yesterday...this feeling sucks.

I knew everyone would be drinking so I armed myself with a bottle of AF white wine. After about 20 mins of being there I stopped drinking the wine because it tasted nasty and I didn‚Äôt want to drink a whole bottle for no reason. 

This morning I‚Äôve gotten up early (as I do now) and I still have the wine taste in my mouth like I would if I was hungover. It was pretty alarming and a huge reminder that I don‚Äôt want to drink wine anymore!

I feel like this is a pretty big sobriety realisation that I actually don‚Äôt want to drink it anymore or go back to that lifestyle. I‚Äôm so happy it‚Äôs just a sour taste in my mouth and not a hangover üòÉ",6,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.561865508556366}"

2020-11-01 02:35:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jlyk95/dispense_with_the_toxic_positivity/,Dispense with the toxic positivity.,"# I'm about to get very angry.

 I sleep better. I'm industrious and capable. Okay?

And it's an entirely joyless, angry existence, a hole in the soul kind. And I can't even think back to what used to make me happy before I became an alcoholic, because the last time I wasn't an alcoholic I was an angry teenager some 15 years ago. Shit, I don't think I've ever been happy once I hit puberty. The first time I felt *happy* as someone with a brain more complex than that of a pre-teen was when I was hammered.

And I wish I wasn't expected to perform happiness with sobriety. I loathe these things I'm expected to say to myself to bury the bitterness of not being able to drink, and convince myself that I'm just so much better off.

Fuck this. Of course I'm not going to drink. The beauty of being me is knowing when something's become so untenable that maintaining it is simply not a possibility, it simply cannot exist anymore. I don't struggle with the act of staying sober at all. What I'm struggling with is seeing: how is this new reality of mine any better? It's just soul-killing in all the other ways, and it's insulting and disrespectful that there are people in my life and even in recovery communities who don't want to hear that sobriety can suck ass. Why's that? Is it because it forces them to confront something that they've tried to ignore and bury too?

I hate this. I just hate it a little bit less than I hate being an active alcoholic, but I am *not* going to pretend that I'm happier enough for it to actually matter. I'm just doing it out of existential fear (my last hangover was terrifying, I think I dipped my toe in delirium tremens there for a moment), and because of peer pressure.

Severe depression was better than this. At least back then I didn't have enough energy to stoke the resentment engine, I could simply exist with no emotions at all.

And I wish my friends and family would stop with the 'ur doing amazing baby girl I'm proud of you queen' shit. Fuck off. Acting like I'm some fragile little idiot with no self-esteem who needs to be handheld and fellated through this shit like it wasn't always not because I *couldn't* quit, but because I didn't want to quit. Outwardly I remain gracious because I've got manners and I know they're trying to be supportive in something they don't understand and don't want to deal with, but do anyway because it's what friends do? but inside I just want to shove a brick in their mouths and hope it hurts when they shit it out.

I don't know what I want. Not support. Maybe to imbibe experiences of others. To relate, not to be supported. I just want to be livid and burn until I'm coals. And maybe then, and only then, can I pick up those coals and draft something that resembles a life, even if the only colours I've got are grey, black and white.

1.5 months in. ""You can do this."" pffff I know I fucking can. I just *don't like this.* The first person to suggest therapy owes me 60‚Ç¨ which is the price of a 60 min therapy session here. The first person suggesting exercise owes me a brand new left ankle. The first person who suggests picking up a hobby owes me a 500 word reflection on why they chose to think that I've got none, and what it says about how they're perceiving alcoholics as a whole.

You know what's sad? When I was an active drinker, I was the most mellow, excitable, cheerful person. Someone once asked me to look into myself and find out what would make that happy, mellow person to come out again. I had an answer to that. It's fucking alcohol. It's alcohol suppressing my aggressive and pessimistic impulses. It's alcohol muting the absolute horseshit of my wired existence. That person has always been a projection of a chemically altered state, she's never been 'real'.

Something my SO once said about me being a kinder, more funny person when sober, and I'm here like homie you saw me when I was only 1-2 drinks in, you've never seen me sober and happy. Ever. The times you thought I was my meanest and most aloof? Sober. Stone cold sober.

I wish I felt joy tonight, but it was probably the most lame Halloween I‚Äôve had in many years. I couldn‚Äôt do most of my fun Halloween antics this year, because of COVID and because usually they involved drinking. 

Instead, some friends invited us over for a fire pit. I froze my ass off in the driveway, listening to the husbands debate politics for like 3 hours while the other wife was sitting there getting drunk, smoking, and whatever else. 

Husband kind of snapped at me in the car on the way home. It wasn‚Äôt awful or anything, but I laid down on the couch when we got home and cried.... while he texted people on his phone. 

Feels like even when I do everything right, it‚Äôs still not good enough.
