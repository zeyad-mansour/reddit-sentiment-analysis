What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life, see how our SD family is doing, and support each other. Share your good, your bad, and your ugly (or your pretty, or your future, or your funny, or whatever else is on your mind) with us below!

-----------------------------------------

**The Good:** I went to an estate sale when they were just closing up. The dealer obviously didn’t want to have to haul the unsold stuff away, so he sold me a beautiful set of four antique dining chairs for just $20.

**The Bad:** I have to do both my and my mother’s taxes. Ugh.

**The Insight of SD Sobernauts:** Recently, I read something on this sub that really struck me. Someone said that if we had to drink backwards, we wouldn’t do it. And it’s true. 

If someone said to me, “You will have to spend a complete day in total physical misery and acute anxiety, followed by eight hours of unconsciousness, followed by three or four hours of loss of control that isn’t even really all that fun—interspersed with complete blackout, during which you’ll probably do things that will embarrass you later—but then, after all that, you will get to enjoy a single hour of the merriment and great pleasure of being freshly intoxicated. Do you want to do it?” I’d have said no—even back in the day, when I loved to drink.",51,0

I did 31 days at the end of 2020 and felt much more upbeat overall. Was recognizing more positive changes to my appearance, weight, mood. This time though I'm finding myself in a very different place. Preoccupied with thoughts about life, death, existentialism, regret. Did I waste my youth drinking? Of course not, I met my significant other, have a successful career, friends, family, etc. But I can't shake these negative thoughts. Then I start fixating on death and illness and life being cut short. Did my drinking already do damage to me? What is the meaning of life anyway? I'm trying to find joy even in the mundane. I'm wondering if this is the latest way my mind is tricking me into drinking again. Right now I don't have the desire, but maybe my brain is trying to create the ultimate ""Fuck It"" scenario. Has anyone else experienced this? What helped it pass?",10,0

What I could Avoid in the next 10 years. Looking back at the last 10 years of my drinking life, there are so many bad choices Ive made and I put myself in so many dangerous situations that could have ended up incredibly different and tragic. To think that right now I could decided to stop drinking and prevent another 10, 20 or 30 years, etc. of bad drinking decisions from life is so powerful and liberating. 

&#x200B;

2. I have been sober a few different times, and honestly I enjoy it. The problem is I enjoy drinking too, and everytime I am sober I have the thought of how sad it would be to never be able to enjoy a  cold glass of rose in the summer again. 

But last night for the first time.I thought, really is that SO sad?  There are a million other things to do during the summer, that are beautiful, rewarding and enjoyable- isn't it more sad that when I think of summer- the first thing that comes to mind is rose? It really made me think about how alcohol has made my world so small. Alcohol is what I look forward to doing the most. Most of my life events can be characterized as follows- \*some celebratory event\*, me excited to drink and celebrate, me not remembering, me piecing together the ""celebration"" the next day. That is the way I travel as well- so excited to see a new place, so I can get there and drink. Its like i rarely participate in anything that doesn't involve alcohol and there is an entire world out there of activites and people that don't involve alcohol. It seems like once I commit to stop drinking, there is an entire world out there that I haven't engaged in bc i have been obsessed with margaritas/rose etc. I haven't even been living it seems, more just waiting until the next time I can drink.",27,0

For the umpteenth time.,"Well yesterday I was drinking because a friend wanted to have some beer because he just got a job. Everything was going great until I got a message that a friend of mine passed away just a few hours before. Drinking made me way more emotional than I would have liked in front of people and I kept trying to message people without sounding intoxicated. 

My friend who passed away didn't drink and he was a largely known activist. When I woke up I wasn't hungover but I was completely dehydrated and mentally in a bad place. What made me feel better was thinking I should try to stop drinking and become a better person overall. 

I practice acts of mutual aid between me and my friends already but I want to be genuine and not have people think I'll regret helping later because I had a few beers.

My friend wouldn't ever ask me to stop drinking but to just be myself. And obviously from all my posts on reddit I keep getting brought to this page. All I ever talk about to my spouse is that I hate that I can't quit drinking. And when I wake up he can tell that I regretted downing those beers. It puts me in my head and I hate it there because I'm not healed yet from a lot of shit.

I listen to everything rock metal country rap pop. My whole philosophy is every artist no matter who has at least one song I will like. Even mumble rappers. 

Today is approaching close to a year since my aunt passed away and since my grandfather went into hospice and my drinking reached epic proportions. 

I have been struggling all day I have a cold and my usual method for dealing with it was to make a hot toddy with 4 fingers of bourbon. So I have been fighting my urge a lot. 

Well I work 12 hour shifts and when my kids get home when my wife does from work my house is so noisy I put my noise cancelling earbuds in and just let Apple Music shuffle. 

I quit listening to Jason isbell awhile ago when he got all preachy on politics so I haven’t listened to his new album at all. Well a song off of it called “It Gets Easier” came on.  

It’s about drinking and giving it up if you haven’t listened to it check it out everything he says in it is so so true. It gave me that extra push I needed to fight off that craving and refocus. 

Music has done so much for me this past year. I wrote so many new songs just about my pain and struggles and today it kept me sober. I love how much I have grown as a musician now that every time I learn a song it’s not in a blackout and I remember it! IWNDWYT",10,0

Before he left this morning, he went out and bought 10 six-packs of craft beers I like and told me to enjoy them slowly for working so hard. He assumed I'd drink one beer every few days over 2-3 months :/ 

I hadn't told him of my decision to quit and he left pretty quickly after for a 10 hour drive home.

I used to think that financial pressures/work difficulties led me to drink. Worrying about how I was going to pay my next month's rent, worrying about my next month's paycheck (I've been in a commission-only job so it kind of naturally is more stressful since there is no steady paycheck.)  


Thankfully, I am no longer in that position where I will worry about short-term financial obligations.  I used to tell myself, that once I was in this position financially - where I wouldn't need to worry anymore, I would quit drinking for good.  


However, even though I don't worry about bills anymore - my mind is still racing, going in all sorts of directions, trying to make something else an excuse to worry about and to drink.  


I'm actually happy that I relapsed because it made me realize - that there probably isn't or wasn't a real or a main reason I've been drinking. Just my brain telling me that I basically needed it to function - making up excuses in my head as to why I need to drink.   


Being near people who drink casually made me justify my drinking as well. Of course, I end up drinking way more than them.  


Anyways, I know that for me at least, it takes daily effort.  Basically, prioritizing being & staying sober every day over everything.  Thankfully, I am in a good position where I can do that.

Like obviously if just seeing it makes me obsess about it, I definitely can't handle drinking one. I don't want to throw away my streak, either. I am determined to not drink a single drop of alcohol in 2021. I just wish I had never found this bottle. Maybe just venting about it will make me feel better.

I found them helpful but it was so unbelievably anxiety-inducing having to talk in front of everybody, even though people were SO beyond nice and supportive. Sometimes I would just sit and listen, but I found it more helpful for my sobriety when I would interact. I eventually stopped going because the anxiety was too exhausting, but now I've started attending online meetings. I've been forcing myself to speak up but it's extremely uncomfortable for me. Does anyone have a similar experience with this? Has anyone gotten over their social anxiety by continuing to go to meetings?

This afternoon It was sunny - for the first time in practically 6 months. I decided to bake some of the food from my home country and my partner asked a friend over and I got an alcohol free wine and we all sat in the sunshine, for the first maybe, 45mins I glamourised their drinking for split seconds here and there. We went after and had dinner at my father in laws house, and they continued to drink there only one person cared that I wasn't drinking, and made it slightly awkward for me (omfg why do they do that) It was a little awkward of a night just because we had a friend making shit jokes and its harder to fake laugh when you're stone cold sober. But I noticed that when I went to the bathroom, I thought, oh I look nice, and happy, and I'm not mad at myself or making funny faces or just numb and stupid. 

I'm quite sure my father in law thinks I'm pregnant because historically I don't turn down a wine. But I am very glad I did. I'm feeling good. 

I just fucking hate it when other people have to make you feel weird about it. Our friend that just couldn't stop making fun of my alcohol free wine for not being a 'grown ups drink' annoyed me.

I hit 4 years sober in January. I don't post often anymore - sobriety is just a part of my life now. But last night I got into a big fight with my SO and suddenly I felt a strange, familiar feeling. I felt like I was suddenly exposed as the unlovable, angry, cruel person that I keep hidden inside. I couldn't place why this felt so familiar - then I remembered that this is how I used to feel **all the time.** When I was hungover, I felt like I was just minutes away from someone calling me out for actually being an evil swamp hag - the swamp hag that I keep hidden deep down in the deepest recesses of myself.

I'm hoping to sort things out with my partner tonight. I'm reminding myself that even though I see myself as terrible, I don't see my SO this way, and I have to believe that he doesn't see me this way either. I just have to hope that he loves me as much as I love him - accepting the things you can't control and all that.

By the way - last night I seriously thought about getting just fuckin blasted. Four years later...sometimes it's still just one day at a time.

IWNDWYT - I promise.

&#x200B;

UPDATE - Thanks everyone for all the love! I knew I could find acceptance by posting here. You guys are as kind as I someday hope to be.

So I still haven't drank, but I started smoking weed regularly in October. I was slowly feeling more agitated a lot more easily than normal as time went by. Then I started smoking only after work and my edge was gone. 

Turns out I smoke like I drink, (trying to get as high as possible as quick as possible) so I had to put it down the other day. I know when you quit smoking there's some agitation and anger but I dont think it's the weed. I was smoking a little under a gram a day,(since I never smoked regularly my tolerance was still low) so I dont think it's that. People always describe me as laid back so Its not like I've been blind to the fact that I'm just some angry ass dude, but this agitation feels and builds up the exact same as it did before I started smoking.

My drinking started in high school and it was mostly because I became acquainted  with the ""wrong crowd"". Not as in we were out hurting people and things like that, but more-so the binge drinking and partying crowd. I became addicted very quickly and was also experimenting with other drugs. It got to the point where all I was doing was drinking, partying, and chasing women. Which in turn led to me falling behind in school, social anxiety, and my relationship with my family being severely damaged.

I fell deeper and deeper for years, then cut down, then had a couple of good sober streaks. Now I’m  happy to say that I’m hopefully done for good. Now I’m working to improve in all aspects of my life.

Life gets rough, sad, lonely, and confusing a lot of the time. But that’s part of the process. I'm turning 30 in a month and have a long way to go to get to where I envision myself, but I’m positive that sobriety is an important piece of the journey.

But, I'm familiar with how vivid dreams can be when you sober up. I've had plenty of dreams where I fight with my mom. I definitely wasn't prepared to wake up thinking that I had bought a bag of heroin. 

I've broken like eight bones, a few of which where serious, and I had gallstones/pancreatitis a few years ago; I've been injected with morphine, dilaudid, and fentanyl, tried codeine, vicodin, and percocet on my own, and honestly have no taste for what opiates do. I have no interest in heroin or any other painkiller recreationally whatsoever.

So imagine my terror at waking up, after going to bed triumphant that I had gone the day without drinking, and thinking that I had picked up a bag of heroin and really fucking enjoyed smoking it. Thinking I would have a new addiction to beat, and my life was just going to be a cycle of wasting time and money on drugs that do nothing for me.

Obviously, I only thought this during the nebulous moment between waking up and actually being awake, but it felt legitimately scary. It made me realize my thinking towards drugs (especially alcohol, duh) has definitely changed since reading TNM, and I'm infinitely grateful for that.

I've been reading this sub for quite some time now, and I think I've even posted a few times, but now I'm committed to coming here daily. I'm turning thirty in a month and a half, and I fully intend to go into this decade free from the self-imposed handcuffs of alcohol.

I never thought I would make this. This time was different though, a whole lot different. Someone on this community helped making it so much easier for me. So now I want to give back to the community. 

When I relapsed for about the 15th time at the end of last year, I started reading more stories from people on this community to start becoming inspired to quit again. I came across the [My Beloved Wife](https://amp.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/kalcjm/my_beloved_wife_long_post_but_i_need_to_get_this/)"" story posted by /u/grackleATX. That story hit hard. I recommend anyone to read this and maybe it will help you as it did me. 

grackleATX recommended the book ""This Naked Mind"" by Annie Grace. After reading his post, I instantly bought it. When it arrived in the mail, I was sceptical at first, mostly at myself. I haven't read a book cover to cover in like 10 years? But this book was different and had grackleATX' story attached in my mind. I read it fully in about a week (which I think is crazy for someone who hates reading)

My mindset since then has completely changed. I haven't had any trouble staying off booze since then and I have /u/grackleATX to thank for it. This post is a big thank you to him and this community. I owe you guys a lot. 

I highly recommend anyone who hasn't checked his post out, to do it asap and also recommend the book This Naked Mind as he did in his post. I won't say this is a ""fit all"" solution, but it helped me big time, so I know what kind of potential it holds.

Just looking for some advice. I have a such a bad problem with drinking. I get very strong cravings and when I start drinking I cannot stop. Last night a face-planted right through my boyfriend's table and smashed everything including our  drinks. He knows I have a problem and trusted me after promising him I would not f-up again. I'm at home crying and so disgusted with myself. I cannot afford to see a counselor. I promised to pay him back for the damage and I will but he's pissed and rightfully so. I want to quit more then ever. This is killing my relationship with a man I love very much. I have a lot of mental health issues and drinking was my crutch. How do you get through that?",9,0

It's not super common, but it happens every now and then. I think after the hurdle of the first few months had gone by, I was scared I would have dreams about drinking for the rest of my life. 

Despite these dreams, if someone was to ask me if I still struggle with the thought of drinking (you know, that obsession in your mind that doesn't leave you until you magically distract yourself or worse end up drinking), I can honestly say I do not. Drinking was a big part of my life for a long time. Before I got sober, it was basically my identity. In some way, shape, or form I will reflect on my drinking for the rest of my life. I'll always have a little regret about not getting sober sooner, wish I was able to avoid just a little bit of the pain I had to, but I'll also be forever grateful I was able to turn things around. 

""Those"" dreams SUCK. I know on a morning like this, I wish they didn't happen at all. But despite how real it might feel when I wake up out of them and realize I am still sober and it did not happen, I remember how much hard work I have put in to get where I am today, and how important it is to keep going. Thankfully, I'm still here and I'm still sober and it's not day 1 again. Because, tbh, fuck day one.",10,0

I am writing from a throwaway account because of how much shame I hold. I have not shared these thoughts with anybody in my personal life, and I hope maybe sharing them here will help me get some insight and clarity. I am a 20yr old woman living in the US.

I started drinking when I was 16. It was in the context of high school parties, pretty mild and I had a lot of control over the way I drank (except for when I met fireball- the first time I had an alcohol-induced vomit). My relationship to alcohol from that point was pretty neutral, I did not think I had a problem and drank very occasionally, mostly with my family and occasionally in a safe place like a friend's home. I found the line between drunk and blackout to be very thin, but liquor at this point was hard to obtain. Although my parents never punished me for drinking, it was rare that they would supply me with alcohol. 

When I was 19 I moved out of a shitty situation with my parents (unprovoked by drinking), and stupidly moved in with a boyfriend I had been seeing for 3 months. It was a really stupid decision in retrospect- he turned out to be extremely manipulative, emotionally and sexually abusive- but it was still a better place (in my mind) than with my parents. That relationship lasted for maybe 8 months. When I broke up with him, he still wanted me to live there (and maintain sexual relations). In retrospect, this is another manipulation tactic, but it took me talking to his roommates to understand this. When I talked to them about my experience with him- the cheating, the black eyes that weren't exactly accidents, the times he had sex with me when I was blacked out, and the money he stole from me, they were extremely disturbed that they didn't see this going on and urged me to find a new place to live. When my ex-boyfriend found this out, the abuse got turned to his roommates and they also decided to move out. We ended up finding a temporary living situation in an AirBnB until we found more permanent housing. This is when my heavy drinking started.

I grew so close to these two and I still consider them to be my dear friends who helped me process a really difficult time. They tell me that they did not know me until I broke up with him- I was only a shell of a being. And they were right. But it was so hard to think about myself as a victim. I wish I had gone to therapy, to talk it through while it was happening, but I didn't. I drank. I drank a lot. The act of drinking bonded me and my two new friends together so much. I knew they had my back, and I had theirs. I ended up falling for one of them, and we started dating 3 months after I had broken up with my ex. When my ex found this out, it restarted the abuse- and somehow everything he had ever done to me did not matter anymore because I moved on. I received text messages, calls, LETTERS (the scariest because it let me know he had my address), he contacted my friends who knew nothing about the situation and began to twist the story into being a story about me cheating. I hold a lot of guilt about how I met my boyfriend because he was roommates with my ex, but when I think about what he has done to me and openly admitted to doing to others... the guilt fades away.

There are so many times when I wish somebody told me that my drinking was a problem. I did not see it then, but I know that others did. Sometimes I would get drunk and reveal intimate secrets about my partner. Other times I would make a fool out of myself and pass out before 9:00. Once, I even tried to pee on a stool in the kitchen and had to be carried to the toilet. I went to work every single day hungover, leaving to vomit or dry heave every 20 minutes. The drinking only got worse when the pandemic started and suddenly I had no responsibility at all. It felt like heaven- spending time with my lovely new boyfriend and starting to drink at 10 am. I ate only when it was convenient for me, but drinking was never inconvenient. I lived through the whole pandemic drunk. When I was not drunk, I was hungover in bed until 5:00 because I only drank shitty $10 plastic bottles of liquor. The drinking caused a lot of strain on my relationship- I felt as though my boyfriend only knew me when I was drunk, which encouraged my cycle of drinking. I have never acted violently when drunk, but I have a lot less control over my emotions. When normal tensions came up in our relationship, I would solve them by drinking and having an emotional outburst (and he would drink too, but he could handle alcohol better than me). 

I ended up deciding that living apart from my boyfriend would be the healthiest for both of us, and although it was hard at first, it helped with my drinking greatly. I reduced my drinking to mostly only with friends, but would still blackout. One time, I was meeting my friends boyfriend and we took a 'few' shots. I then decided after \~7 shots that I wanted to walk over to my boyfriends house (about 2 miles) completely black out. He told me when I got there, I passed out in his bed immediately. I feel lucky and safe knowing that my boyfriend takes care of me, but the next day when I read my texts to him while I was walking over I felt eerie. This is the first time I feel like I escaped death- the texts were completely incoherent. I'll quote one: ""So hungry and rrunk i won tlwtm my slday gets ye"". I thank whoever was protecting me that day from getting hit by a car or abducted. And I thank my boyfriend endlessly for his caring patience through my uncontrollable addiction. 

The last time I got drunk was 32 days ago. A friend finished work early and invited me over for some seltzers. We each drank six, and somewhere through the night I decided to contact a person who sexually assaulted my sister. I think my plan was to 'lure' him to where I live so that I could kill him. I did not end up killing him, but I told him that I know what he did and if I ever see him I will curb stomp his brains out. These are not normal thoughts for me and I can still feel the essence of rage I felt that night. This was a serious wake-up call for me. Not only did I completely betray my sister's trust in me by contacting a person she confided in me about- I also completely embarrassed myself around my friends and my boyfriend. I woke up the next day feeling suicidal and confessed to my sister what I did. She was very upset (rightfully so), and although I wasn't trying to hurt her, I did. I wanted to hide under a rock for the rest of my life. The shame and guilt from that night followed me for weeks. I am trying to be gentle with myself and understand that I would have never done that in a sober state. The alcohol took my strong, hurt feelings and manifested them in a way that hurt me and those around me. This is the day that told me that it's time to wake the fuck up. Blacking out isn't cute or fun. I cannot even imagine the damage I have done to my body over the last year alone. My body has been good to me and I have treated it badly. Alcohol turns me into someone that I AM NOT. If I could meet myself when I was drunk I would hate her. I would hate how obnoxious and loud she is. I would hate the way she talks over other people and how she inserts herself into every conversation. I HATE who I am when I am drunk, and I am the only person who can stop that person. 

I am turning 21 in a month. I feel nervous, although since we are still in a pandemic I do not feel too much pressure to drink. My hardest struggles with drinking come when I am around my family (my whole family jokes about how we have to be drunk to tolerate each other- and it's not really a joke), and 'casual drinking' does not exist to me. Every time I grab a new drink I am already thinking about the next. 

I wanted to share my story here because I lurk here often and do not see many people who are not of legal age yet. I also fear sharing these thoughts and feelings with people who do not have a similar experience with alcohol. I hope this is the first step to processing the relationship I have with alcohol. It is hard for me to call myself an alcoholic, but there is no other way to put it. Alcohol inhibits my ability to grow as a person. Thank you if you read this all, and thank you if you have any words to share with me. I appreciate this community so much. IWNDWYT.",7,3

I met ""him"" when I was young and we got along very well from the start. He made me laugh, he made me feel sexy and fun, I'd forget about my problems and worries when I was hanging out with him.
Then a few years later he hurt me for the first time. I cried and cried and swore I wouldn't never go back to him. But he showed his nice side again, tempted me and we reconciled. We had many other more fun nights until he hurt me again. And again I swore that it was the last time.
And the vicious circle continued for 15 years. I could leave him for a little while, or a long while, but would forget about his lies and betrayal, I would forget he made me behave in ways that would make me lose my self esteem even more each time. I was ashamed to get back with him, couldn't really admit to my friends and family that our relationship was dysfunctional and that he was hurting me so bad. Sometimes he would call and I wouldn't pick up, I could feel re empowered for a little while, but always would end up relapsing into his comforting arms... Thinking this time would be different, hoping that we had such a connection that he wouldn't hurt me anymore....
The good times were shorter and shorter. He hurt me more and more. I had bruises, lost my self esteem, but always hoping it would go back to where it started the fun times, the confidence, the feeling good. But good times were rarer and rarer. Pain and shame were constant. But I loved him, couldn't imagine my life without him. And each times he called, he promised this time will be different. And I believed him. And now he's hurting me everyday.

I'm writing this at the past tense but it's just day 3. I've done very shitty things in the past year, shittier than the year before, where I already had done shittier things than the year before... Last weekend was a bad bad bad relapse after a week sober. I've reached hell I think. So Monday Day 1 I was shaking again, so ashamed again, the guilt was overwhelming, most of you would do what I'm talking about... Tuesday Day 2 I felt more normal, and started thinking about calling my ex abusive partner. On day 2. Already.

On Dec 20 i was ready to put it all down after some time of questioning what i was doing, the example i was setting to my family and the lack of ""personal profit"" i was getting out of the alcohol. So i  poured 2 trays of beer down the drain and switched to fizzy/bubbly/seltzer water **(SODASTREAM <3)**.  

I don't want to say it was easy but it was also not hard because i had a healthy replacement and i was truly ready to lay down the drinks. 

Prior to this i was drinking about 2/3 pints a night for about 7 years straight ever since i quit smoking which doesn't sound like a lot but it def screws with the notion of sleep and memory. During these 100 days **i have notice a good improvement on the memory, i am able to dream and feeling more cheerful in general!**

Plus this Subreddit has helped me a lot just by being able to talk about it while it is far more difficult to open up to friends and family.

my usual ritual since i started meeting with him (even before i was a full blown alcoholic) was to have a couple shots before going. it made my sessions more effective i thought. back then i was able to do those shots, do the session and that's it. now once i have those first couple drinks i just keep going.

today is just not a good day to start and i really want a drink right now it's 1030am, around the time i usually start my 12-15 drink a day habit. i don't plan on having more than 10 today.

the reason i am confident that the end is near is because the main reason i started drinking again 5 weeks ago was because my girlfriend and i had broken up.

i would drink because i couldn't stop thinking about all the ways i hurt her and all the ways i could have been better to her. i couldn't stop thinking about all the times i was an asshole to her...

but then it hit me... she also could have been better to me. she was a shitty girlfriend sometimes too. she was a bitch sometimes too. she didn't appreciate me sometimes too. 

i drank because i missed her so much, and when i drink i would dwell on her even more. but now i can't figure out what i'm missing so much. sure i still miss our memories we had great times but we fought every damn week too. about everything! by in june and july it was every few weeks, by august it was once a week.

the relationship ruined my mental health so much and actually drove me to drink and i want to stop and i WILL because i'm actually in a better state of mind now than i was when i was with her and i know damn well she isn't around destroying herself with alcohol so why the hell am i? the booze doesn't even make me feel better anymore it just makes me feel worse because i know i'm just wasting time when i could be using these days to better myself.",1,0

I'm sitting at work right now, nodding off and trying to drink as much coffee as I can. What's bad is if I drank a beer, and I don't really know why, I'd get a boost of energy. I'd feel so much better. I'd still suck at my job but let's be real, maybe I just suck.

And that's kinda where I'm at. A few days sober, realizing how much I just suck. I don't get out of bed if I don't have to. I know I'm depressed and continually pass up opportunities to get help. I don't go out with friends anymore, in fact I just recently pushed them away a little. I just sit at home, loathe in self hatred, and wonder why things aren't changing. 

I sent here and wonder why I can't find a job I like? Well maybe it's because my dumb self won't get up and apply for anything that isn't a ""1-click apply"" on ziprecruiter. Why do I keep gaining so much weight? Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I don't get up and do anything ever. Why am I so stressed all the time? Maybe it's because I know all these issues and do little to change them. 

The only thing I know to do is quit drinking. I'm making progress.. I've been trying to quit for about 2 year. My best so far is 8 days. I know I'm suppose to ""be kind to myself,"" but I'm really starting to lose patience with myself. And I think for pretty understandable reasons. I keep making the same mistake that leads me into these states of mind that further dig the hole of all the problems I've self inflicted. 

You know, before I started drinking I was fit, sharp as a needle, smart as hell, motivated enough to get stuff done, always 15 minutes early, and a whole host of other good qualities. Now I'm the opposite, and the worst part is I know it. I know these things, and yet 2 years later and I'm still dealing with the same dumb stuff.

I am about 50 pounds from where I want to be and as a very heavy drinker have always found the concept of these ""empty"" calories as a tad bit ironic.  For being ""empty"" they sure as hell help you pack on the pounds!

I hated him deeply for that and I still do. He never let me just be myself. My father is a classically stoic male who believes emotional vulnerability is contraband. My mother I’m almost 99% sure has borderline personality disorder, she is always playing victim and flies into temper tantrums that last for weeks over minor things that she perceives as personal attacks. They both have no friends, no social life, just each other. I feel I’ve been walking on eggshells my entire life. A therapist would have a fucking field day with me and my parents. 

You probably might be thinking that this post is about blaming them for my problems but you’d be wrong. I have plenty of responsibility to take because ultimately our lives are in our own hands. So here I am, sharing all of this shit with an anonymous sobriety forum on the internet, because I have no one else. On Thursday of this week I will be 4 months clean from weed and 6 weeks sober from booze and I will never have anyone to share my success with outside of you fine strangers. My interactions with my parents are huge triggers to use. I wish I could cut them out of my life completely and never look back. They raised me but they never nurtured me. I wish I could do it but I can’t because somehow these heartless people raised someone who ended up with peace and love in their heart.

I guess that’s it for now. I had kind of a rough weekend that brought up these feelings. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Stay strong and IWNDWYT.",24,0

I had been feeling tired, anxious, and I was gaining weight. I had a feeling this was a contribution to those issues. I was a *heavy* drinker. 1-4 drinks per night, every night if not more. The last few nights I did drink before quitting, I took a bottle & a half of wine to the face. It was so easy too! I think a combination of factors like this one made me pause and re-evaluate my decisions. I have been now sober for 30 days and honestly, I really never want to go back. I took a sip of some non-acholic beer my husband brought home (he's also committing to stopping alcohol) and it was so gross (to me). Beer is my #1 love. I could take down more pilsners than you might imagine in a single sitting, given the right circumstances. I was out of control and am *so* glad for this community. Reading about your experiences inspired loads of motivation within me for which I feel like otherwise I would not have been able to muster. I truly appreciate it.

On Good Friday I will turn 30. I honestly haven't given it much consideration, as it will mostly be just something I write or occasionally tell someone, but I was stricken with a great realization this morning.

My 20s were a lot of fun! I probably only regret about 7 days of the whole lot. XD While I would go here and do that.. it seemed every day was similar, mentally. I was stagnant with little drive and just enough cash. Sure had a good buzz goin' though. The journey of murdering the muck man began in 2017, and while this is the longest streak I've had, there have been SO many non-drinking days in between any 'hiccups.' 

2020 was a surprise year for us all. I don't wish to undermine anyone's troubles, but for me it has been revolutionary. I started it with getting lots of work done on my teeth, leaving me pain-free and more confident. When I realized how much money I was saving I sold my old beater and bought my first nice car, getting exactly what I wanted. I'd wanted a bee hive for years, and in June finally got one! I went on a solo trip in it to the Badlands (from IN) and while I was out that way decided to go to Yellowstone. When I got back, my best friend and I (of 10 years) started our own cleaning business. That was in September. 3 weeks ago we had our most profitable week! We are far from rich, but enough for doing what we enjoy.

I'm so grateful to myself for having the guts and strength to get out of the 9 year loop I was stuck in, and ending my toxic relationship with alcohol. I feel free and hopeful. Yay to turning 30! IWNDWYT!",15,0

Contrast that with drinking the last five days straight, and I feel terrible.","It's no kidding that drinking 'gives to you' in the beginning. And by that I mean only for the first day or two, maybe a few days tops. I am realizing now that when I start drinking after weeks sober: I look forward to drinking at night. I feel good all day because I haven't drank in so long (duh). When I drink, it is initially fun. As the days of continuous drinking go by, my wellbeing declines. I feel worse during the day. Instead of being happy and looking forward to drinking at night, I start to crave it and depend on it. It starts to get a grip on *me*. The amount of good things the drinking gives decreases and the cons increase. Instead of being conked out most of the night, I wake up multiple times to go to the bathroom. I have trouble falling back to sleep. At those early hours of laying in bed I realize drinking has become its own energy force. A dark energy. 

My mom stayed at my house this week to visit me. That's why I drank again, to celebrate her being here. Now I'm realizing I simply cannot drink. I don't want to drink. Most of the successful people I admire in life don't drink and in fact they condemn it. If I could drink and get drunk once in a month and stop, I probably would. Drinking traps most of us instead. 

I'm realizing now that I found a few things that I wanted to achieve that kept me from drinking. I need to continue to focus on those things. Each time I have a craving for alcohol, I can remind myself that I absolutely will not achieve those things or at least not to the degree that I could without drinking. 

One of those goals is to heal my back. I saw my physical therapist yesterday who specializes in the Mckenzie diagnostic method. In my case, I'm seeing him for disc issues. To relate to everyone reading this, I sat in front of him hungover yesterday. My back problem has lasted for years and been hard to treat. This was the first time seeing this particular PT. He was optimistic about treating my condition, but stated that for me to heal completely would require me to take a holistic approach to overall health. Yet as I sat in front of him, I was hungover from about nine 'Natural Ice's'. Actually, straying so far from sober in the last week and sitting in front of my PT super hungover is motivation to me. Honestly, nothing feels as good as being sober. 

As I hit 31 in January, I'm realizing more and more how right Carol Dweck is. Life is not about arriving and being perfect. The people I admire most in life had to work and practice for years to get where they are. Some people can give up drinking once and for all at the drop of a hat. Maybe this will be that time for me. But for others, it takes practice. The fact that we are here, reading this or posting here indicates our devotion toward a healthy lifestyle. 

Once I hit about three weeks or a month sober, along with daily yoga at my local studio, I feel like I'm on a natural drug. I can't wait to get back to sober.

The 1 thing I ABSOLUTELY need to do today is to Breathe.  I am responsible for this first, my sobriety second and finally I can add in the duties of my workday, family needs, pets, etc.

So many times I thought “ I NEED A DRINK”. Well I did!  I took on the weight of the world worrying about everything in my life all at once.  I would make it 10 days sober then worry would creep in and I’d “NEED A DRINK”.   Then 3 days sober.   Then oh wow 1 month sober! ...oh crap.  “Why isn’t this working?”  Rinse and repeat

Well today is a record of sobriety for me!  Everyday is!   I’ve been trying to get sober for 3 years and every time a horrible stressful day would come my way I would forget to breathe and pull my hair out with worry and by the end of the day. “AAAAHHHHH.   F IT!!!  I need a fucking drink!?!?!?!   Aaahhh.......  breathe 🧘. Breathe 🧘‍♂️ .....no.  I don’t I just need to breathe.

The universe will worry about itself.  The sky is not falling...I am just not breathing and trusting that it will all work out.

TLDR.  Find a quiet space and take 10 deep breathes.  Feel each one energize your blood with a little more oxygen than the last.  At ten breathe the deepest and remember that you can do this!  You’re not alone!   We will breathe another sober breathe and it will be amazing!   IWNDWYT ☮️",25,0
107,2021-03-30 09:28:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mgg150/tired_of_myself/,Tired of myself,"  

I am so tired of my own bullshit at this point. I realise how often I lie to myself, it’s just so boring now. I always have a reason. My mum died a year ago, that’s been my excuse for the past 12 months, seems reasonable, but if I investigate the excuse with any shred of rigour then it quickly falls to bits. Before that I was working away in London for most of the week, so that was my excuse then. Before that my kids were young and I was permanently knackered, that was my excuse then. Before that my job was stressful, good excuse. Before that I was just socialising. It’s so boring. 

And what’s worse is my mum died through her addiction, not alcohol, but the incessant wear on her body as well as what she took that night is what killed her. It was sudden and a shock, she was good at keeping things on the quiet, as am I. The parallels should be obvious, but I don’t let anything knock me off course and keep me away from drinking. 

This must be my third or fourth account now over the past 7 or 8 years. I can’t remember my usernames as they were always a randomly chosen mash of letters. All those times with an introductory post just like this, then a few days and even weeks of checking in, and then I disappear and fall back into the hole.

I’m nearing 40, I have two young kids and a long suffering SO. My drinking is regular and has took a heavy toll on my body and spirit. I’m so good at keeping things just below the level of really blowing my life up, such an expert on taking things right to the edge but no further. I can drink exactly the right amount where I don’t tip over into massively visible drunkenness. I drink just frequently enough that I just about meet the bare minimum for my job and for my role as a partner and father. Honestly, the efforts to walk this tightrope, the skill of it, if I’d have put half as much effort into any other pursuit I could have really got somewhere. And I’m so tired of it now. The mental and physical effort. 

So, I’m back again. I’ll take this one day at a time, but I want to keep an eye on the bigger picture. My personality is too much ‘all or nothing’, it’s ridiculous. One slip up and that will be me gone for the next two years. I want to recognise that I will make mistakes, I will slip up, just the odds and my past experience says that, so rather than tearing everything down I want to recognise my progress, not be so concerned about racking up streaks but rather with my overall trajectory and number of days sober over time. And I need to watch myself, because this could be one of my other bullshit excuses, a reason to fall off, to do the minimum again. But I’m not going to do that, I want to be sober each day, but I want to be realistic and protect myself from using the excuse of a mistake to burn down the whole house. 

I’m really fed up with myself, and this feeling alone is part of the drink. I know how good it feels to wake up sober, to not feel that rising guilt and shame, how good it feels to do things properly with the kids rather than rushing through them to get to a drink, how freeing it is to not have to juggle so many lies, always checking and triple checking myself. So much effort, so much wasted effort that has only served to damage me mentally, physically and spiritually, that has impacted negatively on my relationships. 

So I am here again and I will not drink with you all today.",4,0

And I Took That Personally.,"In the early days of my sobriety, it felt as if I was walking on shaky legs throughout aspects of daily life without alcohol as my crutch/reward. I posted a comment about how proud I was for making it to 90 days. I got some great encouragement and then a comment that I probably mis-read/mis-interpreted – it went something like, *“that’s great you made it to 90 days – did you know that only 1 out of 20 people who give up drinking make it to 90 days?* *Out of the people who made it to 90 days, only 1 out of 20 will make it to two years*?”

This took a fair bit of wind of my sails and while it was probably meant to be encouraging, I saw it as, *man, if 400 people decide to stop drinking, then only one will still be sober at the end of 2 years?  That can't be true.  Was this person implying I’m not going to make it? I’ll show them how I can crush this!* I stewed on this a while and then became determined to make it to two years. I found this newfound chip on my shoulder empowering and it gave me long-lasting confidence.

I recognize it’s often not the best thing in life to have a chip on one’s shoulder, but for me, I think I needed it in the early days.

I've never thought I do because it has not hampered my work or such but it's still clear to me that whenever I do drink, I don't entirely handle it, I do stupid stuff, and I don't like the kind of person I am under the influence. I usually feel terrible and lack motivation to do anything and feel something of a nothingness for several days after I've drank a lot.

I used to drink way more heavily when I was younger and as I've matured I've thought I can do it in moderation. Maybe I can on a Wednesday night but if it's Friday, then the ""oh just two"" becomes as many as I can down until everyone goes home and I'm usually the last one wanting to go just one more pub or whatever. I've found that much like with my smoking, the idea of moderation was just a weird way of lying to myself because the idea of an alcohol problem I had was something much more dramatic than I was observing in my own life.

During the last year or so my drinking has been down considerably anyways For Obvious Reasons and I haven't been to pubs or such and I've found I don't miss them either. I still sometimes have drunk with small groups of friends. How it's gone in most of these situations is that I've intended to drink just a few and then it spirals out of control and I'm completely wasted. Last weekend I met with a friend and intended to just drink a few but at some point a bottle of vodka appeared and it all ended up escalating. I took the bicycle home which was so unbelievably stupid of me. Something really bad could've happened.

I just wanted to write these feelings out here because I feel alcohol has always been a force of more bad than good in my life and I want to get rid of it. I don't want to make any kind of grand declaration about this on social media or whatever but still felt like I want to write this out so you all good people will have to do for that.

This is my first post and maybe my thoughts can resonate with some of you. 

I (33f, sober 134d) come from a country where alcohol plays an important cultural role (Germany). Anyways my alcoholic career was pretty ‘normal’ compared to others. Teenage drinking, party drinking, adult accepted drinking, childless working: so more drinking with the occasional too much. 
And the too much happened more and more. 
So I toned it down and then it got worse again and because I was ashamed I tried to quit last March. Tried to quit meant give up alcohol. Missing it dearly, feeling disadvantaged (why can the others drink normal?!?, can I still go to a bar, what if I am boring now?!?). Needless to say that only lasted for three months. I started drinking again but paranoid: can I drink this one beer or two? What will happen? Will I lose control again? 
This wasn’t much fun and it got progressively worse (drinking more than one day) until I hit my rock bottom in November. I was convinced that something is fundamentally wrong with me since I am the only one I know who has this drinking problem. So I went to AA and they helped me immensely in quitting. 

But it didn’t feel right for me. I don’t wanna fear alcohol lurking around the corner waiting to ruin my life again. I don’t want to be this helpless victim having to avoid it at all cost or else...

After a couple of weeks my mental health improved immensely (gone was the guilt and shame) and the not drinking became the default modus.
While being sober I started to realise: I am not a bad or weak or whatever person who is hopelessly addicted to alcohol for the rest of her life. I was promised cool shit by the alcohol industry if I drank and -what a surprise- got addicted to an addictive substance. We are surrounded by alcohol and its promises and all the cool justifications (day drinking, mommy wine culture, going out, having a meal). I was taught that alcohol is a part of all of these things and at the same time it can help me with a stressful day, and when I need to celebrate. 

What I’m trying so say is: many of us were tricked into drinking and then getting addicted to an addictive substance. Nothing more nothing less. We are not bad or weak people.",32,0

My older brother is the same way. They glorify alcohol use, yet belittle weed, and weed users.  

I hoenstly think they're mentally retarded and they can really piss me off at times but weed has been legal here in Canada for about 3 or 4 years now, many American States have been following suit.  

When I come down from weed, I usually am in bed within a few hours. When I come down from an alcohol 5-7 beers later I have emotional disregulation episodes where I can't properly channel negative energy/emotions (fuck this, fuck that, fuck everything mentality) I have a great first few hours while drinking, once I stop drinking/start coming back down, all of the sudden a Dr. Jeckle/Mr. Hyde switch is thrown and want to hurt/fight people. Weed makes me want to be everyone's friend and be overly positive even though the world around us isn't always the grestest.

Weed is not perfect, if I smoke in the morning their goes my day... But drinking is just as bad/if not worse.

Does anyone ever go through that cycle of feeling really wretched on Day 1 and swearing you need to make a change, then by a couple of days later you are embarrassed because you feel like you overreacted and your issues really aren’t that bad? 

This is like my seventh attempt (at this point it feels more like I build up, drink too much for a few weeks, say I’m going to stop, go dry for a month or so, then have a few beers one day and the cycle continues).

I think I just can’t shake that feeling that I just have a bad habit that I need to exercise more self control over than a full blown addiction (like, I never drink in the mornings for example). It feels almost like my problem is boredom drinking and binge drinking. Like maybe with some hobbies and just a bit more discipline I could be okay.

As some of you might know a couple of days ago I reached out to a friend who is a GP for help. I did that when I was super hungover and had made an ass of myself the previous night. 

They messaged me again today to check in - and I confess I’m just embarrassed that I contacted them and that they now think I’m a terrible alcoholic. I’m embarrassed that I’ve kinda “outed myself” and that they’ll think of me differently. A couple of other friends that I spoke to have already (in a kind way) made references to me having soda water etc when we next catch up and I guess it makes me feel almost childlike and resentful - like they get to sit at the adults table but I am some kid that needs protected.

I guess I’m just looking for people’s thoughts on the above generally, but also how you deal with feeling like an outlier compared to others.

Sorry bit of a ramble but I’m just freaking out that I’ve made a big mistake by telling others when it might not actually be so bad in the first place, and the idea of never drinking again seems silly and an overreaction now.

The whole nine freaking yards.,"I can't wait to sleep well again. It's been a week. I've taken 5htp one night, melatonin, basically every over the counter sleep or relaxation aid and nothing work honestly. 

I did end up getting a few hours of sleep though. 

Is it bad that I want to quit this job already I just started a month ago? Probably. I know if I do though it'll just be daily drinking again with no way to distract me or otherwise be occupied. 

Spoke with my mom for a while last night about things. I agree with what she had to say, which is that I need to get out of the house and stop being such a hermit. Tough sell though, but I do agree. Might try to get myself up and go for a walk today after work, we'll see. 

I always just get to the moment I'm about to leave and then decide not to, for whatever reason. 

Anyways, another day sober. Extremely irritable today, but I guess that's to be expected. Really just wanna lay down but I can't do that until my lunch. IWNDWYT",14,0

It's like there's something sneaky about alcohol where it can suppress your own assessment of how excessive your drinking may be.  So, as you're slowly drinking more and more, it's simultaneously silencing the alarm bells that should be going off, distorting your picture of what's really happening.

I'm pretty spooked by this realization.  Is this a phenomenon others have experienced?  Is it part of how a dependency can begin to take hold before you're even aware of it?",17,0

I don't know what to do at my end,"I was living with my brother and his fiancee and was paying rent and lending them money as neither of them worked (I'm talking hundreds of dollars) plus paying extra rent that should have been 3 way. They had a friend staying at theirs and I let her stay in my room while I stayed at my parents (both alcoholics) and was helping with their business and my little siblings. 

I fucked up because I got drunk at my parents and was having a good time, chilling and listening to music on my earphones however my mum came and yelled at me because I was still up on a weekend and told me to go to bed. I wasn't being loud, decided I wanted to go back to my room at my brothers and stupidly thought because I pay rent that I have access to the place I pay for. I had my key however didn't have access to the swipe downstairs, I jumped the fence and they had locked the screen door (which I only have access to the main door). I tried calling my brother and his fiancee and eventually my brother answered his phone and said where am I. I told him I was at the front and he was like 'you need to move out by 4pm tomorrow'. When I came in and was going to my room he came at me and started screaming at me to get the fuck out and kept yelling that. I told him that I paid rent there and at this is my room. He said I do not pay rent and I need to get the fuck out and was coming up to me aggressively and I went up to him like 'are you going to hit me?' because I was genuinely scared and he was being extremely aggressive and swearing at me. He pushed me really hard into the room once his fiancee pulled him back and said calm down. He then locked me in the room where I was unconditionally crying and had to call lifeline because I had had enough. 

Fast forward to today, my brother is holding my stuff ransom saying I need to pay him additional rent... because he and his fiancee feel like it is 'fair' even though I do not owe them any money. They owe me hundreds of dollars. He is telling my family I owe him 3 weeks rent and was screaming around which wasn't true, I may have been drunk however I remember everything extremely clear. He is saying how disgusting my behaviour was and how I need to look at myself and just completely deflecting. He is telling my mum to stay out of it and don't get involved while he lies, has threatened me if I don't give him money and holding my belongings ransom. 

I cannot believe the situation I am in. How quickly it went from having a somewhat stable home (my brother is emotionally and mentally somewhat unstable and fiancee is his enabler) and on good terms with my family to my mum absolutely drunk and losing her shit because she's an alcoholic and mentally unstable as well and blaming everyone else. She is telling me how disgusting I am and how I make so much money but where does it all go. Which is go to helping out the rest of my family who are all mentally unstable. 

Sorry team, I haven't drank in 4 days, I had half a glass of red wine tonight and decided to pour it down the drain. Alcohol is not the answer especially when mental illness runs deep in my family, including myself. 

I don't know what to do anymore, my mum always threats to kill herself when she's this drunk and talks about leaving and telling me how much of a failure I am and everyone else and how there is something severely wrong with me and how come I cannot get my shit together and stop blaming everyone else. 

I am not blaming everyone else, I know I have fucked up on parts and I am where because of my actions however I have been taken advantage of and treated like shit by my family over and over again to a point where it's like I have no worth. 

Thank you to whoever is reading this and if you have any advice or been in a similar situation. I genuinely feel worthless and just want to give up. 

Side note: I feel nothing at the moment but am glad I didn't drink a bottle and only had a few sips of Shiraz and poured it down the drain.",13,0

I work all by myself, driving a car around and running accounts and whatnot. I could feel it building up all night long as I sat there in the car feeling more and more miserable. My stomach went through all three visual trimesters of a birth (and I'm a male!), before it started going down. Now I'm home and relaxing in bed after eating some Tums. 

Why is it a good problem? Because I know exactly what happened and how to fix it, and it wasn't because of alcohol! Once this passes I'll be feeling just fine again, not having to worry about what I did last night, who I texted, or what pointless argument I got into with someone online. I also won't have to worry about feeling hungover, ashamed, sick all over again after throwing all of it up the night before anyway.

I'll take a night of indigestion over the horror of what I would have faced had I been drinking. Plus I earned money from being well enough still to work at my job instead of calling in sick and not earning anything and wasting my money on something that made me feel miserable in the first place.

It is about everything so I am hoping to take a holistic approach to well being as I continue.

The one thing I will share however is that I am slowly getting back into music. Alcohol robbed me of music. When I was drinking I only listened to music as a means of controlling my mood in a way that suited more drinking. I barely discovered new stuff and the new stuff I did find was similar to the stuff I was already listening as I always wanted to ‘feel’ a certain way. When I stopped one of my early thoughts were - how will I listen to music sober? It just happened over the last few weeks and without even trying I am now listening to new (to me) stuff and really enjoying music again. It’s been great as it is another outlet and thing to do that can fill in the time I would otherwise have wasted on alcohol.

Just wanting to write it out for my own sanity.,"Hey y'all. I felt like I needed to write everything down in order to clear my head and to remind myself why I am doing this. First, some background. I am a young wineseller living in Germany. My wife and I separated a little over six months ago. My problem with alcohol started a few years ago, when my ex-wife told me she liked me better when I was drunk. Instead of seeing that as the major red flag that it was, I happily obliged. When I am drunk I feel more confident, I am funnier, etc. You all know the typical excuses. This last year I realized I was severely unhappy in that relationship and decided to end it. 

I don't know if I can honestly say that I left my wife for this other woman, a coworker, we'll call her Lisa, but our relationship started pretty much immediately after my wife left back to the US. Lisa was also coming out of a long-term relationship and her ex is a severe alcoholic. She told me from the beginning that that is the one thing she cannot tolerate and she promised herself that she would never be in such a relationship again. 

Well, last Saturday was her last day at work and we all went out to send her off. I was coming off of a fourteen hour shift and hadn't eaten anything all day. I didn't intend to get totally wasted, but I did. And now that relationship is over. I lost what I believe to be the best thing that has ever happened to me because of my love for alcohol. This is my motivation to become sober. It was a problem with my ex-wife, and I lost Lisa because of it. I can't allow that to happen a third time. 

I know I am only just beginning and this will be a long, difficult road, but I am happy to have found a community with so many supportive people. We can do this!",18,0

I find myself thinking of the gatherings of good friends over IPAs, the freedom of being able to go to a party or gathering and not have to be self-conscious or getting a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) while I stick to seltzer. Long walks in the park with the wife after we just shared a bottle and have that ""fuzzy numb"" sensation as we promenade in the summer evening. Cleaning the house with a healthy buzz to then transition into a killer cooking session. Gatherings with the family/in-laws while everyone gets overly-jubilant (and collectively hammered).

And of course, I would be remiss if I also didn't give equal attention to the dark side of those memories; sneaking in more drinks when my wife would go to the rest room or be distracted. The murky memories as some parties would drag on. My wife having to take care of me when I drank the equivalent of 3 bottles of wine by myself at a particular party. The astronomical hangovers and shakes throughout the next day (until that ""balancer"" drink can make it's way to me).

And then there's the tremendous regret that I let it all run away from me; if I had better self control, would I be able to still indulge to a degree and not have all those memories be only a distant remnant of my life that I've all but left behind, because I've proven to not be able to drink casually? If I held back here, held back there, would I still be able to join in on the ""fun""?

But then, I wonder more: was all this inevitable?

Even if I maintained some kind of moderation for a bit longer, was it eventually going to end this way, with my obsessive behaviors taking over any semblance of rationality? Was I eventually going to let it get away from me, no matter what?

Was addiction destined for me? And furthermore, is sobriety, as well?

Is this exactly where I need to be? And can I honor those positive memories, as well as the negative ones?

'You've got control now you've had a break, you can handle it this time'

'Just have a few and then stop'

I'm an alcoholic. I'll always be an alcoholic, there is no escaping it. Denying it (for me) is just a trick I play on myself.

Nothing exists outside of this moment, past and future are simply thoughts of rememberance and anticipation.

If you can stay sober and hold on for just this moment, therein lies your power to be sober in this moment. We could say there are lots of moments, but there really is ever only one.

It's not easy, there's no magic fix, there can't be light without the dark, but when the moment of that craving passes (as you know) it's such a relief. It won't be the last, you'll be tested often, but if you can get through this one moment then you're free.

Well my mom left and said she was staying overnight at her boyfriends place and I really didn't want to drink but... the opportunity and craving was so powerful so I ended up doing it.  She never leaves overnight so it was REALLY hard to avoid this.  She caught me and now I'm being kicked out. 

I'm really scared. I'm 23 but I've never been out on my own. I'm scared for my future and everything from this fucking disease. Part of me just wants to end it all but I really don't have that in me...

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Tuesday - Healing

&#x200B;

I just want to say quickly before I get into today’s subject that I am so moved by your stories and your willingness to open your hearts.  Thank you so very much for sharing with me.

They say that time heals all wounds.  But, I think there is so much more than that.  Most all of us have experienced the pain of a broken heart.  Losing a friend or family member by misunderstandings or even death, a broken heart is a very real thing. Sometimes it feels unbearable.  Like if it is never going to pass.  Time helps in this process but it’s not the only thing that helps.  It takes effort on our part to heal.  Reaching out for assistance, a friend, therapist or even a kind community like here.  Doing simple things like keeping yourself busy and distracting yourself can be helpful too.

I’ve read references to quitting substances being compared to losing a friend or a loved one.  The first time I read about this concept was when I was a part of a quit-community that helped me quit smoking.  I read how people were describing quitting smoking was like losing a friend.  I never really thought too much about how these can be similar.  It wasn’t until quite recently after I quit drinking that I felt it.  Under a different situation when I first stopped drinking I thought that I was losing a real friend in real life.  But, I may have been mistaken about all that pain of loss that I was experiencing.

I think that a majority of those emotions and feelings of loss were possibly coming from the separation of alcohol from my life.  Either way I dealt with them the best I could.  One of the best things that I did to help heal myself and get past those emotions was to sleep.  I slept a lot.  Maybe it meant that I needed to heal a lot.  I did plenty of other things that helped but sleep was probably the best medicine for me.

If you choose to answer, what “medicines” do you give yourself when you are trying to heal?

I want to say how very proud I am of each and everyone of you.  And it doesn’t matter if you literally put your last drink down this very moment as you read my words.  Just know that you are trying your best and that is what’s most important!!!

I will not be drinking with you today!

But this time I had a plan, happily strolled right past the airport wine bars, sipped 7-up on the plane, did not drink and actually really enjoyed my trip, and skipped straight to my properly-parked car and safely drove home with 105 days under my belt this morning.

I do have a movie recommendation this week. I saw *The Sound of Metal* on Prime last week and it really affected me. I liked how it wasn't really your typical getting sober narrative but that sobriety was still an important part of it. It seems rare to me, too, to see a movie about a person who has been sober for a medium length of time, i.e. 4 years in Ruben's case. It seems to me that people are usually shown just getting sober or having been sober for half their lives. (I'm probably forgetting loads of great 1-5 years sober characters?) If you're hoping for a lot of heavy metal music content you might be disappointed-- his music or its style doesn't figure in as much as I had imagined it would. It's just a smart, big-hearted movie about a good person dealing with a really scary, big challenge in life. >!And I've seriously been thinking about the end where he turns off the implants and sits in the silence and he realizes that the scene all around him is actually full of peaceful, positive energy. I've been thinking too about his decision to get the implants and how the group leader at the home said he was sounding like an addict again and what that says about sober support communities. Because I thought it was kind of ""typical AA old-timer judge-y BS"" while 100% simultaneously agreeing with him, and of course he seems to have been proven right by how events played out.!< Anyone else have thoughts on this movie?

I had cut back significantly but I didn't fully quit but I quit over 35 days ago and haven't had a single drink. I'm proud of myself for that but it's mostly the other things I've started since I quit that I'm most proud of myself for and I need somewhere to brag a bit about my accomplishments. 

Last year both of my great grandparents died within 14 days of one another. They raised me and my brother. We were closer than close. I loved them immensely and I took care of them both for the last two years but alochol was my crutch. My grampa was 96 years old and my gram was 90 years old. When I'd go visit them ( they both lived at home ) I'd usually reach for a drink when I got home because I hated so much to see them failing. My gram had advanced dementia and my grampa was just hanging on for my gram. He always said he had to outlive her to make sure she was okay. Anyway he did, by 14 days. The day after she passed away he immediately went to hospice. It's been a very intense grieving process. I was with them both when they died because of covid only one person was allowed. For a couple months after they died I binge drank HARD. I developed an ulcer and was constantly drunk. But one day I snapped out of it and said no, this is not honoring them. So I started walking. And then I just weened off alochol because I couldn't walk when hungover. Anyway, last week I got a job as a home support worker. I can feel them smiling down at me. It's my dream job. To be a companion to the elderly. I wish they could be here to see it. If I kept drinking I would not have gotten this far. I would still be living in a drunken self pity stooper. 


The combination of being sober, anti anxiety meds and physical exercise has completely turned my life around. An emphasis on the getting sober.  Some days I still want to drink but it's not as severe as it was at first. Before I felt I had nothing to lose but now I believe I do matter and I am worth putting in the fight and I'm worth not losing myself.

But at the same time, I feel that I can also connect most deeply to myself and my emotions when under the influence. I can listen to those sad songs that make me feel everything I've been trying to avoid, read the sad stories that touch and sensitive subjects and reflect, etc.

I don't think it's that I necessarily block my emotions out in the day to day, but everyday life is so busy. There's work and if you're a parent, there's your child. There's bills and social responsibilities and bills, etc etc etc. I don't feel like there's always enough room for emotions - the true and deep ones. 

Maybe it's because I'm diagnosed anxious and depressed. Or am single with a lackluster dating life. Or have the fascination for the macabre and intense aspects of life and death in general. 

While I hate the cycle drinking has put me into, I can't help but recognize the aspect of me in it's trance I can't quite shake. This aspect of me doesn't completely go away when I'm sober, but I feel it's more muted and subdued - tucked in the background.

3. Problems didn't go away, they just kind of ceased being so large. I have so much more time to do things I enjoy; sleeping, walking, talking with friends, writing. I used to ""have"" that time as well, but I was only fogging up my memory and battling bloated/dehydrated mornings.

For some context: 

Throughout my childhood and adolescence , I watched my mom go from having a good job/relationships/hobbies to completely losing everything and living in nursing homes for the last ten years of her life due to severe alcohol abuse. I watched her have seizures and go into comas at least twice a year for all of my high school experience. The last two years of her life she couldn't even have a conversation because of how brain dead she had become. She started needing a wheelchair at 33 years old. She would regularly have blackouts and poop her pants every time I saw her during that period. She died in 2017 at 39 years old. She said the reason she drank so heavily was because she couldn't stand losing my sister and I as well as both her parents dying from prescription pill overdoses all within a few years.

The week after my mom died, I woke up one morning in the hospital without any shoes and a large medical bill after apparently chugging a bottle of liquor to myself and having my friends find me covered in puke and unresponsive. Within the next couple of weeks I started self-harming pretty consistently and starving myself as well. I had a rough three years mentally and quite frankly did not want to live anymore. I made it through university though and am graduating in two weeks.

I have been in therapy for about 8 years now and substance use in some form or another has always been an issue for me. It still is. I made the switch from liquor/whisky to beer/wine about a year ago since I was harming myself and others while drunk (not to mention wasting all of my money). Over the last six months, I've been trying as hard as I could to quit drinking with the help of the therapist mentioned above. We talked about the maintaining factors of my drinking and what I thought would happen if I stopped. I was honest with her and said I didn't think I could quit as I'd been drinking and smoking marijuana for years. I was always anxious, especially socially, and felt the only way I could fit in with others was if I was drunk enough to let my guard down.

A couple of months ago, my depression and anxiety got the the point where I needed some intervention with medications. I got prescribed a medication that I absolutely should not drink on, and was going to just not take it for that reason at first. 

I had to make a big decision at that point. I either was going to not take the medication so I could keep drinking, which meant still being suicidal and feeling terrible every day. On the other hand, I could give the meds a try and have to put down the drinks. Thankfully I chose the latter. 

The first week was incredibly hard. I had no idea what to do with my time now since I was so used to getting drunk every night. I started finding things to do instead like skateboarding, reading, making music, and learning more about philosophy. During this time I've lost a considerable amount of weight and have had many people tell me I look way healthier and happier. I think that is true. 

Don't get me wrong, I still have pretty bad days, and I definitely still have cravings to drink. After the first week of being on my meds I had one beer just to see what would happen. I threw up and felt dizzy and dissociated. Overall a negative experience, so i haven't drank since. That was February 22nd. 

I think the hardest part of deciding to stop drinking is having to decide whether or not I wanted to get better. Whether or not I wanted to being an active force in my own life, or just watch it pass every night as a passive bystander. I've started skiing again, feel much less anxious around people, and have been doing and learning things that i never would have had the drive to before.

I know that you can do this! I highly recommend having a therapist to help you through your journey, but even if you don't I believe it is still possible. as cheesy as it sounds, you really do have to believe in yourself and decide whether or not you want to change, and find the reasons to start now.

best of luck to you guys and I will keep checking in here often as I am still an alcoholic in heart and mind. I need to keep constant maintenance or I will fall right back into where I was two months ago.",43,0

I drink around 12 beers a week, usually 6 beers on Tuesday and 6 on Friday. Sometimes a bottle of wine instead of 6 beers. This helps me blow off steam every few days. I'm done.

- I stepped on the scale a few days ago. 195lbs and 5'10"". This is the heaviest I've ever been. I can't believe 3 years ago I used to be 168lbs, lifted weights, and running half marathons in under 1:45. My clothes are getting tight, my gut is noticeable, and my chest area has become noticeably more boobish. Cutting out 1500-2000 calories/week of beer means I should lose 3lbs a month just from quitting alcohol, plus water weight. 

- I also eat like shit when I'm buzzed. Seriously, who has ever drank and thought ""fuck I'm craving a salad""? That's probably another 1000 calories/week I eat for no reason at all.

- I have two kids. One is 2 and one is 12. I'm started to feel like a shit dad. Beers help take the edge off of working from home and raising two kids, a super rowdy toddler and a moody pre-teen that needs a ton of help with school. I don't want them to remember me as a regularly drinker.

- I act like a fool when buzzed. Sure, I've never texted an ex, hit my wife, or gotten a DUI, but I ramble about really stupid shit while buzzed and randomly laugh for no reason. I don't want my family to see me acting like a clown.

- I want to get back into running. 12 beers/week does not do **anything** to help. Weight gain, dehydration, poor nutrition... it also highly demotivates me. Running after pounding down 6 beers the night before is not a pleasant experience.

- Lack of self-control. I've tried cutting back to 3 beers, twice a week. Failed. I've tried cutting back to 6 beers, once a week. Failed. I always fall back into the 6 beers twice a week routine.

I've scheduled a physical for mid-June with a physician I deeply respect and stopped seeing due to life, work, family, and drinking. This will keep me motivated, as well as joining this sub. Saturday 3/27/2021 was the last time. I'm glad to be here.",15,0

Official record.,"One time a couple years ago I went for a month and after that the longest I’d gone was maybe 5 days until now. I was still using Kratom regularly and smoking weed pretty much daily. While it was a step in the right direction for the time it wasn’t true sober. 

Now is the first time I’ve gone this long and for the most part without weed. It helped in the beginning with the withdrawals but now I’m not a fan of how it affects my morning workout. I’ve been Kratom tea free also, it was a trigger for me and clouds my mind.

I feel like a completely different person. I was overweight, depressed, and anxiety ridden. I woke up 30 minutes before I had to be at work regularly and didn’t like how I felt. Now I wake up at 6 or 6:30am and get a workout in and have a healthy meal and shower and groom myself like an adult. I NEVER imagined I’d be this guy. I still have plenty of work to do but I see the finish line and I FINALLY have hope. 

I promise even if you don’t see yourself as the type or never have been, if you’re anything like me who never truly met the sober adult version of yourself you have NO IDEA who is coming out the other end. My friends find me funnier (I was positive that would suffer) I feel high and happy from things in normal life I’d usually have a drink to enhance. Now I feel like a drink would ruin those things by not being fully there and feeling the wind against my skin and the warmth of the sun. I can have fun again! Real fun. It turns out all my fears of quitting drinking were utter bs. I am much happier now and have more fun and I look and feel better as a bonus.

I think until a few days ago I knew I needed to get sober but was doing it for my family more than myself. Looking back on the last month, my behavior has been horrifying and I can't convince myself anymore that it's under control.

Well, I guess that trick could be not drinking alcohol. What I really wanted to say is that I told my wife (who doesn’t drink) that she had my word I won’t drink again. Never said that to her. This has been a much easier attempt than in the past for one reason: I don’t feel I have a *choice* to make, because I gave my word. I’ve only ever made the “no drinking promise” to myself. Which hasn’t worked long term. But now that I came clean and made the promise to another, I truly don’t have the internal struggle of “what if I drank today?” Or “maybe just one,” Etc. Every time I get the first thought of drinking I immediately remember, “oh yeah, that’s not an option.” 

I know this doesn’t help many people, as I would think most have made one promise or another to others, but for those of you that haven’t, perhaps try it. Come out of the dark, make a solemn promise to someone important in your life, and tell yourself you no longer have the option to self justify another drink. Ever.",7,0

Maybe I'll look into that sooner rather than later. 

Spent all day in bed just waiting basically. I know the cravings will pass. I know a drunk night turns into three or four, and all I'm left with is less money, and more of this nasty feeling in my head. 

I don't want to sit here and complain all day. I want to relax, enjoy myself somehow. I wonder how long it's gonna be for my head to level out?

This has been an unusually good couple days for me. It is very much because of this shining new sobriety from abusing prescription pills, smoking cigs, and drinking alcohol. 

One of the things that inspired me to get help was seeing an  ex-coworker I was very fond of for a couple minutes one evening, and not even be able to talk to her or look at her in the eyes cuz I was drunk and high, and she had her little child with her. I'm not sure if she realized, but it doesn't matter, because I knew. This is only one incident of many. 

Anyhow, this first week of sobriety has been great. My brother came and visited me and the visit was good -- I haven't seen him for two years. I started waving hello to people, cuz I'm sober and was able to get back on anxiety and depression meds (always was a complete disaster mixing alcoholism with psychiatric meds). My gard is growing beautifully. I'm not experiencing flashbacks of a loved one's suicide like I used to while using and abusing substances. 

And today I have had another huge win! I know what my first class returning to school is going to be! It's going to be Applied Farming, as I'm going into a Technical Certificate of Horticulture program! I am beyond thrilled. I dropped out of college years ago due to mental illness, physical illness, addiction, and loved ones' deaths by sui. And now I feel healthy and competent enough to return to school!

I am just really thrilled with how my life is right now. I have to stay sober because I have poor health anyhow so if I go back to drinking, smoking cigs, and pill-popping, I know all the progress I've made is gonna dissipate. I have to stay sober for the people I love. But most importantly, I have to stay sober out of SELF-RESPECT, CONFIDENCE, SELF-WORTH, and SELF-LOVE.

I've felt that not drinking alcohol was a huge challenge, one that I couldn't possibly overcome.

But two really bad nights in a row of binge drinking copious amounts of wine and alcohol and waking up after those nights hating myself and how I treat myself seemed to be a decent wake up call. I also hate how I now have the reputation at my workplace (which is a fine dining restaurant) of coming in to eat and getting ridiculously hammered. It's embarrassing.

even with my loved ones drinking around me almost every time we are together;

even with working in an industry that romanticizes alcohol and expects everyone to be at least a moderate consumer of it,

I slipped up a total of 3ish times (that my mom knows about) over the course of the last few months. I really drank probably 10 times over the last few months.

Drank last night. Couldn't control the urge or craving. Guess I'm weak. Probably should have called someone but... what can I say. I wanted to drink and sneak it. 

My mom found out. She is being a bitch about it though. She hates alcohol and I understand but she literally wants me to leave and go to a hotel TONIGHT.   We spent all morning arguing because I'm going to see if I can live with my dad. I'm asking her to wait until tomorrow so I'll find out if I can live with them but she wants me to leave tonight. 

Sigh. Anyway. I'm so fucking scared. It feels like I have no future. I'm 23 and am bouncing house to house. Lived with my dad, then aunt, then brother, then my mom. I can't get my feet into a career. And most importantly the girl of my dreams who lives in a different country, that is my second half and I've been attached to her for 4 years, may never end up with me. My drinking is tearing everything apart. I've thought about killing myself numerous times. I know I could go through with it as long as I'm hammered. 

I tried AA, I tried counseling, nothing fucking works....I'm at my witts end. I guess when I finally quit for good I'll be horizontal. I'm sick of relapse after relapse after relapse....",9,0

My relapse was hard. Drinking at work and the like again. However, I'm... ashamed to admit, it was like greeting an old friend. No extra drunk-ness, everything was like, as if I had stopped the day before then resumed.

If you would look at my past postings, you would see I already experienced the physical benefits of becoming sober. Though... I can't lie if i said that I felt ""normal"" after imbibing a LOT of beer and.. while sober again now, I feel like...

Like I traded one addiction for another. I don't feel shame nor anger nor disappointment at what transpired last week. I feel loss that... my wife won't do wifely things, to be polite about it, with me having relapsed. However, she is the one that put things in perspective about myself and my own addictions.

Bit scared though.,"Hey guys, so I was a fairly heavy drinker. Everyday, I started off on IPAs over the years and on a very rare occasion I'd have some liqour (Fireball) or so. Towards the end of this drinking I went down to seltzers, and then sorta picked back up into wine for the past month or so because it wasn't leaving me with a hangover.

So what should've stopped me in the first place was years and years ago my aunt passed away from liver disease, and not to be gross but just be straight up and honest. What really is making me kick this to curb is I've been noticing my stools have been yellow, and I read that's a huge component in liver disease/cirrhosis. I'm honestly deathly scared, and I want to go to my doctor to get some blood work but I've been agoraphobic the past months (Not due to COVID) but due to my anxiety and panic attacks.

I was just wondering if anyone else noticed those sort of symptoms and that's what made them finally decide to quit? Aside from the yellow stools, I don't have any stomach cramping  or like fatigue etc. (Not asking for medical advice)

I've tried quitting numerous times, but enough is enough. I hadn't drank at all this week until this last Sunday when I got off work and now I feel like hell when I was feeling not so bad all week.

Thanks for listening and letting me vent.

Yet here I am, once again throwing up in the morning (I'm sober now tbc, I respect that rule), feeling sick and most of all, ashamed. Telling myself I don't want to live like this anymore.

Sooooo I thought I would tell you all about my Saturday, because after that shitshow I realize I am NOT missing out on anything lmao. It was my fiance's birthday and we had a picnic in the park with his friends. The first couple hours were great, we listened to music, ate yummy food, and I sipped on seltzer while they did soju shots. Then one guy started bitching and complaining about how he wasn't having fun because I wasn't drinking (wow, didn't know I held so much power. I can ruin everyone's fun!!!!!!) My coworker wanted me to analyze everything everyone at work has ever said to her with her and reassure her that everyone likes her. People went off to do drugs behind the bathroom (classy). The remaining folks alternately bullied each other into doing more shots and begged not to do more shots. Someone screamed ""OH MY GOD YOU GUYS, we're OLD!!!!! We're in our MID-THIRTIES which is practically FORTY and then we're going to be FIFTY!!!"" Fiance finally asked to go home when he was very obviously inebriated, and everyone else started whining and begging him to stay out. Then he lost his shoes while we walked up the hill to our car.

I was pretty mad (and honestly I'm not going to hang out with these people again, at least not in a situation where I can't duck out early), but thinking about it now, it has completely cured me of all the romanticizing of warm weather drinking that I was doing, and I'm grateful for that.

as i sit here right now i hardly want to drink which is very surprising but i guess i'm just sick and tired of that lifestyle.

I’m putting them here in case someone else searches this sub for “moderation” (like I do!)

- you can’t moderate an addictive substance. Alcohol is inherently addictive because it produces dopamine, which increases anxiety and makes you want more almost instantly 
- Alcohol is a depressant, so it makes you tired and numb. It makes you feel glued to the couch (or floor) when it hits. 
- You don’t get the buzz anymore, for some reason (you know too much? Being aware that you’re drinking a carcinogen that will just blunt all experience is kind of a buzz kill)
- You think about it literally all day. If you’re only drinking on the weekend, you think about it literally all week. Your life shrinks down to the size of the two hours you spend drinking, and they’re not even GOOD. 

Anyways, I hope this helps someone else! And stop searching for the “third door,” as Laura McKowen puts it. Start figuring out how to make your current life tolerable and even enjoyable without a substance. (Caffeine doesn’t count)

I was not going to say anything here or reset my badge because I was ashamed.  But I'm going to come clean both for accountability and maybe to help one person today.

There was nothing special about Saturday -- I was making dinner and thought a drink might go well with it.  You all know how the next part goes!  One led to a bottle of wine and twelve beers split between my husband (who also has been sober) and I.  The worst part is that we have a four month old baby.   He started sleeping through the night a couple weeks ago so I figured I wouldn't have to worry about him until morning.  Thankfully, he did *not* wake up in the middle of the night. But I was wracked with guilt yesterday about that in particular.  What if he *had* woken up?  Would I have been too drunk to safely care for him?  What if there had been an emergency?

Today, I feel a little better.  The experience strengthened my resolve, not just because I got hungover or spent too much on alcohol or ate a bunch of junk or wasted my whole weekend drinking/recovering, but because I have a sweet baby to care for and protect.  I never want him to see his mom drunk.  And I especially never want to compromise his safety!

I thought these people got the same feeling or enjoyment out of that one drink and then were able to stop because they were better than me in that capacity. In reality, these people probably drink because other people are doing it so whatever. They can leave half a drink on the table at the end of the night because it's at best a weird tasting beverage and at worst a chore to get through. It doesn't hit them the same way.

This understanding helped me work through the shame of not being able to ""drink normally."" There is no ""drink normally,"" you either enjoy the buzz or you don't, which is a matter of preference. Not everyone likes the way booze makes them feel or the way it tastes. So what I saw as someone enjoying a buzz throughout the evening could have very well been someone suffering through a weird tasting drink that produced undesirable feelings. Who the fuck wants to do that? It also makes a lot of sense looking back on all the people who declined my sustained invitations to drink.

Then there's the person who does like the feeling and who is ultimately trying to manage it. 1) good luck with that and 2) anxiety on a tightrope where the fall is getting totally black out drunk? Been there, pass. Being present in the moment is a much more enjoyable, rewarding, and downright easier.",12,0

While the general consensus around NA beers is to be cautious, I wanted to share some more details with my experience to potentially help others with their evaluation. 

1. NA beers are generally sold at liquor stores, so be aware that this can be triggering. While trying to find the NA beer shelf at the liquor store, I came across a number of nostalgic beers, some that I could almost taste again. I also came across a jug of mississippi mud - that was one of the beers in college we'd always buy whenever we stumbled upon it. It's funny that even years later that thought was still automatic (Mud? Gotta get it!) But this time I shut it down and managed to hunt down the Athletic.
2. It tastes like beer. I think this is the obvious one for most, but just be aware of that, in case that taste may driving cravings. 
3. It doesn't taste exactly like certain beers. I always liked trying new beers and varieties - but in trying NA beers, there still are some tastes that I still haven't found - so just use caution if  that 'taste gap' may lead to a craving.
4. Beware the ritual. I used to drink beer after beer while playing poker or playing video games. I  avoid NA beers during those times and stick to seltzer. With that said, others have been successful using NA beer as a tool to fight cravings during these past rituals - it is all about knowing yourself. 
5. Mindfulness and Timing are important. It was important for me to build up mindfulness about my relationship and history with alcohol, and a sobriety tool set before I tried NA beers.

I started trying to cut down about a year ago when the doc said I had slightly elevated liver enzymes and I had already been dealing with hypertension for several years.

cutting down wasn't working... I wasn't a morning drinker, never drank at work, have a pretty good life, good job but liked to kick a few back (or more at times) most evenings.  once I started tracking what I drank I realized it was too much (not that this was surprising in anyway) and that even when I thought I was cutting back I really wasn't. 

this year I completed a dry January, during that month I worked out regularly, ate healthy, and got some projects done around the house. someone asked me if I ""felt better"" from the not drinking and honestly I did but not anything amazing.... so I thought. 

come Feb. 1st I was going to keep going for a 90day streak, and well I thought id just have one to celebrate the month and see what I had been missing. first one was awful, but I drank a few more anyway.

from then until now I had gone right back into my old habits. I had been sick twice from drinking to much (my tolerance apparently had fallen but my drinking mind had not forgotten to have more). I wasn't working out, and I was eating crappy food/take out again. 

I went back and told the person who asked if I felt better that I did indeed and I never even noticed how much until I went back to drinking. its like eating healthy, you don't always notice the slow improvements until you slam down a cheeseburger and some onion rings and feel like shat. 

I am here again now to give it another go, knowing how much more I can be and that this crap could ruin everything I have worked so hard for. 

stay with it everyone and know that even if your not at the ""rock bottom"" there can still be so much more!",7,0

What’s worse is that this happens particularly in situations where Im with other people (I get mild social anxiety) and when things should not get out of control, not so much when I’m alone, at home. I don’t know if this is something anyone else can relate to? 

It’s gotten me into so much trouble... I hurt my knee 2 years ago from running in heels while shitfaced and 2 surgerys later and it’s not ok (I need another surgery and do physio 2 times a week). I’ve done countless other stupid things like have sex with people I really regret while blacked out and not even remembering the following day. Ive made an absolute fool of my self by acting like an idiot in public and saying and doing so many regrettable things. I’ve gotten myself arrested. I’ve lost precious items. Sometimes I’ve gotten angry and aggressive- who knows why?  I’ve hurt people I love and care about. Today is my 26th Bday and I really want to change. I woke up sad today because I had too much to drink yesterday. Nothing terrible happened but that was pure luck. Every time I’ve hurt my knee since the first incident it has been due to alcohol. I’ve tried moderating and I successfully do it for a little while but at some point I lose control. Alcohol brings out the worst in me and I’m looking forward to changing. 

So cheers to day 1.

But cultural struggles...,"Another weekend down without a sip. Made it through three separate social gatherings where I usually would have had a beer (or 10). Huge for me.

I have to say though, it is tough... I didn't really have a problem socializing or whatever, but I just feel like an alien... I'm already vegan, which nobody understands, and now I'm not drinking alcohol, which nobody understands either. So I'm sitting at a pizza joint drinking an NA beer and eating cheese-less pizza and not eating birthday cake while everyone else pounds beers, eats meat-lovers pizza, and enjoys cake.

I know my decisions are right for my life and my ethics, but its just tough sometimes... Sometimes I wonder why I bother with any of this? Sometimes I feel like saying fuck it and diving in and eating and drinking whatever I want.

But then I remind myself that I'm not just doing this to deprive myself of good things, I'm doing this for my health, and for my sanity, and life is not better with those ""good"" things in it. I don't miss terrible digestion, I don't miss hangovers, I don't miss the extra 30 pounds I carried when I ate animals, I don't miss being a slave to alcohol, I don't miss gout.

Plus, I got home from the party and prepped some food for the week, did a workout, and had a nice evening. If I would have had pizza and beer I would have felt life crap for the rest of the night, probably found more alcohol to drink, and be battling a hangover right now.",10,0

The obvious answer is I so enjoy waking up early feeling great and getting so much done during the day. When I first started down this journey of sobriety, I stumbled on the sub /r/tooktoomuch. It was a very stark reminder of what I look like when I drink too much and what my wife has put up with. I view that sub from time to time when the urge to drink hits me.

I thought either I was in a insane asylum or I died and found my way to hell. Alone. I had to get up and run. There were wires all over me and some tube coming from my dick. ( I have been in hospitals before but never like this.) I ripped everything out if me and I mean everything. No more tube down there. Next I remeber blood and people yelling. They were holding me down. Told me not to move for I was being taken care of. I had to be there they said. I dont remeber much after that scene, but I knew I felt alive. Must of been all the blood spewing from my body. I don't know how much time had past but I was back awake finally. A doctor finally came in and told me what happened. I was not surprised. I knew I was going to die from my addictions. I knew that years before this happened. I had excepted that. I never wanted to die. God is it a hard fucking downward spiral I thought had no exit sign....at least not one for me. I was actually scared of being sober. For 10+ years I was creating the addict I was. That was the person I knew. Not all times were bad. Most were a fucking blast! I had one crazy ride and figured a sober me would have no personality and not be even able to laugh. 

The first shock from the defibultor did not revive me. I was listening to a nurse. He was definitely looking at me like I was one lucky son of bitch. Like he never seen anything like me. To this day I dont exactly know what happened that night. How intensely they had to be to revive me and save my life. I waited some more in thought...I was scared. Shea my roommate came thru the ICU doors. The nurses looked so happy that I had someone to come see me. I did not know it at the time but shea called 911 when he found me foaming from the mouth. Shea saved my life. He acts like it was no big deal....Shea saved my life.

Shea left. I was so happy to see someone I knew. That was what I needed to know I was not in hell. I had one thought at the time. ""Wow I'm suppose to be dead"" This statment would haunt and destroy me even further for the next 3 years.

This was not a healthy or supportive person. (Not that I was a saint either.) The relationship had too many ups and downs, and their drinking/drug habits occasionally turned my stomach, even when I was fully immersed in my own addictions. I went no contact for the sake of my own mental health, and I firmly believe that it was, and still is, the best option. 

But all of a sudden I can't seem to get this person off of my mind. I'm wondering if my brain is just flailing for an easy dopamine fix, and my subconscious is saying, ""You know what *else* used to take us for a ride? This person's bullshit!"" Or maybe I'm just processing and recalling the end of things in a way I wasn't able to through a cloud of alcohol, making the emotions seem more fresh and raw? We were friends for 10+ years, so it wasn't an easy decision.  Thinking about this person makes me feel both Angry and Lonely, so maybe my subconscious is just dredging it up as an excuse to drink, something worth running from? I don't know. 

I'm not planning on reaching out to this person. And I am planning on NOT drinking. I'm just a little concerned with how obsessive/intrusive these thoughts have been the last couple days. What I really want is to just move on, and have it out of my mind.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? Any tips for giving yourself closure? I've been trying to treat it almost like another addiction, getting involved in something else when I think about it, and just giving it time. I know this isn't exactly drinking related.

I sat silent for a second. Then I started laughing. 

“What?!?” my wife asked. 

“I feel hungover!” I haven’t had a hangover in over 4 years but the memory remains. My head was pounding. I was a little pissed off. I wanted everything the body craves when you’re hungover: carbs (I had oatmeal with plenty of brown sugar and cinnamon), potassium (a banana for me), and electrolytes aka salt (hello everything bagel with chive cream cheese).

Every conversation, every day sober, everything.

I've said it before, but I know I have clinical depression, got ""diagnosed"" with it a while ago when I was going to therapy. Specifically high functioning depression. Schizophrenia was discussed but I quit going before we could nail that down or rule it out. 

I dunno, am I suppose to act like it's a fair shake I've gotten and ""tough it out."" I don't want to. I don't want to do anything. 

Maybe I'll get back into poetry. At least I enjoy that. Maybe try to get a few more published. Maybe I'll just sleep workdays away until I get fired again. Maybe I'll wake up and stop being human trash for once in my life. Or find motivation to continue sober. Maybe I'll quit being so mentally weak and learn to deal with my issues. Stop immediately falling apart the second goes slightly wrong. Maybe I'll find someone that can put up with me for more than a few weeks and feel normal.

The first couple years it was all floundering, it was just putting the one foot in front of the other, looking across the street when I walked by a bar, zoning out when coworkers talked about needing to grab a drink. And the next couple were a difficult struggle altogether. I had put so much work, daily work into my sobriety those first few years that it felt breathlessly, joyously easy.

I can’t explain how unprepared I was, how unprepared my sobriety was, something I proudly thought was unbreakable and unshakeable, for this past year. Between the pandemic, the cultural reckoning we found ourselves in, people I knew hospitalized, people I knew who died, people I knew who relapsed, people I knew who died OF relapse...they were all hard. Really, really hard. 

It’s funny because the years when I felt bored, I felt uncomfortable. I felt uncomfortable because I craved that conflict of it being hard — I remembered the thrill of how immediate it all felt, how *important* it felt. I remembered people telling me the importance of keeping it green, keeping it in the back of your mind, remembering that the Disease is doing push-ups in the parking lot... I remembered and figured, I got this! I already struggled through it before, so I was prepared!

Except I wasn’t. It was all the same feelings, all the same grief, but the brain and heart are muscles and those muscles had been out of shape for this kind of exercise. It had been riding the high of connecting with people who I could help, and forgotten how to deal with the pain of watching people I couldn’t. I had forgotten what I learned quickly in those first few weeks — that one day at a time sometimes felt, and was, unbearable. 

So I did what I did back then, too. I took it 10 minutes at a time. I set Google calendar alerts for every morning “I will be sober today.” When I felt the discomfort rise and rise until it felt like it was lodged in my throat and I felt I couldn’t breathe, I stayed still. And it passed. 10 minutes, one hour, one day at a time, it passed, and those muscles (out of shape and unused to the workout), got sore, and complained, until slowly and suddenly, they weren’t anymore. 

Five years has felt like both a long and also not very much time at all. I don’t know what epiphany other people have gone through at that milestone, but I’m only marginally more enlightened than I was before. But I know now what I did not know before— that I can live my life, a sober life, honestly, unprettily, and joyously all at the same time.",86,1

Here’s my experience and tips.,"It may seem like “woah, he’s only 23, he couldn’t really have that hard of a time with alcohol,” but I hope someone reading this can find something useful regardless of age. I’ve been to multiple detoxes/rehabs/sober livings, experiences homelessness, done some overall shitty things. This is coming from someone who had a pretty privileged childhood and adolescence. This is just my experience and what has worked.

I take Naltrexone daily (25-50mg). I also take Wellbutrin daily (150mg). Both have been scientifically proven effective in treating alcoholism. I also take other nonaddictive psyche meds (low dose lithium, an SSRI, and Guanfacine) because I am diagnosed with depression and ADHD-PI. 
It took me years to figure out this combo. I’ve been on amphetamines, Ritalin, various benzodiazepines, etc.
For me, marijuana and psychedelics (micro and macro, LSD, DMT, or psilocybin) did not help my problem, and I was not able to manage the amount of alcohol I consumed, when I drank. 
The one thing I have not done is ketamine, legally or otherwise. I have heard wonders about it from friends in recovery and family members with severe depression.
I went to a 60 day inpatient and did 6 months of IOP and sober living as well. The urine tests helped *a ton*.
I work full time and do 12 step oriented stuff for an hour or two a week.... basically I help find trolls as security for an AA zoom chat once a week and I text my sponsor every day or two.
From my understanding I could probably drink without the same black out issue if I took naltrexone, but I take it daily and have no desire to drink. When I don’t take it I do notice a difference, but haven’t bothered to drink on those days anyways.

TL;DR: I went to and completed treatment, continue to take my meds daily esp. Naltrexone and Wellbutrin, and stay connected with a sober mentor and help people on zoom.",21,0

I lost all I live at my mothers apartment with no job for about 4 years. I'm slowly gaining clarity and I see it as a win. The very hard part is that I see alcohol everywhere. There are always ads about it and every store has it and restaurant and I started going out with my girlfriend to friends and they talk about it or drink and I can't handle it very well. I don't ever want to relapse again because it doesn't even fit me anymore. If I drink it worsen my depression I get very sad and the next few days super anxious ! I take prozac and gabapentin and i'm going to see how it affects me now that I have no alcohol in my system and no drugs. The thing is I can't even get a job at the moment because I have panic attacks and i'm having difficulties not having anything to back me up but I have to learn to live with my sober self.

I just wanted to write a quick note that I am officially three years sober as of a couple of days ago! It's amazing to reflect on where I was and where I've come. Truly It's been worth the journey, but it took me a while to actually get on this path.

I hope if you are just starting out, or thinking about getting sober that maybe my experience can help to inspire you to do it. My life now is completely different from before, but that difference is largely internal. The only way to describe it is that I no longer live in a constant state of anxiety and dread. It's really very nice...even the worst days are better.

Anyway, I hope all the best for you, I felt all of the same fear  that you feel, and I can say with absolute certainty that it's so much better on this side. Good luck with your journey...",20,0

Before that I quit for 6 months and started back thinking I could moderate. I did for a while but it wasn't long before I was drinking every day again. In total I would say I've been drinking for 30 years of my life. Not all those years, speaking of the early ones, were daily. I was usually drinking a bottle of wine, then about 3 to 4 IPA beers, followed by a few bourbon drinks. 

Onward to today. I have been sober for 8.5 days now and I have have barely seen the first sign of withdrawal. I have been having some anxiety, boredom, and hand shakiness (which seems to have cleared up). This surprises me because over the last year or so I have been drinking until passing out in the evening. I'd wake up at 3 am with my head on the counter top or passed out on the couch. I've blacked out so many times now I've lost count. Watched movies with my wife and not remembered many of them. Held entire conversations, same. I've drunk texted women I've met and been embarrassed the next morning because I did not even know that I did it.

Now this last part about the blackouts was my personal low and I just knew I had to stop. I don't know what causes the loss of consciousness and losing full control, but it was embarrassing and scared me a bit too much. I was not sure where I would be headed next.

I don't understand why I have had almost no symptoms of withdrawal with this level of drinking... Anyone experienced this? Not complaining of course just wondering if it happens.

Wanted to share a bit of advice that's helped me this far.

What's really helped me stop drinking is changing the way I perceive not drinking. In the past every time I wanted to slow down drinking or stop drinking it was seen through a negative lens. For example was always like I need to stop because of the health problems it causes, relationship troubles it brings etc. I think viewing stop drinking like this turns it into a negative situation and I would always find myself back on the drink because of it. 

Until I changed the way I viewed it, now the reason why I don't drink isn't because of the negatives of alcohol its because of the positives of not drinking alcohol. Now I can get more immersed into my games, cooking, music etc.

Anyways just wanted to say that if you view not drinking as a positive and not a something your doing because of the negatives I think it helps.

But, pregnant or not, those days are done for me.   

I’m realizing that self harm comes in more forms than the classic cuts from a razor blade  or burns from cigarettes put out on your skin. I never self harmed in that physical way so I guess I just ... didn’t really think about it too much. I actually used to joke rather darkly as I mixed another drink that “hey at least I’m not cutting”.  But it’s true, I think. Self harm can come in the form of a bottle opener and a cork screw as easily as a razor blade.   

Drinking again would be like going back to an abusive ex boyfriend. Even just a conversation could lead me back to a place I don’t want - and don’t deserve - to go. I deserve so much to be a happy and healthy woman. A strong and stable partner. A loving and caring mother. I’m not ENTITLED to any of it and I could lose it all at any given time.

The biggest & best advice I would give to anybody new, the thing that got me past the 30 or 60 or 80 day stints that I would do before I would cave, before I would be offered that drink, was that I told everyone to stop.

Speak  candidly with your friends & family, just remove that stigma straight up and be like ""I don't drink any more. It's just not a think. So boom, let's continue our lives"". That's what changed for me, the key to me being ""somebody *trying* not to drink"" and ""a sober person who **doesn't** drink.""

Especially at the moment, if like me, in London, you're a bit scared of how you'll navigate post-Covid life: it's relatively easy to sit indoors and busy yourself, but when social occasions start showing themselves, will you really be able to say no to that glass of bubbles at a wedding? Or at friend's birthday?

I have come out twice in my life - once as a gay man, and another as an alcoholic, and both times I found everyone dealt with everything far better than I gave them credit for.

This week I want to tell the story of a stray dog in North Carolina named Sisu who snuck into a Dollar General store to steal a purple unicorn - five times! Clearly Sisu wanted this stuffed friend! Store staff called animal control, who came out to pick him up. But before taking him back to the shelter, the animal control officer bought him his coveted purple unicorn.

[You can read the story and see the video of Sisu with his unicorn here.](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/27/us/dog-steals-purple-unicorn-gets-adopted-trnd/index.html)

I didn’t request a badge because avoiding the world and not drinking is necessary but didn‘t convince me of growth. Now I have had victories. I went to the store in the evening last week, considered a 6 pack of beer, looked at small wines, went back and forth between the wine and the beer, anybody watching would‘ve laughed or cried. I walked away, didn’t buy any alcohol, made dinner, struggled to get to sleep as I have every night I am sober. Two days later, a friend had a major life crisis. I went to visit her, took her out for dinner, told her I was off the sauce but she could have as much as she wanted. I was proud to be the DD, I had a half lemonade/half club soda and didn’t miss alcohol at all while sitting on a patio full of imbibers. Being clear headed helped me be a rock for a woman whose life had turned upside down in 5 days. That’s progress. 

I love the morning joy, I love going to bed with a clear head. I love feeling like me again. When did I lose me? I don‘t know. My alcohol use ramped up 5 years ago, slowly, I took breaks but I never took a stand. My husband joined me on the wagon after he realized that I really am on a one way train and he would get left behind if he continued to drink. We giggle, snuggle, help each other more, and we are closer than ever. We were both having health issues, esp high BP; my BP is a healthy 127/73 today, his BP is 113/73.

I usually drink in the car ride over to the event while my husband drives.

Does this get better? Or does it depend on the people I’m with? I had a mini zoom party with my childhood friends today and I didn’t feel awkward with them. But on Saturday night we hung out with friends we see often (the one family in our bubble) and I wasn’t really comfortable at all. Is how I feel around people sober a sign if I really like them? 

Can I do this for real without falling off the wagon and “trying moderation?” And why are all my close friendships (after college) built upon a love for drinking?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Monday - disconnected

&#x200B;

First up is I want to thank each and every one of you for responding to me.  And although I can't respond to every one of you, I can say that I've read all of your responses and I really appreciate you.  I can’t believe how much love I can feel from you.  It truly is amazing.  YOU are truly amazing!!

&#x200B;

When I first quit drinking I swear that I must have gone through every single emotion that my mind, body and soul could conjure up.  Fear, anger, regret, loneliness and emotional pain was what was served to me everyday it seemed.  It almost felt like it would never end.  It was exhausting.  Crying like a little child was tiring, but I knew this was going to happen because this is what I signed up for.  So, I embraced it and was grateful to finally be able to FEEL something from all of the years being numb. 

&#x200B;

And then…..<sighhhh>  All of that past!!!  I couldn’t believe it, this must be a dream.  I’m walking on cloud nine!!  Euphoric feelings I haven’t had since….well, it was like being in love.  But, in the back of my mind, just like all of those negative feelings I just knew that this was not going to last.  The good feelings were going to go away.  So, I embraced the moments I had with them while they were here.

&#x200B;

Now that I’m more than four months down the road things are different.  Emotions are not nearly as intense as they were.  Sure I have my ups and downs but they are manageable.  The one thing that I felt though was a feeling of disconnection.  My mother and father have been gone for years now, but they’ve been on my mind a lot lately.  I keep thinking about the home I grew up in.  Even comes up in dreams sometimes.  

&#x200B;

I miss my mother and father and I miss my home.  I will need to visit where they are laid to rest and I need to visit my old house.  I’m fortunate that my house is still there, unoccupied.  My sister wants to give me the house but I don’t know if I want to take it on yet.  

&#x200B;

Have you ever felt this way?  What things have you tried to help you get “connected” again?

&#x200B;

For the beginning of our week I ask that you hunker down and be strong.  Trust yourself that you can and will make it another day.  Stay strong!!

I will not be drinking with you today!!!

A lot of the people in my life don't really understand why I am doing it. I never hit rock bottom, so to speak, so people are often surprised by my decision.

I have been in sobriety training since January 2020, when I went though eye opening withdrawals when I went for the usual sober January with my friends. 
I have probably “stopped” drinking (with various lengths and levels of commitment) 10-15 times. Each time is different.

Sometimes I will stop and have little to no cravings, an (overly?) positive attitude, no problem sleeping through the night or hanging out with drinkers. I’ll dive into projects and quit lit and by the time I get to 30 days I barely realized the weeks passing! These times tend to be shorter, as I convince myself it will all be fine if I have a few drinks, or just drink for a week. My positive mindset leads me astray. 

Sometimes it’s a fucking nightmare. Constantly thinking about alcohol, constant cravings, irritability and boredom and frustration. I can’t watch tv with triggers or be trusted to walk by the corner store. However, these stints last longer because I remember how much they suck and I don’t want to do it again.

I’ve tried quitting before but those times always felt like I was trying to prove something to other people rather than do it for myself. This is why this time has felt so much different. 

This past month has felt like the start of the new beginning. Like the feeling you get when you start college or move to a new city. It’s been refreshing to enjoy life, go out, be social, and enjoy the world without drinking and spoiling  the experience.

My first week of being sober was surprisingly amazing. Everything that could have went right did. It felt like I was purposely being rewarded and blessed for finally deciding to stop drinking. There were a few hiccups throughout the month but never did I feel the desire to grab a drink as there’s nothing a drink would have done to make any of the situations better or make them go away. 

I’m so proud of myself for going to Chumash Casino this month for the first time and not drinking despite being with a group full of people drinking. (Shoutout to the bar at Chumash for carrying Heineken Zero which has been a godsend this past month along w/ Budweiser Zero) 

I know it won’t always be this easy. Actually I’d almost guarantee that it will get harder. The longer you’re away from something, the easier it is to forget why you got rid of it in the first place.  Same reason we start to feel okay after a breakup, move on and yet sometimes decide to call that ex months or years after the breakup and bring them back into your life (only for you to be reminded there’s a reason this person wasn’t in your life anymore).

I’ll start by answering the question. My drinking career started 2 years ago when I was 24. From ages 21-23 I’d drink only on weekends socially. During my college days I could have a 6 pack of craft beers in my fridge that would last an entire month. I’d enjoy them in the proper beer glasses paired with a recommended meal. At age 24 I was in a situation where it was socially acceptable to drink with co workers everyday after work and the boss too. One day I woke up with a massive hangover and thought I wasn’t going to make it to work. So I quickly searched “fast way to get rid of a hangover”. One thing that caught my eye was “the hair of the dog”. Drinking to cancel out a hangover. I did it. Ever since then I’d been drinking in excess when I go on benders.

My longest amount of time sober since a 22-day stretch last December,"It's Day 5! I'm getting through it. I had a bad craving earlier but drank one of my NA beers instead. Was delighted to see my husband was doing the same thing to deal with his alcohol cravings as well (he's not an alcoholic like me, but still drinks more than either of us would like). 

I didn't go to AA/NA for the first time in a week because my older brother finally made it down to see me from two states over. This is the first time I've seen him for about 2 years. 

So far, I have found that I have a little more energy for physical activities like walking and playing basketball. I hope to go back to the gym this coming week, where I was getting into a good routine of weight-lifting. 

My mood is stable, I've only gotten really upset once in the past week, and that was temporary irritation with my husband (and normal). I don't feel as depressed or anxious as I did drinking every day/regularly. 

I'm going to make sure to always have an alcoholism, addiction, or sobriety-related book on hand in the coming weeks or months. I have a good little stack of recommendations and another one in the mail. It really helps me mentally re-commit every day or night to sticking with this decision to be alcohol and drug-abuse free. 

Having my brother here also helps me commit, even though there's a part of me that wants to go out drinking with him. The bigger and stronger part of me wants to stay sober for everybody I love, including him. Our parents weren't great parents, and I feel like at least one person in his life needs to be steady, healthy, and sober for him. When I hang out with him I see the little boy who was very shy and suffered tremendously from abuse and neglect.  I feel like I'm the only person who remembers that kid. And I want to be there for him, and I don't think I can do as an addict. 

Anyhow, that has been my 5th day sober. I am very proud of myself for getting here. I am excited by the possibility of succeeding in this long-term.

It got me thinking of what my response would have been if I was drinking beer when they got curious. I hope to break the cycle of alcoholism for their sake. Hopefully they're young enough that they won't have this vision of their father as a regular beer drinker. 

On a side note, I've been reading ""This naked mind"" and it's truly amazing. One thing she mentions in regard to moderation (this may have been on her podcast) is how much mental energy it often requires to moderate. I know if I set limits of how much I can drink, I will constantly be obsessing about the number and when is the next day I'll be able to drink, etc. Whereas if I just quit 100%, I'm free of the obsession, and free of the risk of going overboard.

Being a sunny, warm, spring day I met up with friends at the local brewery for some patio social time - the first time in nearly 18 months because of Covid. ""I'll reward myself,"" I thought. ""I haven't had a drink in such a long time, I'll just have 2 beers."" Y'all know the story. Two beers turned into seven. I called my wife and asked her to come pick me up from the brewery 6 hours later, which she lovingly did. When I got home, I just broke down sobbing. I'm so sick of alcohol having so much control over me. I literally can't stop once I start. 

I realized, well I knew already, but I admitted to myself yesterday that I can't just have 1-2. I have never been able to have 1-2 drinks. I can have zero, or I can be out of control. There's no middle ground for me. 

I don't want to be out of control anymore. I asked my wife for support and help last night in a drunken panic. When I got up this morning, she had already thrown away all the alcohol in the house. I'm very lucky. 

I'm also lucky to have this community, and I look forward to checking in daily. I did not drink today.",112,1

so im a man, 39 years old, single father, and not drinking anymore so far. I could resist for the past months, which seems incredible... when i started i wasnt sure i could last 2 days... I started mid september so its around 6 months now : unbelievable. I mostly started because it was getting very inconfortable (acid reflux, nausea, fatigue, etc), and i was feeling i was getting into the ""physical addiction"" -just enough to know it was time to stop. I mean, I have a good life, good job, wonderful daughter, i dont want to waste any of this for lame booze.  

but its lockdown, its probably the easiest time in human history to do a drinking pause, no peer pressure at all! I also smoke weed and it makes it completely acceptable. indeed its super confortable to wake up fresh, have a stable mindset, and get slim without any exercise !!  

I was picking my kid at her mother earlier today, and discussing about it with 2 female friends of her (they're all gay, thats why we separated), they are still in the old mindset. They had a point : how will you manage when you can go out again? everybody around you drinking beer after beer, and you hang to your coca-cola? Maybe one hour or two, then it would become more and more boring/annoying as the other people get drunk.  

How to deal with it when its going back to parties and such? 
They are a bit like me : we were nerds at school, then around 16 year, we started drinking beers to overcome shyness and become part of the cool kids. 

Then came uni, and all the alcohol. I was part of a frat, basically partying 9 months a year and still succesfully getting my diploma. such a good life!

was dead shy towards girls, that frat helped me a lot to socialize and overcome it. I basically built all my social experience and friends network around these kind of parties, and it continued after university, in private parties, in concerts, festivals and raves. 

Its basically how i enjoy myself, i dont know any better way to have a good time, meet friends etc. anyway, among every people i know, even a boardgame evening is running with beers and occasional weed. boardgames are so boring in reality -hopefully you can drink and smoke! 

lets be real,  plenty of parties are boring without beer, sometimes you have to wait hours to get to see the artists you were waiting for. clubs live from alcohol and everything turns around it, not to mention other drugs (im not a user of these hopefully).

When you meet someone, lets say its on a first date, having a drink together is almost a ""social pact"" : if you dont drink with the person, you're seen as a boring guy. at least in these social circles.

I notice i am afraid of be bored and of looking boring. beer is not supposed to help it, or am i wrong?

i think its time to re-invent the mental patterns that make you want to drink. it must be possible. like reprogrammation. training new reward patterns. 

I suppose I am not the first person to think about it, I guess almost everybody here has a comparable story to tell. do any of you have some feedback or experience to share about this?


Thank a lot to all of you, hang on to your dreams!! ;) IDWTDWYT!",6,1

I'm dealing with some of the difficult existential questions of my life. Like the fact that I'm getting older and I'd like to settle down with a long-term partner. This is so scary to me because I've had some unstable relationships in the past.

The good news is that not drinking is a great filter for choosing the people that I spend time with. My relationships are much healthier now and I think that I'm approaching a mental place where I can have a healthy relationship. 

I'm doing great quitting nicotine also. It very much seems like quitting alcohol is an essential move in improving my life.

Does anyone have any thoughts on when my mood might improve? I know it's different for everyone, but it would be nice to know that there's light at the end of the tunnel with some of these feelings.

Somedays I may still feel the struggle. Life can be difficult at times and I've been going through alot of changes in my life with a new job, new friends and cutting out old toxic relationships and habits.

My life has changed so much over the past year. I used to drink everyday, sometimes until I would get black out drunk. I felt like absolute garbage, my mental and physical health was deteriorating. I was becoming an alcohol addicted zombie living the same day over and over again. The alcohol was starting to make me lose my mind. Somedays all I wanted to do was lay in bed.

Drinking was fun at first but over the years it turned into a nightmare. The hangovers, poor sleep, mood swings, anxiety, depression, and lack of motivation was all destroying me.

I would try to stop cold turkey for a few days and would have terrible insomnia before going right back to daily drinking. It made me feel absolutely terrible.

Finding help through AA, stop drinking and therapy really helped me. Becoming a healthier person made sobriety worth it. I never want to go back to the nightmare or drinking again.

I've rediscovered my love for working out, reading, hiking, eating well, and playing guitar. I'm becoming a better version of myself and I am no longer filled with hatred and self doubt.

I was in a grocery store yesterday when I noticed they now added a beer section. I contemplated just buying one or two drinks. What's the harm?

But then I remembered I can't just have one. One drink is not enough for me. If I have a drink I just keep needing more and more until I run out of alcohol or pass out. That's something I never want to return to.

I am not a slave to alcohol. Alcohol is just an addictive poison that slowly destroys us both physically and mentally. So cheers to sobriety and becoming a healthy version of ourselves! IWNDWYT",13,0

I obviously hadn’t gone out the night before, and I didn’t have a “rock bottom”... I just realized that I was sick of the time wasted to and recovering from drinking. 

When I drank any type of alcohol in any amount, I would suffer from crippling anxiety for days after. This mental hangover was the reason I had quit drinking for long stints before, but living in NYC and having an active social life full of concerts and weddings, (pre-pandemic), I just always ended up breaking my streaks. 

Last year was a challenge for so many reasons but I truly think I wouldn’t have been able to mentally and physically get through it if I had been drinking. I have changed so much this last year and I can’t imagine ever going back to that same routine of drinking, feeling terrible, finally feeling better, and then drinking again... on repeat.

My son is Autistic and has had buttloads of aba since age 2 so he passes as neurotypical HOWEVER he has had some regression due to covid which made the therapies end. Anyways he and my daughter were so inattentive and it just emotionally killed me. Other kids are just so relaxed and my kids are these massive tornadoes of energy. It embarasses me and the embarrassment makes me so mad at myself. 

I had cravings to drink so I went and bought a ton of berrie bushes to add to my garden. Once I got home I felt like I could barely move and now I just feel so angry I bought them.

Which turned into going to another bar where my usual drunken fight or flight (always flight) kicked in and I tried to leave but my friends convinced me to come back. Which led to more drinks and me doing coke until 6am. Because of course it did.

-I don’t feel like garbage all the time. I was around 195 lbs when I stopped drinking. I weighed in at 163 lbs this morning and I’m honesty still shocked by that difference.
-My friends who drink are completely accepting of my decision. I was really afraid of what they would think when I first went sober but they have been incredibly supportive.
-A lot more people my age are making similar decisions to stop drinking. I thought being a 22-year old teetotaler (I turned 23 this week) would seem out of place but a whole lot of acquaintances have reached out over time to let me know that they too have made the decision to go sober.
-I can have fun while not being intoxicated. I’ve actually enjoyed being around other people without a drink in my hand.
-Non-alcoholic beers have really expanded their reach. Sure, some places still only offer O’Doul’s, but there have been so many other brands that I have tried and generally enjoyed.

This happened about a week ago but it took me a bit to digest...
I went down to the park, as I usually do now, a few days ago to relax and chill with the geese. I have a particular bench I’ve been sitting at there for years now. This particular day I was stressed and in some bad pain with my legs and my head ( this double vision has been causing me some terrible headaches) and I just needed to chill out. I sat there for a bit and as I was stretching my neck, what do I see on the ground under the bench? A pint of rum, unopened...
I can’t tell you how many times I was homeless, or just down bad, with no money, seconds away from having a seizure from alchohol withdrawals, in tears, begging “god” to find something just like this. Now I haven’t had a drink in over two and a half years, I honestly don’t even think about it. Hell, I’ll go into the liquor store to buy Red Bull if 711 is out, I really don’t consider it but, seeing that there really made me stop. 
As an addict I recognize the problems I have with substance abuse, I don’t think most people think to themselves after a bad day or a traumatic event “fuck it I’m going to go buy a handle, an eightball of something, and disappear under a bridge somewhere” but I know that in those moments they are a knee jerk reaction, a habit of falling on the one copping mechanism I had most my life. That’s always going to happen but this was different. In a split second I found myself really considering it...
I thought
 “What’s the point? I’m three years into this shit almost and still struggling as hard in a lot of ways as I was. Five years ago I was buying a home and now I haven’t had an income since that time. I struggle every single day behind the scenes with things no one even knows or sees. I am in pain 24/7 without even a tiny bit of solace. I’m lonely, I feel like it’s me vs the world andI just want a break. I would just want to not be for a little bit”
I sat there in that limbo for what seemed like an hour, staring at that fucking pint. Until I just decided to get up and walk away, I left the pint on the bench for maybe some older version of me wondering the streets looking for a bit of a break from this sometimes terrible now. 
I’m not perfect, I don’t try to be. I struggle more than anyone I know but, I don’t want to keep repeating the same cycles. Who knows maybe I’ll be struggling and lonely for the rest of my life but, at least ill have the pride in knowing I’m facing it. For all the development I’m achieving there’s still so much needed in some very basic places in my life but, for everything I have and am I can say I made that, from the dirt  myself and, I’m stronger than I think I even know. 
I needed to write this for myself and for anyone else that struggles with invisible monsters. I want these moments to be building and not destroying, I have faith in us.

First, I had the dream where I was offered a drink and I said no.  And in the dream it was accepted and fine, and we went about our merry dream ways having fun at whatever thing we dream people were doing.  Neat.  

Second, I had the other dream.  Much more vivid and memorable (to a point).  At a cousin's wedding, reception being held at one of my old stomping grounds.  The offer was made, and I said 'sure, what's a couple, it's been a while' and so slid into the booth with some family and got served by some bartenders from ages back.  Even in the dream, I knew where this was going to go, and dream me rationalized it and figured to just take an Uber home.  It was a great time, like a montage of bar hilarity and hijinks.  Then, nothing.  In the dream I woke up in my cousin's room, head screaming and body aching, knowing I was missing parts of the evening.  Ashamed.  Incredulous at my own behavior.  My mother (dead for years in reality) asked me what I'd done and where the car was and I couldn't remember.  It wasn't at the bar I'd left it at.  We'd have to drive around to find it.  She wasn't mad, not even disappointed, but I was.  Even playing the tape forward in my dream, things turned out worse than I expected.   I was pretty happy when the kid woke me up and asked me to come downstairs and make cinnamon rolls.

Why I'm optimistic on Day 3.","Support for yesterday's post on clear headed Saturday morning's at least tripled the karma count of my now second highest rated post, and it matters to me. It really does, I really appreciate it. 

My favorite comment was the cautious optimism from an old-timer. I appreciated that the most. 

Let me be clear about something: before the pandemic inspired bender, I found this sub as well as Annie's *This Naked Mind*. I sorted by top of all time and read the top 100 or so posts. My story over and over again, in fundamental ways. I had internalized all of it before the recent bender, which is why I called it nihilistic. 

I know that nothing I have to say here is novel, but I do think it's a good case of rock bottom not necessarily being rock bottom, but then again, perhaps the only reason I still have a career is it's too expensive to fire me. I need to perform better. 

Anyway, there's no longer any one reason to not drink. I have the forces of Logos, Ethos and Pathos conspiring for me to say **IWNDWYT** for a long time to come: 

* Absolutely no difference between this bender and the last 10, outside of knowing this one was hopeless. Otherwise, they followed the exact same pattern, and my career is exactly looking for patterns (Logos)
* For an otherwise healthy dude pushing 50, alcohol is my biggest health risk and it's not even close (Logos) 
* I am in a supremely privileged position, and throwing it away would be terrible (Ethos) 
* The day of my last drink, I raised a glass to commemorate my neighbor's friend, lost to alcohol, whom I share a name with (Pathos) 
* The day of my last drink, my last drunken decision, was to clear over $6k in credit card debt, which was mostly racked up with activities closely related to drinking (Pathos, the freedom of the paid debt)
*  The way my early in sobriety story resonated here (Pathos) 
* The silent prayers I saw Dad making while we sat at a bar (no tables available so we sat at the bar, it was the first time I've eaten inside since the plague started but he's both past 'Rona and has had both shots)  and I described all this (he's 30 years sober) (Pathos)

Still staying off the booze but not beating myself up about 'breaking my streak' because I think i did it the right way. Don't deprive yourselves of something nice once in a while, just be mindful.


So I haven't had a drop since the beginning of the year and last night a very good friend was in town. So we all got together like we used to and everyone wanted to take a shot of this really nice whiskey that the visiting friend brought.

 Nobody pressured me or made a big deal about me being careful with alcohol so I decided that this counts as a very special occasion and I asked for a light pour, a 'diet shot' haha and right before everyone took their shot I was nervous and in my head trying to decide if I was going to shoot it or just sip it. I smelled it first and tried to pick out all the flavors and ketones and esthers, then we all clinked glasses and I thought ""The old me would just shoot this down and move on to more, and that guy is dead, what is better me going to do?""

 So I just sipped it, I swished it around a bit and tried to taste everything that went into this really nice whiskey and appreciate how complex it was, I took it slow and talked with my friend about how I usually don't like whiskies but this one is great.

 Nobody got on my case for not shooting it and the friend that brought it even encouraged me to enjoy it. It felt grown up and manageable. I even tried a little of an expensive gin he brought too that he wanted me to try, and it was totally okay. I didn't reach for more booze, I didn't crave more other than to just taste the flavors but I didn't want to slip down the slope so I held back. And then I drove home with no issues.

I'm not going back to drinking, and honestly I'm not even going to count last night against myself because I handled it fine and I don't need to feel bad for enjoying a fine liquor in a mature way as long as I don't continue with it. Balance and enjoying life is equally as important as being disciplined about controlling urges. I wish you all the best, and I am not drinking with you tonight.",16,0

Came back home, did some work, then wife and I decided to take off to the beach. Came home this evening and hung out with the rest of the fam and made dinner. It may not be my ideal (or past life) weekend agenda, but it randomly hit me how fucking awesome doing all those things felt. On top of that, as I go to sleep,I will wake up well rested, with no guilt, and without having to worry about what I may have did or said while intoxicated. I was able to do all of those things today that brought joy to me and others around me. Had I been drinking, no one would have fun because I’d want more and more, and everyone around me would be walking on eggshells.

Well, it’s the end of the month, time to think about how I’ve progressed towards my goals, as well as make new goals for the month to come.

I've come a long way in March from someone who could barely walk in Feb.  Middle of March saw me walking 7-9K steps per day, with one day at 15K (a good day!).   This week I've hit 9-10K steps for 5/7 days.  I think next week we should be able to put our goal back at 10K steps a day for 6/7 days, no issues.  

The knee pain is minimal.  Right now it's around a 2/10 but it'll be gone tomorrow morning.  And that's with a 9K day of walking.  I do my PT exercises 5 days as week and while some of them TRULY suck, I feel good about making that commitment to making this knee issue a non-issue for the future.  I also do arm exercises.  

My goal this month is to add the core work and stretching back into the rotation.  

My weight loss has stalled.  Usually a setback like this would leave me hopeless and depressed, but instead I feel more interested in the process.  

For years I've avoided scales and doctors offices out of shame.  But although our society tells us that being overweight is a matter of personal and moral failure, the science I'm continuing to digest tells us it's infinitely more complicated than just ""having enough willpower.""  

I'm trying to refuse shame about my weight.  I'm trying to choose curiosity, instead.  What small habit can I work on this week to increase my health and wellbeing?  What about next week?  

And someday, after enough small but healthy and great habits have been instituted, real lasting change will be my reward.  

How has your month treated you?  Are you progressing on your goals?  Any new awesome habits you've worked on in March?

I'm excited to go for a long walk and do my physical therapy exercises today.  And it's my last week as your host for Shape-Up, so if anyone would like to take the reins as your friendly host in health, please drop myself or u/BelindaTheGreat a line.

Yesterday I decided was the day that I turn my life around. I’m luckier than some I suppose, in that my drinking hasn’t got me in any legal trouble, but it did cost me a very good job about 2 months ago. Honestly, I felt like it was unfair and that I was let go because of some personality conflicts. I was ignoring the fact that I have been a chronic binge drinker for almost a decade, with long periods of sobriety and longer periods of drinking. I haven’t been able to maintain a relationship for more than 6 months for the last 5 years. Can’t help but wonder how big of an effect alcohol had on that. For the last two months I haven’t been sober for more than a few hours. Most mornings I was still drunk by the time I was having another drink. Black out every night, wake up in a daze, continue the cycle. Some days I was blacked out by 4pm. I am an absolute one man wrecking ball, and a complete mess. 

About two weeks ago I started having a hard time eating food. I was eating maybe about half as much as I normally was, so I just drank more to make up for it. I started having suicidal thoughts and got very close to actually doing it. I was essentially on the same path as Nic Cages character in Leaving Las Vegas. My friends, one after the other, started telling me they were increasingly worried about me. I called my parents and said I don’t know what I’m doing, but I want help and I need to change because I’m not going to make it to the end of the year without ending up in jail or in the ground. My parents invited me to move back in with them, so today I hopped on a plane and decided to start my journey to sobriety and mental health. Today, for the first time in 2 months I have been sober for more than 12 hours. 

I know I have a long road ahead of me, but I am hopeful for the future. I have read this sub for quite some time and I love how inclusive and supportive it is. I am looking forward to contributing and having everyone on this sobriety journey with me.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Sunday - First thoughts of the day.

&#x200B;

First off I’d like to thank u/sweetmusiccaroline for hosting this past week's DCI.  Thank you so much for helping out the community.  And of course the ever wonderful u/sainthomer for allowing us the opportunity to give back.

&#x200B;

My morning thoughts have a funny way of setting the tone for the rest of the day.  Perhaps this is common, I’m not sure but it makes sense to me. 

&#x200B;

For a while now I have had the same morning thoughts almost on a daily basis.

&#x200B;

When I wake up, the very first thought that goes through my mind is how early it is.  Whether I wake up by alarm or naturally it’s earlier than I ever wake up.  And, yes it’s mainly because I get a good sleep and I go to bed now at a reasonable hour.  But, I end up thinking about how early it is and how glad that I have lots of daytime to do whatever it is I need or want to do.

&#x200B;

I can feel my muscles stiff and as I stretch the kinks out, a second thought comes to mind.  Obviously it comes from not drinking because I've been drinking for more than 30 years and I’ve become quite accustomed to feeling tired and listless.  Unmotivated and depressed.  The contrast  hits me quickly and I’m almost instantly reminded that I’m so glad that I’m not feeling like that anymore.

&#x200B;

And the final thought before my mind starts to wander is “what am I going to do today”.  This I feel is the most important of my thoughts for the morning.

&#x200B;

I know that these will eventually fade and be replaced with other things as I move through this journey, but maybe some of you have had the same experiences?

&#x200B;

How about you, if you chose to answer.  What thoughts have come to your mind as you wake?  Is it something that sets the tone or mood for the day?  Do you experience this or would you even want to?

&#x200B;

I want to wish every one of you strength.  Start your Sunday with a purpose!!!

I'm 2 weeks into my second go at not drinking. This weekend I feel great. My body feels like it has recovered from my weekend bouts of binge drinking. My sleep cycle is beginning to settle. It's still a bit broken but the bouts of insomnia are becoming less frequent. And as base as it sounds, my digestive tract is settling into a rhythm.

This week I have begun to address my coffee dependency. Last year I was averaging close to 10 cups of instant a day. Since beginning my new job in January I was down to about 4 per day. Today I have had one at this time, it is 1:30pm as I type this. My goal is to give up coffee in a week or two.

This morning I got up early, had my one caffeinated coffee and hit the gym. I then met up with my Sunday morning walking group for a walk by the river. The weather is beginning to cool here in northern Queensland. Meaning it is not steaming with humidity and the sun does not burn, as much. Our walk took about 50 minutes by the water for 3.94 km according to my smart watch. It was nice to be part of a group again rather than giving excuses for not going when I was really nursing the beginning of the 3 day hangover.

GSD\* stands for getting sh\*t done. For me that means catching up on readings for work, chores and self-care.

I’m 22 years old, and for the last 2 years I went from drinking with friends to drinking basically everyday to cope with life’s issues. It started whenever I was in an abusive relationship, drinking to cope with his anger/outbursts. It made it easier to deal with. Then when I left, the drinking kept going. It felt like a “safe haven” for me. Well that’s until  i found myself drinking every single day, and binge drinking on the weekends. My health took a bad turn, and I was on this cycle of barely eating all day, binge drinking, eating fast food, repeat. I told myself ok, I clearly have an issue - let’s just see how being sober feels. I hit my 4 month mark, then a few of my friends invited me for a get together last night (we no longer have to quarantine here). I thought after 4 months of being sober a few drinks would be fine, but halfway through my first drink I thought to myself “wow, I miss drinking I miss the taste/feeling”. I ended up getting absolutely blackout, got violent, ordered takeout and slept all day today and ignored my responsibilities. So...

But I won't relapse tomorrow or tomorrow night. I've figured out that going to NA or AA daily really helps me. So does exercise, and I have plans to go running with a friend early in the day. 

I'm kind of sad right now because my older brother was supposed to visit me today (I live two states away from my family and friends) and he flaked. I'm from a problem family (to say the least) so it's not crazy shocking but it's still disappointing. I'm not letting the feeling overtake me though -- I have my favorite comfort movie on (Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children lol) and am sitting here with my cat and my NA beer. My husband is putting his laundry on, he's got the beautiful soft indie music he always plays on. Life is good. 

I went to AA today cuz I was scared of the expanse of time between the afternoon and bedtime in which I would crave alcohol or cigarette or some type of drug. So I kept myself busy and around other people going through the same thing. AA was good. Funny stories. Supportive people. All talking about opportunities they lost because of alcohol, but then found hope -- or fears they've had and how they're overcoming it. 

I really really needed a community. I think NA and AA might have been what I've needed for a long time now. It took me 5 or 6 years of knowing I was addicted to finally seek structured help from anybody or anything outside of my husband. 

Anyhow, my first sober Saturday morning was pretty awesome. We went out to brunch with our two friends and then played basketball all afternoon with them! We're not what I would call a very athletic bunch, but we played hard and had suuuuch a good time. I don't think I would've done it if I was still drinking or abusing drugs! So I'm so so grateful for that. 

Writing about my days is helping keep me sober. I hope some part of what I've written helps somebody else, too. 

I'm gonna watch my movie, maybe read some of This Naked Mind, and go to sleep at a decent hour. My brother will either show up eventually, or he won't. I can't control anybody but me.

I'll leave my front door unlocked for him though.",21,0

I can’t believe we made it 8 years together and ended with me throwing you in a fucking lake where I left you. I am sorry for that, I think?

When we first met, I was 16, I actually didn’t even like you. You were bitchy and made my friends act dumb. But I was jealous I guess. They were getting with you and I wanted to stay away. But you snuck out and met up with us one night - Andrew, Thomas and me. I had heard about you and seen you around. I couldn’t help but stare sometimes. I mean fuck, you were beautiful. But I knew there was something weird about you. You were easy. But the way my friends talked about you I had to get some 1 on 1 time with you. Even though it ended up 3 on 1 that first night. I truly do not even remember most of the night, just that Thomas started with you, Andrew and I just watched - we were nervous - it was our first time. Then when Thomas was too fucked up to continue, I finished you off and you finished me. 

I felt weird the next day at school, a lot of people had already heard about it and I’ll be honest I talked a lot of shit about you. I knew I couldn’t get that “first time” back and I felt like I wasted it on you. But still, my feelings were changing toward you. I didn’t know what it meant at the time but I did know I was down to see you again.

We started seeing each other every weekend and I found myself looking forward to it. In fact, after we were going steady for about a year, you had introduced me to people and experiences I would’ve never imagined possible. Before I knew it, I was completely in love, like a fucking lovesick puppy. The homies told me to leave you but I told them to fuck off. They were jealous. All the time we spent in my room alone, the talks we had when out for a long drive, I’ll never forget all the times you brought me to tears, tears of laughter and sadness. I always had you to turn to.

About 5 years in we’d spend every night together and you are down for me in the morning in the shower too. Still to this day I miss that feeling.

Then I met “her” - my now fiancée - and I just left you, without even calling.  I didn’t see you for a while, we didn’t even talk for a few weeks. But this new girl knew what was up. She even asked about you. She wanted to hang out! I didn’t have to pretend like I didn’t like you! And it was awesome, she was cool with us hanging at first because she didn’t really know our history - our real history. I mean, eventually we all spent A LOT of time together. Looking back, it was probably too much. But we were having fun and it really actually felt like we could all make it work forever. I know I certainly thought so. But you wanted me to yourself. Your relationship with my girl was different and you could feel me being pulled in her direction. You stared making me feel like shit, I know you made me yell and scream at my new girl. We always fight over you.

Then one night, 2.5 years ago, you fucked with me for the last time. I had heard too many embarrassing stories of us together. You got me fat. You made me act like a complete asshole to the woman I was madly in love with. When we woke up the next morning and I heard all the dumb shit we did together. I cracked you in the mouth, gave you one last smooch and tossed you in the lake. Haven’t seen you since. Sorry for littering.",28,0

I was scrolling this sub yesterday, procrastinating completing and submitting uni assignments and got some inspiration to really take advantage of the fact that this sober journey I’m on really DOES feel different from the last few and I’m going to hold on and nurture that, tooth and nail if I have to.

Enter, fridge top vitamins: I took an iron tablet, vitamin C, fish oil, a probiotic and vitamin D3

Sleep hasn’t be tooo bad this time around (the free app Insight Timer is fantastic for guided sleep meditations/ meditations in general etc.) however, actually -waking up- sober every morning the past 14 days has sucked.
Until this morning! I woke up from my sleep and I was simply awake! It didn’t take me 45 minutes to get my sore eyes to stay open and build the willpower to crawl out of bed - I woke up and I was up!

Definitely want to get a Mega B+ vitamin to add to our fridge top collection now as apparently that’s great for folks on our journey - any other suggestions?

Edit disclaimer: I’m absolutely not saying GO OUT NOW AND BUY VITAMINS THEY WILL MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER - I’m just sharing a tidbit of how I had a markedly better experience waking up this morning opposed to the last 13 mornings and the only change in my routine was that I took some random vitamins and that may have played a role 🤗",12,0

I credit my son. He gives me the reason to be better.

I've only really thought about it in the context of coworkers going out after work and me shouting out a few recommendations as I leave for home. There's some great beers out there!

Cannabis has been my crutch. If I'm being honest it satisfies the addict in me. The different concentrates, the vaporization equipment. The whole process mimics my relationship with alcohol in a way. I'm fine with that. Cannabis has never caused a problem in my life.

It's strange to me. How a year ago I couldn't imagine the idea of doing anything without alcohol. I would have planned a day around a fun bar or a wine tasting.

Now? I was bummed the other day realizing I had left my MMJ vape at home an hour away. But my son and I ran wild around the Children's Science Museum and I quickly didn't give a flying fart in space about anything but discovering the world with my son.

I want to share a technique that might help some of us. I was following this idea without knowing that it is actually a research-backed technique.

The method is straightforward. The main idea is to **make it unsatisfying**. This will work well for short/medium-term goals. If you repeatedly practise this method, you can end up stop drinking.

1- I've decided a duration that I want to stay away from alcohol. - 1 month

2- I commit money that makes me uncomfortable to lose. Make this amount visible to you. - $500

3- If I drink before my deadline, I'll burn committed money. Actually, burn it with a lighter. I've lost.

4- If I achieve my goal, I'll take it back. Spend it to have fun.

Losing money (**making it unsatisfying**) motivates some people. There might be additional ways to practice this method on top of focusing on money. This is a framework that can help some people to control their alcohol consumption.",3,0

It was tough but I was feeling really good about my progress and started to deeply reflect on my drinking problem. I ate better, was more active and present, and also dramatically reduced my cigarette smoking over the week.

But last night I gave into a craving and bought a case of beer with my partner. I thought I’d let myself have one or two... well of course, that turned into 8 and a half tall cans. I thought a lot about my drinking while I was drinking and finally fully realized it’s harder for me to stop once I start than it is to actually just get through a drink craving when I’m sober. 

I ended up feeling sick at the end of the night, smoked way too many cigarettes, stayed up too late doing literally nothing, woke up feeling like shit, ordered fast food instead of cooking a healthy breakfast, and wasted most of what could have been a productive and enjoyable Saturday. What were the benefits of choosing to drink? There are literally none. I made a big list this morning about the downsides to my choice to drink and thought hard about what I may have gained from it. I truly gained absolutely nothing positive from choosing to drink last night.

I started seeing an addictions counselor around 4 years ago, but was in complete denial that I'm an alcoholic. I knew I had a problem with pain pills, but I was not willing to let alcohol go.

My therapist encouraged me to not drink for a weekend, I only made it 30 hours. He suggested that I try AA, and lucky for me I really like it. 

My friends in AA have helped so much, and understand how to help an alcoholic who doesn't want to drink anymore. 

My life isn't perfect these days, but it's so much better than before I got sober. I can be authentic, present for my family, and find pleasure in small things. I have reignited my passion for making pottery and knitting. I have gotten two promotions at work. I have watched and remembered so many good shows. I sleep well almost every night, and feel great in the morning when I wake up. I have lost 10 lb and maintained a healthy weight. I don't want to die anymore.

I also see a lot of posts from people who say that they are quitting for good and that last night was their last drink. I also applaud these people.

I would like to share my experience with getting sober however, and maybe it will help someone. When I decided to check into rehab in April of 2019, I was desperate enough to do ANYTHING it took to stop. I was completely broken down mentally and physically, suffering withdrawal symptoms and dreaming about suicide on a daily basis. 

Checking into rehab was one of the scariest moments of my life, but I was able to do it because I had already made the decision that I was going to get sober and that was that. I made the decision with no reservations and acted on it before I could second-guess myself. I told my boss about my problem, found a rehab, and just jumped in. Things had finally gotten bad enough to motivate me to change. 

This is the main lesson I think - you have to be ready, and you have to want it more than anything. Nothing else mattered to me at that time in my life. If I lost my job, so be it. My car, my apartment, whatever. I would have given all of it up just to not drink anymore. There's nothing wrong with not being ready to quit. I know that just for me, I had to get to the point in my addiction where I was literally shaking at 4 p.m. on a Wednesday in order to change. 

I was in rehab for 11 days, went home, slipped a couple times, but have now been sober over a year. I never say that I won't drink again, because I might. But not today. Good luck!",26,0
526,2021-03-17 12:47:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/m74qa6/one_week_sober/,One week Sober,"Hey guys. I posted last Tuesday night when I had finally met my tipping point. I'm happy to say that I have now gone a full week since deciding to stop drinking. The last time I went this long without booze was on a fishing trip to the Minnesota boundary waters in 2015, so this is a huge step for me.

The advice and support that I've received from this sub so far has been amazing; it takes some special types of people to take time out of their days to help complete anonymous strangers like me. I hope to pay it forward inside and outside of this sub in future.

To elaborate on my story and to hopefully relate to others that may be in the same situation here's a quick breakdown of what brought me me to this moment and what I plan to do moving forward (sorry if this post comes off as a bit long).

I'm a 31 year old man living in the US (WI) that started drinking around age 15. It was fun and didn't seem like a problem until I reached the age of about 23. I was working a garbage job in a new city where I didn't know anyone. I would sit in my apartment and drink rum while playing video games when not working. I moved on to other jobs and other places but the habit followed me. My work has never suffered too much but everything else has.

It's only been a week but I'm already feeling very optimistic. For the first time in awhile I'm making plans for the future, plans to invest in myself. I'm feeling less nervous about starting a long term relationship with someone; where I used to feel like I wasn't good enough because I was basically useless after 5pm. I can finally accept someone's invitation to go out and do something fun in the afternoon, instead of making up excuses.

Again, thanks for being here dudes. If I can pull this off it will for real be one of my greatest achievements. I have a long way to go and the withdrawals have be tough, but it will be worth it to get my life back again.  IWNDWYT",9,0

I was with my girlfriend at her friends house and playful banter with another girl was taken too far (nothing crazy happened, an almost kiss or so I’m told) I was blackout drunk, I don’t remember most of it. I would never have done any of that sober. It was all fun and games until I took it too far as I usual do under the influence. I betrayed trust and I hate myself for it. It will never happen again. I hate that I jeopardized my relationship. Ugh.

529,2021-03-17 12:20:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/m74436/st_patricks_day/,St. Patrick's Day,"Today is a day that is often thought of as a drinking holiday.  I know that in my past St. Patrick's day was often a day where I got wasted.  I'd start drinking in the morning and continue until I vomited, passed-out, and/or did something really stupid that I later regretted.  I used to love this holiday.  I think that it made my own drinking seem acceptable, because many people do drink and by comparison it seemed 'normal' for me to be drunk on this day.  In truth, this was just an excuse I used to make my own drinking problem seem acceptable, at least for one day a year.  St. Patrick's Day does not have to be about drinking, though many view that as a necessary activity when celebrating the holiday.  I'm writing to share some tips I have learned on how to attend events/parties that involve drinking alcohol, when you yourself are remaining sober.  

1.  Don't go to an event with alcohol unless you are comfortable with your sobriety.  If you're really struggling or early in your sobriety, it's best to skip events with alcohol until you are comfortable.
2. Before you go, have an 'exit strategy'.  Drive yourself or go with a friend/family member who is sympathetic and supportive of your desire to stay sober.  If you go to an event and the temptation or pressure to drink becomes overwhelming, make an 'Irish exit' and depart.
3. When you arrive, go straight to the bar and get yourself a drink (a coke, ginger ale, club soda, etc.)  People tend not to bother you if you have a drink in your hand.  Most don't know/don't care if it has alcohol in it.
4. If someone asks you why you aren't drinking alcohol, be prepared and/or have rehearsed your answer ahead of time.  My normal answer is ""I'm not drinking today.""  Full stop, no further explanation needed.
5. If someone becomes intrusive or overly inquisitive about why you aren't drinking alcohol, there are many valid reasons.  'I'm the designated driver', 'I'm on medication', etc.  Some people just have a hard time accepting it when others around them aren't drinking alcohol, give them a brief answer and exit the conversation.  True friends will be supportive and not press you on this.  People that do seemingly have a problem with your being sober likely have an unaddressed issue with their own drinking.

You can have fun at parties and events without drinking, when you're comfortable you can definitely attend social events involving alcohol without drinking yourself and have fun doing so.  When you do, you will likely notice how other people act sloppy, say ridiculous things, and slur their words with terrible-smelling breath when they get drunk.  Realize that you used to behave like this and take it as motivation to continue your quest for sobriety.  I hope this is helpful, today can be a tough test of resolve/willpower to stay sober when it seems alcohol is everywhere.  If anyone has any other advice or tips on how to navigate today or attend events with alcohol, please share!

I'll make Irish stew for St. Patrick's day tomorrow!"" (I'm not Irish). The recipe called for Guinness so I went to the store to get that and potatoes. Now I don't drink Guinness or even beer - I hate the stuff - but of course when I was buying the Guinness my inner Bilbo Baggins (when he sees the ring at Rivendell) came out and thought ""Why shouldn't I buy a 26 of vodka? It IS Tuesday, after all, and I've had a stressful day at work"". Rang it through on the credit card. For some reason my bank e-mails both me and my husband when the tap function is used on the card and tells the amount. So I know he will already know I've spent too much at the store on just potatoes. I come home and declare ""I was weak"" and proceed to pour myself a vodka soda and watch Rupaul's Drag Race. I had had a stressful day at work and explained this as the reason for getting the vodka. I have not told him I want to quit drinking but we have agreed not to buy alcohol during the week to save money. He very kindly does not chastize me but I know he disapproves. He then sees the Guinness (which I explain is for Irish Stew) and asks if he can have one. Of course, I say, I only need one can for the recipe. So now I have enabled him (he is also trying to cut down on drinking) and I am a terrible wife. He contentedly drinks his one can of Guinness and I proceed to polish off half the bottle of vodka. I have recently learned that smoking some pot (it's legal here) is great when I drink because it enhances the intoxicating effect, so I actually end up drinking less when I smoke it. Healthy, right? But pot while drinking is basically like taking ambien for me, I don't remember anything afterwards and until bed time. I assume I had a great time because I was posting all kinds of happy comments on facebook and texting friends with random memes. But of course I woke up this morning feeling like crap, hungover, unmotivated, ashamed, embarrassed. And half of that bottle is still in the freezer and there are 3 Guinnesses waiting to be made into stew. I won't drink the beer - hate the stuff. But that bottle is there and it's cold and inviting for the inevitable 3 o'clock today.

It would be so easy for me to drive down to the liquor store and buy a bottle of rum. No one would know. No one would judge. I could just get drunk and temporarily numb my depression that has been chewing at me for the past 23 days with new vengence since I last had a drink.

I haven't yet. I feel like mentally, I'm worse off right now than when I would drink. I'm angry, depressed, and crying daily. I struggle constantly with that fucking urge to say, ""Screw it, let's have that one drink!"" My depression was why I started, a series of life alternating events propelled it about five years ago (loss of a parent and some other stuff). Covid just made it a 100 times worse. Even being sober, I don't feel like I've really changed. I'm just as depressed as I was five years ago, maybe a bit worse off. I'm trying to take the rights steps, stick with my meds, and I'm in therapy but I still feel the same. I don't feel comfortable in my own skin. I'm not happy. I still feel the same, just five years older.

I'm trying, honestly I am. But I feel adrift at sea. That was why I was reluctant so long to try to stick with sobriety; I was afraid. And right now, 23 days in, I keep telling myself just have to make it through the day. From reading all these amazing posts, I get the message good things come to those who wait. I have to be patient. But it doesn't help me from feeling like shit in the meantime.

My relationship with alcohol has been troublesome for over a decade, even though it took me a very long time to admit that to myself. Today is my Day 3.

I'd like to be very clear that it's not my first Day 3. It's not my second Day 3 either. TBH I've kind of lost track of the amount of times that I have tried to make this change and there have been a LOT of Day 3's. It's been over 4 years since I truly admitted to myself that I need to figure this part of my life out, and since then I've been on and off with my attempts to stop drinking. 

For the past few months, I have been drinking fairly heavily while I was laid off from my job and sitting alone at home with nothing to do. This year has been hard for me, like it has been for everyone. But even though I had started binge drinking again, I was still subscribed to this subreddit. I believe that a part of me knew that things were only going to improve if I learned how to set down the bottle and that part of me was preventing me from giving up entirely and unsubscribing. 

It can be hard reading these threads when you've fallen into the old habits of drinking to numb your emotions, because it can feel like you are being reminded of your failure. Sometimes I would see a thread come up and my inner critic would immediately go on overdrive, chastising me for why I hadn't figured this out yet. Other times, I would feel jealous of other people who had things so well figured out while I was sitting at home day drinking and depressed. 

I have decided once again that it is worth going through the hard work of changing my life for the better, but it wasn't an easy decision. The reason that I am making this post is because I want to communicate to the people who are on the fence about quitting, people who are in-between attempts, and people who are nervous about taking the first step. Here are a few reflections that I've had over the last few days that I think might be helpful:

- Fear of failure isn't a reason not to try stopping drinking. Even if you fail at stopping drinking, the worst case scenario is that you're going to end up back where you are now. But if you're successful? Your life can change in such positive ways. You'll have more money, more time, better health, and you'll likely be in a better frame of mind. 

- Just because you may have failed in past attempts of stopping drinking doesn't mean that you're incapable of success. Stopping drinking is hard, and it's not something that most people succeed at on their first try. But that's the same as most things in life. When you were a kid, did you stop trying to ride a bike the first time you fell down? Most of the time, failing is part of the path to success. The important thing is that you don't give up, and you learn from your past failures and make your next attempt while being more prepared.

- You can decide to stop drinking at any time. You do not need to hit rock bottom or experience a change in your life circumstances for it to be worthwhile. The decision comes from inside you, not from the circumstances around you.

- The fact that you may currently be addicted to drinking right now does not mean that there is something inherently wrong with you as a person. Everyone has their own struggles to deal with in life, and this might be one of yours, but you are capable of overcoming your struggles and coming out stronger as a person. 

Anyways, I hope that this post reaches the eyes of someone who was in a similar place to where I have been the last few months, but even if it doesn't, this was cathartic to write. If anyone else here has anything helpful to add, I hope they do so in the comments.

I hope everyone has a fantastic St Patricks Day, and IWNDWYT!",12,0

This is day 100. I've been drinking since I was 18, now 33. Among the years were scattered a few blackouts, a million hangovers, and one long string of haze and shame. I never got in trouble and it never was a ""problem"" in my mind. 

Until it was. Drinking changed at some point, and I think admitting that was the first step in my sobriety and recovery. I wasn't in control any more. I couldn't have just one. I always wanted more. It didn't feel right.  

It became as routine as breathing and tied to every activity, as if it was liquid gold that increased the quality of everything I did. Wrong. 

I would feel great for a few minutes. Then, hours of trying to enjoy the things I love only to realize I was too sloppy to do so. Too sloppy to disc golf, too dangerous to climb, too rubbery to run or exercise, too sloppy to play guitar, too sloppy to enjoy a video game, too sloppy to love my wife and child. Cringe-worthy impulsive interactions with longtime friends that felt so damn funny in the moment. Cue the rudderless anxiety when trying to sleep. Cue the 3am wake up call from anxiety and sweat. Cue the hangover and shame, loop to drinking to crush the feelings. Ad nauseum. 

Everything in my life is better without alcohol. Everything. 

I am funny, social, loving, patient, kind, interesting, engaged, motivated, and I have my sense of wonder back. All without you. All those years I told myself I couldn't feel emotions? Just you lying. I am able to be present and enjoy life for what it is, for the inherent joy that exists through the adventure together.

TL;DR: Make sure you take care of yourself afterwards. Make sure it's for you and not anyone else.

I apologize in advance for the stream of consciousness, but I used to frequent this subreddit about 3-4 years ago when I was looking for an excuse to stop drinking. Many of you recommended the book, ""This Naked Mind"" by Annie Grace. I see the hype behind it cause, after a week long bender, I was successfully able to stop drinking upon reading that book. After a couple years of sobriety, I thought about stopping by to tell you guys what kind of impacts it made, since my life was ""perfect"".

First, I'll give some background on my continuing journey. Like many of you, I started drinking in high school. I never planned on drinking, and was known for being the sober perfect student. I excelled in academics and sports, and got an academic scholarship to University. Most my friends did drink though, and eventually the FOMO got to me. My first time drinking was also used as an outlet for frustration and disappointment. I just got turned down by a girl that I really liked, so I was emotional as a teenager and next party, I decided to go for it.

Since I started in high school, it was about every weekend since for the next decade or so. I don't remember missing a weekend, and as someone in a fraternity, there were ample opportunities. I developed a sort of reputation as someone who's always down to get drunk, and as you can imagine this took a toll on my academic career. Lost my scholarships, and barely graduated a year later, but hey C's get degrees, right? I didn't think it was a big deal. Luckily I did oddjobs and have a decent work ethic to graduate with zero debt.

I got a decent job out of college at a local engineering firm. There were about 20 new hires that were all my age, so the party didn't stop there. I hated that job though, and I found myself living for the weekends. I was what you would call a functioning alcoholic. Without getting into too many details about my job and why it was awful, I got laid off a little after a year in. After that I was lost. I wanted to do anything, but engineering, so I decided to teach. Luckily it wasn't a difficult transition.

I don't want to say I was the best teacher, but at a low income school, I was probably the best that many of them had. Because I cared. It was the first time I felt that I had purpose. Yeah my salary was cut in half, but it was worth it. The stress was killer though. It was quite the burden to put the weight of all my students on my back, so at nights when I was grading, I would typically drink. It was manageable at first, but eventually it takes more and more. Then I started showing up to school hungover, and this is when I realized it was affecting my job.

You have to be on your A game if you want to be a good teacher, and after going to school after I pissed myself drunk the night before, I had to make some changes. I also started dating someone who didn't drink and I wanted to be better for them, but it was mostly my students that made me stop. So I did. I read that book and I stopped cold turkey.

The withdrawals were real though. My whole social life revolved around drinking and it took me about 9 months to a year to start feeling normal. My next year of teaching was stellar though. I had high praise from faculty and my students loved my classes. I didn't stop there though. I decided to get my Master's. I found some connections and got it fully paid for. I made more money going to school full-time than teaching. I did this to make more money and provide for a better life with the girl I wanted to marry. I stopped drinking for my students, but I continued for her. I can honestly say that I had no intentions or desire to drink ever again. I can say I definitely wouldn't have gone for these opportunities if I had continued drinking.

We eventually moved in together and life was perfect, or so I thought... I got a job offer from a place across the country (1200 miles away). I had about a year left to plan my life and after talking with my SO, we were going to make the move. My program was very demanding and there's no way I could've made it through, if I was drinking. I was starting to feel comfortable in my sober skin, and felt proud that I could be social at bars and weddings without any alcohol. Annie Grace was right. You become the light house that others flock to when they see how well you're doing without alcohol. I was a motivation to friends and family. I got crazy fit, I made a lot of money with crypto and stocks, I thought I had everything figured out and people noticed.

About 1.5 years into sobriety, my SO tells me that she missed drinking with me. (She never drank more than half a beer, so I still considered sober.) Not gonna lie... That statement fucked me up. I felt that I had finally achieved what I wanted. I had a life plan with a good job lined up and I was able to provide for us. I won't pretend that I was perfect in this relationship or that I'm not at fault, but the way she handled it still doesn't sit well with me. Fast forward, and I'm about to graduate and we're going to move across the country, she makes me plan out our life to a T during these preceding months. I know she was anxious as I was moving from everything we've ever known, but since she was coming with me, I wasn't worried.

About a month before I graduate, she leaves me out of seemingly nowhere. It was difficult to have your life/plans ripped out when only a few weeks before, we're looking at houses across the country to start our new life. She took our dog even... I was lost again, and drinking didn't cross my mind. I would've dropped everything for her, but she says it's too late, so I move across the country. 

I've had my same group of friends for most of my life. People I've known since gradeschool, so this was the first time I was completely on my own. How do you meet new people? I started going to bars. I started online dating, and meeting someone at a bar, seems to be the go-to. After a couple interactions, I felt lame if they're drinking and I just got a water, so I started to order a beer. That's when my ex's words, of I was more fun when I drank started to ring in my head. I don't typically have an issue getting with girls, and I didn't want a serious relationship, so I didn't think it was a problem. I could sip on one beer for an hour and still be fine. It really wasn't bad, but then the pandemic hit about a month after me moving here.... 

That's when things started spiraling. I think everyone tends to have depressive tendencies, but I can say I never felt truly depressed until 2020. I could see my ex started dating some guy seriously after about 2 weeks after our 3 year relationship, so instead of me going through the coulda, shoulda, woulda's about my past relationship, I couldn't bare the thoughts, so I turned to alcohol.

Fortunately and unfortunately, I didn't really have to work. I was still getting paid my full salary while they tried to iron things out. The boredom, the depression, not having to do anything, I was losing my mind. Started drinking about 1 and a half bottles of wine a night, but weekends were fair game. So I can basically count on one hand the amount of days I was sober during this period. I had gained about 20lbs, lost my 6 pack and got crazy out of shape. This didn't help my situation

I still found some girls to date, and have already sabotaged more relationships in this last year then the decade earlier. My last one ended with her telling me to get help. (She's a good person and I respect the hell out of her). Here I am though. Seeking help on online forums. Funny thing about getting help, is it's not easy. Not surprisingly, because of the pandemic, I'm having trouble finding a therapist.

For me, I know exactly what to do. I need to stop drinking, start working out more, sleep more, eat better, spend more time in nature and hang out with friends. That's the thing with depression though. I'm making active choices not to do these things and I don't know why. I've done it before, so I just need to have the strength to do it again.

I had kind of a mental breakdown a few weeks ago. Finished a nice 750 of vodka before lunchtime and just started crying. I reached out to friends drunkenly and they were all understandably worried. They know that I've been drinking again. Luckily, I have a friend that moved down here and I asked him to come over. He didn't hesitate, he was just there. I don't think I was going to hurt myself, but I've never thought so strongly about it. If it wasn't for my friends, my dog, and my job, I don't know where I would be. I have a great support system and a career that I love. Not everyone has that, and I'm truly fortunate. I'm 3 weeks sober, right now, and I'm just trying to take things one day at a time.

I don't know where I was going with this, but it just felt good to get these things off my chest.",13,2

I hope you realize that this holiday is just another excuse we use to drink to excess. And when I say drink to excess, I mean drink all the green beer, whiskey, and whatever else until you barely remember how you made it home. 

Looking back at my drinking when it comes to these holidays brings up a flood of emotions. 

❌ Sad that I drank to that level and the damage I was doing to my mind and body.

❌ Happy because, let's be real, not all of the experiences when we drank, were bad. 

❌ Grateful that drinking Alyson is in the past, and I NEVER want to see her again. 

I remember going to the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Newport, RI, before I even had my son. I drank all morning and afternoon, ate at some pub and then passed out at 6 pm. I woke up the next day throwing up, anxiety levels through the roof and wondering who I texted, what I said or did, and vowed that I would never drink again. Ha! Oh, that lie I always told myself until it was too late. 

Don't let yourself be fooled by the glamorization of big holidays so that you can justify you're drinking. It's just another marketing tactic by those who will profit from the holiday. That's it.

How f\*cking empowering is it to say I DON'T DRINK on a big boozy holiday like today?  Celebrating my FIFTH Sober St. Patrick's Day and couldn't be any more grateful for this life!",18,0

A little over three years ago I totaled my car and decided I needed to stop drinking entirely. That mentality and the humiliation of what I’d done kept me sober for a couple months. But soon enough, without even hardly noticing, I was back to sneaking pints and tallboys. When I was around my partner and friends I would abstain but I made sure I got my fix when opportunity presented itself. It didn’t help the jobs I could get always provided easy access to free and discounted booze. 

But then a year ago, the pandemic was ramping up. I had to leave my job and move. Everything felt so unpredictable and strange that day, except for one thing: this was my chance to get clean. I didn’t know what I was going to do for my future but I knew I’d had my true last drink that day. It’s been a wild year; I’ve managed to get my life in a semblance of order. But for the first time in ten years I can say I have not been drunk in a year. 

It sucks because everyone in my life still genuinely believes I quit three years ago. I never got caught and I never confessed, not even to my partner. Part of me is just glad I proved to *me* that I can do it. It’s a sad perspective on the things drinking has taken away from me. I thought it made me more sociable and outgoing, but it isolated me in the end. I’m glad I found this sub to share the good news with. ONE WHOLE TRIP AROUND THE SUN!

The anxiety of not fitting this AA mold and not knowing if that was my tribe truly fucked with me for the last three days. I was spiraling and overwhelmed; beating myself up and panicking of where I will go or end up. I am not a fortune teller, neither is any member of AA. The fear of “without AA you will drink and die” seems counter productive. I worked an honest program but was not ready to give the pot up. That brought on all these stipulations that just made me feel alienated. I rather work on cigarettes first IMO. 

After researching, speaking to my partner and therapist, and journaling. I realize I can apply the principles of AA to my daily life and continue to take it one day at a time. The toolbox can still be used.

I now realize a place that puts stipulations on what an alcoholics journey looks like when asking for help isn’t for me; and that is okay. 

I am grateful for AA speaker podcasts, this thread, my therapist, and this mornings stream of consciousness.

Last withdrawal ended up in a&e. Managed 30 days sober after that. Relapsed straight back to a bottle a day, sometimes more.

I'm a secret drinker, nobody knows but me, my husband thinks I stopped a year or two ago (I didnt) I just carried on hiding bottles. I ended up not drinking to get drunk, but just to not withdraw and to function.

I just wanted to say that today, I told my doctor. So now someone else knows. I thought I could fix this myself. I cant. I need help. 

So today, despite feeling like I am losing my mind, unable to get out of bed, and not even able to keep water down without vomiting, I am feeling a little positive, that I've asked for help because I cannot do this anymore.

I started drinking in college. It was heavily supported by everyone I knew. I once drank 10 beers in a hour in front of my Grandfather and he told me he was proud of me...lol. From billboards, commercials, and music; alcohol and drugs get a fantasy-like representation that adds to the euphoria of the drug itself. 

This warped perspective gives people the perception that drinking/drug use will make them feel better, provide escape, or allow them to have fun. And most people who can control their intake agree with this. But when someone gets the wrong impression and over does it, they are made an outcast and a failure. 

With how hard life is, in addition to the amount of celebration drugs and alcohol are given, are you really surprised someone is shooting up on the street corner? Are you really shocked that someone ended up homeless and lost everything? All because you didn't, can you really not perceive in the slightest how it's possible someone else went too far? 

When a unhealthy view on something is encouraged, it becomes believable. 

I hate it when someone who drinks in moderation says ""I don't understand how someone can go that far. I would never do that. They are irresponsible and stupid for letting it get out of hand like that."" Is it really that hard to imagine? Why someone would go that far? Are we addicts that much of an anomaly that you cannot in anyway what so ever wrap your brain around it? 

Under the right conditions and circumstances, anyone might be able to fall into addiction.

I just find it so hypocritical that society pushes alcohol so much but then at the same time treats people who get addicted to it like absolute trash. The seed was planted somewhere, otherwise they would have never picked it up in the first place.

There are certainly people who hurt others...those people would have done it regardless of booze. Most drunks/addicts are not dangerous people. They are sad and need help. But the same society who told them they were a stiff if they didn't drink is now telling them they are a loser because they drink too much.

Then I took it back out. Finally I closed out of the app and picked up the carton. I opened it up, it felt so strange. Heard the familiar click. It didn’t taste the same. It wasn’t repulsive, just different. 

It wasn’t comforting. It wasn’t relaxing. There was a bit of giddiness, as I felt the old familiar warmth and tipsy feeling. Then I just got over it.

For 4 years, I drank every night. In December, after multiple nights blackouts and pissing all over the carpet, I decided things needed to change. To do so, I had setup rules for myself with the drinking. Only on the weekend, only with other people, etc. for a few months this worked. 

I’d stay sober Sunday through Thursday, then get absolutely blasted every Friday or Saturday. Then I started letting myself getaway with things little by little. “There’s a few beers in the fridge from last weekend” I’d tell myself on a Thursday night. It all got out of hand and I really felt as if I lost control on Monday, when me and my partner went to the bar for trivia night to meet up with a her friend. 

I blacked out sometime around 11pm, started being absolutely incomprehensible, fell square on my face when I got home, and had to be guided to bed. 

I had a realization yesterday , with the worst headache of my life, that I have 2 options. Keep living this life that CLEARLY isn’t working, constant hangover-induced anxiety, and making a fool for myself. Or figure out how to deal with the demons and live a sober life. 

I want to be sober. I truly do. It’s just so hard. Especially seeing everyone around me enjoy themselves on a Friday night. I want to drink responsibly, but I can’t. And seeing everyone enjoy themselves around me, when I can’t control myself, is HARD. I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this, and I really appreciate the ability to vent here. 

Last night was night #1 and the start of a long journey. Tonight will be night #2. I’m going to get through this one night at a time.

It was oh so frighteningly normal to drink, all the god damn time. It's a birthday! It's the weekend! Its been a rough day at work! Celebrate good news! Commiserate bad news! Happy doctors check up! Kids birthday parties (wth). Evenings out! Evenings in! Your average Tuesday! After 25+ years a drinker, i was done. Driving out to pick up wine one evening, I admitted to myself whilst sitting at a red traffic light that i was only drinking for the buzz, for the escape, for the numbingb effect: I quit there and then. This is not sustainable i thought, and my family does have a minor history of problems with alcohol, so I should back away from this now, fast, and not look back. I kept it rather quiet, and used this sub to share. I knew it would alienate some family and friends, and it did. My mother hates that i don't think, but I can love with that. Everyone's rock bottom is different. Everyone's journey to sobreity is different. Me? I drank milk for 6 months, then diet soda for a few years, now i buy sparkling flavored water, and a little soda, and flavored teas. My standard response is 'lifestyle choice', most people who ask any further questions normally have a problem themselves. It took a few years for my mindset to change, but it has. I just don't really think about wanting to drink anymore. I reflect on the guilt of bad nights, drunk nights, nights in the ER after falling over (I was a happy but clumsy drunk); you learn to let the guilt go, but you don't forget the felling,in fact its that feeling of lingering but accepted shame tgat drives me forward. I'm no longer abusing my body. I'm present in my life all the good damn time, which is hard, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I deserve a sober life. And so do you. Whatever your journey, whatever your rock bottom, read the naked mind book (or listen to the audio book!), make a plan, and derived what kinda help you'd like. Medical? (You can always go cold turkey safely) Emotional (Your gonna be emotional)? Practical (need someone to help you drive past the store)? And most importantly, join and stay part of this amazing community. For me, it felt like being stuck on the interstate and missing all the stop signs: i eventually found one, and got the hell off.

Cravings still creep in every now and again, but with the knowledge I’ve gained at rehab, AA and within this group, I know how to combat them. For me, one is too many, and one more is never enough.

I would use alcohol and being drunk to quell the anxiety and fuel my mania, and it would lead to the worst crashes filled with anxiety and at my worst times, suicidal thoughts. I’ve never harmed myself and knew to call someone to be with me the few times that happened, but it felt like I would turn into a different person. If I were too wired to sleep and too anxious not to distract myself and my mom took my phone jokingly to help me sleep, or when my boyfriend would try to explain my anxious thinking and the unhealthy cycle of thoughts it kept me trapped in, I would just.. feel so dark. I would look up at them and feel so hateful. It’s something I’d never felt before and it’s not who I am. I never want to feel that way again. 

This has turned into a tangent, but what I really wanted to say is that despite the anxiety I feel this morning, I don’t want to drink it away. I took some magnesium and my as-needed anxiety medication and am making some chamomile tea and trying to rest before I go into work tonight. Work is a huge trigger for me, simply because it is one of the most important things to me (I love my career and I feel like it gives my life extra meaning), so of course it’s a huge focal point and I find any part of it to zero in on when I’m feeling anxious. But I’m not going to drink. 

The other trigger is boredom. I’m off for three days after tonight and that will be a true test. I plan on deep cleaning my apartment, going for a hike (weather permitting), and having a self-care night. My backup is to go for a walk whenever I feel cravings, to give them time to pass and also get some endorphins going.

I’m made it one more year. 12 years of good days and bad days and some close calls. Along the way I made some guidelines to keep me on the path. If they help anyone else then maybe I can save them years of trying to figure some of this out. If not and these are already obvious then you are smarter than me.



1. You have to want to quit.

All the self-help books and all the support groups in the world are not going to help you if you don’t actually want to quit.

2. Find a reason to quit.

Any reason outside of yourself that can make you accountable. Start small and build from there.

3. Redirect the the urge to something good. 

As an addict I have the superhuman ability to pour all of myself into something that gives me joy. Replacing the bad behaviors with something beneficial can help help while keeping you busy.

4. Never get bored.

I’m a machine of habit when I get bored I get back into whatever habit that’s easiest for me. 

5. If needed remove the people and things that allow you to continue the addiction. 

This one sucks. It hurts to lose someone that was close to you but when the people around you aren’t helping you then you need to think about what you really need to do and sometimes that means cutting people out. This goes for physical locations and inanimate objects as well.

6. Find anything that works for you.

What works for you may not help someone else. What works for me might seem alien and totally unreasonable to somebody else but as long as it keeps me clean then that’s what I need to do.


7. Get help if you need it.

You don’t have to do this alone. If you feel yourself falter or begin to fail there are thousands of people that know how to help and might even know exactly what you are going through.


You are all awesome.

You can do this.

Never be bored and never stop.

Good luck to all of you and Happy St. Patrick’s Day.

A friend convinced me for some food and just a few. All was fine, I was ready to go home after four glasses of wine (which to me is reasonable but I’m realizing is not). Then a guy hit me up and it was all over from there. I “had fun” even though I don’t remember more than an hour. I woke up to three empty bottles of wine, an empty bottle of whiskey, and PBRs all over my apartment. Two people did that, after I had already had the equivalent of a bottle of wine. I am a 5’2’’ 120 lb female, I don’t know how I haven’t ended up in the hospital. 

I’m good about not using the hair of the dog. I don’t want alcohol after I’ve partied hard, I feel like shit and it grosses me out for a few days after. But that’s my problem, I easily go all week without a drink or wanting one. Everything goes out the window when the weekend rolls around. I went out drinking Sunday, quite literally all day. Woke up Monday morning not even realizing what day it was until my supervisor texted me..... holy shit it’s Monday and I’ve already slept through two meetings. Luckily, I have a good reputation at work so I didn’t get into too much trouble (oh I’m taking PTO today! So sorry I must have forgotten to let you know! ...yeah right). I could have lost my job. I got in a massive blowout with my friends that night. And what’s sad is this isn’t even close to my bottom, I’ve been in much worse.

I have to stop. I can’t live with the pain and shame and self hatred anymore. I struggle with bipolar disorder and have noticed a trend between my emotional/mental control and my drinking control. When I’m doing good, drinking isn’t a problem. When I lose control, everything goes spinning away into a shit show. This pattern has led me to believe I can continue drinking, but I don’t think I can.

I have a great therapist who wants me to do outpatient treatment. Honestly, I don’t know if I can. I know I want to start AA and I know I don’t want to drink for a few months. But I can’t stop that nagging voice in my head “but what about this...? Just a few beers then would be fine, right?” And the idea of failing is shattering. I use alcohol as a major social crutch (I feel incapable of even being around friends of 15+ years without a drink to loosen up) and have no idea how to break that habit without becoming a lonely hermit, although I’ve lost most of my friends of late thanks to manic drinking so, who knows. 

I’m sure many people won’t read this and it’s a novel, but I’m scared, sad, broken and I just don’t know what to do. Most of all, I’m disappointed in myself.",55,0

Alcohol is supposed to be a fun time for those who partake. It’s meant for parties, weddings, cookouts, even romantic dinners that later lead a couple to the bedroom. Haha not for me. I tried to be that social drinker and have fun with everyone. But so many times I’ve embarrassed myself and my husband. And so many times I have hurt him and other family members. I’m not fun with alcohol. 

Alcohol sucks for me. It’s tied to so much pain. In 2010 I hit my first depression. (I’m going to get very candid here.) I hit depression because my daughter, Sophie, who was almost 2-years-old had already been fighting for a year with an aggressive childhood cancer. At this point she developed a brain tumor and her doctors told me she would live only a couple more months. (She actually lived another year and a half.) All of this put me into a tailspin of anger which led to complete exhaustion and depression. We found treatment for this particular brain tumor at Sloan Kettering in NYC. This meant lots of traveling with a 2-Year-old, by myself. Husband had to stay at home and work and take care of our older daughter. So I started drinking to numb the anger. To numb everything. I’ll never forget, one morning in the hotel restaurant, Sophie and I were waiting for the car to pick us up and take us to the airport to go home. I ordered her pancakes. For myself, I ordered a Bloody Mary no heat, and I locked eyes with the waitress and said, “make it Strong” her look at me and then to Sophie and her little bald head, she got what I meant. When we got back home I got a quick appointment to my doctor and sat with tears rolling down my cheeks begging for antidepressants. They worked for a while and kept the alcohol away. But the alcohol came back into my life. 

Sophie went to Heaven in September 2011. I lost a part of my soul, my Spirit. Over these last 10 years, though I’ve healed mostly from losing my beautiful Angel, I still drink. I’ve tried drinking socially to have fun with everyone. But I just can’t. There’s too much pain. And I’m also a closet drinker and a binge drinker. I’m also a sweet and kind and loving woman. But alcohol brings out a demon. A demon that can rip someone to shreds. I’ve watched it happen so many times. I’ve even gotten very physical with my husband a few times. And the weird thing is I’m like outside of myself watching in 3rd person. I can’t stop it or control it. Talk about Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hide. Literally. I guess what happens is when I drink, and drink too much, all of that pain inside me unleashes like the Kraken. 

I turn 40 this year. I turned 30 the year Sophie left me. The last 10 years and all of my 30’s have been up and down. Turning 40 means a lot to me. It’s stepping into the second half of my life. I want to take all my experiences and wisdom and apply it to this next half. I want the next half to be gentle and sweet.

Long post.,"My alcoholism has been an intense battle most of my life. I'm 4 months sober at 32, first time going over a week since I was 16. I found out something from an old roommate and friend tonight that's got my heart feeling very heavy.

Six years ago I was renting a cheap room in a party house. I was working in a bar and drinking heavily. A lot of nights the roommates and I would have people over and be partying until early in the morning. A few months in, my female roommate and I both went through breakups in the same month. We both drank a lot of whiskey, I generally had a pint or two of Evan Williams a day and she always had some fifths of Seagrams around and was pretty wobbly. We started hooking up in the midst of our shit shows. We had some fun times, be it very sloppy times. This went on for a few months, we'd both see other people in the mean time but spend a lot of nights, or days whichever, in the same bed. Eventually I got more serious with another woman and ended the fun. We'd always remained friends and were supportive of each other. A good handful of the nights we spent together I have no or a very hazy recollection of. One morning I woke up to my room completely destroyed, broken potted plants and shit everywhere with no memory after getting home from work. When I asked my male roommate what happened he told me the scene of my ex showing up, barging in to find me and my roommate in my bed, then proceeding to slap the shit out've me and destroy everything until my roommates convinced her to leave before they called the cops. 

Tonight I was casually chatting with my roommate that I'd hooked up with, we'll call her Liz. We don't talk often but every once in a while face time or chat on messenger. It was six years ago when we lived together. I haven't been making a point of telling people in my life that I've quit drinking. Mostly I just want to do it and not talk about it if it's not pertinent. When I asked her how she is tonight she told me about falling out of the bus and sent me pictures of her face. I mentioned some of my facial decorations and when she asked me how things were I mentioned figuring out sober life. We kept talking and I was telling her about a dark place I'd gotten to with a friend who attacked me while blacked out, split my head open with a fire poker and bit the shit out've me when I restrained him so now I've got all these tooth scars. She laughed and said ""I thought I did damage"" I laughed and asked what made her say that ""you never hit me did you""? She said no and mentioned scratch marks, then said ""you hit me though"". I said ""I accidentally ran into you a few times, but I never intentionally hit you did I?""

This is that part of our conversation with the names changed -

Out of all the fucked up crazy shit I've done I always had this solace that I hadn't been violent except with other asshole dudes, and never went out of my way to hurt someone or even got violent without being attacked first. I've been in plenty of scraps but always just end up wrapping someone up or putting them down and walking away. Usually I was one to break up fights and try to calm people down. I've had exes who were violent with me sober and when I don't remember and as far as I know I'd never raised more than an eyebrow or my voice to them. 

Part of me wants to think her memories twisted up but I can't in good conscious just assume that or deny her. The fact that it was possible and I was too fucked up to remember basically strips me of any right to deny it to myself. So yea... I'm pretty twisted up inside now with some confused feelings. Just trying to accept that I did this to her. Makes me really angry at myself. I've had a calm collection of reasons recently resolving me to not want to drink. Now I've got this anger and extreme disappointment for letting the fucking Mr. Hyde get there. Which is somewhat scary because I can feel that ridiculous urge to drink out of self loathing. I'm confident I wont though, I never want that piece of shit to get anywhere near the light again.

I love this group and needed to get that off my chest. Thank you all for being here.

Never could manage it for long (or at all, if I'm being honest). Because of this, I'd almost always give in after three days. 

Over the past 5 years I've averaged 2-4 15pk cases of 4.7% ABV per week in an attempt to stifle boredom and distract me from my loneliness. All that's earned me is extra weight, a low bank account, and extra stress due to trying to hide my alcoholism from family and the few friends I have left. Most recently, I'd end up finishing one of those 15-pks while sitting at my computer and end up passed out in my chair or blacking out and finding myself elsewhere within my home. For days afterwards, I'd feel sick from the hangover only to recover enough to begin binge drinking anew.

I've been lurking in this sub-reddit for the past year trying to work up the nerve to make another attempt to stop drinking. I'm sick of being hungover, tired, and generally unhappy, but I don't know if this is just another 3-day streak before the craving hits and I break again. 

I hope I can make it to day four (and beyond). I really do, because I'm so tired of feeling like a failure for not controlling myself. 

I'm not certain if I can actually make it another day, but here's to attempting my next (and hopefully last) 3rd day streak.",2,0

As much as I love wine, I also love the craft beer scene. I have so many fun awesome memories with my husband sampling amazing beers on trips, dates, and at festivals. Then as I packed up my beer shirts for donation (I feel I should pass them on since being in recovery while wearing a beer shirt feels weird) I just felt a huge sense of loss over the possibility of never having those types of experiences with him again. It was something we were both passionate about and I feel so angry at myself I’m unable to responsibly continue enjoying our shared hobby together.

I’ve proven time and time again I can’t moderate and for every great fun memory I have with the husband, I have an equally horrible memory of acting like a complete loser, so it’s definitely for the best. Yet I can’t shake this feeling of loss.

I’ve been trying to remind myself of all the things I’m gaining with my sobriety when I’m feeling sad, I’m more awake and alert in the mornings, my anxiety meds seem to be working better, I don’t feel guilt or shame over my excessive drinking, and most importantly of all - the quality time with my kids. 

Sometimes it’s just hard, I almost let myself slip because it all just felt SO unfair and why can’t I have just one beer with the hubby? But I didn’t, and I’m proud of that even if I’m also sad about everything else.",10,0

What crept into my mind was alcohol is the only thing that will at least temporarily take away this pain or if it didn't take the pain away if I drank enough I would at least pass out and not care about the pain.

During the week you curse your stupidity and swear to never get blackout again. You never consider stopping all together, because it's only on a Friday or Saturday night.

Have you really considered it properly?

2/7 nights a week you're getting smashed (destroying personal relationships, financially ruining yourself and creating chaos)

That's 28% of the week. That's 104 days a year spent destroying your life.

Don't forget the hangovers! The summation of our continued failures to delay gratification. The complete immobilisation of your being at the hands of anxiety guilt and dread. Throw in another 2 days a week on top of that.

So add that up, we're at about 4/7 days per week. Thats about 57% of your week. That's 208 days of the year; held hostage by the destruction of alcohol.

This might seem obvious to some, but I told myself my drinking wasn't problematic because it only occurred a few days a week. It just couldn't be the root of my problems, it was my escape right? Everything began to collapse around me, slowly... I began to wonder why.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hungover from a three-day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let's not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Top O' the Morning to all Sobernauts on this beautiful St. Patrick's Day! 

While looking for an interesting fact about SPD, I learned that Leprechauns (born prior to the ""Me, Too"" era) like to pinch anyone they can see.  Folklore says that wearing green makes us invisible to Leprechauns thus saving us from a pinch!

With all the parades and festivities happening today, this seems like a fine time to point out my favorite line from the DCI:

>> Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.

Please, once again, join me in committing to not drink TODAY no matter what happens, good or bad. **Together, we've got this!**

Wasn't I *so brave* to quit relying on my go-to drug for numbing out my anxiety during such a crazy time?  As month after month went by I would occasionally miss drinking, but was never even tempted to go back.   It became such a non-issue I barely even discussed it during my (virtual) weekly therapy appointments.  

Now as more and more people are getting vaccinated, it seems like there might actually be - if not an end in sight - then at least a tapering off of the more extreme isolation.   One thing I've realized is that a social shutdown is actually one of the EASIEST times to give up alcohol.  (at least for me)   I've had most of a year to get used to not drinking without any of the pressures that come with social engagements - book club *with wine*! neighborhood cookout *with beer*! extended family gatherings with *whatever is in reach*!    

I find my anxiety beginning to ramp back up a little when thinking about having to deal with all that stuff now.  A few people know I haven't been drinking, but even to that small circle, I've only said that I'm NOT drinking, not that I won't BE drinking.   I haven't yet had to deal with all the defensiveness of others when they find out you're not drinking and assume you're judging them because they are.   When everyone's splitting a pitcher of margaritas, except you.  When you're pooped out early at a party because alcohol used to give you a burst of energy.

**The Bad:** My mother’s bed was ruined by Hurricane Eta when her bedroom filled with water, and I am trying to buy her a comfortable mattress to replace it, but she is fighting me. She is apparently determined to sacrifice herself (to what, I’m not exactly sure) and keeps telling me things like, “I was a Girl Guide when I was a child during World War II—I can just sleep on a folding camp bed.” Then the string orchestra behind her starts to play a sad melody.

I am a 19 year old female and for the most part I haven't had any issues drinking for more than a year and I've made many good choices for myself, like changing my diet and taking steps towards being able to move out and live a life where I can function independently. I simply had no desire to drink, but as of right now, my exams are approaching, I feel worthless and I don't know how I feel about my relationship anymore and he is the only person in my life I'm truly close to. I've been managing these things okay, some days I need anxiety medication other days I am so disassociated (and I don't mean drunk, I just feel completely disconnected from everything)I don't think about anything. I've gotten blackout drunk twice in the last two weeks, one of which was last night. I wasn't planning on drinking after getting so drunk just a few weeks ago but since my mother was, I did as well. You see, when my mother drinks she has this habit of overstepping her boundaries (not in a sexual way or anything, just pure disregard for my emotional stability). She's been like this since I could remember and it's caused problems in me being able to have proper boundaries, and last night I simply didn't want to have her do that again so I made sure I had more than she could and it's made me feel like absolute shit. I now have even worse anxiety and all I want to do is cry about how I don't feel like I've made any progress in making better choices for myself. 

My relationship with my family is.. complicated to say the very least and I just don't know where to turn right now. We have very little money so going to therapy is not really an option, plus the fact that it has been proven that the therapists in our area talk about what their patients tell them to other people. I truly to want to move out because I don't feel being in this environment is good for my emotional well-being or for my future, but I have insane amounts of anxiety which has made it difficult for me to start working and I have two cats I can't bear to leave here so I can't move in with friends or my boyfriend.  I do much better when I'm away from home and it's not even like they are necessarily abusive, it's that this is not an environment conducive to growth or emotional well-being. I want to break away from all of this, work on myself and finally get somewhere in life. I just don't know where to start, please help me?

Recap:

AF 21 days, damn proud. Mindful consumption of cannabis. Therapist. Was/am @ step 2 in AA with sponsor. Being told cannot collect chips, cannot serve, cannot sponsor, cannot share.

&#x200B;

damned if I do, damned if I don't. 

&#x200B;

option A) continue on this path not sharing, just listening; not truly participating in the program?

B) become a closeted cannabis AA member (like I know there are because when they finally are ready to come clean and get clean they do & start their time ) who does not sponsor?

C) find another option --- all i've found require total abstinence; thought I could do 12step a la cart. I'll eventually want to give up the leaf too I'm  sure. Just not yet. -- Tobacco should come first imo & definitely cannot fathom all 3

&#x200B;

It is scary to think that I wont be able to share, or collect chips, or actually participate in the program. Especially since it's been drilled in me that with out AA I will inevitably drink and die. So early on my journey to give up alcohol, truly feel I need the meetings and talking to other fellow alcoholics.

I have not shared much with anyone about my drinking - my father is an alcoholic, so it’s an uncomfortable subject in my family, and the people in my life all drink, and I have heard a lot of “you don’t need to worry, your drinking isn’t that bad” - which, tbh, makes it even more difficult to justify not “having just one” (do people that enjoy having just one drink even exist?)

651,2021-03-16 21:53:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/m6p9s9/four_years/,Four years!!!,"Holy wow. I feel I should say a lot more about my journey, but that would take more time and spoons than I’ve got right this second, so here are some bullet points (bread crumbs?) in case these may be useful for someone...

- For years I was under the misconception that stopping drinking was the *first* step to freedom from alcohol. In reality, for me anyway, actually stopping drinking was NOT the first step. No no no, not at all.  Actually stopping drinking was more like the second-to-last step. There were a BUNCH of other steps that I needed to do prior to actually stopping drinking. Those other steps took over a year. So if you’re thinking, “But I can’t just stop drinking!,” just know that that is TOTALLY OKAY. You do NOT have to stop drinking as your first step. Lurking here is an EXCELLENT first step on the path to eventually not drinking.

- Leaving alcohol, for me, was like leaving an abusive and dangerous relationship. When ~~Carrie Fisher~~ Princess Leia died at 60, I knew in my heart that the abusive relationship I was in WAS going to kill me by 60 too if I could not find my way out of it. (yes I know she had already been in recovery for some time - that scared me even more.) I was almost 47 at the time, rocking my baby grandson. “He’ll be twelve when I die.” I cried with shame and regret.

- Getting out of an abusive relationship requires a lot of careful and secret advance planning; allies; support; resources. At the moment described above, I was in the process of quietly building those things, keeping all of it a secret from my abusive partner Alcohol. Alcohol sensed that I was getting stronger and, just like human abusers, escalated its hold on me. My daily amount of drinking actually *increased* during the final 2-3 months before stopping. (I don’t recommend this, but just know that it can happen, and it doesn’t necessarily mean you are off track; it may mean that you’re right on track.)

- I could not have done it without my therapist.

- I could not have done it without r/stopdrinking.

- I could not have done it without unconditional love and support from my spouse and my dog.

- I could not have done it without the books [Changing for Good](https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X), which showed me the steps in the path that come BEFORE actually quitting, and [Alcohol Lied to Me](https://www.amazon.com/Alcohol-Lied-Me-Stop-Drinking-ebook/dp/B009JY59LI), which helped me finally kick Alcohol’s ass lol. Also the book [In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts](https://www.amazon.com/Realm-Hungry-Ghosts-Encounters-Addiction/dp/155643880X), about why some people (that’s us! Lol) are vulnerable to addiction.

- I could not have done it without listening to the Alcohol Lied to Me meditations (hypnosis? Idk) two-three times a day for the first three weeks.

- I could not have done it without eating a pint of Ben & Jerry’s every day for the first six months. (actually it may have been Talenti but you know what I mean.) Why yes, I did gain weight! Ha ha WHO GIVES A FUCK, I’m going to LIVE. (Now, I’m keto and fit - so don’t worry if you need ice cream at first, you won’t need it forever. Also, now they’ve invented Halo Top and whatnot, so you can probably have ice cream WITHOUT gaining weight like I did.)

- I could not have done it without fizzy water. Embrace the fizzy water. (Especially if you’re a beer person.)

- I probably could have done it without AA meetings, BUT going to my first AA meeting was a watershed moment for me of accepting support IRL from other people who had escaped from alcohol. I do highly recommend going to at least a few AA meetings when you do cross over into Actually Not Drinking - extremely eye-opening when you see who else is there with you in those rooms. And the love and encouragement is a big boost. And remember, your “higher power” can just be Reality, as in Cause and Effect. There IS a power greater than me, it’s the whole universe and how it works, and i CAN learn how to live in alignment with Reality instead of attempting to hide from it.

- [This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5y538w/recovery_scuba_diving/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from u/etchasketch4u was my touchstone for the first days and weeks of actual sobriety. Here’s what it says:

>Recovery SCUBA diving

>I think of getting through addiction like going SCUBA diving. Your only job is to just breath in and out, really calmly and not die. You just kinda do what the other people you are with do. Trust those who have gone down and seen the bottom before. SCUBA diving is awesome and people do it every day. Once you have relaxed your way through something terrifying...you are stronger and have seen something that others will never see.

>One becomes a wizard amongst muggles.

I will go for a run with you today. I will hold my head up with you today. I will look you in the eye today. I will feel your honest pain today; we will feel no shame today.

Like the perpetual mute button that comes from daily drinking has been lifted, which should be a good thing, but now it's like previously repressed negative thoughts are free to drift to the surface. And boy do they. So instead of being proud of being sober and enjoying the better rest and lack of hangovers, I'm coming out of left field and just destroying myself with things I haven't thought about for years - guilty feelings, wrongs I've committed, regrets over old decisions, self-doubt in my new job - the works.

Anyway, yesterday started out ok enough, and then got progressively worse, and then comically bad. I took my first retail job in October, following all the restaurant closures and a move to a new state. In short, I now work the Customer Service desk at a big box store (think Superstore haha : ) Basically I get to argue all day long with people about why I can't cash their checks with non-existent ID's, and why I can't take back like 60"" TVs without a receipt. It's... honestly pretty crazy. And I say that as someone that's waited tables for 20+ years, so you know that I mean it. Lol. 

Yesterday everyone in town decided they wanted to return everything they've ever bought, basically. Like, multiple people bringing in 6-7 bags of random busted garbage, no receipts, you...probably get the idea. I'd say a good portion of the time I am also dealing with people on drugs (scabs all over, etc.) I've been told to eff off, someone called the girl I work with an a$$hole on my break yesterday. It's...a lot of negativity. And I'm a pretty positive person. I will smile and say Hi to anyone. 

So, anyway, you know, these 4 random people showed up yesterday with 4 bags of groceries bought at another location. They wanted to return them. They ""changed their mind"". All food. Mostly perishable - eggs, hamburger, etc. $100 worth. And you know what??? The location I work at doesn't even sell those groceries, and I still had to take them all back because they had a receipt from 3 days ago. I asked the person in charge and was told I had to, and that it would just all be taken immediately to the trash. 

For whatever reason, it really pissed me off, and I couldn't shake it. Maybe it was just the final straw at the end of a long day, but I just left so angry. I kept thinking how many honest people are struggling right now to put food on their tables, and how morally bankrupt other people are. I also just kept thinking how if I was still drinking, I would be like EXTRRRA drinking last night because I was so worked up and just felt really stressed out. But, instead, my Husband picked me up, we stopped to look at something we wanna buy in the near future (a kayak : ) I impulsively bought a $70 winter coat, that's super cute, because I rarely buy myself clothes and I really liked it (plus almost half off! Woohoo!) We stopped and got takeout to bring home, and by bedtime I felt a lot better. A lot better. Today I woke up, had the day off, and our new couch got delivered after months of waiting because of the you know what. 

At any rate, I'm happy to be sober. 

No matter what, I have a job that pays my bills, own my first home, and am looking into starting classes again in a couple months, when the next semester starts. I'm only a handful of credits away from at least having an Associate's degree, but it's a start. And I might have turned 41 last week, but I am a super young, and I like to think pretty fun 41 year old, and I am going to have a career. Not just a job - a career. And, I'm gonna keep doing good things and keep making my life better. IWNDWYT",22,0

The reasons are dumb and long, but in a nutshell, it feels like she screwed up the only week of vacation I’ll be getting for a long time. Heads up, we’re both women. 

I have a week off work for the first time in quite a while, and I won’t have another for a few months at least. 

I wanted to do a little getaway for a few days this week as a treat. My partner wanted to come but didn’t want to book any time off work, and insisted we do something on the weekend. Which sucks, because everything is busier and more expensive then. And I hate crowds.

I researched and came up with a place we could go, she booked the place. I said something yesterday about maybe not wanting to do one of our activities planned and she went ahead and cancelled the whole trip without discussing it with me.

I started looking up other places and things we could do, and it turns out now she doesn’t want to do anything. 

At the same time, she’s booking cottage trip with our friends in the summer. On the one weekend in the entire summer I told her I couldn’t make. Because earlier this year she scheduled a camping trip with her family the weekend of my dads 60th birthday without asking me, so I was hoping to keep the following weekend open to spend time with him. Now she’s pestering me to agree to the cottage weekend date- everyone in our group has now agreed except me. 

I’m so annoyed. I don’t understand why she even suggested the one weekend she knew I couldn’t make to the group. I feel like she’s spoiling my week off and now she’s screwing up my summer plans at the same time.

I’ve never been a big relationship person. 

I miss living alone. I miss sleeping alone. I hate planning things around another person. Normally I’d numb these feelings with a drink or twelve.",3,0

The first time I tried to quit drinking was back in late 2016. I was a junior in college and had been battling with mental health and substance abuse issues since my first semester there in 2014. I was insecure and anxious and constantly felt like a fraud. So I did what so many others do: completely avoid those feelings by keeping myself numb with drugs and alcohol. Then about once every week or two, I would make a big push an pull an all-nighter so that I could address school. Then I would completely forget about everything again until it was time for the next all-nighter. But emotions and mental health never got even that much attention. So the drinking and other substance use continued. 

Things finally came to a head in that fall of 2016. I was rarely leaving my house during the week, and was drinking to blackout at least 3 times a week. I was not a fun drunk either - I just did and said reckless/embarrassing things as a way of trying to compensate for my insecurities and feelings of worthlessness. Luckily my friends and family recognized how dangerous my behavior was getting, and they recommended that I voluntarily admit myself to a treatment center. I had enough sense left to agree to doing so, and spent 7 weeks in inpatient treatment. It did wonderful things for me, and I learned a lot about myself and my use during those 7 weeks. Fun fact: I got out on my 21st birthday. It was supposed to be the start of a new me. I made it to 6 months sober! But I then decided that I had resolved the issues that had been causing me to drink.

The following four years were a cycle of drinking/using, then resolving to quit, then feeling like I could go back, then quitting again. I never got even to close that 6 month mark again though. I did manage to graduate and get a decent job. But I know that I can do better. I can feel the complacency creeping in. While I have used quarantine as an opportunity to start working out again and get my diet back on track (I used to be quite healthy before college), and also managed to kick the hard drugs... But something happened to me recently that has made me want to get completely sober again.

I met someone. And she is absolutely wonderful. I haven't felt this way about someone in years and it has given me a renewed motivation to get myself together for good. Not that things are as bad now as they have been in the past, but being with this girl for the past three-ish weeks has made me realize that I have still been using alcohol to dull my emotions. And I can see that so clearly in my time spent with her. Two of our most intimate nights (not just physically) were those where we had been drinking. In fact they were the ONLY two times we have been drinking together. And those were the only times that I was able to work up the courage to be completely honest with her about how I feel. And don't even get me started on how nervous I am to have sober sex with her. I seriously do not know how I am going to do it. But I do know that if I really care about this girl, I will stop using alcohol to move the relationship forward. I don't want a relationship built on a substance that I KNOW has the power to so easily throw me off the rails. 

And, for me, I think that the only way to successfully take that power away form alcohol, is to remove it from the equation completely. So I'm committing to 60 days. I hope to re-evaluate at that time and decide to go for more, but right now, I'm committing to 60. I'm 2 down. 58 more to go.

I know this was a huge wall of text, so thanks for reading if you made it this far.

Hopefully having put this here will keep me accountable.

My excuse: a neighbor casually asked if I wanted to have a cigar by the fire that night. 

So what did I do? I went out to BevMo and bought a $80 bottle of cognac which would pair perfectly with a cigar and be “to nice” to party with... (my attempt to regulate the amount I would be drinking that night) 

As you can imagine the bottle was nearly drained and when I decided I was making a mistake, instead of calling it a night, I switched to a cheaper bottle. Then proceeded to make a fool myself by trying to have a smart conversation with my friend. Who had since switched to water and soda by the fire. Obv anything I was saying at this point was garbage. 

I’m regretful to admit that when everyone wanted to go to bed I talked a those around the fire into Mexican food. This was 15min before the place down the street closed (you can imagine we were getting the worst of what was left over at this point, reserved for drunks,  college kids and other degenerates) 

I woke up next to my girlfriend at 4:30 to a racing heart rate. I sat up and my chest felt tight. A wave of panic washed over me. I walked to the kitchen. Felt dizzy. My dog and two cats at this point are going fucking nuts thinking I was feeding them (I used to wake up at this time to surf or mountain bike -that’s gone to the wayside bc of drinking lately) 

I ended up shaking awake my poor girlfriend up who had only the glass of wine that night. She saw my panic/fear and was helplessly trying to figure out what to do next. 

The hangover was starting to set in, salty carnitas nachos where heavy inside me, I couldn’t drink water. I was starting to think this was the end. Which made everything worse. I was imagining the possibility of my lovely gf on the phone with paramedics watching me seize on the apartment floor. FOR WHAT? A FUCKEN CIGAR? seems so funny to me in retrospect.

159 over 94 read the BP monitor. I purchased that thing after the first time this happened to me. This is the second time. 

That night was perhaps the scariest night of my adult life. I didn’t sleep. I walked to the beach after my bp went down. I found a self help video on YouTube. I cried after reading some posts on here...

I’ve watched friends rise to success and stardom, some fall off the radar, and a couple die because of our partying habit that failed to dissolve after college. This shit is real now. 

Three days ago is that last time I drank. I’m not sure if I can make it past st. patty tmr BUT joining this community is a step in the right direction. 

This post will serve as a reminder to myself. Hopefully documenting the bottom. If you made it this far in my “note-to-self”, thank you.  Just having someone else read my commitment to stop drinking makes it seem more real.

Edit: I’m following the advice here and getting a special NA drink for tomorrow. Then checking back in here to hear how everyone’s night was. Also I am excited to here how healthy ppl have felt soon after they stopped. Looking forward to that.",473,0

Then I'd say I'm gonna quit, last a day or two, and then be back at the shop buying beers.

One evening i had my sister and my girlfriend over, and ended up drinking with them. By that i mean, i got wasted and they had a small glass of wine. My sister ended up leaving early and was annoyed because I ruined a good night by being obnoxious. My girlfriend was disappointed because she felt like she had to babysit me. I woke up hung over, ashamed, and frustrated.

That was 100 days ago now. The first week was difficult, but it gradually got easier overall. I still will randomly think, ""god a beer would be nice right now"" but i know that it WOULDNT be nice and it'd all be downhill from there.

Not sure if I can quit completely,"Hi all! Long time lurker here! So I recently got news from the doc that I have fatty liver disease, so for the first time in 20+ years I quit booze. I usually have about 15 beers per day. Covid hasn't been good to me since I just start drinking earlier in the day. I've been booze free for 6 days and need to go 6 weeks to get a new blood test in hopes that my liver has recovered. Actually that's a lie (not unlike many other of my lies revolving around my drinking...). I had one beer each night just to make sure I didn't have withdrawal issues during sleep. Yesterday was my first day ever completely booze free.

It's really not as bad as I thought it would be. I'm very antsy later in the day, I drink plenty of fake beers, and I generally feel much better. My problem is that booze is very much a part of my lifestyle. All my friends booze and, more importantly, my boos and colleagues usually go out for beer every week or 2. This is my major concern. My boss and I have a very good relationship and I'm in a field that is struggling. I'm basically like the son he never had (he has daughters) so he has my back in the workplace.

So I'm just wondering how many of you have been able to pull off a partial quit? I don't usually get drunk when I drink and I find that I'm much funnier and more interactive person in social scenes if I have been drinking. But what's most important is that my line of work is heavily reliant on my having these social, drinking, sessions outside of the workplace with my colleagues. So my plan is to get over the liver issue and try to only drink when not alone. Is this feasible? From my lurking experience here, most of you either quit outright or fall back into the hole.

But a few days ago, I woke up feeling happy and alive, and I realized that’s been happening, quietly and unnoticed, for a couple of weeks now.

ONWARD

Even though the weather’s warming up and I used to love a beer on a patio – I have found some lovely dealcoholized beers that fill that void, for as long as they’re needed.

Even though my husband still drinks a couple of times a week and gets a good buzz on – I know I don’t need to drink with him to connect with him. And if it’s hard, I go to bed or find something else to do.

Even though my anxiety brain thinks ahead to post-pandemic vacations and parties, I remind myself that I have done these things sober before and they’ve not only been better, but relaxing, social and fun.

I remember that every struggle, every internal debate, every tough time that I get through making a different choice than drinking, actually rewires my brain to make it easier the next time. Neuroplasticity, y’all! It’s a helluva thing. So if you’re struggling with something, endure, walk away, do something different, whatever you need to do to not drink, and know that on every level you are learning, and that it won’t always be this tough. And the toughest times are made so much harder by drinking.

Whether you’re on your first day one or your fiftieth, you can do this. I think I’m somewhere in the tens of times (over many years) and the way I look at that is that I’ve done my freshman year, my apprenticeship, my retraining, and my refreshers. I have all this experience to build on and I’m getting better at this. So are you. It’s not a slip, it’s not a relapse, it’s a learning to add to your toolkit and move forward. You have all the support in the world and I support you all, the way all of you have supported me in so many ways you cannot know.

Then, yesterday, on day 79, a breakthrough. 

I got a call from my sister and picked up the phone. My very young nieces had a question for me: why wasn't I at their house visiting? They missed me and needed me to visit. They even kissed their Mom's phone in the middle of the conversation. It was the cutest thing ever as I had never received a phone call from them before.

I hung up the phone with a smile on my face and went about my business. It wasn't even five minutes later that I was hit with the most intense alcohol craving of my entire journey. 

Then it finally hit me: the timing was not a coincidence. That brief, unexpected moment of connection with people I love followed immediately by the silence and solitude of my pandemic universe created a crushing feeling of loneliness. 

So instead of fighting the urge to drink or going out to get a drink, I leaned in to the feeling. I cried for a minute. Then the feeling passed as did my alcohol craving. Feels good to understand myself a bit more today.

After taking a hard look at my pattern over the last few years, I now realize I've been slowly escalating into more of a dependency.

What alarmed me was noticing that I was thinking more about my drinking plans, looking forward to that evening drink more and more, wanting to have it just that little bit earlier, having just that last extra sip beyond what used to be my limit.  Reading all of your honest experiences here on this board has informed me alot about my present situation, and that I have a choice to reverse things right now or risk setting myself for a serious problem - and you know what? - I've got enough problems already.  

Anyway, right now I decided to ""re-up"" for another 90 days at the least, and then reevaluate again at that point.

My sobriety feels very good, very normal and natural. I’m seeing consistent benefits. However, my family of origin is a bunch of heavy social drinkers, I think my drinking issues stemmed from the support I received from them when I would “go with the flow”. 

All that being said, being successful in sobriety has been helped with the pandemic. I do not have these influences around me and it’s been wonderful. 

Today we are getting together (6 of us). My mothers birthday was last week and she survived a horrible bout with COVID-19 (hospitalized for about a month early last year). The entire reason for getting together involves drinking a few specific bottles. I can already feel the pressure. My parents are horrible about boundaries, they will push them just for sport.

I hate counting days because if I’m back at one I might as well enjoy the view while I’m down here. That mindset has led me to benders but I don’t want this to be a bender. I already feel guilty and ashamed. I told my mom last night I was tempted to drink due to triggers. So, I’ll avoid her calls today because she always hears it in my voice that I’ve been drinking. I think when you’re hiding your addiction from an addict, you’ve got a problem. 

I’m making excuses for myself that a slip up isn’t THAT bad. I can recover tomorrow and get back on track. A relapse shouldn’t destroy the hard work you put in to staying sober.

i’ve really been struggling lately, with work and life and mental health (shout out to chronic suicidal thoughts) and i’ve been really afraid of relapsing. i take naltrexone (prescribed after i’d quit drinking already, moreso for binge eating) and it is a very helpful part of relapse prevention. given my length of time without drinking and the naltrexone if i were to relapse it would be a very planned relapse, which means there would be a lot of time to reach out to supports, use other coping skills, that sort of thing. i will talk to my psychiatrist and addictions counsellor about my fear of relapsing (i haven’t yet) but it’s not even that i miss drinking (i truly don’t) it’s that i’m so depressed and unhappy anyway and it’s almost like my brain is saying “why not make things worse!” it’s like i want to punish myself for not making the kind of life improvements one is “supposed” to make after quitting drinking... by starting drinking again. 

before i get too many people worried, i’m not going to drink again. my alcohol use disorder diagnosis has only recently been changed to “in remission” and i know drinking again would only make my current situation worse. things are rocky at work (i’ve always struggled with employment but i’ve been at my current job for almost 2 years which is wild. i’m currently on a kind of forced medical leave? but i probably need the time to work on my health anyway) and i’m certain if i were to drink again i would lose my job in a snap. and then what? drinking more to cope? no thank you!

i’m sure this is discouraging to people in early recovery so i apologize for that. but yeah. quitting drinking didn’t magically improve my life, but i’m still pretty certain life would be a lot worse now had i been drinking the last 14 months. so there’s that. 

anyway, thanks for reading, and if anyone has been here i would definitely appreciate advice.

After a few weeks or a month on the booze-free train at a time, I will eventually talk myself into thinking that I can successfully moderate. But, I cannot. At least not right now or any time in the foreseeable future. Plus, moderating is hard! It's harder than just not drinking. For me it is just exhausting trying to decide what the ""rules"" will be. Then all it takes is one night of not sleeping well, bad teaching day, or something else going wrong in life, etc., and then I break whatever ""rule"" I came up with. I'm tired of thinking about it. But for some reason I'm really holding on this idea that there is a good reason to try to keep moderating.

I thought it might be helpful to just write out some of the pros and cons out to help me think through it and access what is going on in my brain. 

&#x200B;

What I have to gain by not drinking at all:

\-It is impossible to drink too much if I don't even start--simple!

\-It is way cheaper to not drink, and we're trying to save for a house

\-I don't have to come up with any rules or feel bad if I break them or fudge them

\-I will sleep so much better! My long booze-free stretches recently have opened my eyes to how much even one or two drinks affects my sleep.

\-My mood will be more predictable and better overall. Sure, I still struggle with anxiety and depression, so it's not a fix-all, but it is definitely better when booze-free. Just like with my sleep improvements, I realized that even one drink can leave me feeling restless, guilty, and just generally feeling bad about myself since I have so much baggage associated with drinking now.

\-I will have more time flexibility. Even one glass of wine with dinner often would be enough to keep me from doing that bit of extra grading I was hoping to get in before bed, or from taking that evening walk I wanted to take. Drinking is a depressant/downer for me now (not sure if my terminology is correct) and sucks up time, even in moderation.

&#x200B;

But I should keep trying to moderate because there are things I really enjoyed about drinking that I will totally miss and that are important to me! (Or are there . . . ?)

\-""I will miss going to breweries/happy hours with my husband and hanging out!"" That is true. But what I have learned is that it wasn't the drinks that I loved so much about that activity--it was the fact that we spent hours face to face talking, and we almost never were doing that outside of that activity. When I did ""Dry January,"" we instituted Thursday night happy hour (at home of course, bc COVID) where we put on music, make cocktails (mocktail for me), and just talk for an hour while we wait for food we ordered to show up. We have kept it up every week since then, and it is always just as fun for me with or without booze. It's really about the feeling of treating myself, celebrating the end of the week, and reviewing the week's events together as we decide on plans for the weekend. We laugh and talk and have so much fun, even when my drink is booze free.

\-""I really, really love red wine. I love pairing it with food, picking out and trying new wines, and really exploring the flavors, etc. What if I want to go to a winery?"" There is some truth in this, but much of it is overblown. It has been a LONG time since I really, truly treated wine like a food (which it is!) and enjoyed the tastes and pairings, etc. This is just not reality anymore. What I do now is pour a huge glass of wine for dinner (which is amazing) but then I pour a huge second glass that I drink while watching Netflix, without even paying attention to the beauty, aroma, or taste of my wine. Also, I never go to wineries. The only wineries I've ever been to have been in places in the U.S. that are . . . well, let's just say it's no Napa Valley. If I had a trip upcoming to Paris, that might be different, but that's not the case, and won't be for a very, very long time, if ever. So I seem to set it up in my mind as something I'm giving up, but I'm really not, because it's not on the table in the first place. So is that one glass of wine at dinner worth keeping, when I can see in the above list SIX things that I'd rather have? Also, the reality is that the one glass pretty much would always turn into 2+. So it's not real--it's also not on the table, in reality.

&#x200B;

So this is where I'm at right now. Sure, there are other negative aspects to going 100% sober, like having to explain it to people when they ask because they know I used to drink, or just being an introvert and not being able to use it in social situations, etc., but I think those are relatively minor for me and definitely surmountable obstacles. Like, I'm fully expecting my in-laws (who drink way too much and also like to scrutinize my behavior) to act completely weird, and maybe a few weird things here and there, but when I look at my list of what I will gain, these are relatively minor and will probably not hold me back. 

One other thing--the counting of days as a streak freaks me out. I'm not sure why. Maybe collecting a streak of days feels super high stakes and like there's a lot of pressure. But I downloaded the I Am Sober app anyway and will try. But I think I might also just track ""total number of days booze free in 2021"" because that is a way more encouraging number for me. I've already been booze free way more days in 2021 total (if not consecutive) than in any year in the past 7 years probably, and that's a win!",9,1

Finally.,"I was 14 or 15 when I started drinking, going out to parties and having a few beers.  I'm only 21 now but I became a daily drinker, especially during quarantine.  I usually drink wine or beer, sometimes four or five glasses...sometimes a couple wine bottles (not that I can remember).  I show up to work late and feel like crap all day.  I drink a lot during the weekend, and sleep in until midday or later.  This week my office has been closed due to a COVID outbreak and my boss is pretty sick so it basically turned into a long weekend for me, and I got out of bed today at 12:30 because I drank last night.  I'm so over it.  I want to get up early, enjoy my morning, and go to work feeling like myself.  I want to feel rested and focused.  I want my body to feel ""light"" the way it only does if I didn't drink the day before.

I know what sobriety feels like because after a particularly bad drunken argument with my ex, I stopped drinking for 16 days back in September.  It felt amazing: I woke up every day at seven, did yoga, cycled all the time, actually remembered my nights (and I remembered to put on my retainer before bed, brush my teeth, and wash my face!).  But then he went back overseas and sukkot came, and a couple of glasses of wine at sukkot ended up leading me to where I am today.  There was always an excuse for me.  There was always a holiday or shabbat dinner or tasting menu or a trip or a friend who I always drink with who wants to hang out.  I'm so done with excuses.

Drinking has taken a lot out of me, even at my age.  I have lost memories and friendships and my health has already been noticeably impacted.  Besides feeling like crap mentally and physically, at my young age I've developed a recurrent hemorrhoid problem.  I had an early-term miscarriage at 19 after a weekend of heavy drinking on vacation (when I was supposed to be learning how to surf but just sat on the beach instead drinking crappy rum).  I woke up in an ambulance outside my house because I drank so much wine one night my Uber driver couldn't wake me up.  I almost got TSS because I forgot to take a tampon out and literally lost feeling in my thigh.  Now that I'm typing it all out I can't believe I've let it go on for so long.

I want to learn to surf and I want to cycle more and I want to do so many things.  I want to go hiking and not worry about falling because I drank too much beer.  I want to go camping and not worry about falling asleep and forgetting about the campfire.  I don't want to be a wine mom someday.  I don't want to get super drunk at my own wedding.

So, finally, after months of lurking on this subreddit I can finally say I am done with drinking.  IWNDWYT.",21,2

It doesn't really feel like it, since I've been using valium to help cope with the withdrawal symptoms.  I told the ER doctor I had 120 tablets at home (prescribed for GAD by my psych) advised me to take 3-4 max daily then taper down, I've been using more (more like 6-8 daily), mainly due to the tremors and extreme anxiety, and, as addicts usually do, to feel high, but it could also be because I was drinking so heavily (~15 beers daily, morning to night) and have a really high benzo tolerance.


The worst part is, valium doesn't even get me high.  It just makes life feel manageable.  I'm going to be tapering down to four daily, then 3, then hopefully will be able to see my provider to formulate a better treatment plan involving Librium and some sort of fast-acting benzo for panic attacks.

The great thing is that I have very little desire to drink anymore (at this point).  I've been stocking up on Diet Pepsi and carbonated water to keep cravings at bay and, with all the money I've saved, have been treating myself to some goodies from Amazon Fresh.  My esophagus has been healing and I haven't vomited since that ER visit -- even the barium swallow I had today showed little esophageal damage, so I'm hoping the next diagnostic testing they do can confirm this.

Even after 10 days of not having a drink, I'm already feeling the positive health benefits.

Every 100 days I like to pause and take stock of my sobriety, life, etc. Last time we were just rolling into winter. 

During this 100 days my life went completely sideways. Some normal seasonal affective depression turned into deep depression, heavy anxiety, creeping dread and panic attacks. By the end of February I thought I was losing my mind. 

Thankfully I have a great doctor and a great therapist. Got the anxiety calmed down with lorazepam and there I was, completely wrung out and lost again. 

Looking back I realize I’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression since I quit drinking and likely well before that. I found myself with doctors wanting me to go on antidepressants. Not where I wanted to end up. 

I chose a very different path than western science and big pharma wanted. I started spiritual practices, mindfulness, meditation and lots of research and introspection. While I’m not “healed” this work has helped me to completely change my philosophy, outlook, and how I deal with myself and others. 

It’s been hard work again. It took a lot of courage to admit I wasn’t ok and ask for help. 

My point is that quitting drinking is often the first step, but not the only step. The underlying stuff is often even more important. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. 

And, if you are still reading, 800 days sober is the thing I’m celebrating today.  And that feels good. 

Take care all.",7,0

This week we will most likely put our dog down. She has a very aggressive cancer and there’s nothing we can do. I’m heartbroken. But, at times, I feel at peace knowing it’s part of the dog owning experience. And I know I will not drink to cope. That will help with nothing. 

We saved her from a dog pound, she ran away multiple times from our house because she didn’t trust us. We’d always get her back. We suspected trauma from abuse. Eventually she learned that we loved her and became much more relaxed. She was still a nervous nelly around strangers though. She even jumped off my second story balcony once when she didn’t want to go with the dog walker. I had to leave work to find her. She became my running partner during the pandemic. It was our thing to do together... My girl is special. Her name is Ladybird. She’s a black and white pitbull mix.

Our community had some no alcohol meet up groups pre-covid. I am hoping when Covid passes to join in.

I work in the restaurant industry and drinking to get wasted is just the norm there. My coworker’s routine is to finish their shift, drink, and drive home well above the limit. I’ve been feeling a lot of resentment towards them and their behavior. I can’t stop harshly criticizing how much they drink or how they act when drunk. I have begun to put myself on this sort of sobriety pedestal and it’s really bothering me.

Was I not once in their shoes not even a few months ago? I know what it’s like to be in the throes of alcohol addiction yet I constantly upturn my nose in disgust. If I had to guess, this pompous attitude is due to my own feelings of shame and regret. I believe that seeing my past behavior through sober eyes is just too jarring to really come to terms with. 

I’d really like to change the way I view my friends and the lifestyles they’ve chosen but it’s incredibly difficult to live so judgment- free. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.",32,0

I was doing so well I didn’t drink in January or February at all and seriously felt the best I have ever felt. I had one drink at the beginning of March which I kept under control and was proud of myself that I didn’t overindulge which is the usual occurrence. I feel like I try to trick myself that I’ve trained myself not to go over board and this won’t happen again even though I know deep down that’s a lie. This past Sunday I went for dinner with a friend which turned into two cocktails and us splitting a bottle of wine and then I brought her back to my place to proceed to drink more wine and completely black out. I’m so embarrassed and angry with myself for letting myself get back into that place. I hate the person I am when I drink it’s like a totally different person that isn’t me. 
My partner is so angry with me and will barely speak to me which I can understand but it’s making me feel worse. He had to work the following morning and I selfishly brought my friend over and we were super loud and I just didn’t care because I was a drunk mess. Maybe this time I will lose my relationship over this and honestly I have no one to blame but myself I can’t expect my partner to always just be okay with this. I seriously feel the lowest I have in so long and it feels like there is no end to this black hole of depression :( 
I hate who I am when I drink and I want to be done with it forever but it seems impossible when I get around certain friends. I know I need to just distance myself and maybe our friendships aren’t meant to last.

Now, I know that completing one day sober is small potatoes around here. But lockdown has been rough on me, rocketing my drinking into the stratosphere, and my sober record over the last year was three days. Meanwhile, it's been months since I had even one sober day—or a day with less than about 8 drinks. And gradually the insidious lure of ""oh come on, it's just one"" has been replaced with a more foreboding fear of what the night might be like if I didn't just get a few in before heading home from work… because it had been so long since I had actually done that, and the prospect of sobriety for a night actually scared me.

The weird thing is what finally changed to make it happen. I ended up signing up for one of those crazy extreme (and expensive) diets that people push via MLM. My wife has a friend who sells that (and bothers her incessantly about it), and during a recent road trip the two of us ended up talking it over. I would never in a million years have signed up for such a thing, but I knew that if I did, it might provide enough discipline to get things going—in part because the program provides a coach who does regular nagging to make sure I'm on track. My awesome wife even offered to pay for the program out of her personal fun money account, but only if I don't cheat. That certainly helps. So, this diet becomes my secret weapon for some drinking discipline, without having to have the awkward conversations.

And so on diet day one, even after getting home having had only 500 carb-free calories for the day, dealing with the raw unanesthetized screaming of my young kids, while unbelievably hangry out of my mind… I sure as hell didn't want to waste all that effort on throwing back some drinks. Nor did I want to have to explain that to the coach. Or my wife (even after she taunted me with ""so… want to have some wine with dinner? … TOUGH!""). Or pay for the program—even though the cost is nowhere near what I'm perfectly willing to spend on booze.

Once I had a proper (300 calorie) dinner, things were a little better. I put the kids to bed, stayed awake for it instead of spending the next 4 hours asleep in a chair. I used the time productively, running some errands, which might be the first time in a year that I left the house to do something in the evening without making a pit stop at a liquor store. Finally I read a little bit before bed for the first time in forever, went to sleep at a reasonable time, slept soundly, and woke up feeling refreshed enough to exercise for the first time in a year. That sure beats a buzz.

And so, my thought upon waking up was, ""Oh look. I'm back."" I feel like my liver is giving me a high five.

But that was just day one. I know it will get harder before it gets easier.",13,1

But it makes it so hard for you.  False promises whispering in your ear.  Rehashing the ""good times"" over and over and completely forgetting the bad times. 

Showing up at your door late at night when you're vulnerable, asking for one more chance.  Things will be right this time.  You two can be happy again.

Then you give it another chance, and once again you end up more hurt than before.  Swearing to block it out of your life. But it keeps crawling back and begging for another chance.  But then it lies to you, hurts you, again and once again you're left feeling awful.

But it is so hard to walk away for good and accept it will never get better. Its over.  It does not love you.  It takes everything from you instead.

Once you let go, there may be a beautiful life waiting for you. But you must let go.

I was not a serious alcoholic. I never drank everyday, except a couple months in my early 20's when I worked as a mover. And for the record I don't think I'm better than anyone here for that, however I was largely a casual drinker. But there was a problem, I noticed a pattern where if I was in a bad place in my life I would drink way too much on individual nights. I usually did things I wasn't proud of, occasionally blacked out, and the hangovers started becoming brutal, sometimes lasting days.

In March 2016 I hit a real low point that honestly had nothing to do with alcohol, because I had barely drank in the year leading up to this. The woman I wanted to marry left me, my band of seven years broke up (we were on the radar of a huge independent label), and I very publicly got screwed on a promotion at work. This all happened within two weeks, and then soon after that I got pretty seriously injured and could barely walk. I have to take my share of the responsibility for why those things happened, but it was a lot of failure and rejection all at once to handle. Things kept getting worse after that too. My mental, physical, and spiritual health were all so fucking bad.

I was a mess and for a while I gave up on myself. Luckily somehow around that time I had a moment of clarity. Given my previous patterns with alcohol I realized that if I continued to drink that my life was seriously on the line. I'd probably keep getting black out drunk and possibly never wake up again, for any number of reasons. My goal was to not drink for one year, but I liked the results and I just kept going.

Giving up alcohol was the first step of many towards literally and figuratively getting back on my feet, but it was not the cure all solution. As I'm sure many of you know, getting sober does not magically fix everything. But it does give you the opportunity to stop running from demons and truly start looking them in the eye. Often what you need most is to be found where you least want to look. That means different things to different people, and only you can really decide for yourself what that means, which is why it's such a profound concept.

But will stopping cold turkey work?

Today's my birthday, and I decided it as good a time as ever to try and start fresh. Nothing special about this one: 32. As it were, I was in the shower this morning alone with my thoughts and started to get depressed again. A drink would solve it, I thought,  like it does - only temporarily - most mornings. Cue the internal dialogue (picture the angel and the devil on each of my shoulders, a la sitcoms of the 90s): 

""No drinks today, man. This is your birthday gift to yourself. Can you go ONE day? Jesus.""

""Today's your birthday. Have a drink and then start fresh tomorrow. Although tomorrow *is* St Patrick's Day.""

""You're not even Irish. Or Catholic. You just want to take part in what's essentially been commercialized as National Drinking Day.""

""Okay have the drink today for your birthday, drink tomorrow for St Patrick's Day, and then.. well you'll need to drink on Thursday too, to celebrate the last day of classes before spring break. Then on Friday of course - it's the first *full* day of spring break. And Saturday is the spring solstice, the first full day of *spring* \- gotta drink to that! And then you'll be on spring break all next week... you can't *not* drink during spring break! You'll find a day in the near future that's suitable to stop drinking...""

I know it's ridiculous but I get into this line of thinking all the time and try to rationalize and excuse every opportunity to drink, from the reasonable, like a birthday or a holiday, to the absurd, like the first day of spring (really?). Not exactly sure why I'm posting here, just venting I guess. So far, no drinks yet. Gonna try to muscle through my birthday, St Pat's day, and the next few days without a drink. As a start. And it'll be a feat for me - a series of days usually characterized by heavy drinking (like every day, but these usually more socially acceptable). For now, I'm drinking coffee.

Then a redditor showed me this sub and I love waking up with my coffee and starting my day off reading y'all's stories. Really keeps me going and never expected something like this to have such a huge impact in making my decisions to not drink so easy.

Just this past Friday I was off with my niece and her dad to go grab dinner for her birthday dinner. He said he was gonna grab a beer and I said I'd have one with him. The whole drive there I just had feeling in my gut that I knew if I had that one, I'd scour the menu for the highest gravity beer and have a second, probably end up ordering an old fashioned. I knew that once we were done I'd search Google Maps for the closest liquor store, and if not I'd stop by a gas station to buy a pack of Double IPA tall boys.

So when we got there, I didn't. I got a soda water and that quenched my thirst. Looking at his beer across the table I didn't even want a sip. Felt like it would mess with the flavor of the food I had ordered. Ended up driving home just jamming out to some music and just taking a passing glance at giant signs.

Played some DotA and went to sleep shortly after.

Seven days with having worked out the past couple days, I cook a lot more and my roommate and I are on great terms, talk to my parents more, actually have plans to meet up my friends (which I didn't even do during my sober days), making progress on projects I had put off.

I only just starting to notice the effects of sobriety after the first 45 days. I’m more present, more mindful and I feel physically healthier. I don't feel numb anymore. My feelings and state of mind are so intense sometimes. I’m in therapy and I attend Smart Recovery once a week. I’ve been in CBT for years.

While I’ve started to reconnect with my pre-alcohol self in body and mind, what I struggle the most with is feeling disconnected from almost everything and everyone else.

Everyone in my life drinks. My friends, my family, my coworkers. Alcohol is a common tool used for socializing, and I constantly feel like the people around me are on a different level in social situations. It’s what I’ve known and felt as “normal” for years. I feel out of my element.

I don’t feel tempted to drink, but I hate feeling so out of place in my own world. I don’t feel part of the group or the shared experience. I get annoyed around intoxicated people where I’d usually be part of the fun. I often feel like dissociating from social situations where I know that drinking is going to be the social attraction. I find in difficult to relate to what’s going on and the people around me.

I've been on dates recently with women I’ve met before a couple times from last year. I've enjoyed their company before and we clicked sexually. During the dates they typically have a few drinks while I abstain. Sitting across from them I'm surprised by how disinterested and bored I feel. I often want to leave. I always feel offput and uncomfortable. I always leave without affair. I feel discouraged.

There's also the ethical factor to dating sober. I don't feel comfortable hitting on someone who's drinking while I'm sober as a bird. It's hard to meet women who are on the same path as me.

I’m not really looking for advice. It just helps to vent and share my feelings. I’m open to your worldview, opinions and your experience.",13,0

Then I woke up around 3AM and... something wasn't right. My throat felt very swollen.

I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror at my throat, and my uvula (thing hanging at the back of your throats) was **INCREDIBLY** swollen. I'm talking to the point I was gagging on it. I couldn't talk as it would just trigger my gag reflex. My anxiety was through the roof because just simply breathing was irritating it and triggering my gag reflex. Thoughts ran through my head about what to do. Go to the hospital? Is it going to get worse? Have I finally fucked up enough?

Some quick googling revealed that yes, a swollen uvula is a symptom of dehydration, irritation, etc. from alcohol.

There wasn't much I could do. I gargled warm water and salt... took some pain killers as they are anti-inflammatory. Drank a ton of water.

I eventually tried going back to sleep but couldn't. Laying down was horrible... felt like something was falling into my throat.

I used to wake up sick. Every. Single. Day.

I used to be buzzed going into work without drinking in the morning before.

I used to be impatient and angry.

I used to be exhausted. Physically and mentally.

I used to have no fun.

I used to worship my drink.

I used to call off from work just to get drunk in the morning when nobody was home.

I used to have no hobbies.

I used to avoid my friends and family out of fear of embarrassing myself or offending those I love.

I used to be drunk for every family event before the event even started.

I used to have high BP, extreme chest pressure, heart palpitations and anxiety that would literally sideline me from even thinking straight or listening when people were talking to me.

I USED TO THINK I WAS GOING TO DIE FROM DRINKING AND THAT’S JUST THE WAY IT WAS FOR ME!

Now.... ONLY 113 days after making ONE choice to change:

I’m sleeping 8 hours a night, I feel amazing every morning like I did before I started drinking. I’ve reconnected with friends and family, I remember all the special things I’ve done, I’m confident, I’m eating right, I’m exercising and I’ve lost 30lbs. No more meds. No more thinking I’m going to die from drinking and the realization that at one point I was accepting of my fate being death caused by alcohol as being absolutely INSANE. I WANT TO LIVE!

It’s not Monday, it’s not right after the next holiday, it’s not whatever bullshit you’re lying to yourself about to evade the inevitable.... but it might just be the day you decide to give up the poison instead of giving up on yourself.

Reading so many stories like this helped me get sober so I’m just excited to pay it forward and I’m just so opposite of miserable that I want to help! I think they call that HAPPY!!!

According to my sobriety tracker app, I’ve saved over $1,100 (which is conservative,
IMO) so far by not drinking. So, on a semi-impulse decision, I bought $300 worth of Le Creuset to invest in my new skills! At first, I was a little embarrassed by the price tag (some pieces were on sale!), but this is my creative release since getting sober and I feel pretty good about it the longer I sit with it. 

A few treat yo’ self moments are important during sobriety to remind ourselves that we’re worth all of those good things were working to be.

Now I'm on day 3.,"I've always had substance abuse problems (lots of issues) but my drinking has been spiralling the last few years due to being in a 10-year relationship with a narcissist where he cheated, gaslighted me and eventually got another woman pregnant. That relationship finished nearly 3 months ago and the drink has been a way to numb myself and has been a ""friend"" to fill the whole where my ex previously existed. 

On Thursday I went to the bottle shop and got 2 bottles of wine (one for Thursday night, one for dinner with friends on Saturday) and a bottle of vodka ""for the next few weeks"" (I don't usually drink vodka - not sure why I got it). Between Thursday and Saturday it was all gone.

On Saturday I woke up not remembering anything. A broken plate in the kitchen, a plate in the garden (hope to god no-one saw me - I have no idea what I was doing out there), a broken computer mouse and a huge graze and bruises up my side, on my elbow and my chin from where I obviously fell over on the ceramic floor. I have no recollection of any of it. What a shit show. I could have seriously injured myself, and I live alone. I'm hoping this was my wake-up call.

So now I'm on day 3, feeling better but very tired, even though I'm sleeping and eating well. Trying to prepare myself for the emotions that are bound to come and hope I can deal with them in a healthy way (just started therapy so hope that will help).

Just sharing my story, as reading everyone else's has been comforting and motivating.

Since realizing how... Absent I am from the moments I should be enjoying most, I've been browsing this sub. It's exactly that. Alcohol makes me feel like a passenger in my own body. I think I'm having a ""better"" time, that I'm less anxious and more carefree. But honestly, I'm not. I'm just pushing myself down so I don't have to deal with me, and my inhibitions, and my rationality. It really sucks that everybody has been told they need alcohol to party and to have fun. That's part of what got me. ""What's a party with no booze?"" That and having too many alcoholic friends lol. It normalizes alcohol as being necessary for fun, for hanging out, for socialization. But when you look back on it, it really didn't make those moments better. It dulled them. It made you do stupid things you wouldn't have done. It made you say things you wouldn't have said. It's so so hard to get over this hump that I need alcohol to have fun; but I can't remember a situation that alcohol actually made better. Just a lot that it made worse.

But I still go back to it. Just having this awareness is helping me, a lot. But still, just this past weekend, I called out of work from being hungover. It's a vicious drug. I have general anxiety disorder, and alcohol is my go to to quell that. It has to stop.",8,0

The past month has been such an eye-opener, showing the extent to which alcohol was dragging me down in every conceivable way. The clarity, energy, enthusiasm, creativity and presence I've felt has been such an incredible experience. A blessing I would never have felt I deserved even. It shows me I've finally made the right choice, and reminds me why I never want to go back.

I don't know where to start, it's the first time I've talked to someone about my problems.

I am 26 years old and I drink about 3-5 beers every day, in the evening after work, from about 18 years old (possibly more, I have this lifestyle for so long that I don't even remember how it was my life before). It happens to me a few times a month to exaggerate, but I usually keep about 5 beers or 1 bottle of wine a day (I don't drink anything else).

I've never talked to anyone about the fact that I might have a problem, nor do I know if it's a problem, that's why I'm writing here to find out if I have a problem. The first step in solving a problem is to realize that there is one.

This lifestyle has not yet affected my life in any way, I do not have strong hangovers on the 2nd day unless I exaggerate, I am quite fit for work, the relationship with my girlfriend, family and friends is very good, only that every morning when I wake up I feel miserable inside, and I feel like I have a problem and if I don't drink I struggle to sleep and sweat, and every time I try not to drink I always think, come on, I'm still not so bad, I drink but I'm still not sick because of it (yet), I work very well socially, it's not a problem if I drink one beer a day.

I really like beer, every time I try not to drink, it is harder for me not to drink beer than alcohol. I tried to drink beer without alcohol, and it was very easy for me not to drink, only at night I still struggle to sleep and sweat.

I’m not sure what I’d call my relationship with alcohol, I don’t black out, I don’t get sloppy drunk out on the town, I don’t puke but I was just drinking so.much every night, enough to numb the stress and get to sleep. At least a bottle of wine and a few generous vodka mixes. To be honest it started scaring me that drinking that much WASNT making me sloppy drunk, in fact not getting me drunk at all. I was drinking to take my mind off stressing about stuff I needed to do, but conversely I wasn’t doing the jobs BECAUSE of the drink. Soo counterproductive and expensive and harmful.

It's a place to reflect on the last 100 days and what I've learnt and look forward too. This is now by far the longest period I've gone without drinking in at least 30 years. It's also a thank you to this community which has been an important outlet over this time.

Not drinking has been my anchor habit for the last 100 days. My motivation to do other things has waxed and waned over this time, but I've always felt that if I avoid drinking I'm staying on the right path.

I've lost some weight (7kgs) but lately it's been creeping back on. I started the new year motivated and exercising but recently that's waned too. I've allowed work to dominate again. I've meditated for 60 days straight at one point but that's stopped lately too.  I picked up my guitar again for the first time in years and that's frustrating too but I'm not giving up.

My finances are getting better though, and although there's a million miles to go before I dig myself out of that particular hole I put myself in, at least I feel I've started the journey to redemption in this facet of my life.

But overall, I'm a better person to be around. My moods are more even. I feel better. Now out of the first flush of sobriety I need to refocus and push on to a new way of living my life.

And the sharks around the corner? I'm anxious about the end of lockdown and the world reopening. I worry that I will just revert to type - socialising in the bar, although my major issue was and perhaps still is quaffing bottles of red wine at home just about each and every night.

100 days up. Feels good. A sense of quiet satisfaction. But it's not the end-point. Not drinking is just the fuel to get me to where I need to go, and lots of the map is still clouded and covered with dust. I need to work on blowing that dust away.  That starts tomorrow, as I'm off work for the rest of the week - just to take a chance to re-focus and recommit to the reasons why I must and will do this.

I never wake up in a panic, scramble to make sure I still had the important stuff and check my doors because I was too drunk to lock them. I've put myself into some truly sketchy situations because alcohol made me fearless and invincible, but really it didn't. It made me stupid and vulnerable and I got damn lucky nothing awful happened to me (aside from the days in jail).

I haven’t drank in over a month, and am trapped with these constant fuzzy memories and moments when I thought I was invincible and didn’t have a care in the world. Fast forward to now: I’m very aware of my many flaws, and know that I was and still am a toxic person. I still constantly screw up.  I find myself daydreaming about moving to the other side of the country to start over where no one knows me. I have nothing going for me here, and no one would miss me.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hungover from a three-day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let's not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

To my Dear SD Sisters and Brothers,          
I had a long day at work so it was well past 10pm before I had a chance to read and Bless each reply in Monday's DCI.  (And Yes, I do read each one and picture a white healing light on each of your names!)  As I was trying to figure out what I would write today, I received a private message from someone.  Part of the note read, ""I just feel so empty.""  I've decided to use my brief space for the following:

To my new friend:  You are not alone.  Please know that You are loved and you are welcome in our SD family!  There was a time in my life --as I'm sure almost all of us here on R/SD-- when I thought alcohol was my only friend.  We understand the feelings of shame, sadness, and loneliness that alcohol brings.  In addition to my brief PM reply, I will reach out to you after work tonight.  I am also asking my SD family to share a few words of support to you as we make our commitment to not drink TODAY.

If anyone is joining us for the first time, no matter what circumstances brought you here, please know that Today is a new day, and you are loved. 

I decided to go with this beginners [**5 Minute Meditation** for Mindful Breathing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmFUDkj1Aq0).  As you take in the positive energy, please release it back into the universe where it might be felt by someone in need.",130,0
820,2021-03-16 00:16:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/m60rl5/i_had_a_victory_today/,I had a victory today!,"So today is my Saturday and I made plans to hang with a buddy and practice some disc golf putting at his house. Now this is one of my best friends, we have been through thick and thin together, including addiction. While he is working on just pulling back his consumption of alcohol and other things, I have chosen to completely abstain. I opened up to him and told him about how bad my addiction had really gotten over the years, and how amazing it feels to finally have some time free from it all. He was very supportive and that honestly took a huge burden off my back.

  


Okay, back to the victory though. I knew I was going to want to drink a few beers while I was there. That's just what we have done so much while playing disc golf, I knew my mind would be craving it. So I took the steps to prepare, I went to the store and picked up a 6 pack of Hairless Dog IPA (it's NA) and was ready to go. Not only did I not want to drink anything with alcohol in it, I really enjoyed what I had bought! I had 3, didn't even feel a buzz, and still had a super fun afternoon!

  


I know it's not much, but it was something I was worried about, and I was able to figure out how to handle it and get through the day without even wanting to drink or get drunk. It made the day so much nicer, and now I'm at home playing around on my computer, sober, and remembering everything we did today.

  


Today I am very content, and I will not drink with you all!",9,0

I never hit rock bottom. In fact, I'm doing extremely well. I own a house. I have a beautiful wife. I have two cadillacs in the garage and a miata I drive in the summer for fun. I make six figures a year and everyone at work loves me and thinks I'm doing an amazing job. I have a lot of friends. I don't need to hide my drinking from anyone. I work 9-5 and then drink in the evenings. My last two promotions came because I was drunk and sent off an email one night feeling confident, and it actually paid off. I've landed clients over drinks worth millions for my company. If you looked at it from the outside, drinking has been nothing but good for me.

But I have a problem. A drinking problem.

Everything I listed above is 100% IN SPITE OF me drinking. While I've been resting on my laurels and thinking that I'm doing well because I was drinking, I've finally realized that what got me here, will not get me to my goals. 

My house I own? It's fine, but it's not in a city I want to live in and it's smaller than what I dreamed of, because I've been too drunk every night to look for a better future.

My wife? I'm now 130 pounds heavier than her and people always comment ""you're outkicking you coverage!"" when they see a picture of us. People are shocked when they see her after knowing me, because she's taken care of herself and I've completely let myself go. She's stood by me 100% of the time and I have her support, but I can't help but feel shitty every day that she met me at 180 lbs, married me at 200 lbs, and now I'm 260 lbs.

My cars are fun, but I almost never get the chance to enjoy them because every weekend I wake up either still drunk, hungover, or I get drunk an hour or two after waking up. They just sit in my garage.

I make six figures sure, but I could be making 200 or 250k by now. After selling my company 6 years ago, I've gotten drunk every day after work and have never in those 6 years have even tried to look for another job. I can coast at my job, I can show up hungover, it's easy to drink every night and do my job. But in 6 fucking years, I could have been 3 jobs deeper in my life and at the pinnacle of my career. But no, I'm still here, still doing the same job, still not moving ahead.

Everyone at work will say I'm doing an amazing job, but that's because my standards are so low. No one has seen what I can do when I'm sober for a long period of time. No one knows the ""real"" me. I haven't gone more than a week without drinking since I started the job. I've drank at least 60 drinks every week since I started, except for maybe one or two when I ""tried to quit.""

The good news, I do have friends. I let them know I'm not drinking anymore and they are actually supportive! We can kick it and just watch a basketball game, play video games, or listen to music and I'm sure it's fucking hard for them, but they don't show it. Thank god for that.

And just because you don't need to hide your drinking, doesn't mean it's not a problem. Just because you don't get blasted at 2:00pm doesn't mean it's not a problem. The years of career progression. The abandonment of my hobbies. The total lack of health -- eating like shit, not exercising, just sitting around drinking all night and all weekend... the end results of those you can't hide. I've been here for 6 years, I'm fat as fuck, and I have anxiety like you couldn't believe. I have horrible psoriasis. My doctor told me I have early signs of fatty liver. I'm ashamed of myself and I realized it's not the drinking you have to hide... it's looking at your fat face on zoom all day. You can't hide that, but you should. I deserve better than staring a dude who doesn't even have a neck anymore all day on zoom.

And imagine blaming asking for a raise on booze. Sure I had the confidence to do that on Alcohol, but only because I was too ashamed of my poor performance to do it sober. If I had been sober the whole time I would have worked harder, moved on to a better situation, and advanced in my career, instead of getting a shitty 10% raise every couple years. Pathetic.

For every client I've landed over drinks, there's another two I probably embarrassed myself over. I envy my co-workers who can have a couple drinks and be fine. That's just not me. I'm the kind of guy who looks at how much wine everyone gets poured at the table and works to finish my glass first so I can claim the extras in the bottle. I'm not listening to anyone at the table. I'm only worried about the next drink, as soon as I have my first drink.

I've been living the lie for the last 10 years that drinking was good for me. I've been brainwashed (yes I read Allen Carr's book and that's what inspired the change), and I'm done with drinking. It will eventually bring me to a real rock bottom, and I need to take control of my life now, while I'm still relatively on top, and reach my true potential. 

From here on out it's one day at a time, and I will not drink with you today my friends. This sub helped start me on this journey and I plan on checking in here every day from this point forward, at least for the foreseeable future. I'm looking forward to weekends of getting things done instead of being hungover, and advancements in my career and working on my hobbies every night instead of just immediately turning to the bottle after work. Thank you all for your stories, and I hope to share my success story every month moving forward from now until the end of time.",39,0

I made it through my birthday, Christmas, New Years, my husband’s birthday, my brother in laws birthday (he’s always been my drinking buddy), and a vacation (a mountain bike trip to Sedona)! 

Sober vacation is by far, my biggest accomplishment! I would typically spend those “boring” hours in a bar getting toasted or I would take the after ride beer to a whole new level and be too hung over to ride the next day, but instead I spent this time reading. Not having those fuzzy memories makes me the proudest. 

Also! Since I’ve been sober, my husband is 100% OBSESSED with me. We’ve always had a great relationship, but he always hated when I got hammered. Those were the only times we fought. Now that we literally have nothing to fight about, his infatuation keeps growing and growing instead of fading away with disgust when I’m sloppy and annoying. 

My biggest inspiration is my 9 year old daughter. I drank too much at my mom’s a week before making the choice to stop. She saw me at one of my ugliest moments...ugly crying, telling my husband we should break up, and wanting to get out of the moving car (so embarrassed and sad she had to see that). Hearing my 12 year old son tell her “Mom’s just drunk, she will be fine in the morning” just crushed me. 

I like myself so much better sober. Life is vibrant and legit fun. I’ve discovered child-like joy in simple things like riding a bike and being outdoors. I’m on my third book this month because my kids and I lay in bed and read every night... 

I don’t look at it like I gave something up or took something away, I look at it like I’ve gained an entire life! 

Also, I’ve always been one to romanticize drinking...I think that for me it was more the ritual of having something fun in my hand to drink. Now I drink Hop Tea,  HopWTR, and Topo Chico with lime and do not feel like I’m missing anything. 

Anyways, I showed my daughter that my counter hit 100 days and she said she is the proudest That is reason enough for me to keep it going...",9,0

I just had addiction brain rear up on me in the strangest way and had to share. For the last few months Ive been eating like crap, feeling miserable, low-energy, depressed. Today I decided to start making changes in my diet, and drove to Whole Foods to do some shopping. The closest WH to me is like an hour away, but it's in a nice town I used to hang out in and it was a nice day for a drive. One of my biggest issues lately is soda, like 2-3 cans a night. Mostly Pepsi cuz that's what we have at work, but cola in general, I dont like any flavored sodas.  Anyway, I was really happy to find a WH brand cola in cans made with no high fructose corn syrup (one of the main things I decided to avoid to get back to clean eating.) I bought a 6-pk. Had one with dinner (a gorgeous pre-made salad) and I liked the taste with food, washed it down well. Grabbed another just now when I settled in to play on reddt, with a clean palate,  took a big swig, and boom! instant craving for rum! It tasted exactly like a rum and coke that was missing the rum. And it made me think of my friend R, who I used to drink rum and cokes with all the time, years ago. And R had lived right behind the Whole Foods! I bet she used WH brand cola as the mixer!  It's 11 at night, I already know I am not going to drink today. But a little voice went ""Maybe tomorrow, just get a nip, make just one. It'll taste so good, just like old times, the way it's supposed to taste, this just tastes weak, it needs a kick..."" I had to give myself a mental shake. I do not drink, why would I be considering it. And I got shit to do tomorrow, which doesn't involve russion roulette LOL  


It just struck me, how fucking weird that my addict brain held onto the memory and roared awake thinking we were gonna be drinking because this taste is supposed to come with booze. I'm not going to drink tomorrow either, and I'm actually gonna try to get used to the cola, maybe make an ice-cream soda with my daughter with it or something to change my brain's associations with it. I only bought a 6pk so if it doesn't work out, no loss, I'll find another brand. I'm giving seltzers another try, bought a few different flavors to try out this week.  Fingers crossed!

But now that I don't drink anymore, I just have a bunch of new bad memories without anything good to balance them out. There's nothing to look forward to, no way to take a break from reality anymore. It's just the same thing day in and out. Wake up, work, sleep. At least with drinking I had an extra step that I could add to that routine any time things got too dull.   


Anyway, I'm less than a month away from a full year sober.

I was so proud of myself and to reward my sobriety, I drank. I went through the mental “what should I drink?” After the arduous process of how drunk do I want to get, what drunk, oh I can’t buy a bottle cuz I’ll drink it all..I settled on a can of wine and two shots of vodka. I used to drink way more than that so I figured I wouldn’t get too drunk. And literally pissing with excitement driving home from the liquor store. I barely made it two steps into my house before both shots were gone and I cracked into the wine. I slammed that can and immediately wanted more. It was awful. I did not enjoy the drinking I was just obsessed with getting more. I tried to get my ex to come over to bring me more but he ended up not being able to come. I read thru my texts “please bring booze” and it’s just embarrassing. I was drunk and didn’t feel like it. I have no desire to drink again because it’s just amazing how tricky and sneaky my brain is whilst drunk. I’m glad I didn’t drink more and that for now at least that stupid desire is gone. To anybody looking to cave, the ONLY fun moments of my drinking night were when I was sober driving home. I was so excited to drink and felt good because I was able to experience my emotions properly because I was sober. As soon as I started drinking I felt the obsession and the almost pissy-ness of not having more. It’s just not worth it.

I've recently been through a really rough break up, my solution afterwards was as i always seemed to do and drink my body weight in liquor. The first two days this made it easier. The third day (sorry to use the cliche) i had what you could call a moment of clarity. It was late at night, but the next day i started to seek help, i've visited a psychologist through my works employee assistance program and i've built a game plan. Because of other stressors also my blood pressure is through the roof and has been for a while, so i'm wanting to be extra careful in the withdrawal process. I'm seeing a doctor as part of the plan i agreed with my psych to assist with that. I've got a couple of questions im going to post below, and would appreciate any advice you may be able to give even if you think its silly or small. If i don't take these steps im going to drink myself to death.

Volume Info: approximately 20 standard Australian drinks a day, i go through either 2 bottles of red wine a night, or about half a cask if not a tad more. Its been for a while and whilst it wasnt this bad before covid it was still an issue.

1. How do i know if i am going to need to go to rehab, its not something i can do very practically but if i need to i will. I'm just not sure how you know when to draw that line.
2. How is the experience, particuarly when you're going through a hard time, to then stop drinking aswell. Does it bring up everything you've been drinking to suppress? Is it like a mad rush of depression? Currently it just feels zombie like, no concentration on anything, its just forcing myself to get through the day and hoping ill start to feel better.
3. Does the medication work, and what are the side effects - is it something that is worth looking at or does it aggravate depression also?
4. How long before you start to feel the effects of quitting?

I'm posting this from Australia at about 12:45 in the afternoon, im trying to reduce drinking so haven't touched a drink today at all yet. But i will later today, just wanted to confirm im participating sober.",6,1

There are still problems to be faced and dealt with. 

But then I remind myself that alcohol doesn't have to be one of them.

I had a dream last night where I was drinking a bottle of whiskey. I actually felt drunk as hell in my dream. I remember thinking, ""this is going to be hard to explain to the guys at work..."" and then just drinking more.

I woke up and didn't realize it was a dream at first, it felt so real. I cannot explain the disappointment I felt in myself. I felt like I had let not only my coworkers (who have really backed me hard in this journey) and you guys down, but myself and my family as well. I was crushed for a minute, until I woke up more and realized it was a dream.

That relief in knowing I hadn't fucked this up was sweet as honey. It really drove home how much better things have been since I quit. I was clear headed, I wasn't bloated, I wasn't sick, I didn't feel like I couldn't think straight or walk straight, I wasn't questioning whether or not I was safe to drive or if I should call in, or whether I'd be good in time to teach my first class...none of that was present. Sometimes it's hard to recognize how far I've come, but this was a moment of clarity, and it made me glad to have taken the steps I have. Still a ways to go, since the journey is never really finished, but fuck have I made some progress, and the thought that I'd thrown it all away is something I never want to feel again.

A small thing, but it felt really good to have external validation that I'm becoming more stable and confident and ""myself"" again.

I can proudly say that it has been 8 months since I drank any form of alcohol. I have started my weight loss journey and workout program and now I am succeeding at that. The strength this community gave me has been the extra push I needed to not only quit drinking but to keep it that way. 

I have come so far the thought of relapsing rarely crosses my mind. “I’ve come this far let’s go a little further” is my drive now. I can’t say for certain that I will never ever touch alcohol again but I can say I won’t today and I probably won’t tomorrow. I don’t have a crystal ball but I do have control over it. 

These last 8 months my wife and I have really worked on our relationship. I have money to spend on toys and restaurants Our goal of buying a house is within reach and now my kids are flourishing. I’m there to help raise my family not be another kid that my wife has to watch and worry about constantly. I started building more things in my spare time for my wood working side hustle I’m doing yoga and running again. I have dropped 13 pounds in 3 weeks because of my new diet. I am so excited I even managed to play 18 holes of golf and had so much fun because I actually played and I didn’t get hammered. 

There have been so many positive changes in my life and it all started by admitting “I have a problem I need help.” I’m never going back to that ever. I may have a moment of weakness in the future and I might be tempted but I can always reach out here and I know someone I will probably never meet in person will save me that day and I will owe them by paying it forward to the next person. 

Sorry this is so long winded but I am so freaking happy I can’t stand it. I finally am doing what I said for so long I couldn’t. My life has changed so much for the better and all it took was putting that bottle down. If it’s your day one and your seeing this I can say from personal experience it’s not an easy climb and you will lose friends along the way and you will feel bad but you will gain new friends. You will become who you want to be and then those days become weeks the weeks become months and before you know it it’s been a half year. I’m so proud of what I have accomplished and I wish everyone who reads this wether it’s your day 1 or day 1000 good luck and success on your journey! I would not be here today if it wasn’t for this community and all of the wonderful internet strangers who have been there for me when I had no one else. IWNDWYT",78,0

Im 25, alcoholism runs in my family, my dad being a hard drinking as long as I can remember. Thank god he’s been sober over two years now. 

I wasn’t drinking excessively heavy.. between 4 and 6 beer 4 times a week.. but alcohol begin to consume my thoughts and entrap me. I felt like everything I was doing eventually revolved around alcohol, and hate how alcohol makes me feel so shit the next day. Not even hungover but dehydrated and nauseated. 

I have seen the negative effects alcohol has had on people around me, and I don’t want that for me. 

In this last month, iv got up every morning with my son bar on Mother’s Day (UK) and maybe one other day my partner got up with him, have been way more present, way more open to paying with my son, which I often feel difficult to engage in two year old play and  alcohol doesn’t help that. Iv been smarter with money, stayed on top of my school work, feel less anxious and do not feel depressed at all and genuinely trying to be a kinder person, one of my worst character flaw is I can be pretty two faced, and like to talk trash, but I’m aware of it and really don’t want to be like that. 

I don’t know if I’m an alcoholic, but maybe it’s best if I don’t know.

The tool I found most helpful to get to 29 days, whenever I felt like drinking really bad I would tell my self “don’t drink today and if you regret not drinking tomorrow morning, have a drink” of course I NEVER regretted not drinking! 

This subreddit has help me, but being honest sometimes I don’t know if it feeds my obsession about alcohol either. 

All I know is, I didn’t think I could get to 29 day but I’m sure glad I have.

My questions and request for advice, insight teachings from all you knowledgeable folks…

I keep getting to about 12 to 24 days sober then my brain feels the intense need for a treat--wine. It feels sort of like a true relief. Hungover on a spectrum—not always a ‘huge disaster’ or complete blackout, but headache, lack of motivation, brain fog, weight gain etc…But my brain remembers that little bit of a tickle of relaxation from half to ¾ bottle of wine. And it feels like “ahhh! Yes, so cozy”. 

What to do when my brain is screaming at me: “I JUST WANT TO FEEL GOOD!” 

It’s like all I can hear and I don’t care about anything else. The sober me feels like a distant, silly, immature dope who is uncaring and has ridiculously high standards. 

Is my brain broken forever? How to not get to the extreme point where I feel such internal stress that the only thing that gets me ‘better’ is a bottle of wine? I feel like I start to grieve the only thing that gives me peace.

Downloaded a sober app today as previously mentioned in a few other posts. 

My drinking is getting out of control. I went through two large bottles of bourbon in a week and a half. I'm scheming of ways to run over to Costco to get more whiskey without setting off any alarm bells for my SO. I applied for a separate credit card just for alcohol purchases. I have to admit to myself I can't just have one drink. If I have a glass of wine it turns into the rest of the bottle, then a glass of bourbon, and another and another and I wake up feeling terrible the next day. I lose track of whole evenings. I forget what is happening in the shows I'm watching. I've knitted whole sections of projects without remembering where I left off because I was too drunk to write it down. I wake up feeling dehydrated and miserable, chug an entire hydroflask of water and boot and rally to get to work. 

Why? Why do I do this to myself?

Today is my day one to change my relationship with alcohol. I'm tired of feeling like garbage and tired of spending money just to drink it away.",13,0

It wasn't necessarily my ""main problem"" (although still a serious problem), and perhaps as a consequence sobriety hasn't transformed my life in miraculous and unprecedented ways. That being said, I quit drinking because it wasn't helping me do anything I wanted to do and because I was serious about getting better with my mental health. The totality of all the changes I've made in my life over the past few years, including sobriety, have contributed to an overall sense of hope and also to my development as a more or less good person.

I just wanted to share my experience so far because I have read so many posts here with people detailing what they have been through and it helped so I’m hoping this may help someone else as well as helping me document my journey.

First of all - totally worth it. Life isn’t perfect but a million times better than when I was drinking. Face swelling almost gone, tummy swelling almost gone, tummy pain is now intermittent but still there. Tiredness is the hardest bit at the moment. I fall asleep as soon as I lie down. I could sleep a lot more than I do but nothing makes a difference to the actual tiredness. This does make life hard. But it’s still no where near as bad as being hungover. I have found that there was a day each in both of the last two weeks where I just woke up in a bad mood and was irritable. But I survived for the most part by avoiding people.

Cravings to day 14 were non existent. Then they came on strong. The telling thing is that I don’t want to drink, I fully understand the consequences and have no interest in it but the cravings still come on strong. Fortunately they have subsided over the last two days so I have a little respite.

Today was my first day back in the office. This caused me anxiety because I have felt that working from home has meant I have had a lot more control over my day meaning I can control side effects of giving up as well as cravings. I had major anxiety that I would not make it. But it was ok. I even went for my usual walk during lunch break at where I work and along the way I passed all 4 shops I used to rotate on a daily basis to buy my whisky from. Had no urge to do so. In fact, I have realised that I cannot walk anywhere I have walked before being sober without walking past somewhere I rotated my whisky buying from. I decided from day one that excercise was going to be a part of my recovery and started with walking. So from day one there has been no direction I can walk in that my alcoholic self hadn’t previously tread in to find booze. But it’s become a non thing now. I’ve started noticing less and less. 

All in all it is not easy at all. Things may change day to day or even hour to hour. And things don’t get better immediately. But it is totally worth it. Because sobriety = freedom.

That said, I totally understand that alcohol can ruin lives and take control away from some users. I have mad respect for anyone who takes responsibility to manage their vices and seeing some of the stories on here make me want to be a better person.

I would never pressure someone else to drink ,and when we have non-drinkers as guests  I make sure we have beverage options so everyone can enjoy their time. But, is the mere fact that I continue to enjoy alcohol while others are disciplining themselves to abstain adding to societal and mental pressures that either cause those people to feel ostracized or possibly even relapse?

I started drinking when I was 15, I’m now 38. My next door neighbour would buy me a 12 pack of labatt 50 and hide them behind my house in the forest. I’d drink a few warm and got hooked on the buzz. Throughout high school my friends and I would always have a 12 pack of moosehead on us or those terrible 2L wine soda drinks. We would walk around, drink go to parties. The normal stuff. 

In college I switched to vodka and started drinking a 26er a weekend and hitting the pub daily. Working during the summer at a golf course gave me access to endless beer after I made friends with the beer cart girl. Moving into my 20’s, finding a bar was the highest priority all of the time. Whenever I was traveling or out with my girlfriend it was always “find a bar” as the first priority. This continued until covid lockdown really. If I was waiting for my wife and had 10 mins to spare I’d find a bar and chug a beer. The bartenders always gave me a funny look. 

In my late 20’s and early 30’s I’d drink 4 or so tall cans of beer a night, and hit up the bar once during the week and drank way too much every weekend. In my mid 30’s i switched to vodka, drinking 3-4 drinks a night and drunk on weekends and blasted on Sunday’s. I don’t know how I got to work most days and functioned, but I did. I’d just go to my area, put on my headphones and ignore everyone around me. 

Covid is when it got bad. My vodka intake was ever day and started to increase, getting buzzed every night. In oct last year a close friend passed away unexpectedly from an accident, it made me look into the mirror and think about how I didn’t want to leave my wife at a young age. My right lower back started to hurt and I started cutting back on the booze , only to revert back to my old ways after saying I wouldn’t. 

I tried to stop, I wouldn't drink all week but when Friday hit I poured myself a treat. On Monday I would say to my self during the day that I wouldn’t drink tonight, only to pour myself a vodka and say what’s done is done. I couldn’t imagine not drinking, it’s part of my NDA coming from a family of alcoholics. 

Late last month my right side was hurting, dull burning pain, it felt like someone punched me. It went away after a few days of not drinking. I finally went to the doctor last week and told them what was up, he was not impressed with how much I drank and he said he’d help me out and first step is to get blood work and reduce my intake. After he felt my kidneys and said he could feel them , which was good. I’m going for blood work tomorrow and I hate needles, so this should be fun. I just pray I didn’t mess up my body too much and I can repair whatever I have done. I’m committed to not hurting myself anymore, for my wife’s sake. 

Yesterday marked 2 weeks without drinking. I had a beer last weekend at a friends house, which was fine. I think I can do this now for good.  3 weeks ago it would have seemed impossible, but here I am. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest and to let people know it is possible. My motivation is really being here for my wife and not disappointing my family by telling them I need a need a new liver in the near future. 


The question. I recently tried a non alcoholic beer and it was damn good. It replaced the taste for me. What is everyone’s take on this?

I’d buy myself a $100 bottle of scotch for each 4.0 semester. Then would proceed to drink half the bottle in one night. 

I’d be on Instagram messaging friends incessantly like it was a normal conversation and not realizing how pushy or drunk I was. They’d laugh it off, I’d be satisfied thinking I wasn’t so cringe. 

I’d remember this all the next day with a headache and dizziness that wouldn’t subside until 5pm the next day. I’d hide in a space to do my work and make myself scarce to anyone who came around.

I burned bridges, made new connections, and thought I was all the better for it. 

I can’t take the feeling of self loathing the next day, the feeling of not wanting to eat for a day, the headache, the feeling of being bloated and having a sense that my blood pressure was through the roof.

I’m finishing one side of grad school and going to another now. I’m sticking to seltzer and tea. 

Saturday, I left the grocery store and next door is a liquor store. I paused for 10 seconds with groceries in hand about to go get a bottle of scotch and two bottles of wine. 

I turned around and went home.

However, putting a lonely person in a place where they feel they cannot escape, whether physically or psychologically, with such a substance is playing a dangerous game.

I say this as I have personal experience of how things can spiral downwards, and how a seemingly harmless pleasure can turn into a tool of destruction.

Ironically, 2019 was the year I finally managed to end my own personal lockdown, a lockdown caused by a disease I had allowed to infect me. Nearly 10 years as an alcoholic had taken my house, my girlfriend, and my job. That year on the 29th of December, whilst having seizures, surrounded by staff in A&E, it came within minutes of claiming my life. When I reflect on the past, and the beginning of my own personal hell, I imagine it looked a lot like the lockdown for some today. No one around to keep me going, not knowing what my future held, and thoughts of only catastrophe. The release, albeit temporary, being provided by the comfortable numbness of an alcoholic drink. However, my biggest mistake was thinking that addiction only happened to others, and that ‘I could handle it’. There is a reason why alcoholism has infected, and sometimes killed some of our most brilliant and brightest minds, it does not discriminate, it can, and will take you, if you don't respect it.

Firstly, it began with a drink to take the edge off, to pick me up. The next day nothing has changed so the excuse remains the same. After a short time, a voice replaced mine, sounding just the same, so convincing were its words, that it bent me to its will, and made me feel as though I was making the decision. Additionally, it was so hard to even notice the changes in me and my habits. This process was stealthy and oppressive. Others may think that this compulsion can be externalized, “just don't listen” you may think, take control. However, the reality is far more surreptitious, and I believed I was simply making these choices, and how do you argue with yourself when you feel uncorrupted? People do not decide one day to ruin their life with addiction. The process of changing you from who you know today, into someone who will lie to protect it, place it above all else, and others, and destroy you and your life around you, is cunning, and does not care if you are successful or highly intellectual. It has seen all manner of hosts before, and in the end, many succumb all the same. Wanting a drink today to take the edge off can easily shift into needing one to obtain the escapism. Especially when right now your world seems so small, and you are temporarily stripped of the distractions normally present in day to day life. Eventually, the need can replace the choice, and your body begins to punish you for not drinking more in order to escape the pain of withdrawal, and this can be at your door before you even see it coming. Not a day goes by when I do not wish that I could have caught myself before that stage.

Lockdown has made so many of us feel isolated, anxious, and hopeless, but the same person that built the life you had before and forged those relationships, will be staring back into the sunlight once the night is over.  However, what remains of you in the throes of addiction you will hardly recognize. Drinking to forget our problems, or to cope with loneliness, is far more harmful, and malevolent than a few too many at the weekend with the gang. It is a hunting ground for a creature that no change in government policy, or relief of restrictions will save you from. It will take you to a place that will redefine your perception of darkness, and despair, and at least some part of you will die there.

My personal lockdown lasted almost 10 years. It took things from me I will never get back and left its fair share of physical and mental scars but with it also came lessons. I had to get to know myself for the first time as I did not recognize who I was without the chemicals added to my brain chemistry. Anxiety and self-loathing turned into profound tenacity, without the crippling poison I was stronger, more thoughtful, calculated and most importantly ready. The road I had always searched for in the darkness was finally forming and with it somehow my career was somewhat still redeemable. Forcing myself through work while suffering withdrawal every single day, losing my mind but somehow protecting the last remaining bastion of my life like shielding a child through a warzone. At least I had this, that is what I thought. The pandemic took that from me as it has so many others, my work contract cancelled days were now filled with constant job searching and rejection emails from the jobs that do remain due to the now huge amount of applicants present. Along with career troubles I was thrust back into the environment I was oh so familiar with, isolation.  However, December 29th 2019 still remains the last time I had a drink. Why? Was it the memory of being near death, the crying eyes that night of my now fiancée scorched into my mind? Yes. The thoughts of letting my family down yet again? Also, yes, but most of all it was the knowledge that I do not deserve to live like that. I cannot and will not live in such suffering. No matter how poorly I think of myself or no matter what life decides to throw at me I refuse to live in that darkness.

None of us can tell the future, no one can claim to know they will move on to live a full and happy life. However as the man I stand as today I turn the defiance I felt to pull me from my darkness to eagerness to truly live. For there are experiences equally profound as the malevolence I fell into, love, excitement, pride. After spending so much of my life with my feelings corrupted and numbed the thing that stands out is how powerful these emotions can be without the shroud of intoxication, worth fighting for, worth staying sober for, worth waiting for. Take it from someone who has played out the whole game that a few hours worth of dopamine to break up the monotony each day is not worth risking losing those moments that you can truly feel as without them we are unable to really live at all. I know now that I will have to be sober my whole life to allow me to live, flying in the face of a drinking culture as well as the odd awkward conversation around why I'm not drinking at a party along with it. I cannot know each person's situation who may be reading this but there are a couple of things I do know. You do not deserve the life that alcoholism will give you, you do not because no one on earth does and you have the right to have the opportunity for happiness, something that will be taken from you. Sir, Madam, fellow human, you deserve better.

Do not let your light be taken by the creature in the comfort.",20,11

Actually working a program, doing zoom meetings every day, giving myself grace through the hard moments and staying honest with the people who love me when my thoughts are veering in the wrong direction...what a difference it's made to actually TRY for once. My biggest fear was quitting drinking. Now my biggest fear is losing all this progress, this amazing feeling of clarity and hope I've gained in such a short time. Is it still a struggle at times? Hell yes it is. But the struggle has become the exception instead of the rule, even this early on. 

I can remember all of my nights-before, I wake up happy and full of energy, I've rediscovered self-care and exercise and am reconnecting with my family in a way I feared I never would again. It's early, early on and there is much work to do ahead, but this is a great start.

I just wanted to share my newfound joy with the community that finally got me to seek treatment. *Thank you* to every single person who takes the time to respond to posts and to share their own experience so candidly.

The past couple days the thoughts have been drifting into my mental space more frequently. I went weeks without hardly thinking about alcohol at all, but lately it has been coming. Someone even offered me a beer yesterday (they didn't know I had stopped drinking). 

So even though you might feel shitty for caving in, coming on here and talking about your experience is helpful to people like me. Not only does it help reinforce the negatives and why we stopped drinking in the first place, but it shows us that we are all human and we can be weak. We shouldn't feel terrible for feeling like having a drink, and if we decide to do so we should feel safe here to talk about our experiences and help each other. 

So thank you to everyone who shares their good and bad experiences on this sub. I read one comment that had a metaphor that I really thought was great. I can't remember the author or the post, but I would like to share my interpretation of it:

I really don't like being a passenger in a car. I always drive when it is me and my wife. Being drunk is like being a passenger in your own body. I'm not at the wheel, I'm not in control. I'm drunk and in the passenger seat. And if I'm really sauced I'm in the backseat laying down trying to stop the world from spinning.",1227,0

I could use some encouragement, you all were such a great help during my sober January that I completed, but here I am back to my old habits already. It’s a hard habit to shake. Some days my anxiety lingers, and I know if I drink I’ll find instant relief even if it’s for an hour, and it’s tempting to do this. But on the backend it will always create more anxiety for me.

There was a time that I never saw this happening for me. I wanted it, God knows I wanted it so bad. Every morning when I woke up with the fear, every mad scramble I'd make to the liquor store to make sure I had enough stock to get me through the night, every single event where I inappropriately drank and tried to turn whatever we were doing into a drinking party even though I was so ashamed.

I had so many excuses and so many ways justifications for my behavior. There's a song lyric I really relate to: "" I am the king of excuses, I've got one for every selfish thing I do."" My marriage was falling apart and as I struggled to keep my household running and trying to maintain the dependable mother, housewife, friend facade I was wasting away mentally and spiritually. 

I was sick. I was afraid. I was so so tired. 

I knew I had to stop. This wasn't living. I joined this sub for inspiration and it did inspire me. I saw people living the dream. Even if their lives weren't perfect I knew it was better than the hell of living as an active alcoholic. I gleaned wisdom from so many strangers and worked up the courage to start my life as that person who doesn't drink and endures the odd looks from those  who do. The day I stopped was the day of yet another family get together where I spent the day fighting the fear and feeling physically ill surrounded by children. I had drunkenly made the cupcakes the night before and they had turned out beautiful but as I looked at them all I could think of was what a chore it was to get it together enough during my drunken stupor to bake, decorate, and pack them up.

&#x200B;

I didn't want this life anymore. I went home and dumped out whatever alcohol I had left in the house and didn't look back. Rock bottom wasn't a thing for me. There were too many well intentioned hands in my life to catch me. It had to be me. I had to put down the shovel and stop digging because in my case it was definitely going to end in death. I accepted who I am:I'm a person who can't drink alcohol, I am a person who will take it to the next level every single time, I will sacrifice everything to make sure I have my medicine. I was sick and I had to be honest with my doctor and get help fighting off the residual anxiety that remained after I had some sobriety under my belt. 

Is life perfect now? No. Is it better? Yes, a million times. My marriage isn't caretaker and embarrassing drunk anymore, I wake up in the morning not feeling awful dread, and I can function. If things aren't going well it's on my terms and I have the strength to stand and deal. I don't care what people think of me not drinking anymore, I don't care if people are potentially gossiping about me; I live in this body and live this life and I will do what I need to do to really live. I guess I'm lucky that I haven't really had cravings. My mind constantly reminds me of how sick drinking made me and all I feel is disgust and an urge to avoid.

I'm just not sick and keeping the lights on at the local liquor store anymore. It gets better and then it gets pretty great.

I woke up every morning at 3am with a headache, but those are dissipating. I feel better every morning. I feel better every evening. I have less lung congestion and I'm breathing better (didn't expect this one).

I definitely had some cravings - usually when I saw references to beer and whiskey but they aren't constant in the evenings as they were in the past.

Weird thing is, my biggest cravings were in my dreams. Seems like my brain can't sway my conscious mind so it's going after my unconscious mind :).

Taking this a day at a time but I'm pretty happy with myself and life in general.

First time posting - hi everyone! I’m your friendly neighborhood secret drunk.  36F living in the fancy apartment downtown with the fancy business looking like she’s together with her fancy life and exercise regime and clean eating plan. She’s not. 

I’m usually SO controlled in my eating but, fries have been my reward for not drinking and god I’m grateful for those fries. Like many of you it seems, drinking had never been an obvious problem for me until 2020 when I spiraled off the fucking deep end and was drinking a pint of vodka every day, a fifth on the weekend days if I could get away with it. I had always been “a drinker” (survivor of 7 Coachella’s by the grace of god) but 2020 something flipped. I lived alone and worked from home and was just secretly and embarrassingly drinking myself crazy, my anxiety was unmanageable and I truly became unglued. 

I got 57 days sober, went on a 2 month bender, got 45 days sober and moved states and went on a 2 week bender, got another 54 days sober and went on a 4 day bender at the end of February. 

Nothing “bad” has ever happened (aside from the loudness, obnoxiousness, fucking people I wouldn’t have fucked and waste of money but, I guess I was lucky I was still “high functioning” before I really spun out of control) but the effect on my body was unreal...  My anxiety spun so out of control I was living in a constant sweaty state of panic, barely sleeping, never eating and having night terror after night terror, vomiting every morning, skin peeling and red, barely making it until lunchtime before I would start my “one shot of vodka every hour on the hour cause that will keep me in control”. It didn’t. 

Day 15 (again) today. I feel stronger than ever this time but, I am weary of myself. The first week is so so so hard, I cannot do it again. So. French fries. 

Thanks for reading, I needed to share this after a hard few days around raging drunk people all weekend. I really find all of your posts and comments so motivating.  Thanks for being here with me. This is the first time I’ve ever really admitted to anyone the full extent of my drinking so. Thank you. IWNDWYT.",211,0

If I knew months in advance of a presentation I had to give, I’d lose sleep and have this low level of dread for weeks on end. One time I had to give a toast at a wedding and got incredibly drunk beforehand for that “liquid courage”. Taking a shot and a klonopin before a public speaking event at work was not out of the ordinary for me, and even then, I’d shake and my voice would waver as I was presenting.

Something shifted in a big way during sobriety. It started when I was speaking at AA meetings. The first few times were HARD. I nearly cried. However, I kept putting my hand up to speak. Over the course of months, my confidence grew, I no longer felt like I had anything to hide, and the idea that I might actually be helping people by telling my story kept me going. It extended to other areas of my life - standing up for myself at work, creating boundaries with toxic people.

I’m reflecting on this as I register to speak at an AA conference to hundreds of people. I’m not even remotely nervous. I’m excited. I love the self-esteem sobriety helped me build.

Long time lurker here,
A while ago I tried to reduce my drinking by cutting it down one drink a day, but each time after a while it's a drink added a day instead
Reading this reddit and your stories really motivated me to just quit, i've got help before from instances but it didn't work. 

My drinking started when I got a bottle of liqor for my 18th birthday, drank it alone while gaming and i was sold because it stopped my emotions for the night and my social anxiety was gone at that moment, I wasn't affraid to talk to people in game anymore, really stupid yeah. Now i'm 24(F) and in all those years there isn't a day i didn't drink. I started to drink as self medicating and eventually it became a part of my daily routine and couldn't stop. It took over my life and health and today i'm going to take it back. 
In the last years i've said so many stupid things, did many stupid thing and just fucked shit up. I want that to be over, just living my life, no waking up with hangovers or trying to remember what happened and trying to perform better at my job.
Many times I said to myself ""okay tomorrow I'm going to quit, just for today I get to drink."" But not today

It's about moderating and controlling the amount I drink, please be nice as I feel the majority in this subreddit don't drink at all.

I've had a long relationship with alcohol that's had its ups and downs, but overall I enjoy it and feel that it can be something I can enjoy in moderation.
Over the years there's been times when there's definitely been far too much drinking and having grown up in the UK there's an almost tacit acceptance that getting drunk is ok. And we're not talking having a buzz or feeling tipsy, full on slur your words and blackout drunk.

Now I've recently turned 30, which is a milestone to many but although I don't see it as one I did notice one thing. Suddenly I'm in a place where I feel like I know myself and who I am and it's made me much more secure as a person. As part of that train of thought I also started thinking about my relationship with alcohol and how much my personal relationships have been affected, negatively but actually also positively. 

I realised that alcohol was something that was always present at almost any social occasion and often the occasion would revolve around drinking. That's not to say there wasn't also food or an activity or that anyone built any social pressure to get drunk. But we all know what it's like and how easy it is to get carried away.

Corona has obviously changed that. However I've been using alcohol as a means to an end to feel a little bit sedated over the last year. Like many who've posted here it's been some time since I hadn't had a drink all week. The only occasions when I don't drink at all or only have one is when I see my SO, who is comfortable with me drinking but doesn't know the extent it's got to now. 
In order to shut down and just coast through this period I've found myself often managing to get through a bottle of rum in one evening, which actually shocked me because although I love drinking is an inordinate amount for anyone. I've been forgiving myself for it and it does help, because I'm not putting negative pressure on myself. As a result it's meant that this didn't become a habit fortunately.
However, I did realise that my intake was much more than it ever used to be and if I'm on my own I almost see no reason not to drink or at worst (in some instances) I worry about being to shut off at night. To me these are the beginnings of dependency, and the idea alone scares the living crap out of me.

So, that's all very nice but what am I going to do about it? 
Reading so many stories here has made me realise that I shouldn't be over dramatic and it's given me a lot of context. I've seen the pain it's brought many, and the pain to loved ones around them, which hit me the hardest. Perspective is a nice thing and important, but I also realise it's not an excuse to allow myself to keep going down this slippery slope.
So I've decided to stop drinking for a month, but starting with a week not drinking first. Here in the UK we will be able to go to gyms again from the 12th of April (fingers crossed), which is just under a month away. Alcohol has somewhat replaced my usual, healthy, mechanisms I use to deal with depression and anxiety, and I look forward to be able to exercise regularly again and get into the swing of things. It'll help reduce the drinking naturally because I have another outlet (usually punching a bag for two hours lol). Having said that, I don't want to wait until then because I want to prove to myself that I'm strong enough and can have some self discipline, which will prove to myself that I'm in control and that actually I'm happier drinking less.

1. Will/how can I enjoy myself sober whilst my group will be partying non-stop?
2. Will I give myself a cheat week (knowing it could potentially restart my regular drinking upon return)?

I should mention it’s not only the group influence - I plan on a solo trip soon and expect similar anxiety going in to it.

From day 36 to about this past weekend, I just went through it. Whatever negativity my mind could imagine, it was there and it festered. I sat down this weekend and started journaling on my iPad. I was writing ideas down; plans for the future, goals, dreams, feelings. And something sparked. I tiny bit of hope and positivity. A belief in myself became apparent. A belief that I have ambitions and stuff to look forward to. I don't feel incredible by any means but I feel better and a little bit more motivated to add to my life.

I didn't think about alcohol all weekend. It's becoming harder and harder to remember. A life has established itself without booze and it has become normal. I've made is through the shit first two weeks of sobriety, I made it through the stage of euphoria, I made it through the depression. And now I'm hopeful again. I'm over the first big hump of sobriety. Now I'm clear and can confidently take the next step.

Just a reminder that if you feel low, soon a good day will come. Remember drinking steals tomorrow's happiness, so if you feel bad today, it's okay. Tomorrow will be better, even if ""tomorrow"" is more of a metaphor for a period of time you have to get through.

Remember, it's not a reward or fun. It's a burden and it holds you back.

But we spend our time together often high or drunk, trapped in the grey haze of addiction. We studied music together, had a band together, live together, have the same friends, the same future goals, we both have ADHD, the same mind, the same problems. We did basically everything together. We were one. Which turned out to be the problem.

The 4 weeks I spent in the clinic were surprisingly great and I grew and learned a lot. He got sober at home as well and seemingly for the first time we met absolutely uninfluenced by any substance and we suddenly realized that we barely ever knew who we truly were. And how toxic our relationship truly was.

For each others abstinence, sanity and health we decided to make a cut and spend some time apart, because we couldn’t just stop being dependent on and addicted to each other as well. 

I don’t know if it was the right decision and it hurts so badly. Two days ago I wanted to drink endlessly until I would black out and, as my thoughts suggested, maybe never wake up again. But then I realized that it was a test of my strength. It wasn’t supposed to be easy. 

Now I’m sober over a month, almost 5 weeks, still hurting but I know that booze wouldn’t mend the pain. I’m grateful that I can feel at all.

972,2021-03-15 06:38:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/m5hv6k/a_happyhopeful_story/,A Happy/Hopeful Story :),"I’ve been a member of this group for a while now, reading posts from others going through similar experiences to my own has helped me immensely. I don’t often comment on posts in this group and I have never made a post despite wanting to, just because of how ashamed I was of my situation. HOWEVER, these past couple of weeks I have been feeling so proud of myself. I really want to share my excitement but my parents, sister, and three friends are the only ones who know the full extent of my drinking problem, so I thought this would be a perfect place to share. 

Some backstory on the worst 4 years of my life: I am 22 years old, so drinking and partying often is still kinda normal for people my age which is a big part of the reason I dismissed this as a problem for so long. My parents were somewhat strict growing up so I didn’t get to go to parties as much as the rest of my friends, but when I did I would go crazy and get wasted to try to make the most of it. I was so excited to move out for university so I could do all the partying I missed out on in high school. And that is exactly what I did. I lived in a student residence so there was never any shortage of parties and drinking. I didn’t give a flying fuck about school, I was having so much fun. In my second year I moved into a house with 4 of my friends. I would go out 2-5 nights a week and get blackout drunk almost every single time. I started mixing in other drugs, mostly coke, xans, and weed/poppers. Once I made weed a regular habit, I was smoking anywhere from 10-30 poppers a day and doing coke all the time when I was partying. My roommates were pretty good about balancing their partying and their regular life but I was not. They would go off to class and work and I would smoke weed and lie in bed and watch Netflix or play video games all day, neglecting school most of the time and just waiting for the next party. At this point I knew that what I was doing was bad but I just didn’t care. I didn’t care about anything really except for having “fun”. I had completely let myself go. I inevitably failed out of university in my third year and moved back home with my parents. I was so embarrassed and I felt like such a disappointment; it seemed like all of my friends and peers were in school and had their shit together except for me. I started drinking even more. Drinking for the hell of it all the time. I couldn’t even tell you why, but I couldn’t stop. I would have benders of being drunk for days straight, even when I had commitments like work, sports, plans with fam or friends; I would show up drunk or secretly drink while I was there. There was no such thing as just having just a couple drinks; it almost always turned into 15 drinks. I was now fully aware of the severity of my addiction. I was so embarrassed about it and didn’t want anyone to know. I did everything I could to hide it from my friends and people I knew but it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to realize when somebody is wasted so people definitely noticed. I was depressed as hell because of it. I envied people who didn’t have this problem and I missed the way my life was  before all of this. I started trying harder to quit abusing alcohol. I considered rehab but I didn’t want to commit to being sober for life, I wished that I could enjoy a couple drinks in a social setting without it spiralling out of control like a NORMAL PERSON. I wanted to go to therapy so badly but I just couldn’t afford it. I had been making a conscious effort to try to change my habits for 2 years with no concrete results. My whole life revolved around drinking and I had accomplished almost nothing in the past 4 years. The more time passed, the more I hated my life and wanted to fucking die. This past October, my friend told me that she was thinking about doing “sober October”, so I told her I would try to do it with her. My mom loved the idea and said she would participate as well. I figured there was a very good chance I wasn’t going to follow through with it but I knew that it was a great opportunity for me because I would have people that are around me all the time holding me accountable. October was approaching and I was dreading it, I knew that it was going to be so hard for me. The first week was the worst and hardest but somehow I stuck with it. I wondered if/how I was going to make it through an entire month of this, but things started to look up. I started experiencing that “sober clarity” that people were telling me about. I had so much more energy, my sleep schedule became a lot more regular, I had the time and motivation to do things that I wanted to do again like working out, school, learning sign language, hanging out with people. I felt PROUD of myself for the first time in a really long time. This made it so much easier for me to get through the rest of the month. Now, I was worried about what life would look like after the month was done. I knew that it would be so easy for me to fall right back into my old habits but I really didn’t want that to happen. Since October, I have been trying my very hardest to stay relatively clean. There have been a couple times where I’ve slipped up. Times where I drank more than I probably should have on a night out. Times where I’ve had a beer or two when I knew I probably shouldn’t be. I haven’t stopped drinking alone but when I do it is after work or when I’m watching the hockey game and I’ve been keeping it to a 6 drink limit. I still smoke weed quite a bit. I’m still working on all of this and that’s okay; recovery is a long process. I CAN say that I have stopped drinking at work. I quit poppers. I very rarely do any drugs other than weed. I can count on one hand the number of times I have been drunk to the point of blackout in the last 30 days. I have been taking care of myself. I have hope for myself. I don’t hate my life and I actually want to be alive. None of this was true for me in the past 4 years before this October. Now that I KNOW that this is possible for me and I’ve experienced the clarity that I had been missing for so long it is so much easier for me to keep going. I’m still going to fuck up and I know that. But now when I do I’m not feeling sorry for myself, avoiding the consequences, or continuing to drink even more to numb the feelings of guilt and shame. Now when I mess up I acknowledge that I’ve done something that doesn’t align with the way I want to live my life anymore. There ARE consequences and feeling guilty is one of them but eventually you have to put it behind you. A slip up does not define you, people make mistakes. You have to forgive yourself and move forward. My recovery process is not done, there is still work to do but I can get there and I will get there. 

I didn’t come here just to flex on all of you, I also thought it might be helpful for young people who are experiencing this to hear the story of another younger person. For the longest time I couldn’t accept the fact that I had a problem. Going through this at an age where binge drinking and partying is normalized can make it difficult for you to start recognizing the early signs of addiction. If you are somebody who is scrolling through this group right now because you think you might have a problem, here is my advice. As you get further and further into your addiction, it becomes harder and harder to stop. I was really lucky and my active addiction was relatively short compared to a lot of people. But me (and I’m sure every other person subbed to this thread) can tell you that this is NOT a path you want to go down if you can help it. Be aware of the early signs. Are you drinking alone? Are you feeling like you have to hide how much/how often you drink from friends/others? Are you feeling guilty about your drinking? Do you ever continue drinking in the morning when you wake up hungover? Are you drinking during the day/for no reason? If you are answering yes to these questions then this is definitely something you want to start actively trying to fix if you think you’re ready. Again, the earlier into your addiction you handle this, the easier it will be. Step 1 is recognizing that you have a problem. It took me a long time before I truly accepted my addiction for what it was, but you can’t fix a problem without acknowledging it exists. Next, if you are going to come out of this you have to REALLY WANT IT. It’s fucking hard and it’s not gonna work if you’re not serious about it and READY to make changes. Identify your reason for wanting to change and keep it in the back of your head, it helps. I had 3 main reasons that motivated me to quit: #1) I was so tired of hating myself and feeling like a failure. I knew that I had so much potential that I was just pissing away. I knew that if I wasn’t drinking all the time I could be successful and I could be happy; I remembered the time before my addiction where I felt like I was. #2) I felt terrible about the people I was hurting. Mainly my family. I love them more than anything and it absolutely broke my heart whenever I would think about how hard it must have been for my parents and my sister to watch me do this to myself. I knew how disappointed they were and it really bothered me. #3) My future. I recognized that if I continued down this path I would not be able to keep a job. I wouldn’t ever graduate school. I would lose friends. The chances of me finding a partner and maintaining a healthy relationship in my current state were microfuckingscopic; I have been single for my entire life thus far and the thought of potentially being alone for the REST of my life terrified me. Once you have decided that you truly want to do something about your addiction you need to make a plan. What are you going to do to fix this? What steps will you take? Who can help you? If you have support available to you TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. If you can afford therapy, please GO. If you can’t afford professional help, there are lots of other options. Reach out to friends, family; people you love and trust. Let them know what is going on and discuss what they can do to help you. It can be terrifying to open up about this but you will get there. I had an especially difficult time talking about it with people I know because it was extremely shameful to me and I worried they would look at me differently. It’s hard for someone who hasn’t struggled with addiction to understand the depth and severity of what you are going through. If this sounds like something that might be a problem for you as well there are apps to help you quit and online support groups like this one where you can share with others who UNDERSTAND or just listen to their stories if you aren’t ready to share your own. It helps. Honestly just reading some of the stories on this page of people who were way further into their addictions than I was scared the shit outta me and forced me to think about what my future would look like if I continued drinking the way I was. I’ve heard that in person support groups/AA meetings are great as well. There’s lots of help out there but you have to ask for it and accept it. I will reiterate that the process of recovery is not an easy one whatsoever. You will  probably have lots of failed attempts before you are successful but you CAN do it if you keep working at it. Don’t let a relapse or even 50 relapses stop you from trying again if it is something you really want. You can do anything if you want it badly enough, and I promise you that this is worth it. 

Wow okay sorry I didn’t intend for this to be so lengthy but if you are still with me I really hope my story has helped you in some way. If you take anything from this, remember that sober October is what it took for me to finally start seeing progress so I would HIGHLY recommend committing to going completely sober for a minimum of one week if you are able to and getting a taste of the life you’re missing out on. This might be the motivating push you need to put down the bottle for good, it was for me! If this has resonated with you or you have any questions/want further advice on how to get started (I’m no therapist but I can try my best!) you are more than welcome to comment or message me privately. Thanks for reading and good luck in your journey toward recovery!

974,2021-03-15 06:26:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/m5hp4u/nietzsche_on_alcohol/,Nietzsche on alcohol,"Just copy and pasted this from an article, has been helpful for me and I hope others might find this view useful.

He hated alcohol for the very same reasons that he scorned Christianity: because both numb pain, and both reassure us that things are just fine as they are, sapping us of the will to change our lives for the better. A few drinks usher in a transient feeling of satisfaction that can get fatally in the way of taking the steps necessary to improve our lives. It’s not that Nietzsche admired suffering for its own sake. But he recognised the unfortunate – but crucial – truth that growth and accomplishment have irrevocably painful aspects: “What if pleasure and displeasure were so tied together that whoever wanted to have as much as possible of one must also have as much as possible of the other. You have a choice in life: either as little displeasure as possible, painlessness in brief or as much displeasure as possible as the price for an abundance of subtle pleasures and joys.”

Nietzsche’s thought recalibrates the meaning of suffering. If we are finding things difficult, it is not necessarily a sign of failure, it may just be evidence of the nobility and arduousness of the tasks we’ve undertaken.",105,0

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

I read a story this past week about a little girl who spent her Christmas money to create care kits for homeless people. Her dad took her shopping so she could buy the supplies and she took the kits with her to an out of town basketball tournament she was playing in, and when there was a few hours free in between games, she and her dad and a few of their teammates used the time to hand them out to homeless people on the streets.

I was touched to my core by the generosity and kindness of this little girl. Not only did she use her Christmas gift to bring comfort to strangers in the street, she brought her friends to help her hand the bags out and shared with them the beautiful gifts that come from paying it forward. She’s inspired me to think of ways that I too can bring comfort to our own growing homeless community, outside of my regular donations to the foodbank and charitable causes. What can I do that isn’t just donating money? I have some ideas.

How about you? Do you have any AoK you would like to share?",19,0

I drank socially and, except for a few times over-indulging, it was never a problem - e.g. it never interfered with my health, work, relationships, etc.  

But after a trial period of sobriety (today is actually day 88), I realized with some alarm that I may have recently been developing an actual dependence on alcohol, here in my early 50's.  

The warning sign was that I started thinking about having that evening drink both more regularly, and earlier in the day - something which never happened before.  It wasn't just like it ""sounded good"", it was more like it was ""calling me"".  (I hope the distinction makes sense.)  

Anyway I'm pretty sure this is something I need to seriously listen to but I'm still confused, how this could develop so much later in my life after never any major issues in my past.  Any of you experience something similar, or know about the process (or where I could learn more about it)?  Thanks friends.",6,0

Saying that, I hate my life sober. Nothing is fun for me anymore. All big events I no longer look forward to like birthdays, holidays, vacations, weddings, concerts, etc. I have hobbies but they aren’t enjoyable for me as I know I would feel 10x better if I was doing it drunk with a dopamine rush. My reward system is permanently broken.

I’m not sure if I’m oblivious but I don’t get a lot of the sayings related to enjoying sobriety and thinking positive. It seems like a majority of people are fine with accepting that their lives will be less boring without alcohol. Like all that matters for enjoyment is waking up without a hangover, being able to remember events and having a couple small hobbies like working out or reading. 

Are those simple pleasures genuinely what gets people through the day? I can’t imagine myself having the drive to make it through a lifetime with only things like that to look forward to. What am I missing here?",5,0

But then today she won facebook contest that landed her 2 new bottles and she got so excited that she sent me a vocal message '' Saying : I know you dont want me to talk to you about this but i won 2 bottles of gin ! ''.

I couldnt really share her joy. Since i also stopped smoking 2 weeks ago, my rage comes up quite easily so i just got mad at her and she got sad. I understand why and i also cant expect her to shut down her passion for me. Its my life and my problems.

Had a BP crash after that stint, came out of it but didn't get back on my meds, but I was feeling good, everything seemed to be working out! I had met this amazing girl, honestly she's the one, but then about 2 months ago, I started being mean to her while I was drinking, not trusting her, violating her privacy... 


I don't know how much was the drinking or the BP swings but it got worse and worse... Then she left me and I lost it, just all control, gone. I was sad and angry and drowning myself in booze and then amplifying mistakes because I felt alone and that no one cared... It was really bad, I didn't recognize people's faces and I pushed her away more and more and more.


I had counseling Friday, going for medicine adjustments and such this Thursday, then more counseling Wednesday. I know I need to get better, and I really want to get better. I have kids that don't need to see me like this ever, and I know it had to be bad for the girl to leave me, because she'd do anything for me and I managed to push her past that.


But I know I need accountability, and right now all I have are you fine strangers on the internet. So maybe this will help, maybe it won't, but I'm not drinking today, because I deserve to be better and those that love me deserve better.

He's here for a bachelor party. 

I've noticed some polar opposite shifts in my demeanor towards him, not that I don't care about him but just that I didn't find myself with that same rush of 'excitement' as I would have in the past. We spent our fair share of nights partying together 'back in the day.' 

&#x200B;

My friend is understanding of my sobriety and would never pressure me. But a few times this past weekend, he asked if I wanted to meet up... and there wasn't an ounce of my being that wanted to. I, of course, said no, but I realized... 

I thought about getting ready... and well, I don't own anything I would even want to wear to a bar anymore. My attire no longer revolves around trying to attract the opposite sex in a blackout. 

I thought about how much mental energy it would drain from me to be there, and that alone stopped me.

I thought about how I enjoy my house, my pup, watching the sunset, reading a book, and just being with myself. That was next to IMPOSSIBLE before.

I thought about the smell of alcohol and instantly want to throw up. It makes me feel nauseous. 

&#x200B;

A switch has flipped inside me. I know it's one day at a time, and trust me, I'm not taking this moment for granted, but I am so freaking proud of myself for how far I've come, how much I've changed, and how evolved I am. 

&#x200B;

The desire is completely gone (in this moment).

Of course, I still saw my friend. I had him meet me at the dog park. I don't have any guilt about saying no to going to bars, where in the past I would've been waiting for him at the bar entrance with confetti and fireworks. 

It's a whole new me!

So a couple years ago, one of my friends had a party to celebrate his first kid.  I was drinking from the minute i got off the plane, basically the whole weekend, made a complete fool of myself, threw beer bottles into the street, got into weird heated political discussion with my friends in-laws, passed out on the lawn etc...Now me and my friend and bunch of the other guys at the party were all in the army together, so this kind of drunkenness was accepted and encouraged, a sign that we were all having a good time and some weird macho signaling.  even still, i went home that weekend embarrassed and honestly couldn't remember large portions of the weekend.  Got sober some time later.

now fast forward to a couple months ago, my friend is having a second kid, second party, same people.  i hadn't told any of them i was sober, and i was worried they were going to make fun of me, try to push me to drink, or that i'd be the ""boring sober guy"" at the party.  

Fast forward again to this weekend.  The party was great! Nobody really cared that i wasn't drinking, only one guy tried to get me to drink, and only once.  I remember everything that happened, and it was honestly a really great time.  not being drunk, i was able to actually talk to people and engage, actually be part of the party instead of the guy on the side hammering beers.  Some people even wanted to talk about why i decided to stop drinking, and in the course of discussion they kind of agreed with a lot of my sentiments.  And as a bonus i didn't have to drive 4+ hours home while hungover.

so i guess the take away is that parties are still fun while sober, and your real friends won't give a hoot that you don't drink.  so good night everyone and IWNDWYT",85,0

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hungover from a three-day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let's not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Never got into fights or got violent or drove or anything like that, I would just constantly drink til I was good and buzzed and then be worthless. Finally decided to quit when my daughter got mad at me for saying I “needed” a drink. 

Quitting has not been too hard after just getting over the initial hump to tell myself it’s time to stop or I’ll die or hurt those I love. 

I feel so much better already in a bunch of ways. Sleeping better, Better skin, less aches, feel more alert and thinking much clearer. My digestion has gotten significantly better...bowels making much less noise and not aching nearly as much. After three weeks though I’m still loose on the pot. Not water but loose. Is three weeks too long for that? Will it get better?

Days are so much longer now lol....it’s amazing the time I wasted. I’m enjoying life so much more in general already. So glad for finding this group. Reading others’ stories has been a great help. Just felt like sharing. Thanks y’all!",6,0

The story of the night was that I was out with my friends. I had like 3 margaritas 5 shots in less than two hours. Thinking about it, as I’m typing this, I got carried away and should have not drink that much. Then, I met my fiancé at a bar with her friends. Last thing I remembered was having a mixed drink and a shot. We left and went to another bar. After that, I woke up in my bed the next day with no idea on what happened. I checked my bank to see if I spent any money at that bar but no money was spent. She said she dropped me off because I got so drunk. I just need advice on how to better control myself. This isn’t the first time and I want it to be the last time. I have gotten better. I use to black out more early 2020 and before but i do not want to black out or get that intoxicated again. I did not eat much that day so that could be one factor. Or just not drink that much but I want to completely control myself. Any advice? Thanks in Advance!",4,0

But tonight, even though after I post this I’ll probably second guess it over and over but I’m going to do it anyway. 

For the second day in a row I’ve had a really great/productive day on a weekend no less. The last two nights now I’ve got everything ready for tomorrow had a good supper and showered. Sat down in my bed with a sparkling water and a tangerine popsicle. And now for the second day in a row as I sit here I just can’t believe I am here doing what I’m doing. I can’t believe after 5 years of heavy everyday drinking and the 5 before that drinking almost everyday. I can’t believe I’ve lost so much weight, started eating healthy and exercising and the list goes on and on. The last year I’ve only drank 3 or 4 times. I regretted it but 4 out of 365 is way better than 365 out of 365. 

I owe this whole thing to this sub and I’m dead serious. About a year ago when the pandemic started I got even worse then I’d ever been. I found this sub and I think in a day or two I saw a post about This Naked Mind. I hung around the sub not fully done drinking yet for awhile. Then I got bored and said eh I’ll read that book. I don’t read, I haven’t read a book on purpose ever in my life I don’t think. Then one day I downloaded that book after everyone talking about it. I read the entire thing in a day non stop. I was crying while reading it. It was crazy. Lol. Then I started checking the sub more everyday. And day by day I just stayed sober. I think I went back and read parts of the book a few times. I started to eat better. Started biking everyday when it was my usual time to go to the liquor store. I just can’t believe how much my body and my life has changed. 

I could go on and on about old war stories and this and that but I’ll end it here. If anyone is out there lurking reading this, not thinking they can do this, I made this post to tell you that you absolutely can. Just give it a shot and be patient and the results will come. If you asked me this time last year I would not have thought in a million years that I would be here right now sober posting on the internet.

At 15 or so, I don't even remember.

I was doing okay, for the most part. But recently I got a (really good) job at a liquor store and sometimes my boss buys something so we can drink at the end of the day. It started with once every few weeks. But last week it was almost everyday. Sometimes it was just my boss and I, other times it was my boss, my other boss and I. It was champagne, it was vodka, it was beer. We have been drinking a little bit of everything, and I would arrive home tipsy or almost drunk.

I started to drink a lot again. At first, I would get tipsy with the first cup, but now I can drink half a bottle of vodka, a whole bottle of champagne, a few beers and I feel nothing. I feel nothing and it scares me because I know it means I fucked up. It means that now I need more to get tipsy like I used to, which already shows I have a problem.

I wasn't drinking to blackout, but I was drinking every day and I had been for years.

This guy was on a totally different level and was it was obvious to all of us who worked with him. He was at the tail-end of that phase we call ""functioning alcoholic"" - he was being pulled up on it at work. People knew. He'd long-since passed through the ""able to hide it"" phase.

I saw something of myself in him. I saw the road ahead for me if I didn't stop. Was I really any different to him? After all we were both drinking every day - he was just drinking more. Twice as much? Three, four times as much? Did I really want to keep going down that road to find out when I too wouldn't be able to hide it?

We both moved on, but before we did I had already stopped drinking, partially because of him.

I found yesterday that out he died in late 2019. He was 51 years old. Details are pretty thin - he died at home, and it was pre-pandemic so it wasn't Covid. It hit me hard because his struggle became my strength. I don't know if he drank himself to death - but I do know that his drinking was, for the three years I knew him, killing him and had been for many years before we met.

Wanted to share my story here: In October of last year my GF and I broke after moving in with each other. We had moved to another state together, lived together for about 6 months during the pandemic  and then decided we didn’t like each other much. Think the pandemic accelerated the end of our relationship. I’ve been doing some soul searching during the past 4-5 months since the breakup and realized that I had been drinking ALOT near the end of the relationship. A lot to
me was about 3-6 drinks a night (mostly beer). My partner would not drink on weekdays but would sometimes drink with me on weekends. I would crack 3-6 beers a night watching tv and I know my partner was secretly judging me. 

Since I’m now single, I’m trying to get in better shape both physically and mentally and noticed I was continuing to drink alone almost every night. I’d drink when I was happy, when I was sad, when I was lonely and when I was social. Experimentally I told myself “let’s try to kick the alcohol for 30 days.” It’ll help me lose weight and help me mentally focus. I haven’t had a drop of alcohol since the last weekend in February but the urges are real. 

Today was a beautiful day and all I wanted to do was kick back in my backyard hammock and drink a few cold ones. I resisted the urge but have had urges like that almost everyday. I’ve put all my alcohol in a back closet so I am resisting but I can’t believe how mentally handicapped I feel convincing myself to drink. 

These urges have taught me that maybe I do have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. I hope to one day NOT feel the need to drink everyday but am thinking that a 30 day break may not actually break the urge to have a few beers everyday. 

Anyway, here’s to NOT drinking with you all today. I know that my dependency on alcohol is minor compared to some of the posters (or at least it sounds like it is) but I thought my story may relate to some folks that visit this Reddit.

My step father quit drinking a while back, as well. He was sober for quite a while, and was doing great!

Then he fell off the wagon, REEAAAALLY hard. He was at the point where he would wake up at 5am, and go straight for a whiskey bottle. Pound a few shots and open a tall boy of beer. And proceed to get stupid blackout drunk by 8am.

Then he would sleep again until about noon. Get up, rinse and repeat. All day and all night. I knew it was a matter of time before something terrible happened.

He cleaned himself up again, and had a pair of heart attacks. So he was now on medication and everything... didn't slow him down.

Two days ago. He was smack dab in the middle of a pretty career ending bender, in the wee hours of the morning. With no shirt on, in his pajama pants... he went outside, to what I could only assume, was go to his PADLOCKED booze fridge, which he always kept stocked. Stumbling around, stupidly... he had a heart attack. He was found by an older man walking his dog early in the morning dead, in someone's front yard.

I have had plenty of urges and cravings in the last couple hundred days... but I tell you, good people. That came to a crashing halt.

Its terrible that this was the epiphany that it took to really sink it in. But I can honestly say, if I start drinking again heavily, that could very well be me in 30 years.

Been sober now for a week! Started after I had a classic Monday night bender that ended at 6:00am (other drugs were involved) Tuesday morning which then led to me calling in at work, ashamed. So it’s been tough but just going day by day. 

The struggle I am having right now is dealing with my sober depression. I’ve been going out with friends and not drinking and choosing the “no-proof” cocktails at restaurants. But because I’m usually the drunk one, ordering two drinks at a time, and racking up 200$ tabs, I feel out of place. I’m just so used to be drunk in social settings. I feel like I contribute to conversation less and my mood is more subdued. When I’m drunk I don’t have to put in effort to socialize or make a dumb joke because I’m all excited about being drunk and out. But sober me thinks more before I talk (I guess that’s a good thing) but the night out is not as sparkly and, well, fun. And being a person that wants to bring in lively conversation and laughter, it’s tough to realize that at this moment, 7 days sober, that it’s a bit more difficult to socialize. 

Anyway, Imma keep chugging along and hopefully I’ll begin to forget about my internal need for alcohol as a social lubricant and come into my own, socially, as a sober person. 

Love and peace to all! Today I will not drink!!",4,0

I’ve come across this community before and you all seem like real and supportive people. So I figured I would bounce something off you guys, if you’ll have me. 

Basically, I’m pretty sure I have a drinking problem. I never really drank, but I did have a problem with opiates in the past. I’ve been clean from all drugs for a few years now, but when covid hit I started drinking more often. 

It started with drinking 2-3 nights a week last March, and within 2 months I was drinking every single night. I’m at the point now where I can’t remember the last time I didn’t drink at least a 6 pack after work, but usually it’s at least 10-12 beers every night. 

My issue is that I tell myself that it’s normal to drink and I don’t get hangovers so I must be fine. But I know I have a problem. The second I get off work I go to the distributor and grab a 12 pack and have at least 2 down before I even get home. I need a wake up call. My girlfriend tells me at least 3 times a week that I need to chill out and that I’m becoming an alcoholic, but I tell her I’ll be okay and the worst part is that I try and believe that myself. 

I need to stop. I need to know the damage I’m doing to my body. I need to have the foresight so see what will happen to my life if I continue down this path. I’ve been here before with other substances and I wished so bad that I would have stopped sooner. And here I am in the same situation with a different substance and I just can’t get myself to stop. My biggest fear is the sleepless nights when I do stop. I hardly slept for months when I stopped opiates. I work on high voltage power lines and I need a clear head when I’m at work and lack of sleep scares me. 

Idk the point of this post, I guess just to see if anyone in this community could give some advice or perspective. Or even someone just reading my words would be a comfort. I have this thing on my back and it’s starting to weigh me down with guilt and dread. Thanks for reading, and I hope to one day not drink with all of you.",4,1

I've been binge drinking for years and it finally caught up to me on Friday night. I had been hiding my alcoholism from those I love, especially my husband who would always find out. I started keeping handles of vodka in my car, pouring my drinks into a reusable water bottle and taking it everywhere with me. To my job. Whenever I would go visit someone. My addiction to alcohol outweighed any possible horrible accident that was waiting to happen.

I'd go through a handle every 2 days, going to work buzzed, coming home and drinking myself into a blackout and waking up in the middle of the night not knowing what I did and said.

On Friday night I was supposed to go on a trip so I was driving to the airport. I had been drinking all day and stopped to get some more. I didn't realize how drunk I really was when I started to see double and before I knew it, my car was stuck in a ditch and I couldn't get out. Someone found me on the side of the road and the police were called. A tow truck was called and my husband had to come and get me. The officer saw the empty bottles in my car and by the grace of God, he didn't arrest me with a DUI because my husband came to get me. 

My stomach is sick knowing what could have potentially happened. I could have killed someone, killed myself, completely wrecked the car, gone to jail. But I was saved that night. I missed my flight, deeply hurt the friend I was supposed to see and hurt everyone around me. 

My body hurts and I'm experiencing withdrawals already, I can barely eat and I'm trying to keep my fluids up. I feel so ashamed, so lost, so alone. I went to 3 online meetings and I'm planning on going to a face to face AA meeting tomorrow as well as calling an outpatient treatment center. I feel awful but nothing would have stopped me until that moment I swerved into a ditch. 

I know I have a long road ahead of me and I'm already dreading tonight because I'll have to be sober. But I can't drink anymore. I need to start to take care of myself and I don't want to be a slave to alcohol anymore.

I'm tired of lying to my wife about my drinking, and seeing the disappointment in her eyes.

I'm tired of losing control and basing my life around when I can sneak off to have a drink. 

My biggest worry is boredom and what I will do to have fun. I'm worried that my life is just going to be extremely boring now that I've decided to go sober. I'm worried about what people will think about me since I've always been the guy into wines, cocktails etc. 

I don't know how it will play out but surely it will be a better feeling than the morning the regret. Surely it will be better than discovering I spent a thousand dollars last night partying. 

It's been a long road for me. I've had a great career, travelled the world, partied in countless cities around the world. I've had the privilege of  getting away with all my drinking because it was apart of my work and I could afford to sustain my habit. But not really thinking what else it would take away from me.

\- Spent in bed, unable to move until 1 or 2 PM to basically crawl to the kitchen to get some food in my stomach, then laying back down for hours, not sleeping but in a half haze of switching from side to side trying to feel less sick and in pain. Watching hours of TV, my computer and phone dying and literally not having enough energy to be able to move the 6 feet from my bed to the wall to plug them back in. 

\- Day drinking (not fun, not glamorous, when you're drinking at 12 PM on a  Sunday because you're so hungover from the night before). Feeling like shit going to ""brunch"", cheeks hot, feeling sweaty, dizzy, drinking mimosas until we felt good enough to switch to stronger drinks or shots. Barely enough overpriced brunch food in my stomach to try and sustain myself, getting it in a togo box for later since it was always about drinking, not the delicious food! Someone suggests going back to a house for more drinking. The afternoon unraveling as people get too drunk, passing out on the couch around 3, waking up in the evening confused.

\- Drinking enough to black out, waking up just in time (hah) at 3 AM to feel the overwhelming anxiety and sheer, sweaty dread about having to be at work in a few hours. Trying to convince myself that if I can just sleep for a couple hours I might be okay for work. My mouth feeling grimy. 

And then Mondays: waking up in a panic, trying to put on makeup and disguise my puffy face and bleary eyes. Rushing to work in my car, maybe I'm still drunk? I would often not even have time or energy to shower, or wouldn't have any clean laundry to wear. Being in a terrible mood, so nauseous, the weekend's bender turning into a cumulative hangover of pure death. Feeling so irritable in my office, people asking me how my weekend was. Trying to think of a response, and my brain would just be blank and foggy, my thoughts swimming, trying to keep my eyes focused, and I would really have to ask myself in order to answer: ""How was my weekend? What did I even do?"" and the answer really was that I had started drinking the minute I got home from work on Friday, and that other than that the whole weekend was a miserable, drunken blur. It was so sad.

I was so miserable. So depressed. I can still remember it now SO clearly.

&#x200B;

Today my partner and I slept in. Woke up and made coffee, listened to good music all day. We cleaned the whole house, watered all of our plants. I danced around the living room some. Did laundry. The weather was beautiful so we opened all the windows in our house and let the breeze blow in. We're getting ready to go for a drive and a quick hike before the sun goes down. I know that I'll be able to sleep tonight, that I will eat a proper dinner, that I will brush my teeth and wash my face and that I'll be ready to go to my job in the morning.

&#x200B;

I love to drink. But I love being prepared for life more. Quitting drinking has been the single hardest act of self-discipline in my life. It scares me that sometimes I think about drinking and try to convince myself that it would be worth it. But clean and calm Sundays, and being okay on Mondays are so much more important to me than the instant gratification of alcohol.

I went to my doctor about it several times and she mostly rolled her eyes because I guess I didn't meet her expectations of what an alcoholic ""is."" Eventually she gave me meds, but in the end I just did it the old fashioned way: not drinking. Ta da! 

Anyway. I have bipolar and PTSD which basically led me down the path of drinking frequently in the first place. I was hired for a job that required a top secret clearance and subsequently offered a promotion that came with a move to Europe for 5 years. I was ecstatic.

But. I had to have a pysch eval for my clearance.  I had years of stability, regular counseling, medication, references from my psychologist and psychiatrist.  I figured it was in the bag and walked out with confidence...only to be denied.

The evaluator saw that I had taken medication for ""alcohol use"" and without asking me about it, he told them I wasn't stable or trustworthy.  Goodbye Europe and promotion.  Potentially goodbye job if my $5k lawyer couldn't overturn the decision.  

I was crushed. I had done nothing wrong. In the most unexpected way, alcohol robbed me of some big dreams. 

Anyway. I decided to not stick around and fight the decision because I don't need that kind of stress in my life. I moved to the beach. I'm still sober...and I am happier than ever.  

TLDR: lost a high paying dream job because of alcohol but I live on a tropical beach now, I'm sober and happy.",10,0

Only one drink. \*this original number was incorrect\* (6-7 ounces) - it was only 2. oz - of Kentucky Owl Rye. Slammed it. Nothing more. DIdn't really feel anything.

Realize I've been gaslit by a rather controlling, traditional family that I am an alcoholic all these years.

Before the 2020 holidays I got sober and observed their behaviors toward me.

You know what?

I was drinking to mask the pain they're causing.

Got sober and dealt with that pain and distanced myself from them.

Not sure if I am happy with the 3 months - not sure how much I'll keep going - my skin is much worse (BAD ACNE) and the only benefit really has been somewhat better of a sleep schedule. Not sure if I want to get on Zoloft or something for my anxiety issues. And I've put on weight because my body has been craving chocolate. Grateful I am not an alcoholic and it didn't go into a landslide. It kind of annoyed me to be honest, because I really didn't feel anything with the drink.

I'm 125 lbs. woman, 5'8.

Recently, more loudly. I binged Wednesday night and was wracked with severe anxiety Thursday and Friday - heart pounding, sense of dread, the works. For some reason I decided to do it again last night. I drank the same amount I usually drink - I can usually wake up the next day and go to work at 8am no problem. But this morning woke up with a splitting headache, anxiety, and I threw up. I haven’t had a hangover like this in months, probably more than a year. 

I feel angry at myself for what I’ve put my body through for so long - I haven’t properly nourished it, I haven’t been exercising, as a matter of fact I’ve been poisoning it. I’m 30 and I feel like I’m at least 10 years older. Overweight, always exhausted, always anxious, lonely, lazy. I don’t want to spend my 30’s like this. 

I feel a little underprepared but ready to stop. Quitting forever seems like a daunting task so I think I’ll just focus on one week for now and see how I feel after that. I haven’t been sober for a whole week in probably more than 8 years.

Whenever I have about 30% of the bottle left I’m already getting anxiety about going to the shop for the next one. Who I’ll see out. If the cashier can smell it on me. If the cashier has seen me buy whisky that day already. NONE of that pain.

2. Remembering recent conversations I’ve had. I won’t tell my wife a story and she’ll say ‘you’ve already told me that twice’.

3. No depression. I’m lucky that I’m not a depressive by nature. I know everyone is not so lucky but it means when I’m not drinking I’m just happy existing and it’s so much less draining. 

4. Not feeling exhausted from a day off. I could never enjoy weekends. My second full time job of being alcohol dependent took care of that. Even if I had three days off- I’d have just sat and drunk - I’d still be so exhausted by Monday. I have energy now, I feel a lot more alive.

5. This sub. It’s been amazing in helping me during these fifty days. This is the third longest stint of sobriety I’ve enjoyed in 13 years and I feel a world better. I just want it to continue so much. I just need to focus on today. Not drinking today. Do that one thing and every other thing becomes so much easier.

Done.,"As the title says, I am absolutely done with drinking. I’m 31 and started drinking when I was 17. Up until I was about 25, I was a social drinker and could go days without it. After that, it turned into daily drinking. 8-12 IPA’s a day on average. Some days I would only have two or three and feel so proud of myself. 

Over the past five years, I’ve quit 4 or 5 times. Sometimes I’d go 3 months and others would be three weeks. My last attempt was December 4th and made it about a month and a half. Up until the end of January, I picked it back up again. It’s gotten to the point over the past month where I’m drinking at work, putting beer in a togo coffee cup. Wearing a mask has helped cover the smell. Drinking during class (turning zoom video off). 
Last Monday, I woke up around 4 am to vomit. I That continued until Thursday. I think my body was telling me something. Monday morning, I had to leave work early because it was so bad I needed to go home to take the edge off. I’m such a fucking liar and everyone close to me thinks I’ve been sober since December. I’ve ruined every relationship I’ve been in. I’ve started to struggle with school and have gotten extremely behind on my assignments over the past month. Yesterday, I skipped class to drink instead. 

Last night, I drank my last beer and told myself “I can’t keep living like this. I think this is why I’m starting to feel depressed. I used to be such a happy person. What the fuck have I done to myself? What the fuck have I done to the people that love me? I’m gonna drink myself to death one day. This shit has got to stop and I’m done with feeling like this all the time.”

I’ve stopped drinking before so I know what to expect over the next few weeks. I just have to stay the course this time. This time is the last time. I know my life will improve and I know I will start to feel better about myself. 
After reading this sub all morning, I have a gained an extreme amount of hope. I’m crying tears of courage as I write this. I am ready to stop drinking and start living. Thank you for reading.

I’m not one to usually talk about my alcohol problem with anyone, but I am realizing now that I need an outlet and cannot do this on my own. I always think I can but then I fail. I decided to finally stop drinking this year and I stopped for two weeks which is a big deal for me. Then of course I feel better, thought I could have a little drink before bed and boom, one glass turned into an all nighter.

I am more than ready but I know I am also weak. I am trying to find anything to keep me occupied especially since I work from home. I have read lots of others stories here who are exactly like me that makes me feel not so alone. I see people getting into books, taking baths, working out, and just self care. So I am going to try to find some outlets since I haven’t had any besides work and alcohol for the last year. If anyone has any suggestions as to what worked for them I would love to hear them :)

Now what do I do?,"Does anyone else feel like quitting drinking has been anticlimactic? I drank every day for years and years. I stopped for 4 months, but because sobriety wasn't the main reason for me to quit, I jumped right back in again. There was always the voice in the back of my head that knew my drinking was bad for me, I knew I wouldn't be able to drink like I was forever. Then, I woke up one morning a couple of months ago with a pain in my stomach and bloating that didn't go away for a week. So, I stopped drinking. 

The first month was fine. I didn't want to drink anyway until my stomach felt better. Then, I realized haw much money I was saving since I wasn't buying a fifth and 3 packs of cigarettes every 2 or 3 days. I didn't feel like crap every morning. I remembered my evenings. 

Now, I've been sober for 62 days. It's cool, I still don't plan on drinking. I don't want to take the chance that I could really damage my liver. I don't have insurance right now, so I can't go have tests run or check into a hospital anyway. But, it was almost too easy to quit this time. I don't really think about it too often, and when I do, it's not usually too hard to talk myself out of it. I didn't have to go to rehab or talk to a doctor. I know I am lucky and I am grateful. Maybe it was just my time to put the bottle away for good.

But, I'm feeling stuck. When most of your free time is consumed by drinking, what do you do when you don't drink anymore? It just feels like I built this whole quitting drinking is going to suck and be hard mentality, but it didn't suck and I can't drink if I wanted too now because I don't want to die from it. But I don't know what to do next. I can't help but feel like there was some crucial step or phase I left out to be sober and that it will come back to haunt me.

I just got a new sponsor and she told me to tell all the medication that I’m on to a man that I had never met before. He then spent an hour talking over me and telling me that I wasn’t mentally ill, I was just an addict. He told me I shouldn’t listen to doctors or psychiatrists, but AA. He said that people who were actually mentally ill, you could tell, because they sound ‘tapped’ and a ‘few tickets short’- you look in their eyes and ‘they’re not all there’. Apparently I didn’t sound like that over the phone (I tried to explain that after I started taking mood stabilisers and anti-psychotics, my life utterly changed). He also started imitating a ‘crazy person’ which when I finally interrupted and said I felt like a few boundaries were being crossed- I thanked him anyway and ended the call. 

I’m fresh back in recovery after a very brief relapse. This is the first time I have had a sponsor - I’m trying to do everything they’re telling me but my life changed so much once I started on mood stabilisers and anti-psychotics. I have been sober with them before and I’ve been off my meds sober before. I have been told that the reason my mental health played up was because I wasn’t properly working the program - I’m dying to have faith in AA but I’m struggling to see how it is going to cure psychotic breaks. 

AITA? Does anyone have any advice? Both my sponsor and other people in my meetings are all saying the same thing. Took me a long time to accept I had a mental illness and I’m feeling kind of invalidated, but maybe that’s my addiction talking?

TLDR: basically the title

Edit: spelling

Edit 2: thanks so much for all the responses. I was feeling very minimised and like my experiences weren’t valid, like I was just being over dramatic and not bothering to work hard enough to get sober.

Drinking slowly gives time to feel the stomach get a little upset and know it’ll be worse. Or that the heart rate is going up a bit and will feel really bad if I was flat-out hungover. Or most of all, that the thoughts are slowing down but that they will come at me much faster on the other side. I don’t want to go down that road.

There’s a lot of ways to fix feeling bad. You could take a nap. You could try a relatively safe nootropic like l-theanine. You could exercise. You could journal or call someone.

At first I was shocked of my craving for sugar. I allowed myself to eat and drink(No Alcohol) whatever I wanted. Started sleeping for a whole night not waking up at 3am with anxiety and feeling great in the morning was amazing to me. Also going out at night was exciting for me as I was unable because too drunk. That was a great feeling just to go shopping. My temper has really subsided I don't get mad at everything now and can control myself so much better. My marriage was about to end and would have been mostly my fault. How she stuck around so long is beyond me I'm very lucky with her. As for being a father I did a 180. My child (6) was always taken care and didn't go without, but I was not emotionally there for him and you could see it in how he handled his stress. My son would try and break up my wife and I fights crying. Cannot believe I put him through that. Now when he gets angry or stressed I have a conversation to help understand his emotions and to properly express them. 

The way that I chose to monitor my recovery was to watch my wife and child. Arguments continued, but I wasn't fighting yelling taking everything personal any longer. I would rationally talk to my son and wife over time that changed everything. I can see my wife is much happier she doesn't expect me to be a gigantic asshole anymore and is so relaxed. The improvement in my wife and child lives is how I chose to see my recovery

This is not an easy journey by any means my regret is huge what I did to my family and myself is sad. I will be the first in my family to break this drinking cycle

Hopefully this is behind me now the scars remain and I'm still an alcoholic, but my fight is far from over.

I know some beat themselves up and consider that ""a year wasted""...but, don't.

Instead, look at it like a whole year that WASNT wasted due to booze. Hell, even if you never make it two years and constantly bounce back once a year... that's still year after year of not putting poison into your body.

One day/weekend/maybe even week out of all the others? Imagine if you were still drinking and you ""took a week off"".. you'd be proud as hell of that. So, don't let the pride cosplay as shame when its the other way around...cause it can be easy to do.

Even for me at under 20 days.. it SHOULD say 4 months - and even though it doesn't... I know all of the crossroads I encountered in those 4 months and all the right choices i made in those moments and I know how vastly they outnumber the times i made the wrong choice.

I went to his apartment to clean up and change the bedding, etc so he has a nice calming environment for when (if) he comes home. The thing is, my 40 year old brother lives with him and the conditions of the apartment were absolutely deplorable. My dad had been basically bedridden for almost 2 months and my brother said it's been too hard to work full time, take care of my dad and clean. They kept this all hidden from me until a few days ago when my bro was at his wits end and called me asking for help. Dad went into the hospital the next day. I went over to clean and worked for 4 hrs in my dad's room and it's not even done. The entire apartment is a mess and there are countless beer cans and empty bottles strewn about. Luckily I have training in clearing hoards and working in squalor so the physical cleaning is not new to me. I have to go over again today to finish.. Or get as much more done as I can.

Finally fell asleep around 4:30am only to be woken by 7am for work.

Last night, same thing. Thought I’d be exhausted from getting barely 3hours. I was yawning on the couch right before bed thinking “I’m going to sleep like a rock tonight”. Nope! Got in bed around 10:30pm again. Wide awake till 3am. Don’t really remember ever falling asleep at all, maybe got 1-2hrs total. Makes me want to cry again.

So it’s Day 3 today of no alcohol. I’m sure my body is still detoxing which is why this is happening. Curious if anyone knows how long it’ll be before I can sleep more than 3-4hrs a night.

1104,2021-03-14 09:47:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/m4vbin/two_questions/,Two Questions...,"Good Morning,
 
Day 70 here, which is by far the longest amount of time I’ve abstained from drinking.  In fact, it’s one of only three times in my adult-life that I’ve made it 30 days.  
 
I have two questions:
 
1.     Has anyone had any success at moderating, or setting limits (and following) limits after a period of sobriety? 
 
If not,  
 
2.     How hard was it to get back on the wagon? 
 
A little background for those interested.  My 70-day hiatus started as a Dry January challenge, which began after a Saturday bowl game.  Things were beginning to get out of control, and break was long overdue. I’d completed Sober October in 2019, so challenge accepted!  That stated, there were two notable differences between the two.  

The first is that it was harder to quit this time.  This was not surprising, given the amount I drank in 2020.  Boredom, anxiety, and the ability to work remotely all made day drinking, and long nights easier than ever.  So while I anticipated it would be somewhat harder, i didn’t think it would be “that much” harder.  
 
The second difference was that towards the end of my 30-day obligation, I didn’t have the burning desire to return to the bottle.  For one thing, I was in no hurry to relive those first few days, and I hadn’t had heartburn or headaches in weeks.  Still there was more.  

I began to entertain taking a longer break, reasoning that 2021 was perfect time to try, as friends wary of travel and restaurants.  In 2019, I’d fixated on my targeted completion date.  This time, I accepted not drinking as a present reality, and the urge to drink began to subside.   
 
In one respect, this is nothing new.  I vividly recall watching the clock in grade school, which made minutes seem like an eternity. The difference is that in this case, I didn’t take off once the bell rang.  My projected completion date came and went. The Super Bowl came and went.  Before I knew it, 60 days came and went.
 
Next week, my wife and I take a vacation.  Her parents are watching our kiddo, and this will be the first time we’ve really traveled since early last year. Suddenly, cold beer is on the again.

In October of 2019, I set no boundaries whatsoever, and slipped back into old habits within a matter of weeks.

So back the original questions. I’m curious if anyone has set healthy boundaries AND actually followed them... long term.  I read a post about abstaining being easier than moderation.  It resonated. 

The topic of controlled drinking is debated heavily online, and my take is that at the very least, it has the potential to be a very slippery slope. 
 
Any feedback is appreciated.
 
Thanks!",5,0

I'm so sick and tired of hearing this, if you actually fucking knew me, and spent a little time with me outside your busy life, you could clearly see these patterns. I've been like this since you gave me my first beer, dad.

Hey dad, do you remember this incident? Do you remember  the time I was 15 and you got shit face drunk with me? Do you remember leaving me by the fire and waking up and forgetting I even existed? You drove home and left me at my aunt and uncles? 

Its not the same as forgetting your phone at someone's house, you forgot your child.

I bet you don't remember do you? I bet you also don't remember that it was 40 degrees that night and my body went into survival mode. Apparently at some point in the night I crawled into the fire pit where the ashes were warm. And woke up in the fire pit covered in ash, thankfully with no major burns.

Did I quit drinking after this incident? No, and guess what there's many more where that came from. So, dad... if you actually got to know me, and for once in your life actually gave one single shit about me in your busy selfish life. You would understand, I cannot drink.

I had to rant, I woke up depressed and crying. I feel alone as if I have no one or anything. I am trying so hard and to learn to be alone. And so angry at myself for pushing the only person that cared for me away, because I couldn't deal with my issues.

I'm going to try hard and make this a better day. I really need to find insurance. I am so tired of feeling like this. Sure I am doing a lot better but, I need professional help solving these issues that I keep kept away if I ever truly want to move on and be happy.

This is it. Hello. 👋 
I am not a recovering alcohol, nor am I an alcoholic of any sort. But I have been a regular drinker for many years. I first tried alcohol at a young age, and from 18-24 really was drinking every weekend and at every party. I drank to get drunk because that’s how alcohol was introduced to me. I didn’t depend on it during the week, but my life was to get as wasted as possible every weekend. I didn’t understand it I just joined in because that’s what my friends did.

But I do dumb things when I’m drunk. As a 29 year old I understand the law of compounding. My thoughts are still scattered and this Leeds to scattered decisions. I had one beer today and the huge effect on my mind(drunk/dizzy/scattered thoughts) actually pissed me off. That’s when I decided to stop.

Anyways, just wanted to say hello and hopefully be appreciated rather than hated on. I haven’t had it the hardest or the easiest, just a guy who wants wholesome positive encouragement because it feels really great. I’ve got this 👍🦾",15,0

I am currently in therapy, which is totally unrelated to alcohol and I am 18 years old, but the thing is alcohol has been a problem in my family.

My therapist suggests for me to stay away from it as much as possible, since addiction is also genetically transmitted, and I totally agree with him. I had my first year at university this year and I started drinking every Friday, and he pointed how that is not a good habit.

Now I haven’t had a drink since NYE 2021, so a bit more than 2 months. I dont feel bad, it wasnt hard. I also stopped smoking cigarettes and weed, so I dropped a lot of these bad habits in the same month.

I am just pretty sure that there is no need for me to stay away from alcohol entirely, I still feel I can make a relationship in which I am in control. It still is an enjoyable thing, I just want a healthy relationship with it.

What would you suggest? How can I control it? Given my family’s background should I completely stay away from it?",7,0

I’m new here and also quite new to reddit. I came across this forum as I’ve been looking into ways to cut back my drinking. I’ve always been a social drinker and never had problems there (apart from of course the dreaded hang over from time to time) but once lockdown hit a YEAR AGO me and my partner started drinking more at home and on weeknights. 

It started with having wine on the balcony every other night ish, going from maybe 1-2 glasses at a time, and then going up to about a bottle even. (So tolerance obviously going up). We then relocated from London back to my home country. We have my family here but not lots of friends and going out is obviously not a thing these days so we’re becoming very isolated and are now drinking every night, with exception of maybe 1-2 nights.

We have a little 2 year old daughter and this situation is crushing me. I don’t want her parents to be drinking every night after she goes to bed but the urge and need is definitely there, it’s not just for fun, it’s because my body now needs alcohol at a certain point. We never get very drunk, always drink with a meal and in bed by 11, but obviously under the influence, and I keep think one of these nights she might ill and need to go to the a&e and neither one of us would be able to drive because we have 2-3 drinks in us. So ashamed!! 

Do you have tips and tricks how to cut back? I want to limit it to weekends only when our daughter could be at her grandparents but I think cutting back whole 6/5 days out of 7 will be extremely hard.

I had a REALLY bad night on Tuesday when I last drank - went off the rails. Drank an entire bottle of gin on an empty stomach. Contacted and saw my abuser. It ended poorly, you know the black-out high crushed by the weight of the heavy hangover / shame-over. 
Then I was reflecting on the patterns of my drinking this last year and it’s increased to the point where I do rely on it. Night times are hard without it. I have been keeping a bottle of whiskey in my room “just in case” - which no one knows about. I just thought this was normal. It’s like if no one knows then it’s not real. 
The things we tell ourselves to rationalize it away, drowning in the bottomless sea of denial. 
So I decided to try and stop. I went through a terrible and traumatic break up last May, and since then I’ve been basically a shell of a human. And while it’s so much easier to numb out, alcohol isn’t the solution. It turns me into an impulsive, thoughtless, self destructive version of me and it’s not ME. 
Also my mother is a (now recovering) sober alcoholic and I never want to end up like her. 
I grew up around chaos 24/7. I’m addicted to it. Why does living a life without chaos seem so terrifying? 
Anyway. I’m hoping I can at least make a week. Feels good to have made it through the weekend without it, especially since my boss offered me a free drink tonight and I declined.

It wasn't a memorable occasion, I had simply reached the end of the bottle and didn't make a plan to get more. I realized the only excuse I had to drinking alone while quarantined was numbing my boredom, and sleep was a simpler and more productive coping mechanism for that anyway.

But, surely, when there was an opportunity to meet with my drinking buddies again, I would go back to it, right? I couldn't bear my perceived FOMO and the social allure. I decided to read This Naked Mind to gain some perspective. I finished it yesterday night which was great timing since I had planned to meet a couple of friends the following afternoon. In the past, we would swig and pass a bottle of whiskey while talking well into the next morning and be useless for the rest of the day/weekend. However I felt more confident than ever that I no longer saw value in alcohol, and in theory I should be able to enjoy their company without a drop.

I'm grateful to say that the hypothesis was true!

Per usual, they offered me a shot. I declined and mentioned that I actually hadn't had a drink at all this year. They were surprised, and happy for me. After they drank, one of them mentioned that he also wanted to moderate his drinking better, and even entertained the idea of stopping. To encourage him, I declared that not drinking is the most punk rock thing you can do since you're refusing to conform to society's expectation to drink. Got a chuckle out of that so hopefully that seed will grow. We continued to talk and catch up just like before. Only difference being I went home at a reasonable time without feeling like garbage.

Anyways I'm pleased that I was able to reinforce my decision to not drink and wanted to share. Your true friends will respect your decisions, and may even become inspired to make the same positive choices! Hope you all are having a nice weekend.

I'm about a week out from 12 months sober, and I can safely say that it's given me a new lease on life. For the last 15 years or so, I've suffered from severe anxiety and depression, worsened by a traumatic event around age 18. I'm in my mid-30s now. Alcohol was the way I dealt with difficult emotions, relaxed, celebrated, grieved, and most importantly, -escaped-. I was so far down the route of addiction that I could not possibly imagine a life without the crutch of alcohol.

Stopping drinking is not an easy thing to do. It's so ingrained in our society to drink. People look at you suspiciously if you turn down a drink, but don't blink if you say no to a cigarette. Luckily, I've noticed sobriety becoming a bit 'trendier' which is good for a couple of reasons: 1) finding online communities is easier, 2) it's more common to find AF drinks out and about, and is becoming a little more accepted not to drink.

There are a lot of clear benefits to stopping drinking, most of which I'm sure people talk about regularly on here, as in most sober or sober-curious communities. I'm not here to tout all the cosmetic benefits. You're obviously going to have better skin and more energy when you aren't drinking poison most days of the week. I wanted to come here to let you know that the mental health benefits have been 100% worth the effort. The discomfort of early sobriety is nothing compared to the agony, despair and shame I experienced daily - no, hourly - during my drinking days. I felt hopeless, on edge, sad, lonely, worthless and like I was a failure.

I don't feel like that anymore. Underlying mental health issues don't disappear, but for me, they've lessened dramatically. I don't feel that deep, dark depression anymore. The anxiety is much more bearable. I feel a sense of calm that I haven't felt since I was a kid. There are always going to be good and bad days - that's life - but the bad days are considerably less awful, and really intensely horrible emotions pass within a few hours rather than linger around for months. It takes some time for your brain to reset in regards to being able to 'enjoy' things again, but you do begin to enjoy the 'little things'. When people told me this, I thought they were being ridiculous. As if I could enjoy going for a walk as much as I could getting pissed. But they were right. 

I'm not a regular here - I just thought I'd drop in to offer some hope. Whether you are beginning your alcohol free journey, are 10 hours in, 10 days in, 10 months in, or more: keep going. Something wasn't quite right for you, which is why you're here. You know how drinking ends - it's always the same. Give sobriety a proper go. Whether you remain sober forever, that's your choice. But it's worth trying with the chance that it will make your life better/easier/happier/healthier/less soul-destroying. It did for me.",92,0

It’s a concept I was never a huge fan of, but I think that may be in how I was approaching the idea. I’m interested to hear your thoughts on it!

I’ve always thought of alcoholics as active drinkers and felt they ceased being alcoholics when they quit. In other words, a person doesn’t have to brand themselves as an alcoholic for life. That said, I did recognize that the potential to become an alcoholic again would always be there for someone who went through alcohol addiction.

After reading on here a bit, I think that I was missing the mark. I was connecting the word “alcoholic” with a physical action/lifestyle where perhaps others are referring to a state of mind or something within a person that is always there, whether or not they are drinking.",9,0

when i was a junior in college and studying abroad, i ended up going on a date with a guy who i had met off of tinder. he was cute and i was insecure so i drank a little bit before meeting up with him because i was so nervous and wanted to be more confident, then ended up drinking more during dinner at his prodding. once i was completely drunk he sexually assaulted me and it took me a long time to even comprehend that it had happened. even before i made the realization, i ended up knowing that something was off because after that date i started to feel incredibly uncomfortable and anxious while drinking. i had used to love drinking because it made me feel confident and outgoing and i had made so many friends when i was drunk, but then it just filled me with a lingering sense of dread and fear so i stopped for a while. i guess i started to associate alcohol with my feelings of self loathing and victim blaming for a long time, like i deserved what happened to me with the tinder date because i let myself get drunk around a stranger and that it was my fault for not being more careful.

everything seemed to be going well for me in the three years since then-therapy was extremely productive, i felt more comfortable around other guys, and i even started drinking lightly again with less anxiety thanks to two of my close friends/coworkers looking out for me whenever we would go to bars and having a good time with them. however, the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 hit me with consecutive blows to my mental health at times where therapy and nights out were hard to schedule so i ended up suffering from a terrible relapse. i started drinking alone at home whenever i needed a 'quick fix' from my stress-namely, to alleviate my body's tendency to shake whenever i'm upset and to sleep peacefully without being kept awake with my thoughts yet the feelings of dread and anxiety are beginning to come back. it started when suppressed memories of my first abusive relationship came back to me and ever since then i've been feeling a lot of different emotions and i can't seem to work them out at the gym or get them out of my system after therapy yet drinking helps despite being a double-edged sword of calmness and anxiety. i don't get drunk and binge when i do this for stress relief but i also think about it more and more and had 4 drinks this past week 'just to relax'",4,0

Can I just say that I absolutely love the people of this sub?  You all make it such a supportive and safe space to those in active addiction as well as those that are recovering.  We see you, we relate to you and we appreciate every comment.

That being said, I've been struggling hard with alcohol and pain pills for about 10 years but the last few years (especially throughout the pandemic) have shown me this way of life is unsustainable and it's slowly killing me.  It's already taken too much.  I'm using Covid as an excuse to take off of work so my coworkers won't ask questions and I've got a bed ready for me in detox on Monday with a 30 day rehab following suit.

I'm hopeful but I'm absolutely terrified.  None of my friends use and I don't have anybody to talk to about what to expect and how to navigate this.  I really need this to work for me so if anybody has any advice, I'd be forever grateful.  Any ideas on how I can set myself up for success?  Should I bring anything with me outside of necessities (I did buy a journal and This Naked Mind thanks to the recommendations of the fine people of this sub, I love it so far!)?  Even new subs to follow as I had to create a new account due to a password issue on my last one.  Also, money isn't so much of a concern if I need to buy stuff as long as it's within reason.  I honestly don't even know what to ask...

By the way, I just chose a basic rehab that is separate from detox (by about 4 hours).  The rehab is local, decent reviews but seems pretty basic.  From what I can tell, it’s just 2 houses (one for the guys, one for the girls), and a main facility for therapy/ meetings and is medically based.  I just didn’t feel like I needed anything with a lot of extras but if I’m making a mistake there, let me know.  I have private insurance and my deductible is $3K.  Also, if it helps, I am a 36 YO woman, no kids unless you count my dog and I'm married but live alone (long story).

By the end of the week, I’m not eating dinner with my family and drinking straight vodka or a mixed drink so strong when my husband puts it to his lips he can’t even try it. He doesn’t know I have 4 more just like it after he goes to the family room to watch sports or a movie. By the end of the week, I can’t wake up on time. By the end of the week, there’s a full drink next to my bed in the morning that I don’t remember pouring. By the end of the week, I’m driving my kids to practices, picking them up from practices and going to their games buzzed or actively drinking. I have driven while drinking with an open container and my child in the car. More than once. I swore I would never do this. My husband does not know that I have done this. I think I am in control. I think that it is okay because it isn’t that much or that it’s okay because I only drive on my first drink. Then I decide I will stop. I pour it all out. I tell myself I can drink in moderation and that I’m fine. No more. I think I need to throw away the glasses. The limes. My spherical ice molds.

I'm back at walking, friends of Shape Up Sunday!  It's awesome!!! 

And here's the thing.  The habit had become so strong, the reward so important, that I didn't have to force myself to do anything.  Rather, it was with a sense of relief that I was actually able to complete a (short) long walk on Wednesday.   It's just...what I do in the morning.

I've read quite a few books on how people change, and one thing that has stuck with me is how important it is to get yourself into good habits, rather than continually forcing yourself through willpower to get the hard things done.  Because willpower is finite, and we all run out of it sometime.

From Charles Duhigg, **The Power of Habit**.

 “Habits are powerful, but delicate. They can emerge outside our consciousness, or can be deliberately designed. They often occur without our permission, but can be reshaped by fiddling with their parts. They shape our lives far more than we realize—they are so strong, in fact, that they cause our brains to cling to them at the exclusion of all else, including common sense.” 

and

 “This is how willpower becomes a habit: by choosing a certain behavior ahead of time, and then following that routine when an inflection point arrives.” 

I don't know about you, but all my shape-up work in the past six months has been about trying to find the right combination of habits to make the right choices, the good choices, the healthy choices....automatic.

I'm not there yet. 

But I'm back on the walking train, slowly but surely.  I'm habitually doing my PT and core/arms exercises again, starting last weekend.   And I continue to drink my coffee with only cream and work on letting go of my evening dessert habit.  I'm trying fruit this week instead. (Hey, also? Good fruit is AMAZING.  Worth every penny!)  

Feels good.  Slow.   So - darn - slow, sometimes.  But good.  

How are you all doing?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hungover from a three-day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let's not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

The problem is, since I’ve been down here, I’ve been indulging pretty heavily. 

For one, everything is taking place in bars. The music scene on Broadway street is all bars and clubs. I’ve been taking advantage of opportunities to “sit in” with performing acts to make an impression, but unfortunately I have relied on alcohol to steady my nerves as a performer.

Establishing friendships and Social relationships are very important when trying to get your foot in the door down here. For me, I feel uncomfortable around large groups or certain people, or people in general unless I have a buzz. 

You see, I use the alcohol as a cure for my social anxiety and for anxiety in general. It works, but it’s having detrimental effects on my well being.

I see wheee this is going. I’m alone and totally unchecked, and I have nobody stopping me from becoming a full Blown dependent down here. It’s not to that level yet in my life, but it’s escalating quickly. 

If I want this to work, and if I want to pursue this new life and successfully and happily, I think it’s time to stop for awhile. I have to develop a way to overcome these insecurity/social phobia issues on my own as opposed to relying on alcohol to get through them.

Please tell me it gets better.","I've been drinking fairly heavily for ~4 years, anywhere from 4-8 drinks every single night with no breaks. 17 days ago, about 24 hours after my last drink (the usual amount of time between drinks for me), it hit me. Shaking, constant insanely high heartrate, struggling to breathe, feeling like I was dying. I managed to get through it, and physically I'm getting better. My heartrate can still be bad sometimes, but my hands aren't shaking anymore and I can do more than just lay in bed all day. I was an absolute idiot 7 days ago and drank a single beer then went to bed, and woke up the next two days unable to do anything again. Now I've been 100% sober for a week and physically I feel... Okay, I still feel weak when I go outside and walk around and I'm afraid I'll pass out a lot of the time. But the worst part is the brain fog - It feels like its slowly lifting, but to be honest I've had the absolute hell scared out of me by some people saying that it's been years and they still can't think straight. I feel like I can't talk to friends anymore and so many of the things that used to interest me don't right now - I would give anything just to feel normal again.

You know what's hilarious? I haven't been feeling any cravings. I used to desire alcohol so much that it felt like one of the only things that mattered at night, but I don't even really want to drink anymore. I just want to stop having panic attacks over the feeling that I practically fundamentally changed as a person overnight, and I can never think straight or enjoy things again. I'm talking to a doctor next Friday, and I'm praying I can summon up the courage to be honest with her, get tests ran on me and come back with normal numbers.

This is more than I meant to type out. I guess I just want some assurance from someone who's gone through something similar. I can't stand feeling like I'm gonna be this dull, blurry mess forever.",7,0

I'm glad I stepped out of my comfort zone and went. Surprisingly I wasn't even nervous to introduce myself to a group of strangers. Getting outside is good therapy too.

Warning, long rambling vent ahead. You would think after so many days it would be easy. And it is easier than the first weeks, but lately I've been struggling. I'm angry with my husband. He still drinks which usually doesn't bother me and often reminds me of some of the reasons I stopped drinking. But today he went to a whiskey festival after me stating many times how against this I am. How can they even be having a whiskey festival right now? It will be impossible to maintain distancing and masks. So he's putting us all at risk because he wants to party. And I know how he gets when he's drinking, overly friendly (he won't be social distancing I'm sure) and frankly embarrassing to be around (to sober me anyway). I'm pretty sure he'll ignore my strong suggestion not to and drive home. I'm also angry that he doesn't care about me trying to stay sober and often gives me a hard time about it. I don't talk to him about it anymore. He used to be a beer only drinker but lately he's started drinking whiskey and scotch and that is harder for me to deal with since that's what I preferred before I quit. And he buys the expensive stuff and fancy glasses which I never could. So that makes me jealous. It's so tempting to either drink it or dump it. I know I would regret drinking it. So I'm doing what I can tonight to ignore it.

I feel so lonely. I have no friends. The friends we have are really all my husbands and all the relationships revolve around drinking. I'm introverted so I don't mind being alone and often prefer it but being lonely is different. There's a ladies group hike I would like to join in the morning but I won't know anybody and it's so hard for me to step out of my comfort zone and meet new people. So tonight I will sit here and remind myself of all the reasons I'm choosing not to drink today and try to psych myself up to get up and join the hike in the morning hangover free. IWNDWYT!",12,3

thanks to everyone who posts on here. you all have been an amazing support to me and I am grateful for each and every one of you. 

I am on day 103 for reference... but it feels like day 2. Lovely evening here, thought I could handle making a fire on my patio with my little firepit.  After I made the fire I realized, good lord I have blacked out at this fire on this patio more nights than I can count.  I could hear my neighbors (drinking buddies) screaming and laughing, music blaring... any other Saturday night I would have eventually stumbled over there and joined the ""party"". Only to black out, wake up, filled with shame and regret.. absolutely sick in every way. 

As I sat by the fire tonight, I started to fucking panic. The sounds, smells, and just atmosphere was too much for me. So... I recognized my situation and an awareness of my panic took over and I laser focused on an action plan. Texted my fiance that I am struggling, asked him to put out the fire, and I came inside. 

THEN I got on doordash, ordered a nice salad with a BOMB ASS dessert - some salted cookie crunch thing. about to take a shower and knit while watching my fav british crime show on netflix (broadchurch is really good, guys) and sip my seltzer.   
i feel better.  i wanted to share with you guys.  love to everyone. thinking of you all. it helps to know we're in this together.

Or does it? I'm reading about the chemical changes in the brain from alcohol use. Almost everything that I can find is about heavy drinking. I would control mine, such that I drank only one glass of wine per hour. It would go from 5 to 7:30 p.m. nightly. I would have a bottle of wine in two days. I had been doing this for twenty years, at least. More recently, though, in the past few years, it started to increase on some days, especially on Fridays, so that I would have more like 2/3 of a bottle of wine at least once during a week, or maybe twice. So I quit drinking the other day, because I was drinking more than I had planned and because this made it harder to sleep and to be productive at work. I'm wondering if the brain actually heals if the alcohol consumption went on for so long. I am 56 and have been drinking my almost my entire adult life. It's hard to find info about it, everything thing I'm reading is for people who drank more heavily. I'm not really sure if what I did is considered moderate actually, but reading stories here, it seems to be so. On one website, it said that drinking two drinks a day for women was in the upper 20% of drinkers, that is 80% of drinkers drank less than that.

I am the absolute worst at asking for help- it took me trying to kill myself last year to even approach the idea that I can't manage this alone. I'm a daily drinker, and I have been for over three years after a rough miscarriage. I drink vodka everyday, I think I've purchased more plastic handle Crown Russe then anyone else in my dying college town. My blood pressure is astronomical and I'm a fat alcoholic.

I finished my handle this morning, did my daily pass out, and I'm out. I told myself, as I have many times, that this is my last handle and I need it to be- I'm 25 and my life is based around drinking. If anyone asked me to pull up my bank account and type in ""Wine and Spirits"", I think I'd die on the spot, just mortified. I live alone, so it's so easy to hide my problem. My SO and my very limited friends I have think I'm just naturally a tired person, but instead I'm drinking and passing out. On my days off, I wake up early, drink, sleep, wake up, drink, sleep. It's no way to live and I haven't had a ""good day"" in I don't know how long.

Everyone thinks I'm doing better since I got out of the psych ward but I'm not. I'm not taking my meds, I don't eat until I'm drunk so it hits me faster, and when I'm not drunk I'm laying in bed depressed. I'm scared to go to the doctor because (and this makes goddamn no sense) that even though I know I'm in a bad spot...I'm also comfortable and a part of my brain just wants to accept being an alcoholic.

I was convinced if I could get sober we would live happily ever after. Once the relationship fully collapsed (not entirely due to my drinking, but a lot to do with it), I was an absolute, disillusioned wreck of a person. I honestly could not fathom that the relationship had ended because it wasn’t in my mental plans. It was dumbfounding. I continued to pursue therapy options in a subconscious attempt to get better for them even though I was outwardly saying we could never work again (they wanted a child, I did not). 

It’s been nearly three years since then with multiple attempts where I still had the same mindset - save yourself for THEM. Though I still love them and wish them to be happy and well, the choice for sobriety is no longer an attempt at recovering what was lost with them. I’ve recognized I can no longer sulk and that it is now my choice whether I grow or not. I want love from another partner in the future, and it is now my choice whether or not I better myself enough to be worthy of it. And yes, I know EVERYONE is worthy of love. But I need to be the best partner I can for someone, too. I refuse to enter a relationship until I feel mentally healthy enough to do so. 

Of course, I’d like to be sober for my family and other loved ones. But they don’t know I’m going through this right now, so it’s not really like I feel guilted by them or anything. I just want to continue to live and have a long life sharing happy moments with them.",11,0

Not sure how to do the counter for number of days, but I am on day 7, after previously going six months.

This morning, I woke up feeling so rested and refreshed. I had to laugh at how ridiculous it is to willingly make yourself suffer through hangovers on a weekend. I have robbed myself of so many days off by feeling miserable.

I slept in (and didn't wake up several times during the night from dehydration, sweats, etc.), had some tea, and then got back into bed because I wanted to. On my own terms. Not because I couldn't get out of bed.

Now, I am up and sitting on my couch, just lounging on reddit while watching TV. It feels great because I am fully embracing being lazy and relaxing. Because I want to, on a day off from work. Soon, I will go for a walk and pick up a new book. And it's no big deal.

To anyone who is feeling rough, I was there a week ago. Waking up sober, without a hangover, is better. It just is. I know the trap very well. Thinking ""I don't feel good. Here is a quick solution."" Last weekend, I felt truly horrible. High anxiety, high heart rate. Forcing my body to recover again.

BUT I remembered the last few months. The hangover is not worth it. It was not worth giving up how good I felt for so long. This forum really helped. Seeing others post that they got back up and kept going--it helped keep me going. The pain is temporary. It WILL pass, and like magic, your body does feel better. I feel so much better than all of those weekends hungover.

I am not going out of my way to beat myself up over drinking again. A quote on here helped: ""Falling in water doesn't make you drown. Not getting back out does."" Well, I got back out and kept going. It didn't take away from all of the progress I made. It is serving as a reminder of why I stopped in the first place.

I'm honored and grateful to participate in the Saturday Share. This sub has been a lifeline for me throughout my journey. When I decided to get sober back in 2017, I was terrified. I didn't know a world outside of my drinking bubble. I thought that it was the only way to make friends, but in reality, these people weren't friends but just accomplices in not dealing with the root cause of why I wanted to continually blackout and abandon myself.

I didn't have a blueprint of what sobriety would look like, and my brain had never experienced that world. This sub was a lifeline into a perspective of hope. I could read other people's stories and understand that I am not alone, but the possibilities of changing my life around for the better were possible.

I lived a highly intense party life that was starting to destroy me. I didn't recognize who I was in the mirror, and I wasn't taking care of myself. Frankly, I didn't know how. Looking back, I was an emotionally immature child trapped in an adult body trying to make sense of the world.

There isn't one singular event that dictated getting sober, but it was the catalyst in changing things. How many more times did I want to get into heated arguments with my boyfriends? How many more bruises? I woke up once with blood running down my face and a chipped front tooth I lived with for almost a year. I don't deserve to hurt myself like that. I needed to turn things around and understand that just because people have hurt me doesn't mean I have to hurt myself.  

It is a massively complicated undertaking to begin to unravel the threads of trauma. My counselor told me that I was essentially an infant emotionally with zero life skills when I started therapy. I was tired of giving up on myself, I was tired of giving myself away, and I knew somewhere in the deepest depths of my depression and anxiety that things HAD to get better, and they did with a lot of work.

Relapse after relapse, I stopped hating myself for going back to my old self. With each relapse, I sat down and actively forced myself to learn from the experience instead of beating myself up over it. I had beaten myself down my entire life, and it was time to try something new. 

Each sobriety 'stint' has been different. Last year, I found a massive amount of joy that I had never felt in my entire life. It was life-changing.

Last September, after a night spent doing things I wouldn't choose to do sober and sleeping with a close friend of mine, I woke up the following day after puking up tequila on the floor, looked myself in the mirror, and said I'm fucking done with this shit. I deserve better.

I wrote a letter to myself that I planned to read on my one-year sobriety date, but I want to share it with y'all: 

\----

A letter to my future self - open on Sept 18, 2021

&#x200B;

Vycarious:

There's been a lot of day ones. That's okay. It means you wanted to make a change. It means that you're trying. And what it means is that you didn't give up on yourself, and for that, I am grateful.

This year (2020) has felt intense. It's because, for the first time, you allowed yourself to truly feel. To honestly think about what you wanted out of life. 

What you realized most recently is that drinking does not lead to a better version of you. It steals that version of you from yourself and the world.

It's not your job to make other people feel comfortable in their skin, in their environment.

It's not your job to be the most fun person at the party. 

You did that because your tank was empty, and you tried to fill it with ethanol instead of love.

I don't know a good story that ends with drinking more. 

I know one thing - I want you to read this when the days get fucking hard. Like really hard. Where you feel so fucking alone, so rejected, so down, so unworthy, and I want you to remember something:

On this day, Sept 18, 2020, I decided to choose you. I decided to choose future-you over anyone else. Over anything else. 

You aren't alone. It doesn't matter how many days you haven't had a hug. Hug yourself. 

Take a bath.

Drink some green juice.

All those 'silly' things that you thought didn't matter - they do. They matter because YOU matter.

You owe the world the best version of yourself. To live up to your potential.

You clawed back from so many day ones. 

You clawed back. You didn't give up.

Each reset taught you something. 

A big something.

But those lessons have been learned. 

The past has been analyzed and handled. 

Your value does not revolve around the number of friends you have or what you do on the weekends. 

It revolves around the things that people can't see. 

The things that you choose to do each day for yourself when the doors are closed.

Like chipping away at a rock, these little things don't seem to make a difference.

The affirmations don't seem to make a difference right away.

The money you save doesn't compound every day. It's insignificant at first.

That one-mile jog you did yesterday - you didn't see an immediate change in your body. You're not where you want to be.

That's okay. 

Because each and every fucking day for the next year, I choose you. 

Even if I only give it one year, I choose you. 

I know it's one day at a time. I know. 

So today, I choose you.

Repeat that to me: today, I choose you.

If it fucking hurts, cry.

If you're fucking mad, stand up for yourself.

If you don't want to do something - don't.

But one thing is for sure.

Tomorrow is a new day.

Tomorrow is another day closer to your goals and dreams, and desires.

Drinking will subtract a day.

And drinking a month from now will subtract 30 days. And you will still be a year out.

Or, you would be 11 months closer.

Choose you, Vy.

Choose you above everyone and everything else.

Life gets so much better. So much prettier.

You don't have to live in the dark.

You don't have to live in pain.

You don't have to hate yourself. You can choose to love yourself.

You're a good person. A talented writer. The world needs you.

And most of all, I need you.

I love you.

&#x200B;

\-Vy.

This is the longest I have ever been sober. Almost six months. I used to read posts on here about six months or a year, and they wouldn't provide much detail. I think that's because when it becomes the new normal when you start to remove yourself from that world, there isn't much to say. I'm not sure. 

I'm not the happiest I've ever been, but I'm not in the darkness either. I don't fluctuate daily from two extremes: the dopamine rush of drinking and the comedown from withdrawal. I have control of my life. I make decisions based on logic and not on blackouts. I never wake up in a cold sweat or a panic. I never have to wonder what I said or what I did and who I need to apologize to. 

The work I've done on myself emotionally is life-changing. The tools I have now don't lead me towards drinking because I have tools now. I had no idea how to have a relationship, take care of myself, deal with how I felt, or be an adult. All that has changed. 

I used to be incredibly self-conscious, riddled with anxiety daily, unable to function or get out of bed most days, or adequately care for myself, which I expected other people to do for me since I was essentially a child. I was the queen of self-victimization, and I made sure of it. 

What has changed?

I no longer suffer from procrastination and holding myself back. I have self-worth and self-esteem. I love saying no. I have boundaries. I fought through resistance to not doing things for my highest good. I have hobbies outside of drinking (yoga, writing, reading), I meditate 3-4 times a week, and I don't live in pain mentally or physically. My house is always clean. I know where everything is. I live in consistency instead of chaos. 

&#x200B;

And most importantly of all, I choose me.

Earlier my husband had an open beer in the kitchen... I literally picked it up... sat it back down and thought, “I could just have a sip.” I didn’t.... but I got a little pouty and annoyed over the fact that I couldn’t drink beer and watch basketball with my husband. Then as my son was sitting on the couch he almost rolled off, but I saw him out of the side of my eye and caught him with my foot. He’s fine. Then I realized... if I would have had some of that beer, I wouldn’t have stopped... I could never stop. I would have been buzzed by the time he almost fell, and I wouldn’t have caught him.

I've been to the hospital more than once because of my drinking, but I always end up picking up again. Sober life seems so aggressively empty and boring, and the things I'm told to replace drinking with like meetings and friendships are frankly just annoying. Any time I go to any type of meeting(And believe me, I've attended a lot of them), and hear someone talk about how bad drinking is, I feel like I'm back at one of those crappy office team building exercise. And talking to other people hasn't changed much or become any more fulfilling since high school. Even work and my hobbies are just opportunities to fail or else do passably.  I don't feel like a real person unless I'm drinking, or at least doing some type of drug.  
Even my longest stretches of sobriety end with me drunk again, and often I emerge from these sprees not even a little bit remorseful as long as I wasn't caught.   
I don't want to be this person, but I don't know how to be anyone else, and it's taxing and exhausting constantly having to pretend to be happy and grateful in sobriety hoping that one day I'll forget I'm pretending. I just want to alter my consciousness somehow so I can feel like I belong in this world. I wonder if my whole purpose on this earth is to die of cirrhosis, or to overdose on a playground, just so that someone I met on the chatforum or in a meeting can tell my story and scare some newcomer with a soul still inside them into getting and staying clean.   
There definitely once existed a perfect state where I was fucked up enough to behave and feel like a normal human being without being so sloshed I couldn't function, but with my tolerance like it is I don't think it exists anymore. I have just been craving hard all day, and wanted to post here before I relapse for the second time this month, just to see if it would do any good. If you are reading this, don't be like me. You might still have a shot at enjoying life. Even if you don't die due to this disease, this is the life that awaits you-- boring, lonely, and built on pretty lies.",4,0

I look back and realize how much of our children’s lives were schedule around activities we could drink at. How many venues we dragged them to so we could drink while they waited around. How many tasting flights they waited around for us to finish, all in the name of “adult enjoyment”. How many nights we stayed at friends’ houses well past their bedtimes making asses out of ourselves and saying things / making jokes we shouldn’t have made. I could get lost in the regrets. 

A few days ago I came home and told my SO I was offered a drink by friends while I was out - one of my kids looked up nervously and said, “what did you say?!?” The relief at finding out I could abstain, that they could trust when I said I was done drinking, was both heartbreaking and heartwarming. I never want to drag them back to my problematic relationship with booze again. 

The progress in just a short time for our relationships has been amazing. I didn’t realize how much faith they were starting to lose in me. How undependable I had become. How much they were seeing / hearing that I didn’t think they noticed. I was letting the alcohol blind me in ways I swore I never would.

This time week ago tomorrow, I was starting a four and a half hour memorial over zoom for my childhood best friend, a hard drinker and wonderful kind soul, with hundreds of people in attendance. His fortieth birthday would have been this past Tuesday. He’s my first friend to die and I spent his memorial sober, so I could hear the stories of how he touched the lives of others. I didn’t drink after the memorial either, though my brother who was also a friend of his invited me out for drinks afterward. I went to bed sober that night, hoping this day one would be THE day one. Not to use my friend as a scared straight story, but that I could honor his memory living soberly the way he might if his accident had been a rock bottom instead of the big one. 

In the middle of the night that night there was a knock at the door followed by “Police!” I jumped out of bed and opened the door to two officers asking if my brother was here. I said no. They asked if I knew where he was, I said no. They said they found his car wrecked on the side of the road and the car was registered to my house (he’s moved a lot). Apparently he had walked away from the accident, so that was a relief, but no one knew where he was and his phone went straight to voicemail. They said goodnight and I went out driving from where he wrecked it in the directions he might have walked. Couldn’t find him. At 10am Monday I got a call from his girlfriend saying he had borrowed someone’s phone to call her and she was picking him up, putting him in the shower and putting him to bed, where he slept for nearly 36 hours straight. He had escaped the accident with a sore wrist and broken glasses, no harm to anyone else, and a wrecked 20 year old Camry. 

I didn’t mean to make this post about others, that all just came out when I started writing. Today I’m a week sober. I’m finally, slowly waking up from the dream that alcohol makes me happy, to the ugly reality that it’s literally killing people and will kill me if I don’t change course. Alcohol is an addictive poison that will take your life slowly, like it did my friend, or quickly, like it very nearly did my brother. I don’t play around with heroin,  despite how wonderful the high sounds, because I know heroin is a one way street. Alcohol is exactly the same, it’s just more socially acceptable.

I would be pissed, it would ruin my whole night if we couldn’t get alcohol. Then I started dating a 27m at 18 and that’s when I really became an alcoholic. My ex drank everyday and would let me too. I loved the routine of getting off work, coming home to him and just relaxing with drinks. Who cares if I had college and work. I smartly dumped him but now I was friends with his friends who would buy for me. College ended after 3 semesters due to lack of funds and place to stay. I’ve moved out of my parents 3 times but I always struggled and have to come back.  
However working comes easy to me. I have only called in hungover twice. I make manager at every job, I go above and beyond, always answer phone, always there   I love making money, I would show up in awful hungover states to work.But I know deep down the alcohol and pot are really affecting my career.

I just wanted to make a post encouraging those who are not only in their “1st 30 days” of sobriety but those in their “last 30”.  

I have now somehow found the strength to go longer than ever into sobriety but it is a journey I started over 3 years ago.  And I only have 3 months!!

Apparently I am an amazingly stubborn human and my will to “do things my way” and “just stop drinking long enough to dry out” were just lies that brought me back to misery, pain and sadness.

Currently I go to a local AA meeting 4x a week.  And check in daily with a sponsor, but I’m going to add this subreddit to the list to help keep me accountable.   

So many times I would achieve a week or 2 or 30 days of sobriety and I was CONVINCED this was the time I never drank again but I failed over and over and over again.  Going back to the drink and the hangovers and the sickness.

Thankfully I somehow received the strength to keep coming back.  Keep resetting my sobriety counter!  Keep showing up at AA meetings and admitting I broke yet again.

BUT THIS WAS NOT FAILURE. These relapses were temporary roadblocks and checkpoints to where I am today.  No alcoholic is guaranteed another year or month or week of sobriety.  All we have is the day set before us.   IWNDWYT is our mantra because of this fact.   

So if your someone thinks they are growing weary of resetting your sobriety date,  or have told friends and family countless times that “now I’m finally sober “. HANG IN THERE DAMMIT”.  Maybe it’s not yet time.  If you’re half as stubborn as me then you will inevitably have to learn some things the hard way.  Please don’t give up hope it is a longer tunnel for some of us as we journey towards the light.   I didn’t find it for years for some it takes days.  We are all different, but if this is what you want and need and desire??!!  Keep getting back up, clean off the dirt and start again.   If you’ve failed 107 times and you give up on 108.  What if your magic number was 109???  And you were almost there?

I've been lurking here for a while and have really enjoyed reading many of your posts and comments.

I don't think I can do it, but I'm really going to try to stop drinking for the next 2 weeks. If I can do that, I'll then try to extend it longer.

I've had a problem for the last 10 years, and an even bigger problem for the last 3-5. I'd say 15-20 shots of whiskey/scotch from 6 until around 10 or 11 each night is typical. When I go out I almost never remember what happened the night before when I wake up---and usually have no idea how I got home. Sometimes I don't get home but instead wake up in a jail cell, outside, or at a stranger's place. I have a good job as a tenured philosophy professor, but I haven't completed any research or journal articles in the last 3 years since getting tenure. I think I am lucky I was not a raging alcoholic before securing my job.

It will come as no surprise to anyone here, but I have been severely depressed since a breakup 3 years ago. And yes, drinking was a major part of the reason why my beautiful, wonderful gf broke up with me after 6 years. She meant everything to me, but I became a mess. I am now starting therapy this month.

There are more ""juicy"" details, but I'll leave it at that. I just want to stop for a couple weeks and then take it from there. If I can do it I will post again 2 weeks from now with the results and with some info on whether my mood and health changes. Wish me luck!  :)",10,0

I will preface this post by saying that I am by no means a sobriety expert since I'm only a few weeks in, but I thought I'd share my experience in any case it helps anyone! :) 

Like many of you, I tried quitting about 438903890 times with no success. I tried cutting back, only drinking weekends, switching from wine to another drink I didn't like as much, 30 day challenges that I never stuck to, reading many books about quitting alcohol, therapy, exercise, daily life. medication, journaling, meditation and sober apps. 

What I've learned is that I would start all of these things and then only last a day or two, and I didn't change anything else about my daily life. I was a rather passive participant in all of my efforts to quit. Here's what I did differently this time.

1) I told people!! Other than my husband, who isn't a drinker, no one in my life knew about my drinking. I FINALLY told my mom and sisters and also my closest friend. I simply explained that I was having difficulty moderating and had decided to quit completely. The support was overwhelming and so empowering. 

2) I read a few chapters of one of my sobriety books everyday BEFORE I start to get cravings. Even if I'm not feeling any cravings at all and feeling like I don't need a refresher on sobriety, I read it anyway. Always. I also make notes about key points that I can go back to if I'm feeling a craving.

3) I put my sobriety first. I've (at least temporarily) cut out some of the things I'd busy myself with during the day/evening and I'm dedicating 1-3 hours per day on maintaining sobriety. This involves engaging with this forum, participating in another sober group I joined, journaling, doing my own research on addition, and starting my own Instagram page dedicated to my sobriety to help with accountability and a sense of community. 

I hope this helps! Have a wonderful sober day!",10,0

Yesterday evening I played some call of duty with a friend and had some whiskys with Coke. I ended up drinking the whole damn bottle, and I didn’t even feel too drunk... I went to bed where my girlfriend was already sleeping, and slept until this morning... so I thought... when me and my girlfriend had breakfast she jokingly asked if I remember last night. I asked what she means because I only remembered going to bed and sleeping... she laughed and said she expected me to not remember... she told me that when I was in bed and cuddled up to her, I started playing with her boobs and butt, and to kiss her and was in the mood for sex... she woke up and said I should sleep it’s 3 am. But I began touching her all the time again. Eventually I just took my dick out and kinda just placed it between her buttcheeks. She got up and pushed me over to my bedside and told me to fucking sleep. 
She thinks the whole thing is funny and just laughed about it, but I am fucking mortified!! I am so deeply ashamed that I didn’t stop when she said no in the first time and even took my dick out and put I on her. My face was bright red when she told me what happened, but she said it’s no biggie everything is ok and I shouldn’t worry about it, it just shows that I really wanted her... but I can’t stop thinking about it and feel so immensely bad. 
I don’t remember any of it and that scares me so much. 
In December I had a rather hard bicycle accident because I drove drunk. The next day‘s evening I made myself some drinks and kinda just shrugged it off. When I woke up hungover in the morning, I asked myself what the fuck im doing with my life, one day I Fall of my bike injuring my hands arms face and knees, the next day I drink again. After that I had a 2 month drink free episode. This was my first wake up call. I don’t even know how it started that I stated drinking again. But I seriously have to put away alcohol. My life is so much better without the constant hangovers. My mind is clearer, my daily routines are more structured and I just feel better all in all. And I can’t moderate, if I feel the first bit of being drunk, I just want to down drink after drink. I just wish I will be alcohol free all my life.

No more alcohol, no more coffee, no more Advil. I had been drinking too much anyway; and during the pandemic I was drinking hard liquor almost every night to help cope with my anxiety and stress. 

My partner has greatly reduced his drinking but still will enjoy a beer now and then. I don't mind as he loves IPAs and I can't stand them, so no temptation on my part. I was jealous though: a Friday night of drunken silliness is something we have done together for so many years. But not last night. 

And wow, was he annoying. He was drunk, smelled of beer, and was handsy. I told him he reeked of alcohol, so he kept trying to shove his fingers up my nose to ""block the smell"". He didn't hurt me and after I stated my dislike of his actions loudly and clearly he backed off.

But that used to be me. I thought I was funny: but in reality it was an alcoholic fog that made me think my partner, my friends and my family thought I was hilarious too. When instead I must have been stupid and annoying. 

It was a shock to make that realization last night. I'm proud of myself for quitting drinking, and I don't ever intend to go back to being that person. I feel clear-headed, I've taken up meditation and yoga, and have lost some weight. Quitting drinking has been a boon.

Do they ever stop?  I'm 7 weeks into sobriety (yay!!! also 3 months free of weed, and almost 6 months clear of a toxic relationship), and the cravings and ""knee jerk"" thoughts of drinking while I'm awake are really subsiding.  Had a twinge yesterday when I drove through a town on a sunny Friday afternoon, that I knew had a store with good craft beer.  But then you contrast that ""good taste"" in your mouth with what happens when you play it forward and you feel sick the next day, you have to tell a friend (and this sub) you've been sharing accountability stories with, and you have to restart all over again and it for me it subsided.  

&#x200B;

However, I am really getting sick of that feeling of ""oh shit, I had a drink and have to 'start over' "" when I dream about having one.  Often just a sip, a toast, a special event, a long lost friend...  Why do our brains do that?  Is it just years of habit?  Is it something we are processing at night, retraining our brains to say no when subconscious?  Is there a victory in it finally stopping?  Funny story - we do a weekly zoom on Thursday nights.  Often the scene of many drunken arguments, and a few good times too.   I have kept going because it is a really safe way to train myself around drinkers, see friends before they get too hammered, but not be ""in"" a physical environment with booze.  Anyway, two things, a friend of mine said HE had a dream that I had a drink after quitting - my drunk dreams are getting into other people?!! hah!  And another friend goes, ""wait, YOU quit drinking?""  it had been 6 weeks of calls and he didn't even realize, notice or care - probably because he was too caught up in his own drinking to care.  So, good lesson in people not really all that concerned if you are drinking or not.   Also, what felt like a weekly bacchanalia wasn't as booze-y as I thought.  In the sixish weeks I've been there, we've mostly wrapped up by ten pm.  For weeks through the summer it was often 1, 2 in the am.  So I think I my have been the gas on the fire at times...

I don't drink everyday but I can't remember the week clearly enough to ever count just how many I went without. Usually only 2-3 at best anyway. 

I work at a gas station, and I actually don't think about drinking most of the work day. I never drank at work either. This morning leaving my shift I realized I'm most vulnerable then. I've probably made a habit out of it because as soon as my replacement comes in I started thinking about alcohol today. I decided to make this post after catching myself having that craving. I kind of figured I had a problem for a while but that really made the case for myself. 

I hope I can stop drinking for good. I recently have been trying to get my life together. I've been going to the dentist and doctor to get myself fixed up. Today marks my 6th month studying Japanese everyday, even if I was drunk sometimes I still did it. I always tried to study before drinking but sometimes I didn't stop myself. Hopefully I'll be able to study better after a couple more weeks, stay focused and remember better. 

I want to start working out, I want to try and go for a walk today. I really hate running and always have. I'm going to have to do something though. I'm overweight but definitely in that skinny-fat area where if I have enough clothes on I can kind appear less-so. I also eat a lot when I'm drunk. 

I started 3 days ago just wanting to take a short break. I know I need to just stay away from drinking for good. I don't drink when I'm not supposed to but once I start or think I have several hours free my mind definitely wanders towards that train of thought. 

It's hard to get started on even recreational activities sometimes. I made studying into a habit, but I'll open up a video game now and kind of not even want to do it. I never feel like I've got the energy to twiddle my fingers. When I drink that's not a problem.

I felt a little funny going in, because I remembered these to be highly drunken affairs. I made a big thermos of tea in a pint thermos, thinking that people might assume it was beer and I could avoid questions I am not quite ready for.

Very quickly it was obvious that these bonfires had never really been drunken affairs for everyone else. Most people sipped one drink, and a bunch of other people had nothing. (And of course a few people got blasted- I recognize that those were the folks who had occupied most of my attention.)

Anyways, here is what was surprising. I woke up with regrets! 

I remember talking over a female friend, and her leaving shortly after. I remember a mean joke I made about a friend who is trying to do something ambitious- I undermined her goal even though I actually think it's courageous and awesome. 

So, I suppose for me waking up sober is not waking up free of regrets... Which is disappointing in some ways. However, I suppose the difference is that these regrets feel actionable. I can apologize to my friends, without the shame and weight of my relationship to alcohol. That DOES feel new. And better.

Thanks for reading- I know this is mundane.  I just thought I would share in case someone else was dealing with similar feelings early in their sobriety.

So grateful for all of you, and this thing. Have a great day.",561,0

Still, I managed to keep running 20 miles a week or so even when drinking a bottle and a half to 2 bottles a night(not fun).

I was a sad lonely kid with no friends or parents, I was sad at a young age.

It’s almost like training a little dog, if you only give him treats when they behave good, then they will be good dogs, but if you let them run wild and then give them a lot of treats, then they will become addicted to it without doing anything positive in return. So I’m now retraining my puppy brain, I feel like I let it run wild and that’s why I’m an addict. I now know to be careful out there because in this World there are a lot of people making money of those puppies running wild, wether it be alcohol, fast food, heavier drugs etc. I need to put on a leash on my subconscious all the time, no by that I mean to watch what I eat, what I watch, avoid negative social media, avoid violent movies or dumb Hollywood movies, avoid watching porn, etc, because all of those things are targeting my subconscious without me being aware of it.

Like the small streams in the field outside. Changing shape and size from moment to moment. A lot of odd shaped moments have passed since I felt much more than gravity. I’m not sure if it’s possible to feel too much. I’m certain it’s possible to drink too much. Did that for a long stretched out moment. One too many somersaults down a steep gravel bank. I wonder if my filament burnt. I used to feel so much so strongly. I wanted to stop, or do something about it. I could never really figure out what to do, at least nothing I did really soothed the burn. I’d try to resist getting drunk, high, escaping into a game where I could lose touch with those thoughts that were making me feel so strongly. Just remembering those times of feeling so strongly I can feel the tingle in my limbs. A fire swirling through my veins, a belt cinching around a swelling heart. Almost three and a half months without a drink. I can’t recall shedding a tear since then. Until tonight. Here they come again. I feel like I don’t know myself. Kind of like I never really tried to. I could say I’m trying to see the point, or find motivation. But I don’t know how hard I’m trying. I feel like I have such a strange sort of will. I believe I’m capable of almost anything. But I feel alone, I don’t know what I want. I want the rights of a free animal. The fear I see creatures exhibit toward humans is usually quite unique.

I like wine and hard kombucha. And I like several glasses of them, usually 4. Sometimes a full bottle of wine (this has been happening more frequently in quarantine over the past year).

But something I’ve always struggled with is terrible hangovers from an amount that doesn’t seem that terrible. It’s been a bummer because my tolerance level is decent- I know my drinking “limit” and don’t brownout or blackout (college and early 20s was a different story). but my hangover tolerance is lowwww. More than 3 drinks and I’ll feel it the next day- a big drop in mood and energy levels- I’ll be depressed, negative, tired, and brain foggy. I’m a complete slug and incapable of doing anything productive let alone socializing or texting back. My brain will be tired but I can’t sleep. It’s a terrible feeling that lasts all day into the night. And it’s from making a poor (pour) decision for just a few hours of fun and relaxing.

I’ve tried so hard for years to fight the hangovers, trying every trick and supplement in the book. But it’s been futile and I’ve been reluctantly accepting that my body just can’t handle alcohol (plus I’ve taken a low dose of an SSRI, Effexor, for years that probably factors in). 

It’s been a really hard pill to swallow but I am accepting it more and more considering how many days I’ve lost the past year alone from being hungover from “just” 4-6 glasses of wine.

I’ve been going through the gauntlet of emotional craziness that comes with your brain putting itself back together after literally poisoning the poor thing, and apparently this week it’s existential crisis week. 

So far, what’s kept me from drinking is not wanting to go through withdrawal again, not wanting to be hurting people all the time again, and knowing that if I go back there again, I’m probably not coming back to sobriety alive. This feels like my last shot. 

Which is all well and good. Whatever keeps you away from it, right? But now that all my systems are switching back on, and I can finally start to function like a normal human again, I’m starting to realise I have no idea what I want. My entire life I’ve spent running desperately towards whatever choices give me the best chance of not being in more pain than I already am, clawing and scratching at any half decent opportunities that come up because god, anything would be better than this. And now that I’m sober, and that part of my brain is finally starting to be more rational, I’m realising that no matter where I run and no matter how hard I fight, I’m never happy where I end up. 

Even now, when my brain is all sobered up and I’m working through all my trauma, I don’t know if I can be happy. And I don’t mean the endless incredible happiness with no pain ever that people unrealistically hope for, I just mean, any comfort at all. Going to work every day and not having a mental breakdown three months later because I can’t handle it. Interacting with anyone without wishing I was somewhere else because I can’t stop questioning their every word and action. Just... going about my day to day life without wanting to change it all and run somewhere new. 

It’s always been like that, even before I started drinking. And because I don’t know whether anything is ever going to be enough for me, I’ve started questioning everything I’m working for. Do I want my career? Am I unhappy doing my job because it’s not right for me, or is nothing going to be right for me and I should just stick with it? Do I really love my partner or is he just the only one who stuck around? Does everyone have flaws like his that I just have to deal with, or is there actually a problem? 

Sobriety is hard. Life is harder, and it will never stop reminding me of that. Sober or not, it’s always been kicking me around. So do I really have to be sober if I’m never going to be happy with what I have anyway? It’ll kill me eventually sure, but is that so bad? If life is going to be hell no matter what I do, I might as well be out of it enough that it can pass me by quickly. 

I’m sticking with sobriety for now because I don’t know, I’ve made it this far. Maybe this is just another phase of recovery and I’ll be more certain about things down the line. Maybe it won’t always be painful just to wake up in the morning and drag myself through the day.

Slipped into a coma, never came back. This is after they cut off his foot due to the alcoholic diabetes. He never got sober, much less any recovery.

I’ve seen a lot of people on here bashing AA for coming on too strong, or it’s cult like behavior. I get it, I was in my 20s the first time I had to go and it wasn’t for me. If it’s not for you that’s fine. But I beg of you, please don’t slam the door on it or taint the pool for others that may need it. 
Without a doubt, AA saved my life. Plan B of it didn’t was a bullet. That was over 18 years ago. If I told you how good my life is now it would sound like I was bragging.

If we AA’s come on too strong for some of you or act like a cult, here’s why: This thing worked for us when nothing else did. Remember, nearly all of us were maniacs, and some of us still are. I, myself am normally one of the quieter ones. It takes all kinds. There’s an ass for every seat in AA, lol.
Here’s what we see with regularity.
If every person that came to my home group and said they loved it and that they’d be back actually did, we would need to meet in a stadium. But nope, something comes up. They decide maybe they overreacted, or these AA’s are Weirdos, or it’s a cult… and then they disappear. 

I had another good friend die two years back. He boiled himself alive in his car in the California desert. Passed out drunk for who knows how long. His internal temperature was 105° when they found them. He never came out of it. He had tried AA once and found a reason why it wasn’t for him.
If AA doesn’t seem right for you, that’s fine. We are not the only game in town. But please don’t slam the door on it. I genuinely want to give away what I have so freely been given. And it sucks that I can’t make people take it. Because I don’t want any more of my friends to die.

Im at day 132 so I’m excited to share something that helped me! 

Guilt is normal and is typically easily manageable, shame is one of the most toxic and unproductive emotions one can experience. 

For example, After a night of drinking and having 1 too many. 

A normal person would feel:
Guilt: “ah, that was a embarrassing, I can’t believe I danced on the table, I better text them and see how they’re doing”

Me, an alcoholic would feel: 
Shame: “I’m disgusting, horrible. I never want to face my friends again and Im terrified and so stupid for not remembering what happened.”

This was the feeling that kept me coming back for more punishment. 

I would wake up in the morning from a long night and be frozen in my shame about the night before. I hid my shame from my roommates, family and friends- alone in a dark room with sweaty sheets, dehydrated and full of hate for myself. 

Until I mustered up the strength to buy another few bottles of wine and start the process all over again

I thought about calling in sick and getting a 12 pack, or going home from work and hitting the liquor store on the way home. Drinking is how I learned to cope with stress from my parents and as an adult it’s how I’ve always responded to stress.  

I made it through my work day, called 7 therapists and left messages to try to start seeing someone to help me deal with my unresolved issues.  Bought a 12 pack of lacroix and talked through our problems with my fiancée.  Today was hard, but my desire to stay sober and better my life was stronger than my desire to drink.  Now we’re sitting on the couch together with the cat. I’m proud of me. IWNDWYT.",34,0

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Saturday/Sunday!

It’s my last day hosting the DCI! Thanks so much for all of your participation this week. It’s been such a pleasure to read all your responses and spend time together in contemplation. And in just plain not drinkin’, too! 

Yesterday we talked about things we’d like to learn or nurture, and many of you talked about a desire or effort to better nurture yourselves. I love that! Self-care is an important practice, but it’s also one that I think has been pretty warped in an effort to sell people more bath products, expensive juices, and so on. 

That’s not to say that baths and juices don’t have a place in self-nurturing—just that the overall effect is that “self care” ends up yet another thing tacked onto the end of our already overwhelming to-do lists instead of a genuinely mindful, helpful, and healing practice. 

For me, a practical way around this has been to keep in mind the difference between self-care and self-soothing. I first came across the concept in an illustrated blog post by Deanna Zandt about the unspoken complexity of self-care. It was a real lightbulb moment!

The idea is that self-soothing is all the stuff that feels comforting in the short-term and self-care is the stuff that promotes a sense of groundedness and well-being. Both are important! Especially during hard times, self-soothing has it’s place. 

It’s always been easier for me than self-care, but that was especially true while I was drinking. Maybe it was because all times felt like hard times back then, but I was wayyyyy off balance choosing to get wine drunk in the bath (self-soothing) over and over instead of maybe cleaning up my house for a change (self-care).

What’s one form of self-soothing and one form of self-care that you either have been benefitting from a lot lately or that you’d like to try? 

For me, I’ve been loving having good sleep hygiene as a form of self-care and binge watching Critical Role as a form of self soothing.

As I’m closing this out, I’m feeling a lil’ pang in my heart! My time is done!

Thanks again for havin’ me at the helm this week! If you’d like to give hosting the DCI a shot, reach out to u/SaintHomer to express your interest and get on the schedule.",98,0

Something clicked this particular morning though. For the first time in my life, I was totally at peace with the fact that I needed to quit drinking forever and that it was going to start right then. 

In my 15 years of drinking, I'd probably made two dozen half-assed attempts to quit drinking. Some lasting a few days, some lasting a few weeks. I'd always find my way back to it though and the progression from a binge drinking partier into a full blown alcoholic continued. 

For years I knew I had a problem but I was able to brush it off. I had a good job and it wasn't really negatively impacting my relationships, so I just kept chugging along. In hindsight, there were plenty of problems my drinking had already created but I was either too drunk or too ignorant to notice. 

Along came Covid and the progression of my alcoholism hit warp speed. 

Working from home was great for the first couple months and I was actually quite productive. Sure I'd still find a way to drink my 6-12 beers at night, but they were mostly light beers and the 6 second commute from the bedroom to the home office meant no hungover commute which was nice. 

Fast forward a few months and the ""Hey it's 2pm and I'm done with my meetings, why not go downstairs and grab a beer?"" quickly turned into waking up and immediately starting drinking. 

The best part about this? No one can smell booze on your breath in zoom calls. It was kind of a fun little game that I'd created. Everyday was a party and I made the rules. 

Not only did I become an expert at hiding it from my coworkers, I also did a good job of hiding it from my wife. She works in healthcare so most days when I'd be working from home, she'd be gone working 12 hour shifts. I was completely left to my own devices. 

I'd fill up bags of empty beer cans and bottles and stealthily take them out before she got home. How'd she not smell it on me when she got home? I'd crack a beer before she got home and tell her it was my first one after a long day. Little did she know I'd done my best to drink a case of beer before she got home. 

I'd never lie to my wife sober. When drinking though, it was second nature. Being able to effortlessly lie to the love of my life that easily, coupled with the gut-wrenching reality that I was drinking myself into an early grave, is ultimately what caused the switch to flip in my head. On December 1st, I started a new chapter in my life and I'm not looking back.

This subreddit has been monumental in helping me get these first 100 days under my belt. I'm still taking it one day at a time and the other problems in my life haven't miraculously disappeared by any means, but it's better tackling them sober. 

I'm still early in my journey but I figured I'd share my story here in case it resonates with anyone else. It's nice coming here and seeing that there are other people like me with similar stories. Thank you for this great resource. It may very well have saved my life.

I HATED IT ! 

Which was the best thing that could’ve happened. 

Just had one (unheard of for me) and felt totally sick, tired, and headachey the entire rest of the day. 

What a great reminder as I’m starting over again knowing that it’s not only that I don’t want to drink because I don’t want to reset my days/disappoint myself but more importantly that I don’t even like it anymore and it’s not worth it at all. 

I know this might not be super relatable but just wanted to celebrate feeling a shift in perspective that will hopefully help me long term.  If anyone has tips for navigating this trigger of social situations/anxiety other than just practice please let me know!

Quite a few months back, I made it to 25 days sober, then I caved. I'm an emotional drinker and as someone with major depressive disorder, it goes hand in hand for me. I was a very high functioning alcoholic during 2018-2019. Then I was a not so functional one in 2020. 

As for many people last year, life was rough. It came with a lot of want to get sober off and on, and then a lot of excuses for why ""I should drink today."" 

Over the last 2 months, I've noticed a change in my mental health. I've had minor spells of depression, but no thoughts of wanting to unalive myself - and this is the longest I've been in YEARS without one of those thoughts. And while I have other parts of my life that I need to work on for the betterment of myself, I feel like the continued growth in my mental health will make those other goals come easily over time. 

This is honestly the longest I've been sober since 2015. Some days continue to be a true struggle of trying to convince myself why one day of drinking after such a long break won't kill me - but I can't let those kinds of thoughts win. 

I want to become the best version of myself and it's something I will never achieve if I allow myself to go back to the liquid of despair.

I can't wait to come back here after some time to update that I've continued my sobriety. I can't wait to be able to look back on my posts from a year to come and beyond and see how far I've come from this moment.

I have been pretty open about it (at least I think so).  I have had anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months but I drink at times in between these sober periods. My boyfriend is, in my opinion, pretty overbearing and paternalistic about the whole thing.  Basically we just fight about drinking most of the time at this point.

Well, my sister texted me this evening that she was coming over tomorrow but didn’t really say why.  Odd, but okay.  A bit later my  boyfriend came to tell me that he decided to reach out to my family and talk to them about my drinking (my sister told him he should let me know instead of keeping it from me).  The telling everyone also included having my father come over when I wasn’t aware of it and showing him my empty bottles that my boyfriend found by looking through my things (note, he was always aware I have bottles in the house, I didn’t hide this from him).  I’m very upset by all this.  I feel like he is overstepping boundaries and basically trying to take away my agency.  As I said, I have told everyone about my problems and I have been trying to work on them.  

I guess no advice asked for, just wanted to vent.

Edit:  I think a lot of this stems from how terrible my father was and just that someone would reach out to him.  I talked to my sister about treatment options and it wasn’t bad.  My boyfriend reaching out to my father is basically a suicide mission.  He knew this. He bypassed it.",16,0

Why can’t I have a glass of wine with dinner and nothing more? Why can’t I watch the hockey game and have two beers?

1306,2021-03-12 21:18:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/m3wz74/day_257/,Day 257.,"Drinking has been a huge part of my life for over 10 years. Alot of good happened in those 10 years, I was most definitely a highly functioning alcoholic. My drink of choice was cheap light beer and it got to a 30 pack every other day. I tried quitting many, many times. Everytime I would go a few days and then jump right back in. 

One day I woke up and just said ""No more"". I wasn't hungover and nothing tragic or life changing happened the night before. I was just done.

I'm 33. A husband, a father and a son. It was due time to stop. I owed it to everyone around me, but especially myself. 

I guess this is just a message of hope for someone out there that yeah, it sucks. It's hard to quit. You will want a drink often. But man does it feel good to be free.",11,0
1307,2021-03-12 21:04:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/m3wqyu/why_should_i_stop/,Why should I stop?,"My first reaction when explaining my relationship with alcohol even while quitting is to belittle myself. Thirty-three days today is the longest I've been without a drink since it was legal to drink in college. I would buy a pretty cheap bottle of chateau san michelle dry riesling and work on it a little harder when I was anxious about something. My drinking morphed a lot when I discovered whisky. You get drunk faster, but you look really refined while doing it. Drinking wine or beer (which I still drank) was for normal drinkers. Drinking whiskey was for the true connoisseurs of alcohol. Combine that with the fancier more expensive ones and I was someone who lived in a high class world. I don't know if you've ever smelled a Hibiki, but it's divine.


I think I know exactly why I drink while also feeling like I don't have a clue.


I think I drink due to anxiety. I wasn't even aware I was an anxious person until recently, but looking back it all kind of fits together.


I think I drink because of boredom. Perhaps another symptom of anxiety, but the feeling of wasting my life tends to make me want to end it.


I definitely drink as a strange sort of reprisal. I'm mad about something so I'm going to sabotage myself, that'll show them.


I drink to be social.


I drink to let loose.


I drink as a ritual to let my brain know that work is over and I can relax now.


I drink because I've already had the first one.


The hardest question for me though was:


**""Why should I stop?""**


I enjoy alcohol. It's a part of my identity. I am the friend/child who finds and brings expensive bottles of wine when visiting. I got to feel classy when out with my friends drinking expensive cocktails or fine whiskey. A cold beer as a reward for some good exercise was the only way I knew how to tell myself I did a good job. I'm a regularly depressed individual. I don't find joy in many things without alcohol involved. Even though I think I like board games, making chit chat as I play them sober feels painful. I can't wait to escape. In fact most activities that I enjoyed feel painful without alcohol. Thirty-three days in and I still find this true.


**""Why should I stop?""**
To not get fired?


I have worked at some pretty big tech jobs and had bouts of really good work and really mediocre to abysmal work. The nature of these places would allow some mediocrity to fill a seat as opposed to nobody filling the seat at all as long as you put in a minimum viable effort. I could put in a minimum viable effort in a few places. I've only been a star employee for maybe a year out of the ten I've worked. It felt good until it didn't. Alcohol was less important during the times I was doing well. But I mostly didn't like or didn't care about the work, or eventually wound up there. When I wound up not caring alcohol was right there to fill in the void. I still managed to not get fired, even though I probably should have been. Either way, I don't really care about my job. Getting fired, well I could recover from that and find another way. I can be talented and charming for a while when I need to be. I can't consistently work hard though, not when the work never ends and it seems to never end.


**""Why should I stop?""**
I'll leave sad loved ones behind?


I thought dating or getting married might change things for me. I don't know why my partner agreed to marry me after spending over a year living with my drinking habits. We drank together for fun, but I was always the heavier drinker. When I thought it was too much I drank alone at night when my partner needed to go to bed early. I guess my partner found me charming somehow. I suppose I can be that way when I want to be.

My partner didn't like my heavy drinking. After their dad died they didn't want someone who wasn't going to be sticking around. It was a huge contentious part of our relationship. I both wanted to keep drinking and stop, but the part of me that wanted to stop couldn't beat the question of ""Why should I?"". Part of me was angry that they should have known who they married. This didn't come out of nowhere and if this is what caused the relationship to fail, then it wasn't very strong to begin with. I didn't know if I wanted to stick around that long in the first place. Growing old scares the hell out of me. Living in constant pain more than what I'm already living with is not something I think I'm equipped to deal with, dying early is fine. What right did my partner have to make me live healthier and stick around.


**""Why should I stop?""**
Because I'm drinking myself to death?


In case it hasn't been clear I constantly ping pong between wanting to live and wanting everything to be over. I keep living because the alternative is scarier, but when I'm in pain and that pain feels like it will never end only growing bigger and bigger… Well, death sometimes looks like a relief. I know this isn't true. I know this is depression and there are a lot of great writers who put that buried under snow feeling more poignantly then myself. Drinking was my slow suicide. Maybe I'd find something worth living for, but in the meantime I was going to keep killing myself. To put it less dramatically I'm self-sabotaging. I don't like the life I have, but I don't know how or am too scared to try and make it better. I have a pretty good spot in life so why can't I be happy? I deserve this.


**""Ok, but really why should I stop?""**
Because we decided to have a kid.


This was it for me. I honestly didn't believe it was going to happen because my partner was scared about the idea of being a parent. I'm an overly anxious and conscientious person (as weird as that sounds from me stating how I didn't care about other people's opinions of my death).  But there we were starting the process of trying and here I was still an alcoholic. Alcohol can have some pretty negative effects on conception from both parents, so can a lot of other things, but alcohol was a bad choice I continued making. What if it was my fault that some horrible condition befell our kid? I can't bear to think of that. I have to do everything in my power to make sure they get the best chance possible. I also just can't stand being an alcoholic parent. Raising a child with the same normality placed on alcohol as I was raised with just doesn't feel right.


Also wow I can't die early. I've felt alone most of my life. I'm terrified of failure and that there would be nowhere to go if I did. If I wasn't successful everyone would leave me. There's no way in hell I want my child to feel that way. They've got to know from day one that there will always be someone there to help them get back on their feet for as long as I possibly can.


I've wanted a child more than my partner. It's a big selfish request that could potentially ruin both of our lives. I have to be there, I have to help. Honestly it's the least I can do.


You know the real big change though: I want to stop. Alcohol still has power over me, but not nearly the power of a hopeful future. I spent my early years building towards a bright future that never seemed like it was going to manifest so I filled the void with alcohol. Now that a bright future seems like it's here I want to do everything in my power to see it through and make it the best I can.


Here says the person thirty-three days into sobriety. I have no idea if any of my thoughts resonate with the rest of you. I plan to keep up my sobriety though. I haven't talked about my rock bottom because honestly I never hit it, nor was it a good reason to stop if I did. I often drank two bottles of whiskey a week plus whatever beer and wine I wanted. I swung back and forth between cutting back and ramping up. However, I never found my reason to stop completely even knowing it's power and negative effects. Some part of me wanted to stop drinking, but it was never strong enough.


I hope the rest of you find your reasons to stop. My life is going substantially better since finding mine. Making the pledge and reading this community have helped me a lot. I've felt less alone. I feel less judged here, I feel like I'm not a bad person for my lack of control over alcohol. Using my knowledge from my other failed attempts at quitting has helped me too, making them feel less like failures.

Pros:  Have accomplished so much more than ever expected.  Both have so much less anxiety and have so much more energy.  True contentment for my life and for what we have and work hard for.  Making plans for the future and working towards those goals and plans instead of just sitting around and saying “there is always tomorrow”.  More money and wayyyy better sleep.  Oh and Tea.  Glorious tea. 

Cons:  Still struggle with eating more sugar via candy than Id like.  But I know I can overcome this in time.  Chronic pain can be more intense at times cause do not have the alcohol to mask the pain.  Still unsure of social situations and how that will be as we’ve not had any due to Covid.  More energy but also more tired. Lol.  I accomplish so much more in a day by the end of the day I am SPENT.

I've been following this post for about a year. 

Up front info on me. I suffer from depression, anxiety and PTSD. In the past I've been diagnosed with dependance on alcohol. With my mental health issues, I can not sleep. I am often riddled with my past or current issues I identify with. 

Recently, my coworkers nephew died at 35 from a heart attack. For the past week, my anxiety has focused on death. Mostly, how I will die. I live alone. I work and work another job. So my day is full. With that being said, I hold on to my daily issues until I get home. 

I drink 5 airplane bottles nightly, to sleep.  I have had meds to treat my mental health, but the side affects suck. So I don't mix meds and alcohol at all. 

Since the death of my coworker's cousin, I am afraid to die alone. I live alone, btw. 

So due to my anxiety, I went to have a full check up. However, I wasn't honest about how often I drink. 

I really want to stop. I DO!!! But, I am afraid of the demons of my mind and not sleeping. MY earliest memory of not sleeping through the night started at 3 years old. I had trauma at an early age. 

I've gone without alcohol plenty of times, but I find myself very emotional. I can not deal with the thoughts and emotions. 

I  am here asking for help. Clearly, drinking isn't the answer, but I need help to deal with life and I am not sure how to do it. 

I don't want to die alone. As I type this, I see I am boo hooing and this post isn't worth your time. I know what I need to do

I had my first drink at around 16 years old.  A guy I was talking to on the internet (an older guy... I was naive) told me to steal liquor from my parents cabinet and keep drinking.  I got alcohol poisoning that first night, drinking alone and an ambulance came.

I actually started dating that guy for the next 7 years.  His idea of fun was a handle of vodka and video games every weekend.   He is the one who encouraged me to steal liquor from his parents, and would convince me to drink in the morning.

Then, off to college where it was normal to binge and party.   I never quite grew out of that, and learned to always drink to get pretty damn buzzed or drunk.   

Hung out with lots of heavy drinkers and partiers the rest of my 20s.  I felt normal because everyone was doing the same as me.

It truly is baffling to me. I know when I’m stepping into a messy situation and I just start slinging more shit. It’s like I think I can come out clean the other side if I just keep drinking but we all know that is not the case. 

I had therapy. Check for the trigger. I got dressed in something other than work clothes to go out and get my Covid shot (funny what we “dress up” for these days. Check towards frenetic energy. I ran out the door after therapy with no food on my stomach. Check for set up for failure. Had a serious convo about mental health and meds with a friend which stirred up some painful memories. Check unstable emotional platform. I got super caught up in the plan to go for drinks and apps after our shots, because social but also, booze. Check continued linkage between social and friends and alcohol. We went to a place that used to be “our” (ex wife and semi ex friend) watering hole. Check nostalgia and sadness but also comfort in the known. Then I ended up being around said sorta ex-friend in an awkward social setting. Check drinking to make it less awkward. Check lots of drinking for that. Check more and more drinking once it ended up just being the two of us left at the table. Check strained conversation that was kind of personal but also weird so, more drinking. Also, strained convo because we’ve butted heads about drinking and both enabled eachother while she also was asking me to cut down/stop. When she left I was alone to finish my beer and just felt deflated? sad? alone? confused? I don’t even know. I felt emotions so, back to drinking. 

I had to be at another staff meeting in an hour so I stayed and kept drinking. I didn’t just sit there at the staff meeting like I’d hoped I’d do. I was vocal instead. Which is fine, I did have some things that needed to be brought up. Hopefully I didn’t say them in a negative way but oh well. I say what I mean when I’m drunk but I’m a bit more forceful/willful about it. 

Of course at this point it was beyond the point of return and I’d already bought more beer and had it in the car. Time to go for broke! So after I invited some friends to have some parking lot beers. We finished what I had and bought more. We, surprisingly, didn’t finish those. The cops had driven by a few times so we wrapped it up and headed on our way. My way should not have been driving but my drunk brain didn’t register that. I’m so upset at myself. 

Made it home safe. Thank whatever powers that be. Stuffed my face. Crashed out. Woke up in the early AM knowing that work was not on the agenda for today. I probably could’ve made it. I probably could go in now. But I just hit my wall. 

I feel like a selfish dick though because I know we’re short staffed and I know it was going to be busy from the get go and I’m all about making peoples lives better and work better and here I am fucking them over. Also, I’m scared our boss saw us and knew I was drunk and is putting two and two together and that I won’t have a job anymore. I think I even made some comment about I’d come in early if I wasn’t too hungover. Shit. 

And, onto damage control. It’s so exhausting. Lies upon lies. Being truthful has always been important to me. But with drinking I’ve spun some pretty tall tales. Gets down to plausible deniability. Smoothing things over and trying to hide the demon inside so no one else sees. Back to shame and guilt.",5,1

One of the lowest points of my life is when my boyfriend discovered empty beer cans in my dresser while trying to put back clothes he generously folded for me. Today I found a mini bottle in a rarely used cabinet above the microwave that I must have hidden a long time ago. I took it, looked at it and sniffed it to see what I would drink right before I poured it down the drain.

Over the last decade I have slowly cut back to where now I don't have any desire to drink and don't know if I ever will. Over the years my husband had cut back too the point where we only drank one weekend night. But now that I have stopped drinking it seems as though he has ramped it up... he's now drinking every other night. And sometimes it's just a couple of drinks/beers so he doesn't actually get drunk and other nights he gets wasted. And there really is no telling what kind of night it will be. He has admitted that he can lose control of his drinking once he begins but I guess he doesn't really care? He has also admitted that he has a drinking problem but again, I guess he doesn't care? He's not a violent drunk but he can be argumentive and very annoying. We use to have HORRILBE arguments but now that I am sober I can see how he tries to push my buttons and I don't engage. All of his family and friends drink A LOT so in comparison his drinking still looks like nothing. I don't expect him to change just because I did. And I feel bad because he didn't sign up for a sober partner/life. But I also am not going to drink just to save my marriage and lets be real... like I just mentioned, we had HORRIBLE arguments soooo it wouldn't be a happy marriage even if I were still drinking. My best friends are also LEGIT alcholics hence why I am here.. I feel so alone with my sobrity and have no one to talk to about this. We have four kids and a decade worth of living together that leaving isn't just an easy thing to do. One of my reasons for quitting drinking is that our kids are getting older and I don't want them to grow up to see mom drunk every weekend but then there their dad is... drunk every weekend and a couple times during the week. Can this work?? Has someone stayed in a situation like this and lived happily ever after??? I have also really gotten into health and fitness this last year and I look and feel better then I EVER have in my entire life and he said this was the year he was going to get back into shape and eat better and that lasted all of maybe 2 weeks because it's hard to care about those things when you are hungover. I don't want to break up my family. I reallyreallyreally don't. But I don't know how much more I can take.

I have been drinking a half-bottle of wine pretty much every day since November. I'm pretty petite - 5ft and 98 lbs. 

Teaching from home has been convenient, but there is little structure, and because teachers at my school are encouraged to hold asynchronous days, I use them as an excuse to drink a lot the night before. I'm very structured despite a lack of structure - I start drinking no earlier than 10PM and never go past 2-3AM. Maybe I see wine as a way to wind down after the day, to reward myself for work or getting through a busy teaching day.

I plan days to stop drinking (non-negotiable days) but I haven't held myself accountable. We received news that we have to return to in-person instruction next week, and I thought, why stop now? Might as well stop next week. 

My structure will be in place again - there's no way I am drinking when I have to drive to Brooklyn at 7am the next day. I'm nervous about my own nervousness - the gradual loss of hope that comes about when I make excuses. I won't keep alcohol in my house anymore.",5,0

remember waking up feeling like this: 
You wake up, heart beating out of your chest, head pounding, and unsure of what time it is. You quickly look at your phone to make sure you didn’t send anything or talk to anyone you would regret. You are so shaky you can barely hold your phone without dropping it. The feelings of shame and regret start to seep in.. why did I just waste 3 days of my life being completely and utterly wasted. During this time you have completely isolated yourself in your room, only to venture out for more wine and crap food in a drunken stupor. Avoiding everyone’s calls and texts including friends and family.. you have done nothing but lay in bed and drink the days away..You wake up and drink till you pass out and wake up to do it again. You have not showered or brushed your teeth in 3 days. You probably haven’t even drank water in atleast 24 hours your lips are so dry they are starting to crack. You feel completely and utterly disgusting, the crippling and debilitating anxiety starts to creep in that is so overwhelming. You decide to take a hot shower in the dark to feel better, during that time your thoughts are racing, completely all over the place and nonstop that you feel crazy and panicked, you are so nauseous that you decide to make yourself puke in the shower just to get some relief.. nothing is in your stomach so all you puke is bile. You contemplate just getting out of the shower and drinking more just to soften the voice and the anxiety. You wish you could just stay in that shower forever and thoughts of dying cross your mind. You then are only able to lay in bed all day, wasting another day, horribly hungover. Even talking on the phone makes you feel like you are going to have a complete panic attack and your mind is so slow and foggy, you are so shaky and nauseous you are unable to eat for the whole day.. you would do anything and everything to take those feelings away and not have drank and to just feel somewhat normal again. This is the reality if you drink. This is the outcome every time your mind tells you “maybe just one glass” this is the vicious cycle that will not stop until you choose to take hold of your life and remain sober...

Hi Guys,  
 

I wanted to share here because it is possible. No matter how deep it feels you’re in it, there is a way out if you want it. I want to remember this anniversary date by sharing how this all started and where I was. I want to focus on this because it is one of the hardest places that I believe a person can be in. 

My hope is that in sharing it, someone can draw from my life experience and if this helps only one person, then the years have been worth it.

By March 12, 2013 I was freshly 22 years old. I had been kicked out of one of the best colleges in the world and stepped down to a lesser one, I had to return home hat in hand. My liver was failing, my health deteriorating from drinking over a fifth of hard liquor a day.

I had reached the point where in the last weeks of drinking, my tolerance for alcohol had plummeted to a few shots only. Those who are familiar with the Jelinek Curve can see that it is a stage you really do not want to be in.

By then I had already tried unsuccessfully to quit drinking for a few months, but nothing worked.

My breaking point, or should I say, the point where I realized enough was enough…. I was sitting in class around 530 pm and I pulled out my phone and googled 12 step meetings. Right then and there. Saw there was a meeting at 630 a few miles away.

In a break in the class, I went up to the professor and said: “Sir, something came up, can I take leave early?” I remember it crystal clear he responded jokingly: “Is it a matter a life and death?” I stayed quiet for about 5 seconds and looked back at him somberly and said: “Yes Sir, it is.” He gave me leave.

I left school and headed to that meeting. Been sober ever since.

I have graduated college, started a business, started a family, lived through the death of my mother, changed residences and states, changed workplaces, lived through deaths of friends and people I love, gained friends and lost friends. All of the above, sober and without a single drink. It IS possible, just go for it as if your life depends on it and as if it were a matter of life and death, because as I said eight years ago… “Yes sir, it is.”",398,0

Of course I google it because I know I drink far too much, for far too long and convinced myself it’s something else. Ascites?  Cirrhosis? Maybe.  Or a gas bubble that just likes to linger and make me look 6 months pregnant?

I’ve heavily drank for the better part of 13 years.  Not an all day drinker, but every evening, averaging about 8 high alcohol 12 oz beverages. Sometime more, sometimes less.  Rarely not at all.  I have had some minor pain where my liver is.  But of course, convinced myself I have time to turn it around.  And then continued.  I’m 35, btw. 

Well, 2 days ago I had the abdominal pangs and bloating and gasX isn’t helping. But after researching it, I’m convinced my liver is failing me (or rather, I failed it).  Maybe I’m looking too far into it but it definitely got my head out of my ass.  I’ll be scheduling an appt. with my PCP tomorrow and am avidly sure I am done drinking.

I already know I have high blood pressure and cholesterol.  No swelling in my feet, ankles or legs. No jaundice. And no DT’s.  This stomach thing is freaking me out because the prognosis of what I read up on isn’t a good one.

Has anyone here ever experienced anything like this? Hopefully some positives came out of it you can share with me, to talk me off this ledge of “omg you are going to die in two months and leave your family “mom and wifeless”.

March 12, my actual birthday I woke up with dread, anxiety and a huge sense of disappointment and failure.

I sewed a T shirt (my newest hobby), we went for a bike ride around a local park, now I'm having a great 0% Nanny State beer, being cooked a steak, being overwhelmed with love by friends and family.

I’m a 22 year old male who graduated college a little over a year ago. I am really coming to terms with the fact that I am an alcoholic. I drove home drunk last night and my parents figured it out. A little part of me is so happy that this finally happened because now it is out there in the world and I can speak it. My mother is an alcoholic and has been sober for 28 years, her father was an alcoholic as well as my dads father who has been sober for many many many years so I definitely have the gene. 

I have always kind of known this about myself, but in college it just seemed like a part of life. There was ALWAYS the opportunity to drink and ALWAYS people to drink with. Alcohol ruined relationships for me there and I figured it out too late. I was not a good boyfriend, friend, or person to be around. Like all of us here it was never social drinking, it was drinking to the point of blackout, every weekend was a bender. Got addicted to nicotine as well, can’t go without it when I’m drinking. Luckily I never went down the drug route, I know for a fact if I ever did cocaine I would immediately become completely addicted.

Now school is over, I work a great job remotely, and I make a lot of money. There are no more parties, but the booze is still there. At the beginning of the pandemic I found myself drinking alone in my room. I was bored and lonely and unfortunately alcohol was the way I chose to fill the void. This is when I really knew. I could go the week without drinking but as soon as the weekend came I was determined to get as drunk as I could, alone or with others. 

Then I started driving. I’d go buy booze or meet up with a friend to drink and I’d crack beers on the way there. Then drink 6 more and drive home. It is an absolute miracle that I didn’t kill anybody or myself. This is 100% what I am most ashamed of. Especially because it is so easy to just not drive.

Looking forward - I am absolutely terrified for what is to come. I understand that alcohol will do me nothing but harm for the rest of my life, yet I still love it. Of course it is an excuse but I feel like this is difficult for my 20’s, almost all social events involve boozing. I want to just learn to control myself and drink socially but I know that as soon as that first sip hits, all bets are off. 

All of this said I would appreciate any advice people may have. Resources, practices, life experience etc. I’m glad that I can finally acknowledge this disease but it is only the first step.",4,1

Couple months ago I discovered this sub r/microdosing which changed my life for a healthier one.

I found there users who could easily quit methamphetamine addiction due to microdosing.

I think it might have very strong anti-addictive properties. 

For sure it is helpful with regeneration of the brain which is now research at John Hopkins on fighters from UFC.

Back to the story, when I stopped drinking I did not stop drinking coffee and smoking cannabis though. Many months later I discovered microdosing and I found weird side-effect of microdosing that I was no longer needing the weed nor coffee. So I stopped also this.

Has anyone tried microdosing helpful with the stopping of drinking?

I don't know because I am not drinking regardless of microdosing but I found that the cravings for alcohol which I had during that last year have ceased to exist as well. Like I did not need conciously resist the thought of drinking, like I just did not need it. It's somehow different. Like not drinking was easier. 

I know that the father of AA, the man who created it, has made the first step to use the psychedelic as a first step but later it was taken down due to resistance from the people who did not took it and it is 12 steps not 13 now.

It sucks to have a need to drink for the sake of drinking. Every need that a person has gives symptoms if left unanswered, it’s the same with alcohol addiction. That need is like a burning lamp inside my head, fueled by alcohol. The need dies down if left unanswered for long enough, but make no mistake it returns if I drink again. Then it’s fighting again against that need, with successes and failures, it takes time and it never goes away if I drink again, it’s exhausting. It sucks ass and there’s no other fix to it but to quit completely. Everything else is just pouring more fuel into that lamp and then it’s on again. I’m done, I want to get rid of this once and for all.

As I reflect on what triggered me to get drunk last night, ending my 11 day sober streak, I think back to a comment I read on here a few months ago:

""Try to build a life that you don't need to escape from.""

It's obvious that many of us suffer from loneliness, depression, or anxiety, or some trauma from our past, and sometimes we try to self medicate and numb our brain with alcohol.

I have learned that it is NOT enough for me to simply quit alcohol. I NEED to have a plan and structure to thrive and enjoy the sober life. A mistake I have often made is planning for not drinking, but not planning for what comes next: ""So I'm not drinking... what now? what do I do in life? How do I spend my time instead?""

In other words, if I don't have plenty of other healthier options, activities, and friendships to fill the void left by alcohol, I will feel stuck and uneasy and return to my bad habits.

I am back on the sober wagon, but I need to prioritize living a full, happy life with good honest friends and clean activities, so that I have no need or desire to numb my brain anymore. Building a life I can enjoy and thrive in, not run away from.",43,0

Before I officially got sober, I had tried to get sober, but relapse was part of my journey.  While I continue to get better and stronger, I also have realized many work related mistakes I made while I was in the worst of my drinking days.  It has taken me some time to muster up the courage to deal with some of these mistakes.  I owned up to a few of these mistakes today and I am taking the steps I know I need to take in order to get things righted.  I am feeling a fairly significant amount of anxiety about dealing with these work related mistakes.  I have mentioned to my wife that I made some mistakes and will need to deal with them.  She has been supportive, but I also do not feel right burdening her with the gory details as she has been the glue that has kept our family together as I navigate my way back to a more productive and healthier life.  Despite my increased anxiety and uncertainty about what the future holds regarding my past mistakes, I will not drink with you today.  I am praying for more courage to deal with some of the other issues I created.  I have to remember that we are not defined by our circumstances and our circumstances are what they are right now for a reason, but they do not have to stay that way forever.  Good luck out there.

I started the Alcohol Experiment Monday, as well as the book Alcohol Explained. I have begun to remember how much I used to love to learn, and slowly that love is returning.

And although I feel like I new some of the things I am learning, actually hearing them out loud backed by studies is INSANE!! I find myself yearning for my breaks at work and my drives to listen to these powerful learning tools. I am loving it! And feeling damn strong.

I told a couple of friends about this on my day one. By day three, one of them had signed up for the course (YAY!!!) Today, the other told me they were not going to do any programs, but that they were going to abstain for 30 days. I never asked them to do any of that, I asked for support and help to keep me accountable. I am SO DAMN HAPPY to have maybe influenced them to stop, or at least take a look at their consumption habits.

I am humbled because I came into this for me (which is still my main focus) but I realize that I am most certainly not in this alone, and that people I love want to better their lives as well.

I started stopping five years ago.  I was traveling, down in L.A.  My old neighborhood.  I distinctly recall craving alcohol in the morning.  I remember getting browned out and fuzzy, and losing cards that I purchased.    I remember talking to the guy in the next seat at the bar in the oldest restaurant in SM, an old haunt, and he said to me you are spitting on me.  A client took me out for brunch with mimosas.  My next appointment said he could smell alcohol.  I said yes, I just came from a brunch with Mimosas.  Prior to this over the years many times I thought about the fact that I am drinking too much and should give it a rest.  That was the beginning of my journey.  

Now, five years later and a lot wiser, there is no reason really for me to be coming here. I want to be moved on and not thinking about the fact that I dumped the wine.

 I quit cigarettes 6 years ago and it was way harder.  I just moved on.  Didn't get fat.  Rejoiced privately and also told all my family and friends how proud I was.  When I quit drinking it felt more like shame.  I kept it secret.  I mentioned I just stopped drinking.  The difference is one is socially acceptable and one is not.  I want to move on to the part now like forget I quit and just move on. 

 Next up I need to face my fears.  As I look back, my job has been a big reason that I want to smoke a cig, joint, or have a drink, because it causes fear and anxiety.  I need to just let the fear go.  Here is to a new chapter for me.  IWnDWyT",13,0

Dear brothers and sisters in recovery,

Bring some tea and maybe a cookie, because it’s gonna be a long and bumpy read.

Looking back on what I wrote last year, I was very hopeful and energetic, coming out of some of the best months of my life. The reality of lockdown life and reduced autonomy caused by the corona measures didn’t yet fully materialize. The 3rd year of sobriety was fantastic for so many reasons, so many positive emotions and memories.

This 4th year has been very different. The balance of positives and negatives has shifted strongly to the negative side. Not having a social life, periods without a relationship or cuddle friend, going months without touch, this was the reality in some parts of this corona year. But this is not unique to me of course, many of us went through similar experiences. I wish you all as much warmth and love as you could possible receive. I wish you all exciting times and great stories to tell in the future once all this corona stuff is over.

What was I up to? The first months of corona just the basics. Work, exercise, sleep, repeat. This was tenable, because I still had hope it will pass quickly and charged batteries from the previous great year. In summer we had light measures here in Belgium. Not having any festival hurt, as it felt like I was throwing away my summer holidays. There wasn’t that much different between lockdown and summer, as the daily flow still was mostly work, exercise, sleep, repeat. In July I finished my teaching degree though. Didn’t really celebrate, firstly because it wasn’t allowed, secondly, because I didn’t really feel like it was such a great achievement.  

At the end of summer vacation I went on a bicycle trip with a friend of mine. We both wanted some adventure. This was such an awesome time. It’s hard to explain how great it was. We cycled through forests, hillsides, next to long canals. Having a break in small villages where we drank some coffee in a random restaurant. Hiding from stormy weather. We stayed at camping sites, where we had to run from a fast food joint back once, because our tent was still open to dry and it started raining! Sleeping together during a storm in a tent is something special. I could write pages about this, but a quote of my friend will make it clear: we experienced so many different things that one day of cycling vacation almost feels like a week in a normal vacation. 10/10, would recommend, do it with a friend/partner though. We became FWB during and after the trip, for the second time. This was at the end of summer.

In fall I started studying again, but this time economics. I couldn’t handle another period of ‘work, exercise, sleep’, I had to have something to work towards. I felt like my youth was slipping between my fingers and falling in the dirt because of the pandemic.  This first semester was particularly hard, as it was the workload of a full-time student + full-time work. Somehow it was successful though, as in the end I passed all subjects I studied for. There was balance: I had my work to support me, I had my studies as a purpose to get up in the morning and I had my FWB (although in style it was more a relationship). It was hard but I could make it work. During exams we weren’t able to meet up for 6 weeks though, those were dark weeks.

When we met up the first time she said she wanted to stop, to look for a real relationship. This hit like a brick. I wasn’t expecting anything, in my mind all was well. We met up one last time afterwards. I felt how the balance I had before was shattered. I wasn’t able to put much energy in work and did the bare minimum for my studies. Recovering from a heartache in these times is so much harder. There’s little to balance out your negative and painful experiences. Our last meetings were a lot of fun and good memories, but there was still this lingering fear of all of this stopping.

I did a lot of emotional work these weeks. I wanted to suggest that we’d date for real. I worked through my fear of commitment. I worked through lingering feelings I had somewhere for another friend, that were never expressed for years. I didn’t expect anything when I told her I regret that we never knew eachother better when she was still single. She has a boyfriend of some years now. I just wanted to get these feelings out. So we talked a lot about our vulnerabilities and became better friends. Due to this talk she even started to plan for mental help to work through her anxieties. So, my tip to you, never leave your feelings unexpressed, rejection is indeed better than regret. Afterwards I suggested to my former FWB if we could date for real, but she said no, with pain in her heart. She was looking for someone who’d jump into a relationship fully, instead of someone with fear of commitment. I can understand that, but it hurt. It hurt a lot. All this working through emotions and having challenging conversations made me exhausted mentally. One thing I learned these last months: “You can work through rejection, even though it hurts. Working through regret is difficult and can be with you for years.” My solution at the time was: go for 2 days to my parents to rest, to not have to take care for 100% of my life, to be cared for a bit.

Something I started doing to deal with the feelings during this time is dancing, I started training on solo dancing, to have 10 minutes or more to forget about all this corona stuff and stay connected to my passion, which is dancing.

At my parents, my dad made some degrading comments about my choice to be a vegetarian, while under the influence. I haven’t felt this angry in a long time. I talked to my mother about this, about how my only dad was making negative comments about me, while strangers on the internet were supportive and complimenting me on my dancing. How can this be right? I cried here, I cried a lot these weeks, almost daily I think. Still better than drinking though. All emotions need to be felt and not ignored or ‘drank away’. Even though it hurts, it feels like life. So even more challenging conversations!

After I returned home, I wrote a letter to my father, about how he made me feel. About how I longed for a warm and spontaneous relationship with my only father. How it hurts when he makes negative comments about choices in my life that positively impacted me. How I couldn’t connect with him and that we rarely have conversations in depth. This was a subject that I’ve been talking about in therapy for some years now. He responded that he doesn’t really share many feelings of his own, that it’s hard for him and that we’ll start conversing more. It wasn’t as in depth as I expected, but I take what I can get now. It was the first time that I could talk about feelings with my father, so that’s an achievement. If you’re in the same situation, please share your thoughts with your parents, you don’t know how long they’ll be here. At least you tried, if it would fail, at least you won’t have to think about the ‘what if?’s.  

Because of this, I was emotionally drained, I was exhausted. But I felt some changes in my mind. I felt how I was becoming an emotionally brave person, someone who can initiate the difficult conversations and talk about these topics tactfully. So it’s been a hard training, a very hard training, but it works. I found rejection is better than regret.  

In all this I still had to work, haven’t had carefree fun since the beginning of 2021. I was exhausted and I was having old psychological issues returning: dissociating from the moment, feeling gray, laughing less and less, feeling anxiety, feeling hopelessness sometimes. Thanks to recovery + therapy I had better coping mechanisms though. I started calling friends more, having more frequent therapy sessions. I started sharing more with colleagues about my private life. Opening up and being emotionally brave again, daring to be vulnerable.  

Being vulnerable and having supportive experiences are good for the self-esteem. I feel stronger and feel like my social network is stronger. I further dare to dance new styles: burlesque styles, blues style, classic/almost ballet style. I feel my body moving with more freedom every day. So there’s that.  

On the other hand, moments to ‘let go’ and get ‘in flow’ are few and far between. This makes bad experiences hit that much harder. I’m holding on to hope that the worst is behind me now, even though I have moments that I feel hopelessness. A bittersweet year, a year of big self-development. A year of sowing, while the previous year was a year of harvesting.  

**Time to take a look at my previous plans:**

**- I want to keep expanding the comfort zone, by trying new, scary things. When expanding the comfort zone, I feel very alive.**

Well, this has happened, I’ve expanded my comfort zone in many dimensions. Even though this year was much more challenging than the previous, I expect it to be like my first year of sobriety. I hope I’m already past the deepest point of the trampoline and the future is going up. I believe my 30’s are gonna be great.

**- I want to be more active in my dancing communities by volunteering at the bar or DJ'ing.**

Sadly this wasn’t possible due to corona. The plans are still there. I still want to be a Lindy Hop DJ and an ecstatic dance DJ.

**- I want to be vulnerable in front of an audience more often, to show my inner self that it's ok to be vulnerable, that people won't leave you suddenly. I'll join an improv jam in some weeks.**

I’m doing this, not in the way I planned though. I’m filming my dancing exercise and sharing it online sometimes. The first times it was very weird, but you get used to it. I’m comfortable now and filming my exercise makes my dancing so much better. I feel more secure in my body and ability to be sensual now.

**- Keep going to therapy to improve my emotional side. I'm already so much better than before, but there's still room for improvement. Usually, when I share my deep wants and needs, some good plans come up: like the solo dancing, going back to improv.**  

Especially January and February were very though, but effective times to improve my emotional side. I’ve discovered that I can be emotionally vulnerable, that I can be the one to engage these conversations. That I can be the one that strengthens friendships or initiate friendships. I usually saw this as one of my biggest weaknesses. I believe helping out others in recovery and therapy were important.  

To keep the most important for last: while being together with my FWB, I learned that it’s ok to communicate all your feelings. She was very accepting and supportive when I shared my emotions, the good and the bad. I did the same for her, helping her through difficult times and trying to make her see herself like I see her, to make her feel about herself like I felt about her while we where together. As someone very kind, fun, supportive, attractive and adventurous (and more adjectives), because she felt self-doubt and insecure sometimes if something didn’t go right in life.  

 

**Plans for the next year:**

* I  want to keep studying and work towards a PhD. I want to do my best and  get the most out of it. I want to chase this dream, as I believe this is  the best path for me to have the greatest positive impact. I’d like to  work on sustainable development, which I’ve been interested in since I  was 15.
* I  want to develop my courage further. I want to be brave both in actions  and in emotions. This way I hope I can be more empathetic and confident.  I hope I can have stronger relationships. I want to not feel shame  about my unorthodox hobbies and interests. It’s already a lot better,  but it’s 	still a bit there. Or I need to find a group where I feel more  at home (my dancing communities were like this, but they’re gone now,  due to corona).
* I  want to keep developing my physique and dancing further, I’ll try to do  2 songs every day. When possible I’d perform as well. Add improv  performing to this too. This 	way I can enter my 30s in the best shape  of my life.
* I  want to keep doing therapy and connect more with people emotionally. I  want to keep helping people in recovery and give back to the community.
* I still want to be more active in my dancing communities by volunteering at the bar or DJ'ing.
* And of course, to stay free of alcohol, as it’s the foundation of all this. Without sobriety, all of this is impossible.

And  thus concludes this longest of posts about a very unusual year. If  you’re still reading, I’d like to thank you for listening to my story.  To a year with a healthier balance of fun and challenging moments!

“In this terrifying world, all we have are the connections that we make.”

Long time lurker but first time poster.

I stopped drinking on the 1st Jan and overall am really glad, but a couple of recent wobbles with social awkwardness have got me worried. How do I talk to people sober?! I make things so awkward, but always found 1 beer would smooth that over and I have had a good social life and good friends (back when social life was a thing).But now lockdown where I am is easing next month and I'm worried I've completely lost my crutch. I had a painfullu awkward chat with a neighbour this morning and it's playing in my mind. 

Has anybody else been through this? And found a way through? 

I feel like as a teenager I found the 'cure' for my shyness in alcohol, and now I don't have that.

Feeling good...

The first week was really tough, I found myself constantly wanting a drink or thinking about a drink. The last couple days have been relatively smooth but now I find myself thinking, ""I don't have a problem, i haven't had a drink in almost 2 weeks why not just go back to moderation?"", ""St. Patrick's Day is my favorite holiday and that's right around the corner, maybe I should buy some Guinness and Jameson?"", ""I think I deserve it I've been pretty good the past two weeks and I feel fine"".

It's amazing the tricks your mind will play. Just two weeks ago I was waking up with hangovers everyday, feeling like I was going to die. I finally broke down and admitted to my wife that I had been hiding bottles of whiskey from her and was drinking far more than she knew. How can I so quickly forget all that and think I can control myself to only have a beer with dinner? It's easy I guess, I used to say daily that I wouldn't drink and by the time the sun went down my memory of that would be gone.

In the past I have always socially drank to excess, or binged at home by myself to numb my stress. I've blacked out more times than I can count and the pinnacle of my addiction was winding up in the ER after passing out in a bar a few years ago. 

August 2020 I took a pregnancy test and boom it was positive. I haven't had a single drink much less a craving since that day. I honestly couldn't tell you where the ""discipline"" comes from? Obviously drinking during pregnancy causes a myriad of issues. Despite all the stressful situations I've had to endure as sober + pregnant (pandemic, extreme weather, problems at work, relationship stuff, etc), I can't help but wonder if I'll quickly return to my old ways once my son is born. Has anybody else dealt with this? Any advice on how to stay sober for your children's sake?

P.S. I know there are addicts out there who have/do drink during pregnancy and I am not looking down on any of you. I understand how difficult addiction is and I count myself incredibly lucky that my urge to drink somehow vanished once I got pregnant.",12,1

5 years ago I found myself in a desperate position. I couldn't imagine my life with alcohol and I couldn't imagine my life without it. The more I tried to control it, the more out of control it became.

I had been hiding my alcoholism for years. It had progressed to the point that most days I was drinking against my will. What's more, the only thing that brought me relief each day from the constant anxiety, depression, and despair, was also paradoxically the cause of those same conditions.

I hid it from most, though anyone who had the pleasure of going out with me on the weekends or at parties noticed my abnormal consumption (and the seemingly endless drinks I could have without appearing particularly inhibriated [though this too changed toward the end]). I was always the designated drunk driver as some friends used to joke. But neither they, nor my wife, or anyone else new the levels and frequency of my drinking.

It seemed that once I started drinking I couldn't stop. And even if I managed to stop for a day or two, I wasn't able to stay stopped. 

Privately I sought counciling. Saw an amazing addiction specialist. Yet still my drinking got worse and worse. Started medication. And still it got worse. Cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy, I was trying anything to stop. But I couldn't. Everyday I found myself at the package store. Nips, tall boys, then entire bottles. Every night I promised would be last. Tomorrow I will stop. I swear it. Yet everyday I would find myself in front of the register, shaking as I handed my debit card over. I was willingly to try anything to stop, except 12 step programs. I didn't care for the god concept and thought it to be cultist and brain washing. (It never occured to me that perhaps my brain needed a little washing;)

I felt alone. Terminally unique. And 5 years ago today I awoke drunk and tired and full of despair. I was truly a serf to King Alcohol. I was surrendered fully to it and seemingly powerless to change it. 

I can't explain what happened next, but in that surrender came a liberation. After a a very embarrassing interaction at a family event, I felt like I was not only powerless of my drinking, but life was becoming unmanageable. 

I don't know why, but I reached out and asked for help from a close family member who I knew had been sober via a particular 12 step program for over a decade. Despite my prejudices against it, it was the last house on the left for me. I tried everything else I figured I might as well give this a shot too. If it didn't work I could always return to my misery.

I took time from work and sought medical treatment first. I'm glad to have done it because apparently I was in a much more dangerous position medically speaking than I perhaps realized. I then stoight refuge at a 12-step retreat. 

This was not the way I had envisioned rehab. I went to a place called the Plymouth House in Plymouth New Hampshire. I was expecting group therapy massages hikes long talks with a counselor about injuries perceived or real from my childhood that's still haunted me. Instead what I found was a few small cabins in the woods not far away from route 93 and a group of people reading talking and writing from a big blue book. This I would come to learn as being the basic text of the same fellowship my close family member have been living happily and soberly through for many years.

I began a process there which again is hard to explain. it involves self-searching, a leveling of my pride, being of service to others, and a willingness to believe that something greater than myself could and would restore me to sanity if I was willing. I found my lack of belief in a higher power was not a barrier to it. And despite my best efforts, I came to believe up there. I won't try to explain it. And I can't even if I wanted to. My conception of a higher power would tell you a lot more about me than it would about any kind of higher power or force in this universe anyway.

When I came back home I moved into sober living. It's one of the best decisions I ever made. In that time I returned to my relationships my commitments my work and my family. I became a part of a local fellowship and took on jobs in that group to be of service. I became willing to help others and to ask for help. I developed a manner of living which demanded rigorous honesty but which also provided a freedom I hadn't known, maybe ever in my life. My entire outlook and perspective transformed seemingly without any direct effort on my part. I became dependent upon and consciously connected to a fellowship and program that is indescribably joyful.

The Fellowship and program I've discovered has freed me from the obsession to drink alcohol. Sobriety isn't just about physical sobriety. It's about emotional sobriety as well It's about soundness of mind. Whatever higher power there may be in this universe I believe it works through people. I see little miracles every day I see big miracles everyday. I now have the privilege to be of service to others both in my 12-step program and in my family and work life.

Today I am not fragile around booze. Hell, I still have alcohol in my house! It's just that provided I pick up a simple toolkit each day and engage in right action, I'm gifted a daily reprieve from the obsession to drink. It's like sardines. You can eat them around me, I don't care, I am just not interested in eating them myself. 

If you are struggling and feel there is no way out. If you're hiding it the way I hid it and feel like nobody understands. I want you to know you're not alone. Millions of people have gotten and stayed sober. More importantly most of us are happier than we were before! I can promise you I wouldn't still be this 5 years later if this didn't feel better than the alternative.

I thought I would be depriving myself by putting down the drink. Instead I was liberating my life and potential. It's hard to believe if you're stuck in it, but weddings, concerts, parties, and even going out with friends is far more enjoyable and enriching today than it was when I was drinking. What used to take me lots of substances to feel for an hour, is now my baseline in sobriety. 

If you need help or know someone who needs it please reach out. there's lots of us out there in lots of different fellowships. before I tried this I couldn't conceive of going 5 days without a drink let alone 5 years.

I'm about to be 29 and have went 10 long years drinking pretty much everyday. It's been a long road. Lots of run ins with the cops which I was lucky up until about a month ago when I wrecked another car and finally got hit with a dui. I was going back and forth right before the dui on whether to get the vivitrol shot or not because I was so sick of being stuck in the same loop from hell, waking up everyday depressed, anxious, and hungover to the point I felt like I was going to die and frankly apart of me wanted to die. I've only ever made it about 30 days twice in the last 10 years, then I would crack and drink again. So now that I got this dui, which I feel was a blessing in disguise... I took the plunge and got the shot and WOW. I feel like a new person almost. Like a normal person that never really gave a shit about alcohol. It's crazy. Aside from being a little bit bored and having to find things to do I'm not sitting here white knuckling it obsessing about booze and being mad that I can no longer drink. I've had a 12 pack in my fridge since right before the shot and I keep forgetting it is even there and when I do remember, I don't even care about it. When I first started debating the shot my thought process was ""well it's one decision a month, I just have to get there and then I can make it another 30 days."" 
Well my thoughts now are, I look forward to the next one and the next one if it means I feel as free from booze as I do right now. I had little to no side effects. The shot didn't really hurt at all and was quick. I am 6 days sober and have not even counted the days really. It's been a godsend. I just wanted to post this to tell my story and for anyone who was maybe wondering what vivitrol was like and needs additional help to get rid of this poison for good.",9,0

I did a full 7 days alcohol free and it was amazing, then I literally celebrated with alcohol on the 8th day 😐.

I didn't want to say anything to family about it til I was sober at least a month, since I feel like I will feel pressure to have a perfect sobriety once I tell people.

As the title states, quitting drinking has helped my depression tons, but my anxiety can still spike very high.  I'm at about my 3rd day straight of heavy anxiety, and am doing what I can to try and lower it (meditation, walking, prayer, low doses of kratom, and I've recently drastically lowered caffeine intake).

I have had my days of feeling quite calm overall during this sober stretch, but the anxiety/OCD always seems to find a way back in, and it's such a huge threat to my sobriety.  I see stories on this sub of others quitting drinking, and finding that their anxiety has virtually disappeared...I'm so jealous of that!

I've tried psych meds in the past, but unfortunately they either did not help, or the side effects were too much to bear (mania, akathisia, etc).  I *do* have an appointment with an ART (Accelerated Resolution Therapy) specialist next Thursday, and I am eagerly awaiting that.

Has anyone else had to deal with anxiety/borderline panic even after 3 weeks into sobriety?  If so, what did you do to help relieve it?  I know that reducing my caffeine intake is certainly an important step (only day 2 of drastically reduced intake), but I wonder if I need to do more.

On top of that, he drinks an additional 100 plus beers. He regularly starts drinking at 1030 in the morning on any day he’s off. 

As you can see, we both have a problem.  I can stop, I’ve done it before, but he has no interest or intention. We’ve talked about it several times but To no avail. He’s been drinking like this for years now...mine has progressively gotten worse and it’s time to do something about it. 

How do I quit while he keeps on? Can’t really criticize him or I’ll look like a hypocrite, right? I did quit once for like 2 or 3 weeks, started exercising, eating better...he said I was acting like a bitch and I needed to eat carbs. So...not exactly supportive, lol.

As a brief background, my underlying causes to drinking may be ones shared by many of you. The boilerplate mental health issues that make one predisposed to substance abuse. Riddled by insecurities, depression, the desperate need for approval, self-loathing, anxiety, guilt for my past actions, etc. And, of course, the loneliness of pandemic life. I’m 33 years old.

I’m not a writer and in retrospect, this came out as a stream-of-consciousness from what I remember. If the terse sentence structure is obnoxious, well… I’m sorry for that, too.

———

Three months ago I was laid off and with the infinite down time of lockdown, alone in my apartment, I starting drinking more heavily than normal, which eventually culminated to a handle of vodka per day over seven days. I guess I should mention that I'm 6’5’’, 260lbs, and have developed a high tolerance to alcohol from roughly a decade of heavy drinking. So while it's probably a bit heavier than many people, it was what it took.

A few times that week, I would wake up with the handle gone before 8AM, when the first liquor store opens with delivery service. On those days, I spent the time withdrawing and watching the clock like a pot of water to boil, waiting for 8AM. And shortly thereafter, the call would inevitably arrive from the delivery driver at my door with my handle. And I’m okay again.

I would drink until I passed out, wake up, and immediately start drinking again to repeat the cycle. I just wanted to be unconscious. Not dead. Just unconscious. I guess at a certain point, there’s not much of a difference.

I knew something was coming. That my body couldn't sustain that much alcohol indefinitely. I just didn't know what it would be or when. But I felt an odd relief when it did, like that old saying about criminals wanting to be caught. It was over.

———

On the seventh day, I wake up with pain in my back and I know something's wrong. I start puking with nothing to expel. Just retching *nothing* every few minutes.

I call my friend, a physician, who tells me that I have alcohol-induced pancreatitis -- an inflammation of the pancreas. I need to go to the ER immediately. Be honest with them about everything, he tells me. Keep me updated.

It's 6AM and I live in a major city. In the back of my Lyft, it’s still dark outside. But I'm panicking envisioning the COVID-filled waiting room where I'll be waiting, withdrawing, retching for hours before I'm seen. But I walk into a long, empty waiting room with empty chairs lining the walls. The lights aren’t even on. It’s as if the emergency room isn’t open for business yet. Not a single patient waiting. Just dead silence and a single woman down the hall, sitting behind the administration desk. I figure it’s a blessing from who-knows-what.

I explain everything to the administrator and before I can sit down, I’m sent to the back to get my vitals checked. Everything’s elevated. Hypertension 160/100, tachycardia 120 bpm. I'm sent to a room and a nurse asks me questions. How much. For how long. Any blood. Another nurse is working on me. IV in, bag of saline, blood work. It's like an assembly line. The doctor arrives. I talk, she talks, she leaves.

The nurse explains what's going in the IV as she administers it. This is Zofran to help with the nausea. This is Ativan for the withdrawals. The withdrawals stay. This is a second dose of Ativan. The withdrawals start to fade away. Here is the EKG technician. He can’t tell me the results, he just does the test. The pain in my back is worse. Where is it on a scale of ten. An eight?

The doctor comes back with the blood results and reads various numbers associated with acronyms I don't know. But they're all elevated. They're all bad. I'll be admitted to the hospital. No, I don't want to call anyone.

I get transported on the gurney and make small talk with the transporter. He's a Lakers fan. He accidentally takes me five feet through a pair of doors, only to stop abruptly. This is the COVID floor. We turn around and laugh about it. Everyone is so nice. Why is everyone in the hospital so nice?

The next five days are a routine. Bags of fluids going through a machine into my IV. A white one and two yellow ones. Vitals check. Glucose check and insulin. Blood work. Oxycontin every six hours for the pain. It wears off after four. You’ll just have to fight through it. Vitals check. More Zofran for the nausea. More insulin. More bags. Big yellow pills and small white ones. I think the nurse says they're potassium. Blood work. I’m able to urinate a few milliliters. It's dark, like the color of a dark beer.

On the fifth day, I wake up and the pain is gone. The doctor comes in. I have adult-onset diabetes due to pancreatitis. I have to stop drinking.

I see the dietitian who walks me through diabetes. How to check my blood sugar at home. A chart labeling the carbohydrates of various foods. What I can and can no longer eat. Two medications, three times a day. I never thought I'd have diabetes.

The experience is the wake up call I needed. I’ll never drink again. I go home and clean up the mess of the previous week. I go grocery shopping. I start walking 45 minutes per day. I cook every day and check my blood sugar. I have a Zoom appointment with my new endocrinologist who explains more changes I'll need to make. I go to a Zoom AA meeting but it’s not for me. They seem like a group of friends. I opt to buy books on sobriety and start to read them.

Suddenly I'm 45 days sober and everything is going right. I've lost 20 pounds. My glucose is down. My blood pressure has normalized. My heart rate is dropping. I appreciate my Apple watch on a new level. I read an article on ""what happens when you stop drinking"" and I'm happy to see all the positive changes that have already happened in my body. I’ll have blood work done next week to see the progress and I’m legitimately excited to get the results. Everything is going right.

———

I don't remember ordering the first case of wine on Drizly, but suddenly, I'm drinking again. I miss the blood work appointment because why bother? A week or two later and I’ve graduate back to the handle of vodka a day. And five days later, the back pain. Puking with nothing there. And this time, I feel delirious. My mind is jumping from thought to thought every five seconds. It feels like my brain is flipping through channels on a TV trying to find what to watch. I wonder if that's DTs. I call 911 and take an ambulance this time. That fucking God for COBRA.

I'm back in the ER and it's deja vu. Acute pancreatitis. This time, it’s morphine for the pain. No one should ever feel that good. I’m admitted to the hospital and it’s back to the routine. The machine with the bags, big yellow pills and small white ones, blood work, vitals, oxycontin. The same doctor comes in and she remembers me. I was hoping I’d never see you again, I joke, but there's no laugh. Talk about embarrassing. She recommends impatient but I later find out my insurance wont cover it. I didn't want to go anyway.

———

I am now two weeks sober. Again. Experiencing that same, familiar “wake up call” feeling that I’ll never drink again, only this time with the knowledge and vigilance that it wont last. But I don’t think I’ll survive a third relapse either. Maybe three strikes and I’m out.

So that’s the end of my sob story. Now I’m here to try to join and stay active in this community as a resource to help me stay sober.

A cursory investigation on this sub showed me that this is actually quite common with people new to their sober journey. Those eventually became less and less frequent as I turned the corner and made it past a year of sobriety. But last night the dream came back with a twist (Disclaimer: much like that damn movie it gets a little confusing here so apologies)

In my dream, I fell asleep and dreamed that I randomly drank three shots of tequila (I remember the booze and the quantity specifically.) Then I woke from that ""Inception"" dream devastated, but still unsure if it actually happened. So I spent the remainder of my dream trying to figure out if my three shot tequila dream was real or just a dream. Then I woke up from THAT dream and after taking a sec to process what actually happened, I felt that awesome sensation of relief that I used to experience in my early days of sobriety.

I had a lot of headaches and a lot anxiety. Then one night, I had my heart almost bursting and my level of anxiety went higher then ever.

There it goes. For 4 days I drank wine. First day I was sure that I had control. Drank 1 bottle and went to bed.

Turns out, I've ALWAYS been an addict","I certainly haven't had alcohol my entire life, and I definitely wasn't always addicted to it. However, I have always had what I'll be referring to in this post as an ""addict brain"".

What is an addict brain? An addict brain is where your method of coping in life is stuffing your feelings down and telling yourself ""It's okay, I have ________ at home""

When I was a kid, I'd turn to my toys or video games or whatever activity. It would be okay because I had that waiting for me. It could be anything, whatever sounded good, I would promise myself that later on.

Eventually that's what alcohol on the weekend became. Everything bad or stressful could be managed, I would just have to wait for the weekend.

The problem is, (besides the alcohol addiction) so much always rode on the thing I was planning on doing, even before it was alcohol. If, for any reason, I couldn't have the thing I was going to use to cope... I found I couldn't cope well with that. I am extremely emotionally distressed if I can't have my cope. Trying to find an alternative is difficult because I would have my heart set on my cope, nothing else would make everything okay. 

Then whatever negative emotion I dismissed in lieu of my cope would come back in full force. 

Right now, I'm not really sure what to do in regards to learning this about myself. I'm not sure how to fix it. I do think that realizing it and acknowledging it is a step in the right direction.

I went to a grocery store I used to frequent to pick up some taco seasoning and a few other groceries(I was in the area).

 I walked up and down the aisles and grabbed a few things, when I got to the meat section, I set some chicken down in my cart and there was a bottle of my favorite booze.. 

The realization hit me, that out of habit, when I was in the soda aisle I grabbed 2 diet cokes(which I had planned on) and reached to the other side of the aisle and grabbed my booze, something I have probably done hundreds of times in the past, I remember grabbing it and putting it in the cart, I just didn't even think about it till I got to the meat section and looked down and saw it.

I am very into fitness and booze is absolutely killing my progress. It has recently become worse, I went on vacation a couple weeks ago and went on a 5 day drinking binge. Normally I keep it to once a week but a few times a year I break that. Last weekend was a friends going away party, 3 days straight. I wanna be serious about this now.


I am now working 60 hours a week after a period of not working for 3 months. On top of this I exercise 5 days a week. My body NEEDS some some down time or I could injure myself. Now that I am this busy, I cannot be spending my only night off (saturday) drinking, and I can’t be spending Sunday hung over, I need to prepare food for the week, get a haircut some weeks, and run other random errands. If I am hung over because I had 10 beers, 5+ shots, and a couple gin and tonics Saturday night I am going to completely fuck my entire week up.


So I devised a plan. This coming Saturday I am going directly from work to my parents to do some laundry. My parents might be drunk, however I won’t drink, I never drink and drive and I hate being drunk around my parents anyways, I can’t be myself and just get bitched at the entire time. Normally at this time I’d be at the bar by my house. 


The following Saturday after work, I’m driving to my friends house out of town. If I don’t have to work Saturday he’s coming to me. Regardless it’s somebody I don’t care to drink with and make an effort not too when I see them because he is a weirdo.


Please give me some ideas on what I can be doing Saturday night instead of drinking. If I knew some decent women maybe I could keep myself busy but the only way I meet people is at the bar so that’s a no go. I want to be dry until my birthday in may, and from their until the 4th of July. Not only do I need to get in better shape, but I’m gonna need to move and get a new car in coming months and need to save money.",5,0

On motorcycle gear....,"I had never truly reflected on just how much I was spending on booze. A quick estimate put it at between £200 and £300 every month. 

That. Is. Madness.

After two and a bit months racked up now, my new found savings were burning a hole in my pocket. Combine that with the fact that life will be (hopefully!) returning to normal soon and I'll need to go back to the office, I decided the most logical thing to do was to learn how to ride a motorcycle.

I would never have considered this before. Driving a car hungover is dangerous, but riding a motorcycle hungover is a death sentence. There would literally be no time for me to ride as I'd be hungover, or if I had a day off to spare I'd be drinking.

The idea of buying a bike made me extremely excited and happy. Not because of the bike itself, but because it feels like I'm free of the burden alcohol placed on me. Three months ago I was hating myself for realising I was putting on shoes to go buy booze without consciously thinking about it, realising what I was doing, _then going anyway._ 

I'm not going to look like Sandy from Grease, as I still have a beer belly to lose and I have a beard, but I'll look a hell of a lot cooler than passed out on the sofa with remnants of dinner spilt down myself.

Bit of an excited rant, but I'm feeling super positive and wanted to get this feeling down to reflect on if I ever need to in the future.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Friday/Saturday! 

Hoo, it’s felt like a loooong week! It’s been a pleasure hosting so far, but I’m pretty burnt out with work, too, so I’m definitely looking forward to the weekend to rest.

Yesterday, we talked about virtuous and vicious cycles. Sounds like many of us—definitely myself included—have experienced some vicious cycles that we’re now working on interrupting or even reversing while no longer drinking.

It’s amazing how many ripple effects can occur in our lives after little (or big!) shifts. It’s also pretty incredibly how it changes our brain, too. It wasn’t until the 1960s (I think!) that scientists discovered that adult brains also have neuroplasticity, not just children’s.

That means that our brains continue to grow, adapt, heal, and change well beyond the young ages people previously thought. Turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks after all! 

No matter how early or late in life we choose to interrupt vicious cycles, plant seeds for virtuous ones, or just learn something new or make little changes here and there, there’s still hope for them to take root. And we are worthy of that nurturing! 

What’s something you’d like to learn or nurture in your life? 

May you trust that you and your brain are adaptable and agile. May you feel inspired and creative :)

He more feels like he deserves it, drinks for reward, that type thing. I mostly drink to numb pain and escape. I have had my 'happy times' drinking plenty as well, but I lived with daily tension headaches for a few years that nothing else would touch and that was when my dependency really kicked in.

I have moderate recurring major depression disorder, and I have it since I was 16, but I only got diagnosed by a professional a month and a half ago.
At first, I dealt with my depressive episodes by smoking as much pot as I could, everyday.  I was heavily addicted.  I then started taking benzodiazepines to supplement.  I did this to numb my emotions about my highschool girlfriend cheating on me and lying.  I did this to numb my mind, which tells me that I’m a piece of shit that deserves nothing.  I realized that I had substance issues and quit both.  I didn’t realize the effects that they played on my mental health until now, I just played it off as “I like to party, and the people I’m around are partying with me, so it must be okay”.  

I then fell prey to alcohol.  In the past year I have been stuck in this insane self destructive cycle of be depressed-drink-be more depressed-drink more.  I’m trying to break out of this, but I have been thinking- what came first, the chicken or the egg?  Am I depressed because of substance abuse, or do I abuse substances because I’m depressed? They started around the same time, and when I’ve had sober stretches, including now, I am not magically cured of mental illness.

I know I can improve my mental health by not drinking, but I can’t wipe the slate clean.  I was just wondering if anyone has any insight or wants to share their thoughts.

Sobriety has changed my life in many amazing ways. I am definitely much happier now, and I am certain that my life is better without alcohol.

That said, I seriously cannot stop living in the past and feeling guilty over shit I did and said. This extends beyond drunk memories, and dates as far back as childhood. Sometimes I feel suicidal over some of the memories. I know in my heart people can be redeemed, and that we can change, but daily I seem to have a zero tolerance policy for myself. I can’t live this way anymore. If a saw a transcription of my thoughts to myself it would be the meanest shit ever written, and it’s just background noise to me. 

Sobriety allowed me to feel the full spectrum of my emotions, but I live alone and work from home, so it’s almost a burden sometimes. I feel like a terrible person. I expect bad things to happen to me because of the bad person I was in my past.

Always telling me to go away when I wanted to learn your card games.

Making fun of me for being emotional. 

Telling everyone that you introduced me to that I was shy and suffered from depression.

Being openly proud to have a gay friend (making a huge deal about it before you introduced me to her) when I was in middle school but telling me to my face that I'm not gay when I tried to come out to you several years later.

Leaving me in the care of your perverted brother that would talk about my ""tight"" vagina and couldn't wait to see what kind of tits I'd have when I went through puberty. (And fuck you, Uncle D for telling me that the only thing men would ever want from me is good head and something to fuck and that I should get on birth control before I got my period, *just in-case*).

Making me spend time with your pedophile brother after you told me what he did to you as a kid, even though I was grown. It still was gross. (Fuck you, Uncle P for molesting my mother)

Telling me I was lucky to have a dad that didn't make fun of the body type I have like your dad did to you.

Making everything about money and sex. 

Telling me to stay with my abusive husband because marriage is a promise and we had kids.

Emotionally manipulating me.

Not admitting to your mistakes, there's always an excuse.

Over-stepping my boundaries all of the fucking time.

Barging in my room and yelling at me instead of saying, ""Good morning"" or maybe gently waking me, especially as an adult! (This one really squishes my tots, Gawd!)

For remodeling your house during Covid last summer when I was in tears every day while working for the Home Depot. 

For putting me on medication at a young age and then encouraging it still, even after I overdosed in my early twenties. It took me years to get off of that shit and it's still your number one recommendation when I'm going through a depressive episode. I've been telling you for decades how much I hate meds and that I can't take them responsibly. I'm an addict, yes I drank all of your Rx cough syrup in 2 days, no I'm not sorry. Oh? I should go get more Valium from the doc? Sure. Why the fuck not?? Oh! They cut me off!

For laughing at me for having a panic attack as a result of my first period. I didn't even want to be a fucking girl! 

For talking shit about everyone as soon as they left the room, like for my entire life, even now. 

For bragging about your perfect relationship when really you just kept your arguments private. 

For giving me every materialistic thing I ever wanted.

For telling me how your dad died with a drink in his hand and still couldn't see that I was abusing drugs and alcohol before I was out of high school and saying, ""Oh, just do it at home so you don't hurt anyone.""

For encouraging me to find a husband and have kids instead of finding myself. 

I was lost, depressed, addicted, and a total fucking mess and you thought I needed a boyfriend. Fuck. You. And fuck me for listening to all of your bullshit.

I’m extremely grateful that I’ve made it this long, and will continue to be sober. It feels like an accomplishment and I’m proud of it. This subreddit has definitely helped. 

Today I have had some cravings I’ve had to fight off. That old self sabateur was talking to me saying the usual “you’ve gone so long, you deserve to have a few drinks and enjoy yourself. You can do better now and control it.” Which just isn’t true, I am a binge drinker. There is something about going to drink and feeling care free for those few hours. But then everything you were not caring about comes crashing back the next morning even harder. Along with a hang over and money gone that you shouldn’t have spent. 

My wife went to Vegas today for the weekend. I stayed home. She is very supportive of me not drinking, especially since my binge drinking was once one of the biggest problems in our marriage. She is very happy I’m not drinking now. She wishes I could be there to spend the time with her having fun, but we both know I would drink if I went to Vegas. At the end of this weekend I will be glad I stayed home and stayed sober, I know it. 

In all honestly I’d rather be at home bored, sober and happy, even if it means missing a fun weekend in Vegas. That weekend would start out fun, then end in REALLY bad hangovers and lots of money spent, also some arguments for sure. Then regrets.

I haven't ever been on any medication for either of those things, even before I got sober, though I did use alcohol to self-medicate a lot of those symptoms.

I have been thinking about trying anti-depressants to see if they can help. My sister has really been pushing the idea and a lot of things have happened these past 2 months to the point I honestly kind of think she is right.

Bear with me, if I get long-winded. 

For pretty much the entire decade of my 20s, I was a weekend warrior binge drinker. I could go from Sunday morning to Friday afternoon without even the slightest desire to drink, but every Friday evening I found myself drinking in some volume or the other. As I got into my late 20s, I realized how truly awful I felt after a Friday or Saturday night of drinking, although not in the physical sense, but rather the psychological aspects of a hangover; the anxiety, the pit of despair that I felt every time I woke up and realized that I couldn’t piece together the night before with total cohesion or recall. It got progressively worse at 29 years old, with even just a six pack of beer causing those symptoms the next morning. 

In mid-February, I took a sort of inventory of where I was at in life. I turned 30 on Thanksgiving Day, I am currently in graduate school at a Big Ten university, have great friends & family, but I realized that my alcohol consumption on the weekends was beginning to hurt those aspects of my life and I realized that I was depressed and that no matter how well I ate during the week and how many weights I lifted, I couldn’t lose any weight. 

I decided on February 20th that I was going to quit drinking for awhile, figuring that seeing how that was couldn’t hurt. I’m amazed at how much better I felt within the first 7-10 days, but now that euphoria that I felt has subsided to just being content with things. Content and actually energetic on saturdays and motivated on sundays to read 20+ page research papers and type research papers of my own. 

The biggest thing I’ve realized in the past 19 days is that I needed to actually grapple with my emotions and try to process them correctly. It sounds absurd, but when I took an inventory of my life, I realized that the period of my 20s (2018) where I was happiest coincided not only with dating the most amazing woman I had ever dated up to that point, but also with a period of time that year where I wasn’t binge drinking every weekend. I always attributed the happiness in my life at that time for other reasons, but now I’m realizing that not binge drinking in that time frame probably had a lot to do with it as well.

I’m 19 days in and content with where I’m at so far, but I’m under no pretenses that I have it all figured out. I’m just gonna embrace the journey, be self-reflective, and continue to learn the skills of living a sober life.",5,0

What AA is is all spelled out on the wall and frequently read. It is not a bait and switch.

I have ben a member of AA for a long time.  I doubt if many had a first meeting as uninviting as I did but I was sick of my life and at least I saw some people saying they used to be like me and weren't any more. It kept me coming back.  When I started to look how their thinking worked instead of what the great ""I"" thought of it, pieces started to fit.

AA spells out and this group proves daily that alcoholism is a three fold problem. Drinking even a small amount of alcohol  starts a compulsion that changes whatever  priorities I had to continuing to drink.  You all seem to agree on that. But that would only be a once in a lifetime problem.  Some learn that lesson and simply swear off and just don't drink ever again.  I've run across a few like that. It works for them because they don't have the other two symptoms.  A feeling of being restless iratable and discontent with a belief that drinking will solve it and a second symptom, denial,  an ingrained belief that I will get different results from repeating behavior. Not only with drinking but with not dealing with the knawing feeling that demands relief. Until I used AA's program of recovery to dump that crap, all I had was last minute, white knuckles to try not to drink. In other words mysery. The mystery that I am reminded of here every day. I learned that I am not only powerless to stop with one drink,  I am powerless over that knawing feeling until I got help finding out how to dump it once and for all.  Really scary stuff to do to fix it. WORDS.  Listen to some, read some, say some, write some. In enough secrecy that I don't give damn as long as it gets that gorilla off my back.

Something happened to me last night that I wanted to share. I suffer from anxiety dreams. My most typical one is finding myself at school and there’s a test I haven’t studied for. I’m sure you’ve all had this dream. It’s awful. But I also have other anxiety dreams, mostly relating to my job. 

I’m a chef. Typical anxiety dreams for me include: I’ve lost a ticket for a table and the food needs to go out immediately. Or a table returns a burnt steak and I keep burning it over and over. Or someone orders a creme brulee but my creme brulees never set in the oven. Always wake up super anxious and panicky from these.

Something different happened last night. Had a dream that someone hired me to cater a party for them. When I got to their home, I realized I forgot to buy all the food. I’ve had this dream before and this part is followed by me rushing to the supermarket but something prevents me from getting there. Usually traffic or something else I need to do. Meanwhile, the party is starting and there is NO food. I never make it, and I wake up panicked and stressed. 

But in my dream last night, I saw the traffic ahead and I just... took a different route. In the dream I recognized the problem, and what I needed to do to fix it. Without panicking. Made it to the supermarket, went back to the party, cooked all the food and everything was perfect. The client was happy and I woke up feeling very content and relaxed.

I’m a year sober today and only 23. I stopped drinking my senior year of college because it was damaging my relationship with my family. My father was an alcoholic and I could feel myself feeling the “need” to drink to cope with my emotions. I was living for the weekend and nothing in between. 

Needless to say, it was completely normalized at my school to black out on the weekends and my housemates had an endless supply of booze constantly in the house. Their solution to any type of problem was to drink the pain away. Until the night I came home from class and found one of them lying unresponsive on the floor. I called an ambulance to find out she had a blood alcohol level nearly 7 times the legal limit. The paramedics said if I didn’t find her when I did, she would’ve slipped past the point of no return. 

I made a change that day. I promised myself I would never let anyone find me in that state. I will attest to the truth that I was groomed into having a higher tolerance by my sorority sisters who would pour shots down my throat on the weekend and leave a glass of wine on my desk if I had a rough day. At the time, I used to think of them as my closest confidants and allies at the school. When I announced my sobriety, that all changed. 

Half of them stopped talking to me entirely after a few weeks. Men would still try to hand me drinks even after I refused. I was called a “stuck up bitch” more times than I can even count, by people I had never even spoken to. I became lost and depressed, confused and angry. All the emotions that I had once used alcohol to avoid came crashing down on me harder than they ever had before. I was always warned about the dangers for women you DO drink at college— nobody told me how hostile people can be when you make a different life choice. 

I’m in grad school now and have rebuilt my friend group with only people that truly love and support me. But that time was absolutely miserable. So to anyone who is struggling with the social side effects of sobriety, please know that this is safe place to discuss them and heal.",25,0

I stumbled on this sub just now following my first psychotherapy appointment in over a year. Long story short, I suffer greatly with depression and anxiety stemming from several issues. I am on medication but have been struggling and feeling few positive effects from the medication . Anyway, during today's appointment, I admitted to sometimes consuming a half bottle of whiskey at night. Sometimes it's once a week, sometimes twice, but sometimes I can go weeks without drinking. Like I don't have this craving that I associate with alcoholics/drug addicts. Do I have a problem? I mean  between all the memes about drinking, people talking about drinking all the time, the person who drinks a bottle of wine nightly, I'm really not sure what makes someone an alcoholic anymore.

First a bit of backstory. I had my last drink Friday. Dropped a bottle of vodka in the 2 hours between when I was supposed to be in class, and when I had to go see my folks. I’m 33, live on my own, except the weeks I have my daughter (50/50 split), and I’m a full time student. 
So I do the whole bit, start going back to AA meetings online (actually I had been in one right before I went and bought the bottle…), set it up so I can stay with my folks For the weekend (that was going to happen anyway) and stay with my gf as much as possible. 
I didn’t tell her I’d drank, just that I needed help with sobriety. 
Well today I’m home alone. I realize I’ve got a craving so I set out to go on a walk. I take a backpack so I can go to the thrift store. Get my girlfriend a mug for my place. And for a minute I genuinely forget I’m an addict.  I get to the thrift store five minutes after they’ve closed, so I walk just a little bit further up the street to the local veterinarians office and I sit down and play some Pokémon GO. I’ve been playing video games more to keep from drinking. It mostly works. 
I get up and keep on my walk and suddenly realize that I’m going perilously close to the ABC store… I figure I’ll make a turn early, walk behind the buildings, and come back the same way because my feet aren’t hurting, and I love walks. But they’ve changed the parking lot since last I’ve walked here, and I end up right In front of the ABC store. I pause. Oh hell no, and walk past. I stop at the end of the strip, turn around, and go straight to the vodka. My feet know the way, and it’s almost as if I’m being pulled along, like a cartoon character following the smell of a lovey pie, fitting, as I’m a joke, or a fish hooked on a line, fitting because this will kill me. 
I grab the bottle and bee line for the register when finally I realize that I CAN STOP. And I do. 
I almost hand the bottle to the lady, to tell her to put it away, but I do it myself, muttering about saving money and get the hell out. My face must  have been redder than my hair under the mask. 

I walk home quickly. Detour through the 7-11, but make a quick loop before I can grab any wine, and I’m out.
I’m back home now, and I’d love to say this is a win, I’d love to say that IWNDWYT or what ever in-lingo thing we say, but I’m not so sure. 
I’ve made it to 4 years sober before this damn Covid thing. I know what it feels like to not have these fucking physical compulsions. 
I know how fucking close to the sun I just flew, and I’m not sure what I can do about it. 
I can’t wait to go to in person meetings again. 
I didn’t need them last time until I couldn’t go. Just a tune up every now and again. 

But now, oh God now.

**How it started?**

Social gatherings have always given me anxiety. When I went to college, I started drinking to fit in and to ease my anxiety in group settings. I started with beer and then moved onto liquor. My group of friends tended to drink a lot and it was an unspoken challenge on who could drink the most. This is where my unhealthy relationship with alcohol started. 

**How it went?**

I didn't drink that often immediately after college. However, when I did drink, I fell right back into those ""college days"". Over the course of a decade, I slowly started to drink more frequently: 2-4/month--->1/week--->2/week--->3-4/week. Once I started drinking several times a week, each day was 15+ light beers. I pretty much stayed on beer and the occasional margarita with Mexican food  because that won't make me an alcoholic right? Wrong. Boredom, depression, and unaddressed life problems drove me to drink. Concerts, sporting events, watching TV shows, and dining out all became dominated by beer. Once I started, I was drinking until I passed out. 

I got a DUI and had some super embarrassing events. Luckily, I never had that ""rock bottom"" moment. By that I mean, drinking didn't drastically affect my relationships or professional career. I'm sure some of my transgressions might have been rock bottom for some (and should have been for me). Before I quit, no one outside of my spouse knew how much I drank. I'm sure some were suspicious.  I wasn't hiding drinks, but I was hiding my drinking. I took steps to mask it. Controlling intake in public (most of the time), exercising quite frequently, eating healthy, and going to bed early on workdays (if I drank). This also helped me lie to myself.   

There were a lot of red flags for my problem, but the ones that really hit home were...

* Being annoyed at a public function because I wanted to go home and get after it while sitting mindlessly in front of the TV
* Drinking 15 beers on a weeknight and functioning at work the next day (in a state of fog). 
* Realizing that night sweats, insomnia, and a few other health related issues aren't just randomly happening....it's the booze. This took me years to fully comprehend. 
* Tracking my daily drinking for a few years and seeing that I drank at 40-50% clip for many of those months.

**How it's going?**

It has been 68 days since I drank last. The first few weekends were **very** hard. The cravings have definitely subsided some. However, I do still have them from time to time. Sleeping has returned to normal. I still feel like I have a slight fog going on, but that could be my imagination. The anxiety is still here and I'm trying to manage it. Why did I do X when I was drinking? What did I permanently do to my body? If I didn't waste that time where would I be? All these are met with an internal FUCK!

Why (and how) I finally stopped? 

* Reading this sub. Thank you to everyone that participates. You've done more than you know.
* Playing the tape forward
* Slowing my drinking down (frequency, not volume) and taking small steps (i.e. not drinking over Thanksgiving) towards the goal. This help prove to myself it was possible.
* Finally accepting that some of the problems that led me to drinking aren't going away unless I stop. They couldn't be handled in my current state. Work, relationships, mental health, etc.
* Realizing how vapid I'd become. Everything revolved around drinking. All my favorite activities were either consumed with alcohol or dropped because of it. I've since regained some old hobbies and it feels great.
* Desiring more for myself. I always prided myself on self improvement and hard work, but all that crashed as a result of my drinking. 
* Finally, and *truly*, living a healthy lifestyle

Hi there,

My name's Logan, and I've been sober for just under 450 days. It's been a wild, bumpy, roller coaster of a ride. I've reached lower lows than I had reached when using. I've also been able to, for one of the first times in my life, look in the mirror and be proud of myself. It's been 450 days of self discovery, and most importantly starting the process of healing what I have neglected for so long. I still have a long way to go, but I thought that I'd share some of what I've learned, if you're willing to listen.

I see a lot of posts here about people just starting their journey, and those writing the regretful posts of their relapse. You see it over and over again, a kind of excitement about life without drugs weighing them down, then shame and defeat when they give in to what their body and mind wants. It's a cycle, and believe me; many of the people who have been sober for any extended period of time had relapsed at some point along their journey. It's almost inevitable.

The thing is, many people use for many different reasons. Most of the reasons stem from their childhood. Their dad was an abusive drunk, their mom never cared for them, they were bullied as a child, the list goes on. A lot of people, myself included, run to drugs to cope with these problems. Sadly, many addicts are broken in one way or another. That doesn't make us bad, it doesn't make us not deserve as much as someone else, it's just what it is.

I think that what a lot of people on this sub are forgetting, something that I’ve had to learn, is that sobriety is not only about getting clean. It's about healing the things that are ""broken"". It's about loving the neglected child, patching the hole in your chest from the loss of a loved one. It's about finding a love for yourself that had not been there before. It's about being able to sit with yourself at night; totally, 100%, with yourself.

To be frank, getting clean is fucking hard. It's not easy. Nobody has ever said that it was easy (at least I hope not, lol). After I got clean, and the waves of withdrawal had passed, I shit you not I went through an actual grieving process. Denial, anger, bargaining, the whole shebang. It felt like I had lost a loved one. Someone I leaned on for support, someone I went to with my problems, just gone one day, and I was the one who forced it out of my life. I had spent my teenage years running away from problems, and then suddenly I took, what I thought would be the only support system that would stick with me for life, away from myself. It was almost comedic really, forcing myself to deal with the world when all I ever wanted was to run away from it.

A therapist once told me; ""When you walk around with your eyes open, you tend to get more sand in them""

That is the opposite of what addicts do. We walk around with our eyes closed. Something bad happening? Fuck that, numb me the fuck up. Get me as far as mentally possible away from that problem. I don't want to deal with that problem, so I'll shove it as far down as possible until I start forgetting about it. 

Inherently, sobriety is the opposite of that. It's about finding the strength and courage to handle our problems. To walk through our life in a present manner. In my mind, that's the hardest thing I've had to face. Being present.

I wish all of you luck on your journey. Remember to not be too hard on yourself, but never stop trying. Find a reason to get sober, and hold on to it. Never, ever, forget why you got sober in the first place. Write it down if you need to. Just never forget. If, and when, you get to the point where you question why you got sober in the first place, read what you wrote down over and over again until you start to believe it again. If you fall, get back up and try again. 

Sending my best wishes to everyone who’s had to deal with this disease.

I was so scared of serious withdrawals which is why I wasn’t brave enough to stop, and now I’m almost mad at myself for stopping sooner if this was going to be my body’s reaction. Oh, well. Better late than never. 

I’m trying not to get bogged down on the intense feelings of not drinking, but instead casually focus on how chill I feel sober. I want a better future for myself. I like not driving to the liquor store every few days to end up pitied by the cashiers. I’ve made very rational decisions regarding my financial future, and have started taking vitamins on the regular. Ive been looking into therapists and other support groups so I’m not alone. And I’ve even looked into grad school options for the first time in two years. 

Idk, maybe I’m being naive. But I’m casually hopeful and glad to be back here where I am, yet again, taking sobriety seriously.

I started my journey almost a year ago (March 23rd will be my one year point.) Personally I don't like to count days other than feeling that I eventually would get to a year.

I had to stop, I was entirely self destructing and really didn't care whether I lived or died. I had given up all hope and mostly just wanted everything to end. My girlfriend was really the only person who was concerned with my well being. She is the only glimmer of hope I've had this entire time. 

My mother didn't really get that I wanted to and needed to do this and I had to force her to bring me to treatment. My father is pretty much useless when it comes to actually giving love and support. My brother is stuck still drinking while I try to work up the courage to talk to him and give him my support when I feel ready to help if he accepts it. My grandparents are not privy to my problem, they only know that I stopped drinking. My mother made me hide that fact to save appearances. 

I gave up on my masters, and am only now trying to get it finished. Currently unemployed largely due to covid, but also because I don't have my masters or the self confidence. I feel like more of a failure now than I ever did when I was drinking, probably because I was avoiding feeling much of anything when I was. 

My anxiety and depression which have been with me my entire life are still very present at all times. Contributing to my fear of covid and my fear of getting anybody else sick. 

I've received very few encouraging words from anyone other than my best friend (who I haven't been able to see for almost this whole shit show of a year)  and my girlfriend.

Largely I don't feel like I've accomplished anything by getting sober even though I know it has made my life objectively (and significantly) better. I feel frozen because of the situation the US is in and I feel like I can't escape my own mind. 

I still won't pick up alcohol. I know I could make all of these feelings disappear if I did, but I can't let myself down like that. I don't find not drinking difficult, but I also haven't been exposed to difficult situations for quite a long time. I almost miss my lackadaisical attitude drinking gave me because it got rid of the anxiety I've always had, but it also brought me to be the horribly anxious person I am now. 

I feel like I am simply existing, frozen by the fact that I am completely lost right now. I don't know how to reclaim that feeling of passion I had during my time at school. 

Hopefully work brings that back in the eventuality of finding a job.

I wish all of you the best in this journey we share.

Okay, that was a hit to my heart and my ego. 
Right when it happened, my first thought was “I need to drink” it was the strongest compulsion. I didn’t give in, but honestly I’m still fighting it.

I am almost 5 weeks sober and 5 years clean.  Does anyone have experience with Antabuse (disulfarim)?  When I decided to quit alcohol(and cigarettes on the same day because why not I only smoked when I drank or was severely pissed off) I of course wanted to quit as hard as I can, so I researched drugs to help me quit and was pleased with what I read about Antabuse, which seemed like Chantix for alcohol.  I was prescribed 500mg/day for a few months.  I realize this is not normal, and 500mg is not a maintenance dosage (250mg).  The first 4 weeks of my sobriety lacked the “energy” and “feeling good” that I hear so much about.  I also noticed my sex drive is gone.  Those are the last two side effects I want to experience, considering I am a married man in a healthy marriage with a physical job.  I read those effects can be from not drinking anymore, but decided to try not using the Antabuse.  All those things came back.  The Antabuse was nice because I knew whatever situation I would be in I physically could not drink so I did not worry.  Alcohol can quickly destroy your marriage or job, but a nonexistent sex drive can slowly destroy a marriage, and a lack of energy can slowly destroy employment.

Like a daily calendar of a few things I did that day. Organize a list of all the jobs I've had. And when I've been to therapists and what we talked about. 

Today I was going through some shit on my computer, came upon some therapy notes, and decided to make kind of an overview without all the detail about when I had been to therapy.

Over two decades I've been to five different therapists, totaling about 2.5 years in and many years not seeing anyone. Three of those times I sought therapy mostly because I'm very smart and capable but not motivated and wanted to fix that. Once was couples while in a relationship. Once was because I was so depressed that the entire world literally (and I mean literally as in actually really) looked dark to me. 

Looking back: I think only one of those therapists asked about alcohol use. I don't remember bringing up alcohol with any of them on my own. It's pretty obvious to me from where I sit today that alcohol, my drinking it, was deeply involved in all of those problems.

Drinking wasn't the only problem but I'm sure it played a very large role in them. 

I wonder if the therapists had brought it up whether I would have rejected the idea. Maybe after I'd heard it from multiple people it would have sunk in. Maybe it wouldn't have done any good at all unless the notion came from me.

Got Librium 25mg x 2, folic acid, B1 and a fluid IV. The nurses and doctors were so supportive and kind even though they were so busy. 


Symptoms were pretty typical: extremely anxious and dehydrated, depressed, slight tremors, and (I'd assume) vitamin deficiencies. I had neuropathy from my chest down to my lower legs, which, from what my doctor told me, was not uncommon for long term , heavy drinkers.

After I was cleared to leave, the doctor offered a Librium prescription. 

I let her know I had Valium prescriptions at home I could use to try to taper down, which, combined with my baseline anxiety which I had even before I relapsed and started drinking (and never used), she agreed.  

I've been trying to use as little as possible, but I feel like I'm still in the throes of alcohol withdrawal, taking as many as 6 10mg tablets daily whilst getting minimal anxiety relief.  I've taken Xanax and Valium in the past at much smaller doses that have had significantly more effective anxiolytic effects than what the current doses I'm taking now.

I'm trying to taper down to 4 tablets daily today and tomorrow, as well as L-Theanine and several other vitamins that I'm certainly deficient in that might be  affecting this lingering anxiety.

I apologize for the rant.  If anyone has suggestions for vitamins (liquid form preferably since I can't really swallow big pills) that have helped you return to normalcy during the first week(s), I'd greatly appreciate it, as I'd love to prevent a Valium dependency to form as I'm recovering.

I tried setting up an appointment with my PCP,  but I won't be able to see them until next month, so I might go to urgent care and see if they may be able to help in some way.

FOR THE GOOD NEWS: 
I haven't vomited at all since the visit.  
The neuropathy is 90% better, but my legs feel really weak. 
I've eaten more this week than I probably have in a month. 
I cleaned out my room full of beer cans and battles...all 10+ bags. 
Walking up the stairs to my third floor apartment don't make me pause for breath every few steps. 
I did my laundry for the first time in a month. 
The weird pains and aches I've been having have improved markedly (although that could be the Diazepam).

Also, I've been drinking a ton of water (2 liters a day approximately), but my urine still seems dark yellow/orange colored...?

Anyway, sorry for the rant.  Fuck alcohol.

I am 42 days sober and I'm a college student in my late 20's. I recently started up school again after a year of drunken debauchery, and I'm noticing a change in my memory; specifically, my recall and retention. Before I turned 21 (and even a few years afterward) I had excellent recall and retention, and was able to study over the course of a few hours and ace my exams with little to no effort.

Now, when I do my assigned readings for class and am taking notes, it's like the information I'm trying to learn goes in one ear and right out the other, and this has significantly hindered me during exams and I have never struggled like this before in school. I may hold onto some of the information that I've learned, but not for long.

Are memory issues common for an alcoholic? Does it ever get better, or have I permanently ruined my brain?",6,0

I started thinking ""This really isn't a big deal, I'm sure I'm OK to pick up a six pack on the weekend to go with some pizza or something"". My mind was convinced, but then I went back and read my original post (only a few days ago) to remind myself how I felt.

I am glad AA exists and I love to hear how people have benefited from it. 

Several years ago I was trying a last ditch effort to save my marriage and I went to a few AA meetings. The first 2 or 3 were energizing, but then I realized it just wasn't the right place for me. I felt like AA was a place for people that couldn't stop drinking without AA, was focused on God, and that the message was you can't stop drinking without AA. Again, these are not *bad* things, just not the right mix for me. 

Recently I found out an old friend had quit drinking 5 years ago and I messaged her, talking about sobriety. She is in AA and it's going great and I am happy for her. I let her know that I did not enjoy AA previously. She offered to connect me to some men who I might be interested in hanging out with, and I was very interested in expanding my circle. This is where it goes sour. It was conditional. She asked if I could go to a couple of meetings a week, and I politely said again that I did not enjoy AA. She pushed for me to go, hinting that I would fail without AA. I had 9 months of sobriety in 2019, so I have a little bit of success without AA, not that it matters, but I didn't remind her of that. I told her that I tried to be honest about how I felt about AA and that if these men only want to hang out with AA members that is just fine. She pushed for it again, asking if I would as least be sponsored, and now I really don't even want to connect with these guys because I'm confident they will treat me the same. I was excited to expand my circle of friends with like-minded people, but I was so discouraged after our conversation. 

Sobriety can be lonely, and this experience with conditional potential friendship was not helpful. If you are in AA, I am happy for you, and I hope that you will not treat people in a way that makes them feel inferior or less than acceptable if they do not want to be a part of AA. 

And to end with a positive note, I am so proud of all of you for doing this hard thing. The world wants us to drink, all the time. And we are all choosing to live a better life!",39,0

I don't want to make assumptions about people but...if that's your medical situation...drinking ain't it right now for you.

I feel better knowing that the liquor store isn't my obligatory check in point to hell anymore. I was that guy, I went in and they knew. They'd just walk to the pint of Vodka without me saying anything. Looking back, to be that regular with an establishment that has so many customers is embarrassing and scary.

I will say I'm not impervious to waking up tired sober, but I, in 70 days, have not once woken up with the same level of lethargy I did when drinking. It's not easy to stay up past my bed time. I listen to my body now. Fast food and stuff, as good as it tastes, makes me feel like garbage...so I just don't eat it. The feeling isn't worth the taste.

It's all falling into place. Growing up isn't necessarily fun...but there's still an appeal to it that is interesting enough to keep the ball rolling.

I was hiding it from my fiance, who is completely oblivious when i drink. We regularly drink tea, so would make him some dark herbal tea whilst i would have a sneaky mug of red wine. Our lounge is low lit during evenings so its hard to tell 1 dark liquid from the other.

2 weeks ago i brewed some earl grey tea which we drink with milk. I poured the tea, poured the wine, then on autopilot added milk to both and bought them to the lounge before realising my error.

I can assure you, red wine with milk will never be the newest flavour sensation, but i wasnt going to waste it. As i finished the last swig of slighty curdling pink concoction, i realised how completely ridiculous was this chain of events and the absurdity of my behaviour. 

10 days clear now. No major withdrawl symptons apart from a week of cravings, so its probably the easier cold turkey ive ever done, and i glad i caught the problem relatively early this time.

First of all I want to give everyone on here huge compliments. I've been lurking around here since I've stopped drinking and all your stories have motivated me and moved me to keep going.

I am currently worrying how to move on. I don't know if I want to quit totally, control my drinking or fall back in my drinking past. To start the story. I always quit drinking for a month on my birthday, which is the 2nd of january. I keep that going for a month. To stay sane, to show myself I have the willpower and I don't need the alcohol to have a good time. But usually after a month things go back to normal. This year, because of the lockdown we challenged eachother not to drink until the pubs reopen. From the 5 friends who were in, 2 are left. Me being one of the 2. With the news that pubs might reopen the 31th of march my worrying began.

I am 27 and have a huge group of friends who all live close to me. All of them are drinkers, some heavy, some occasionally. I am in the middle. I don't drink often. Mostly one time a week, sometimes two, but I do drink 8-15 depending on the night. I am a binge drinker. Problem is I don't get drunk easy and I don't have huge hangovers. I only drink regulars beers so the calories rack up too. I've been overweight since my 18th and since I've stopped drinking on the 2nd of january and went to a nutrition specialist on the 8th of january I've dropped 9kgs (19.8lbs)

As I said with the pubs reopening soon I am currently worrying how to move on. I've dropped massive weight, feel more energized as ever and really don't miss my weekly beer. On the other hand drinking a beer with my friends has always been my cooldown after a rough week at school or work. I don't know if I can control drinking just a couple of beers because usually our nights are quite long.

I can safely say that i have spent the last 15 years of my life as a very heavy drinker,  a binge drinker. An alcoholic.  After those first couple of sips, that feeling kicks in, that tingling in my spine, it's on. There's no tomorrow, I'm alive right now and that is all I care about. Drinking right now. Except for no, it's fake, it's not real, and I can hardly even remember it when I wake up. 

I found this community about 2 years ago and it has helped immensely in finding some perspective in all this mess. I never requested a badge before today and it holds even more weight for me than I imagined it would. I'm doing this because I've given enough of my life to alcohol. I've exhausted it, there's nothing new to be found in it, nothing positive anyway.  Eight days ago I went to have a picnic lunch with some friends, with wine of course, and we ended up drinking for 15 hours straight. No one batted an eye about it.  Just a completely normal thing to do. And I guess, in a sense, for us it was. No one was sick, no crazy stories to tell the next day, just a normal everyday binge that sent me into a dark world of anxiety and self-loathing in the days that followed. 

I'm just so tired of it. I feel defeated everytime I wake up with a hangover, a shell of a person. Just going through the motions until the next drink. This is not living life to the fullest. This is drinking yourself to oblivion to forget, to avoid, to pretend. It feels empty, I feel empty. I'm ready to join the living again.

Fuck alcohol. 

Thank you all for being out there, for your kindness, wise words, and for showing your battle scars. This ain't easy, but and least we're in it together. IWNDWYT.",30,0

On one hand I feel good that I'm closing in on my goal.  But on the other I am concerned since I caught myself thinking, more than once, how great that first sip of whisky will taste after 3-months sober.   I mean, it's kind of stupid isn't it?  It would be like celebrating veganism by chowing down on a bacon cheeseburger.

So, after doing some soul-searching, and reading here on the sub till late last night, I decided that maybe I'm not as in control as I thought I was, and so at the least I'm going to extend my initial commitment to 180 days now.  

And that's why this morning, as the sun was just coming up, I found the 1/3 bottle of good scotch left in my cupboard, and poured it right down the drain.  I actually opened the windows and ran the kitchen fan so I wouldn't notice that fine aroma.  Anyway I just wanted to make clear to myself I wouldn't be drinking it in some kind of warped ""celebration"" 6 days from now, or ever actually.",232,0

Sitting in a dark apartment that hadn’t been cleaned in weeks with several bottles all around me made me realise that this isn’t living. This isn’t even surviving, it’s essentially coasting until death. 

This last year I have achieved nothing. I used to be a top student at a world leading university, but I haven’t passed a single exam in 14 months delaying my graduation. I had a failed relationship due to my drinking and now my family are taking it upon themselves to sort out my life from thousands of kilometres away.

After 4 days, for the first time I can actually see my future and it isn’t nearly as dark as I had always thought.

I am grateful I stuck to it. I'm feeling better everyday. Progress is possible because I'm in control of myself. Last year, the sobriety and it's progress really kicked in. I lost 40 pounds, I started running regularly, I'm passing all my classes. And I am so so happy for it.

Usually I spread out the bottle over two days. I definitely noticed that my tolerance rose in the last few months since I started this stupid behavior.

To be honest, I am not even sure it is that bad - I have no point of reference for what is considered alcoholism. I do not have any negative side effects which makes it hard to really admit that it's bad. It does not affect my performance at work or at all during the week. And on weekends it is just a nice way to let the time go by (since I don't really have any hobbies that interest me).

Why do I not get a hangover?

How can I bring myself to stop, when there are no perceivable negatives for now?

Last night, one of my best friends texted me that her husband asked for a divorce. It was completely out of the blue for her. Even I had to read the text four times before I fully comprehended.

So today I stopped at the liquor store for the first time in more than 3 months and picked up two bottles of our favourite wine. 

Thing is, I haven’t told anyone that I’m quitting drinking. My boyfriend knows, but friends and family don’t know. Covid restrictions preventing gathering for the last 4 months have helped me keep it to myself and avoid situations where I’d otherwise be tempted to drink. 

But tonight, I could have made the excuse. Could have chalked it up to an extreme circumstance. Could have agreed to a glass to keep my friend company in her crisis. Could have gone along with having a drink to avoid the awkward explanation that I’m not drinking right now. Could have thrown away the 103 sober days I have under my belt

Could have, but didn’t. Instead I had two fizzy waters and was able to listen and comfort my friend with a clear head.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Thursday/Friday! 

So far this week, we’ve explored the topics of attachment, connection, human needs, emotions, and communication. We’ve talked about how they relate to each other a lot, too—they’re quite interconnected! 

Connection is one of my two core values. The other one is wholeheartedness. According to Brené Brown, “wholehearted living is about engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness. It means cultivating the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough.”

Striving for wholeheartedness in my life has also brought me a lot of confidence and strengthened my sense of authenticity as a result. In a talk I referenced earlier this week, Gabor Maté said, “Authenticity means being connected to ourselves. It’s about knowing what we feel and how to act on it.”

Hey wait a minute—that’s exactly what the point was for using Non-Violent communication tools with ourselves! 

I am consistently struck by how cyclical the relationships between attachment and authenticity, connection and wholehearted living really are. Courageously relating to others from a place of honesty is a habit that reinforces itself the longer I keep at it. So far, my sobriety has been like that, too. It’s not a coincidence! 

What are some virtuous (or maybe vicious) cycles you’ve noticed reinforcing themselves in your life lately? 

May your virtuous cycles remain fueled and may you feel empowered to pause any vicious cycles that hold you in their grasp for long enough to turn the tides.",93,0

How I decided to put myself here, what decisions I made to get here, and mistakes I made consciously to do so. No one. I can say that confidently because I don't know myself to be honest. No level of clear explanation will reveal the balance between my fault and environment that got me here. A year or two from now, when I find myself homeless and afraid no one will ever know why. The vast majority of people won't care. A small amount will blame me, and a small amount will blame something from my environment. Who's right? I have no idea. 

I concede knowing anything. Will I break this habit? Right now it doesn't seem so, but maybe I'll eventually grab some sort of drive for some reason and launch out of it. Will I ever be happy with myself and sleep well in the bed I made? I don't know. Will I ever forgive myself? I don't know. 

The only thing I know at the moment is what I want right now. I want to sleep for a week, or two. Maybe even three weeks. I don't want responsibility. I don't want bills. I don't want friends. I don't want to work. I don't want anything at all. I'm the kid a month before Christmas saying they don't want anything when their parents ask then what they want. I just want tomorrow to be filled with nothing, and the next day, and so on. 

I don't like feeling like this. I don't like feeling encumbered by the smallest things. I don't like feeling weak. I don't even like feeling tangible. 

I want so bad to be a kid again. The poor kid at the end of the street. Looking back it was nice and I had no idea, and having no idea is what made it nice. 

I don't know where I fit in in the world, and I hate saying that because if how stupid it is. I know it's a dumb childish thing to say. But I don't. I don't know which character on this book I am. I have no idea.

So yeah. I'm an extremely lost guy drinking his days away because he doesn't know what else to do. The easy answer is ""occupy yourself doing something productive"" but I don't want to.

I never really saw it as a problem despite the hangovers, my reckless and damaging behaviors, and the shame and embarrassment that followed the next day whether I could remember it or not.  It's only in the past 2 years after starting therapy that I realize I have been out of control. I wish I could be one of those people who can stop after 1-2 drinks. But it's all or nothing for me, always has been. I have attempted moderation and failed multiple times. Even as I write this, I think about my love for craft beer or cocktails, sitting at a bar (pre-COVID times) and seeing and hearing the sounds of the bartender, the buzz or more so the numbing of my feelings and experiences, and everything else I'll be giving up by not drinking.  And those things honestly seem to matter more to me despite that I know it's no good for me.

I was at a point earlier this year, where I really just didn't care about living and knew I was destroying my body with alcohol and kept going with it. But with starting an SSRI and upping my therapy, I've come to the point that I am starting to care again. And for the past 2 years, I have been wrestling with the idea of going sober, but I've failed so many times. I actually stopped for a month last year, which was the longest of not drinking in probably 10 years. My sleep got better, I dropped some weight, and I became a lot more productive. Yet that wasn't enough for me. It was more like, I knew I could do it, so I don't have a problem.  But I have been binging ever since. My therapist had recommended AA or checking out local options, but I've been reluctant to go. Part of me is still in denial. But here is me on Reddit, dipping my toes into the water.  So at least now I've gone 1 day without drinking.

Thanks for letting me join, and thanks to the mods and everyone who do the good work of supporting one another, being vulnerable, and letting others be vulnerable.

It is my 2 year anniversary of quitting drinking today.  Thanks so much to this sub for all the support, particularly in the first months.  

Drinking was such a complex and ever-shifting problem for me, there is no one way to describe what it was like.  But now with 2 years of experience without drinking, I respect myself more, my life is way easier, I am far more in-touch with my life, I have much better relationships and I rarely regret anything.  

And I never have a hangover!  It’s like my life is longer because I have a lot more productive hours in the week now, and I can choose what to do with them.

It's a norm that I have fully embraced. I've been so damn busy being a functioning human (and being a senior engineering student) that I almost didn't even post to mark the occasion!

But I figured, why not. Sobriety is still a huge deal, really. The difference between the healthy woman today (a straight A engineering student and a leader, with her depression in remission), and the sick, sad, and sorry fool who checked into inpatient for detox a little over 3 years ago is *immense*. It is important that I do not take that for granted.

I would be remiss if I didn't highlight the changes that helped me gradually climb out of my hole, because somebody out there might be able to take one of my tidbits and use it as a rung on the ladder out of their own hole.

In sobriety I don't go to bars or breweries. That is something ""drinking"" *kara13* did, but it has no place in the life of sober *kara13*. I have avoided all drinking functions, including my own 10 year high school reunion at some bar in Dallas. I just feel that there are more productive ways to spend my time, and sometimes (often) it is more productive to curl up under a blanket and binge Netflix.

Funnily, staying in and binging Netflix is something I often did pre-sobriety, too. Cool difference is I don't pass out 30 minutes in now.

I realized that I would need a new vice or go-to reward to stay sober. I was a smoker when I quit so I let myself have all the ciggies I wanted for the first 3 months. I'm grateful that habit was easy to shed when I was ready. Now when I'm stressed, happy, triggered, whatever, I have ice cream or something else sweet. It does the trick. And for a nightcap, hot herbal tea. Sparkling water is also nice; if I take a few big gulps I get a nice gentle burning sensation in my stomach that is reminiscent of a swig of liquor. An old feeling that I still crave almost instinctively, but less often than I used to.

One last thing I do differently now is to pause before I react, and think before I speak. The 'big deal' is often not so outrageous, or at least not worth my raging energy. Just breathe. This is a habit I had to consciously work at, it wasn't like flipping a switch.

I feel like I'm on a soapbox now so I'll make one recommendation for any newbies who might see this: constructive sober company is **crucial** in early sobriety. You may have heard the adage ""90 meetings in the first 90 days"" and I believe that can make or break somebody's sobriety. You don't have to be a believer in the 12 steps to do this. Take what you can use, leave the rest. I am not a regular AA attendee and haven't been in a while, this subreddit and accountable friends are enough for me now, but the connections I made with thriving sober people in early days *absolutely* helped to carry me to where I am today. Find some COVID-compliant, masked and distanced meetings, something. You have to connect to get out of the rut.

Alright, I'll step down now. You are all beautiful people: lurkers, day 1-ers or day 10,001-ers. Keep fighting the good fight, and IWNDWYT.",23,2

I was able to make it 7 days. It was a good run, I was starting to feel better physically, mentally and emotionally. But ultimately I made up excuses for myself to relapse (social events) and now I'm back to square one.

I recall watching a Jordan Peterson podcast and he mentioned something that stuck with me.

*In order to quit alcohol you need to replace it with something better.*

That's what I failed to do. I was just staying in my same old lazy bum routine. Work, home, work, home, etc. Youtube, video games, repeat, repeat. 

I wasn't making an effort to eat better or exercise, work on hobbies, etc. Ultimately this is what lead to my relapse I think. Quitting alcohol isn't enough... it needs to be a total lifestyle change.

It's day 3, and I'm kind of okay, just irritable and wondering why I can't be normal and have a lovely glass of wine with dinner and talk easily with my partner and put a cork in the bottle and find it two days later, having forgotten it was there.

Feeling grateful is a skill we can develop. This is an opportunity for us to practice*.

About a week or so ago I began a kind of digital cleanse. I’ve never been much into social media but I had grown alarmed by the amount of screen time I engaged in. All that mindless scrolling through newsfeeds that tended to enrage me, causing an ungodly amount of needless stress and anxiety. And then there was the television. The constant cycling back and forth between several platforms just to find something to pass the time. Every now and then I’d find something compelling. But most of the time I was just scrolling, sifting through a bottomless pit of mediocre content. I’ve developed a deep hatred for Netflix’s Catalogue of Mostly Shit. 

But what really rankled me was discovering that I had an Uber rating. And not a very good one. I think we’ve crossed some kind of threshold when we’re being rated as customers paying for a service, that something has gone ominously astray. For me that number was beyond the pale, a manifestation of everything toxic and sick with a culture obsessed with ranking and liking. But I won’t deny that little statistic’s disciplinary power. I started wondering what was wrong with me as a person. I had never been late for a ride so there had to be something about me. Was I not conversational enough? Did I smell? And it changed my behavior. I found myself reading up on Uber’s tips for improving your score. I became uncharacteristically chipper and talkative. I made sure to gently close the door when exiting. And then I finally said “wtf” and moved beyond all that. If I needed any more convincing that it was time to purge myself of my digital fixation, Uber provided it. 

Although I’ve only been offline for a bit I’ve noticed a considerable difference in my mood. My stress level is way, way down. I’m not nearly as agitated. And while I still reach for that prosthetic god out of habit despite leaving my phone in my room, it feels incredible to be untethered to a device that might as well have been an extension of my hand. My eyes seem better. I have less headaches, especially the tension kind. But the biggest difference is in what I’m noticing around me, which is a lot. I’m never distracted by something I’ll just forget about in ten minutes anyway, and instead am present and alive to everything and everyone around me. I can’t believe how much I was missing while plugged in, and how much time and energy I have to focus my attention elsewhere. 

But all that extra time and mental energy has also caused some discomfort. Living a largely unmediated existence has forced me to realize I have a lot of unresolved issues to work through. I noticed how much my sobriety depended on distraction. Having to sit with myself, the stillness of it when without my digital crutches, has led to quite a bit of serious introspection that can be painful but imperative if I’m going to build a more solid foundation. I don’t know how much longer I’ll keep this cleanse up, I like movies too much to do away with the screen. But I’m thankful I took the plunge and am doing the work that needed to be done sooner or later. 

On another note, something I’ve been doing lately is writing down a trait or attribute of some kind about myself every day that I’m grateful for. It’s been helpful for countering all the negative self-talk that my mind is so accustomed to hearing. Today I’m proud of my vulnerability and my willingness to express it. How about you?",36,0

He has dialed his drinking way back and doesn’t party like he used to. I was glad to hear. 

Even went so far as to agreeing that he wouldn’t drink if we played and he didn’t care. We fed off each other a lot and he told me if your not drinking it will be easier for me not to. 

Tonight we played and had an amazing round. I chipped in a birdie out of a bunker and wound up beating him by 2 strokes he had a 100 I had a 98. We had so much fun making bets and cracking jokes that we are already planning another outing.

(I'm 27 years old btw). I adopted a 14-year-old dog named Pepper from my friend who rescued her from a shelter after she was abandoned in a hurricane. 

Even though I had already been sober for a year and a half when I adopted her,  that by no means says that the difficult emotions dried up when the liquor did. Loneliness, regret, feeling less-than. These are things I definitely struggled with as the fog settled from my constant state of either being extremely drunk or extremely hungover. 

So enter Pepper, my new little friend. I can't say enough how much this dog has helped me. I am learning how to not just be responsible for myself, but for another living creature. I am getting up early every day and going outside for a walk. I am becoming more social around the neighborhood. I am essentially becoming that more connected person I was never able to be when I was drinking. 

It's just some random thought I wanted to share for today. Obviously, not drinking is a lot more complicated than this. Anyway, hope anyone reading this is doing well!

I went home and got my mask and showed up to the meeting about a half hour early. it didn't look like the meeting was going to open but I still sat there and waited for 30 minutes until I realized it wasn't happening.

I will keep things brief but I hope my story can help at least one person make it through one more day. 
Alcohol wasn’t the only substance I had problems with, but I won’t mention anything like that incase there is rules against it. 
I started drinking when I was 13 or 14 years old, and by the time I was 18 I was ready to quit. Being under the influence had become all I knew and all I ever wanted to know. I had lost control and couldn’t cope with the consequences of my behaviour. For two years, I would slip in and out of denial until I nearly lost my life. At that point reality became impossible to ignore. It wasn’t as if a switch had flipped, it took a few more tragic spells of drinking to really learn my lesson. In the end though, the last time I was under the influence ended up being the 15th of August, 2018. 
I am 23 years old now, I worried that losing alcohol would rob me of any social opportunities but that has not been the case. My life has completely opened up, and I have come to have more friends than I ever did during my relationship with alcohol.

I was dating an amazing woman, and we started talking about marriage. Eventually, she realized my drinking was getting worse. I knew if she was aware of the reality of my habit, I would have to either change those habits or accept that our relationship would soon be over. So, of course, I made a third option: **lie my ass off**.  

Lied about my schedule so I could stop at the bar after work. Drank four or five pints in an hour. Stopped at the corner store to pick up a couple beers, so it would seem that I only had 2 drinks that day. Opened that beer before I walked into the house, so I had an excuse for why my breath smelled of beer. Hid a stash in the storage closet to drink on dog walks. The list goes on, and I spent more and more time to myself. 

The lengths I would go to in order to hide my habits are difficult for me to even imagine now. The worst part about it was that **it worked**. At the time, I thought I was pretty clever. I thought, ""I can get away with this!"" I said to myself, ""I should've been a secret agent!"" Now I realize that not only was I lying to my girlfriend, but I was also lying to myself. I didn't eliminate the alcohol problem that was in the way of our relationship. I just hid it and created a second problem that was in the way of our relationship. We grew more and more distant because of my lies and my ""time to myself."" And eventually I couldn't keep both problems in check. 

She left me. My friends moved away for unrelated reasons. And one month later COVID shut the city down. I went four months without seeing a familiar face. Weeks and weeks without talking to a single person. I thought I was losing my mind. I felt like the universe was stretching a single finger down from the heavens and squashing me like the insect I was. Punishing me. But that was the most sinister lie, because I was the one punishing myself. 

I could've had a partner through this, but I chose alcohol and I lied to her. I could've called my friends, but I chose alcohol and I lied to them. I could've gone back to school, but I chose alcohol and I lied to my family. **I could have accepted that these were the consequences of my own actions, but I chose alcohol and I lied to myself**. 

I don't want to be a liar anymore.

As soon as I turned 21 I began self-medicating with alcohol. I did not take it slow or start with light beers or drink at parties. I went from 21 years of sobriety to regularly drinking wine and liquor to the point of passing out. And I kept that up for 10 years, until deciding to go sober in April of 2020. 

The one-year experiment with sobriety is coming to a close and I'm not really sure that I've learned or gained anything. I think that I've just snatched a year of my life from the jaws of alcohol. I'm still an addict, though. I still spend a ton of time thinking about alcohol and trying to wrestle with my cravings. I *want* to drink more today than I did at the beginning of the sober year. 10 months ago I was riding high on sobriety and feeling like I was living the first day of the rest of my life. And now I find myself in the same exact position I was before, except now I just don't drink. Literally nothing else has changed on the outside, now I have an almost superstitious fear of alcohol. 

Sobriety is definitely cooler. I no longer feel pathetic and powerless in my own life. I feel like I overcame something that a lot of people cannot overcome. There are a lot of people who die trying to get away from alcohol or who never even try and end up consumed by it. I am, for the time being, not one of those stories and that's nice. 

But sometimes it feels like I'm depriving myself of something I want or even need. I really don't think anything would happen one way or the other if I got drunk tonight. I don't think anything would happen if I continued staying sober either. But there's a 99% chance I'd wake up the next morning feeling regret and despair in only one of those situations. The worst thing I have to deal with being sober is boredom, but never regret. 

This has been a very lonely year for a lot of people. Loneliness and boredom had always been my number one triggers for binge drinking, so I am shocked that I've made it this far. When a year of sobriety passed, I think I'll have a drink just to see what happens. Or I might not. It's a victory, though, to even be in a position where I might consider choosing to stay sober. I used to spend all my time and energy looking for reasons to drink, but lately I've gotten really good at making excuses for my sobriety. So that's a win.

Truly, the list of various alcoholic personalities is extensive. 

I am here visiting this sub to remind myself why I am here in this positive position today, at this moment... because I, (we!), have told all of those alcoholic personalities to F- off!  Because I said I WNDWYT and I mean it. Because I read stories here everyday that make me laugh, cry, nod my head in agreement, feel inspired and empowered. 

So, instead of having that drink with that ""happy alcoholic"", I will NOT have a drink with this happy, strong, honest and amazing community.  I will share my happiness and my pride with you all today. I love this community and I thank you all. I WNDWYT!",383,0

 The first night of heavy drinking was tough and I felt like such an outsider. A drunk girl ironically approached me and yelled at me to ""be in the moment"". I pretty much observed and people watched the first night, dwelling on the fact that I'll never be able to have that much fun again and that I just wanted to be a ""normal person"" who could have a drink here and there. Then when the night progressed and people got inebriated I quietly listened to 3 of my friends have heart to hearts about their personal problems, alcohol abuse and I could start to tell some of my friends didn't want to be around me when they started opening up. 

Second night was much easier, even though more people came. My anxiety left and I made my brothers birthday special, and I'm damn proud if myself.

What I learned from this weekend is that we are not alone, it may feel that way but it's not. YOU made a decision to better your life and cut out alcohol, YOU made the step. Your already doing better than a lot of people so be damn proud of yourself. I love this sub it's a daily reminder for me and you are all wonderful.

I just celebrated my 2 years of sobriety a month ago. I heard milestones can actually be a quite rocky, *def* feeling it.

This year, I got into my dream school for Gastronomy Sciences. I love food. I love cooking it, feeding it to people, I especially love to study food as an anthropology subject. I'm 100% having the time of my life, the people are lovely and welcoming and the classes are very stimulating. **BUT** of course, since there is gastronomy there is wine. A lot of it. They even have a few Wine Masters. The forever presence of alcohol in the food industry, often free, is challenging in its own. Dinners are hard. It's taking a toll on me mentally to see people savoring their high quality wine, making comments, while my only options are soda and water. I get nervous and very very sad seeing everyone drink.  
The welcoming day included a free glass of wine. Cue to me disappearing to ""not miss my bus"" so people won't see me loosing my shit over 20cl of Cabernet.

Also, my biggest issue is that my degree includes wine tasting classes. I've approached someone from the administration and since they've had Muslim students in the past, they've already dealt with this issue. I've explained I would like to avoid drinking alcohol but not bring attention to me or disrupt the class. We are a very small group and since I already deal with OCD, I already have this constant pressure about drawing attention, hating it, accusing myself of faking it for attention, etc etc...  
I did not tell them about OCD and my sobriety at the time. Then mentioned I am in recovery but would like to stay discreet in the last emails.  
He offered that I taste and spit. The school board is very nice and flexible, so I know that they won't punish me for not drinking or ""missing the class"" (aka follow by zoom) but even that option sucks. Of course, I have considered it but just smelling the wine smacks me down emotionally. I feel isolated. I feel like I'm missing on so much being in the vineyard region AND sober. I don't want to break my streak and I don't trust myself to drink responsibly. But I also don't want to feel singled out or seem off and I know that I'll feel awful during the class. 

Soooo yeah, I would love to have the output of people who are working in gastronomy, food industry, restaurants? I've heard there are even sober barmen and barwomen out there. How do you guys deal with the pressure? How do you stay discreet? Any good excuses you've used?

I’m thinking of writing a blog about mental health (I have bipolar I) and I wanted to review my old posts on here. I remember getting some lovely comments from this community! Sadly I’ve only one still left. I remembered a fit of paranoia made me delete all but one! The last.. and not my best piece of writing. 

I was 23 days sober at that point. Suffering with dreadful anxiety for no known logical reason. If you’d told me then that those 23 days would have turned into 3.5 years I’d have never believed you. Drinking was my best friend. I put it before everything. My daughter, my family, my job, my finances and then towards the end my health.. 

That first glass of wine was intoxicating. It took the edge off of the anxiety and I felt invincible. Smoothed out the edges. Made everything that had happened in the work day and all the horrible people I may have dealt with seem insignificant. It made me feel safe. However this first glass of wine always led to the second. The second glass of wine led to the third, then the whole bottle, then the second bottle... Then ‘black out comatose.’ Then dragging myself out of bed in the morning. Going to work probably still drunk, feeling too bad to even brush my teeth without being sick. The sweats, the horror of finding I’d posted something embarrassing and needy on Facebook.. The not getting too close to colleagues unless they could smell it on me. The sick days. The hiding of wine bottles in other peoples recycling.. The constant worry. Did people know? Who knew? My family certainly did. I could see it in my Mums sad eyes every time she visited and I stood swaying at the door. I could see it in the confusion in my child’s eyes. The worry in my sisters. 

However it never made me stop. 
What made me stop? Desperation. Sheer misery. It was stop or remove myself from this world. I could no longer face the world but even worse myself. Every day had become a ‘ground hog day nightmare’ of my own making... Then I got the diagnosis of early alcoholic liver disease and that was a kick start too. I went to my G.P and cried so much I thought I’d never stop. She was lovely. She gave me hope. Just a smidgen. But enough. 

Today I stand here a completely different person. The person I was before the drinking however older and wiser and nowhere near as anxious. I would need to do another post on all the amazing things that have happened since I stopped. It wasn’t easy. I ate far too many biscuits and cheesecake. Gallons of cheesecake.

I'm almost 8 months sober, but drank heavily for years. My brain so often thinks I'm still drunk when I think about doing things. Examples- working out (only can do in the AM since I'm used to be drunk after that), thinks I'm still hung over in the morning when I go to do simple things (I'm not), driving, going to various meetings/social situations, etc. I'm doing well otherwise- no real cravings, feeling great in general, but I'd swear my brain still thinks we're drinking. 

Has anyone else experienced this, and how long did it last? I always give people advice to be patient, but I guess I've trained my brain so well over the years it's still going to take some time.

And I've found myself into a new daily habit. Instead of going to the liquor store, I go to the gas station and buy Reese's. The chocolate, salt, sweet, peanut butter combo is deadly and literally is so good. BUT it makes my stomach hurt, gives me mad nausea and causes me to feel a tad icky. It's like a minor hangover. I've NEVER ate candy when I drank.

I think my weight loss has been stunted because of this. I'm adding an extra 500 calories per day in candy. Which is about half of pint of vodka I used to drink almost daily. So if you add that up...that's still 3500 a week which is 1 pound. Which even though it's half of what I used to do, it's still a lot.

I tried to stop going to the gas station to get them yesterday and I experienced the SAME RAVENOUS CRAVING I felt when I first quit drinking. And it scared me. Because I've now come to terms with the fact I've possibly replace alcohol with candy. I don't want to say ""it's okay as long as it's not alcohol."" Because replacing bad with bad is bad.

If you can relate, how does everyone else deal with this? Have you managed to replace alcohol with something healthy? If so, what, and how? lol. I need help.

I've been exercising, eating well, and sleeping 8+ hours for the last few weeks. Been doing my job effectively to the point of getting a compliment from our district manager who never compliments anybody. Still, for whatever reason, I almost snapped at work yesterday after thinking a little too inward. I got extremely depressed, took my lunch break and just laid down in the back seat of my car. I had no energy. I was 15 minutes over my allotted half-hour. I eventually got back in the groove of things, but that horrible depression didn't fade. I came home and just went straight to bed and blacked everything out in my room. I just woke up from that 12 hour nap.  


I feel a little bit better, and I don't know what triggered this depressive episode. I told my friend I wanted to cancel my subscription to life, and I just couldn't be convinced otherwise. For the first time since 2019, I actually held a 6-pack of Corona Familiar in my hand for a few minutes before putting it back. After playing it forward, I immediately felt that potential future anxiety of waking up without memory and physically burdened.  


I will tell this to anybody who stops drinking: not everything is going to immediately become better for you as soon as you quit. It's going to fucking suck. After 500 days, some things might still suck. But you're not giving yourself a fighting chance if you just decide to get more poison from the grocery store.",265,1

Long story short, after who knows how many binging, stopping cycles I really see how it has messed me up. I've said this before, but I warn you now:

If you keep binging and stopping there is a good chance you'll kickstart the kindling effect. 

You may ask yourself ""What is the kindling effect"" well, it's not good I can tell you that. Here is what happens: You drink a lot for a year, 2 years, 6 months, 5 years, 3 months - whatever the timeframe is. You stop/start many times and are pretty damn hungover each time. 

Guess what? Each time you get hungover, that timeframe of how long you can drink (days, months, years) gets shortened from the previous time. I used to do 6 months to a year of pretty constant drinking pretty heavy amounts. Last few times I got sick were basically a few weeks in a row, then a week, then another almost a week and then recently just 3 days. 3 days AND I didn't drink half as much AND I wasn't hungover, but I got sick. Luckily this past fri/sat/sun I DID NOT get sick and I dodged a bullet. I was positive I was going to be sick this past Monday, thankfully I made it through day 1 and 2 and now on to 3. 

The 12 day sober streak taught me a LOT about normal life, being back to being me and trying to be healthy. The mess up also reminded me why I quit - my body won't allow it, the kindling effect has got me and I really don't have a choice but to shape up or ship out. 

That's all I got, it feels good to get it out and write it. I'm not struggling by any means considering I should be, but I think I know the score now and it makes it easier to just not think about drinking as I think about the kindling effect and what it may do to me next time. 

Take care and I will not drink today.",8,0

I got sober a week after my 26th birthday (that wasn’t a coincidence- my bday was a drunken nightmare). At the time, I felt hopeless, desperate and lost. I wasn’t worried so much about the rest of my life. I just wanted to have a better tomorrow. I wanted to know what it felt like to not wake up and hate myself and my life. Once the drunken fog cleared and I had some clarity (this really only took about 2 weeks), I realized that I wanted to be sober for the rest of my life. In fact, it wasn’t even a choice. I had to be sober or I’d go right back to feeling as depressed and insecure as I did before. 

You might read that and think, “Well that sucks. A life sentence of sobriety.” But that’s not how I see it. I feel incredibly lucky and blessed to have gotten sober when I did. Frankly, I don’t know how much longer I would’ve lasted (mentally, emotionally, physically, and don’t even get me started on financially). What others might see as a life sentence, I see as a long path for a beautiful life, one where I actually have a chance to be happy and do something with this time I have on earth. I’m not saying every day is perfect (far from it), but every day I get the opportunity to have joy, real joy, not artificial and momentary joy from a bottle. If I’m lucky, I’ll never drink again. I put in a lot of daily work so that doesn’t happen. I’m about to turn 28 and I’ll have 2 years sober next month. Whether you’re in your 20s or your 60s, make your time on this earth worth it.

After dinner we play backgammon.  He poured another drink and it had a minor twinge in my psyche and I went into the other room,  collected myself,  got an ice tea, glass, ice, it helped. 

AFTER we played 5 games we were heading in to watch a bit of TV and it hit. Hard! I went upstairs to stop crying but couldn't.  I collected myself,  came down and ""watched"" a show but had tears stream down my face the entire time.  Even typing this is making me tear up again. 

After one show I just went to bed just before 8:30. I took 2 of my ativan and eventually cried myself to sleep.  I don't feel much better today. 

I know I was feeling sorry for myself that I worked really hard and couldn't ""relax with a drink "". My body wanted to shut down and it couldn't.  Then hubby beside me relaxing into his scotch was just too much.

So is this a craving?  I thought it was just me feeling sorry for myself.  I tried all my tools but in the moment they rang empty.  I somewhat slept fitfully but I don't feel any better right now.

It certainly wasn't the most I have drunk, but when I can't remember it obviously means it was too much. 

Enough is enough. I don't even have a hangover today but I feel mentally bad. Things have to change. I am in a vicious circle of drinking because I feel miserable or bored or unhappy, and then feeling more miserable, bored and unhappy afterwards. I'm sure a lot of people are feeling similar during the pandemic but this has gone on for years. I use alcohol as too much of a crutch as well. Need to clean the bathroom? I'll have a glass of wine so it won't seem so boring! Looking at bills and budgets? Some whiskey will make it less daunting! Sunday evening boredom and thoughts about work setting in? Have a beer, it'll cheer you up! 

The worst part about this is that I can't really speak to my fiancé about it. If I tell him I have decided to stop drinking he will scoff and say something like 'I'll believe it when I see it"". Which is completely fair enough, it's not the first time I've said it. I don't really have much of a support network, my mother, father and sister all struggle with alcoholism as well. It runs deep in the veins of my family. Depression and anxiety make staying in touch remotely with people difficult and I live too far from my few friends to be able to visit them during the pandemic.

I feel fantastic during the morning, day, and evening - I'd even say evenings are the easiest. Watching people get drunk, start slurring, acting like apes... it makes it so much easier to keep the bottle out of my mouth.   


And then there are the nights... I think I've been getting something like 3 to 4 hours a day since last Thursday or so. I'm not sure if it's because I've started subconsciously buying more and more coffee/energy drinks to sorta... beat the habit of going into a store and grabbing a beer or if it's something else.  


 In either case, I'm stuck tossing and turning thinking of all the good times I've had with alcohol and more importantly this really deep anxiety that yeah I'm dealing with this now but what about later? What about during Birthdays? Partys? New Years? How am I going to resist when the pressure is on so much harder? How am I going to avoid looking odd or out-of-place?   


It would be easier to change my whole circle to those that don't drink, but it's complicated and there are deep seated reasons why I can't.

I'm a week into sobriety after pretty much 18 years of having had at least one drink every day, getting drunk at least once a week, and getting black out maybe once a month (in a 'good' month), (with maybe a few weeks or months here or there of abstaining from alcohol before falling off the wagon again).

This last week I've been having quite a few vivid dreams. Many are stress related (things at work, or mundane life activities going wrong and me getting extremely agitated).  This makes sense, because it's apparent to me that I use alcohol as a coping mechanism for anger and anxiety issues, so it's understandable that these mental health issues would manifest in my dreams as I level out a bit over the next few weeks.

The strange thing is, I've been having a couple of reoccurring dreams about bread.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Wednesday/Thursday, friends!

Two of the greatest gifts sobriety has brought me have been clarity and calm. Life without drinking still brings challenges, that’s no doubt, but my problem solving abilities are a lot stronger and it also takes less time before I realize that I do actually want to try to change things when they go awry.

Yesterday I shared part of the Needs Inventory from Non-Violent Communication: a list of universal human needs (28 out of the 75 deal with connection!). Today, I’d like to zoom out a bit more on the NVC process.

The reason is that it’s been an amazing tool to make the most of the clarity and calm that sobriety has offered me, and it’s turned into a virtuous cycle, too—using the 4 steps of the NVC process in order to better communicate *with myself* means more of my needs get met and I’m a better advocate for myself overall.

The four steps are:

1. Observe the situation (neutrally, without judging it as good, bad, right, wrong, etc.)
2. Describe your emotions
3. Identify your needs (met or unmet)
4. Make a request (to change the situation)

So yesterday, we talked about needs. I really love the relationship between steps two and three because the idea is that our emotions are what communicates to us that our needs are either being met or not. It’s a green light or a red light, and listening to our emotions instead of shutting them out helps us get regular temperature checks on how we’re doin’. (There’s an emotions list, too!)

We also chatted about vulnerability and trust yesterday, and I’d argue that building trust with a person is a matter of collecting evidence over time that they respond to our needs with respect. NVC helps me be vulnerable because it helps me get to the heart of what I need day to day.

By contrast, I think of times when I was drunk and got upset about something and definitely didn’t have the presence of mind to check in with my feelings and my needs and instead got spiteful or passive aggressive instead.

What differences do you notice in your communication when you’re drinking or not? How else has that changed your experiences?

May clarity and calm be your guides today.",97,0

I wrote my final goodbye to my ex, explaining that I need to let her go if I truly want fix me. I don't even know who I am anymore. I've lost that happy person and drowned it with booze.

I hurt her, and didn't care because I was so depressed. She needed more and she did that. She cheated on me, and I explained I was so sorry about the way I treated her. She wanted someone that was there for her and I couldn't even be there for myself. We tried to fix what was broken but I couldn't get past the way I treated her, and drowned my pain with alcohol.

After about a year of trying to fix my wrong doings, and bettering myself it wasn't enough. She cheated on me again but this time felt even worse because she had an emotional connection with my a friend that I thought was a friend. And to me that's worse than sleeping with a person. I am so hurt, two weeks ago I pretty much begged her to take me back. But she wouldn't because she was falling for my friend. She told me he gave her what I couldn't.

So today I wrote my final goodbye, and am grabbing the last few things I have at the place next week. I've given her a week to put the bills in her name because I no longer live there but she hasn't done anything besides getting her own car insurance. I hate to be a asshole but, if she doesn't take care of it soon, I'm just not going to pay for it and she can deal with it. And if that means removing her phone off my contract and letting her deal with the repercussions then so be it. I only agreed to pay half the rent. 

I can't live in the past anymore and need to move forward. Also I don't even know if she's taking care of my tortoise right now. Like feeding and turning his light out. The damn anxiety is eating at me. I have next Tuesday and Wednesday off and plan on finishing everything. Also leaving her the final goodbye

About 4 years ago is when my drinking started getting heavier. Before that it was only weekends and holidays and when I was off work and when I was visiting family. Then I quit my 40 hr/week stressful job and started working with dogs part-time. 

My coworker, who I closed with every night I worked, was an alcoholic. She would come in wasted, pass out while filling out paperwork, head to the bar during her breaks, and do shots. At the time I thought ""That won't be me"". Then we started hanging out after work and before I knew it we were sharing 3-4 bottles of wine a few times a week. She would stay on my couch and sleep until noon. Then we would go and get food and head back to work. 

6 months later I started school and quit working. I was stressed and had free-time. So, I would drink in the middle of the day, or go out for beers at night and get wasted on a Monday night. This went on for 6 more months. At this time I started therapy and was working through some really rough stuff which made me spiral into a deep depression that I didn't get fully out of for a year. For the first 4 months, I was coming home from school and drinking a bottle of wine, and then passing out on the couch. 

In April of 2019 I was working out and to pull myself out of the depression pit. In order to do that I had to stop drinking, but I couldn't. So, I limited to weekends. Which worked. Then 2020 happened... Anyway, I fell back into drinking HARD and finally stopped however many days ago my badge says i'm on. I just know it's 7 weeks(or almost 7 weeks?) and realizing how much time i've wasted on drinking. I'm also recognizing how much i've hurt my progress in therapy by not stopping fully last year.

Over time, I started picking up the habit as well and as such developed a similar pattern of alcoholism, but alone at home. This came with a lot of physical problems, (I'm recovering from eating disorders,) and as such I've been making an effort to quit since mid last year, hence the lurking here. 

His drinking started mostly with beers; tall boys, four locos, about 2-4 each night of weekends in the start. It slowly became a daily thing, and he would need more to get his buzz. During parties, he would be the one blacked out, hugging the porcelain throne and swearing he'd never drink again... Only to bite the hair of the dog in the morning. About two years ago, both of our alcoholism settled into a comfortable bottle of vodka that we would take shots from throughout the day and night, usually starting around 2pm right as he would be getting ready for work. It wasn't until later that I find out that not only was he drinking all day on the job, but that on his walks to and from work, he would stop by the local bars and gas stations for free alcohol as well. He's a social butterfly and everyone loves him, so no one batted an eye. This was the start of real red flags for me, being as we always share everything together and drinking aside, he was hiding his actions from me. 

In January, he suddenly developed extreme jaundice. He was sent home from work several days because customers were complaining about his appearance. Fast forward a few days; January 14th he was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver, and he FINALLY quit. 

It's been almost 3 months and he was sent home twice; each time while here at home, he declined rapidly. Yesterday I snapped because he wasn't eating, wasn't drinking enough water, didn't have the strength to get up, refused to take his medications. I did some research and it all looked like hepatic encephalopathy, down to the strange smell of his breath that had been bothering me. He finally went back in this morning after more begging and pleading; as of today he was diagnosed with late stage liver disease. 

As far as his care is concerned, I'm at a loss. Idk why they sent him home the first time, and idk why he was sent home the second time. They have not openly communicated his diagnosis to myself or him besides cirrhosis and liver disease. He apparently also has pneumonia, an enlarged heart, and kidney disease. I'm getting all this information from his online medical reports, which I have access too in order to report to his job. I'm confused why they aren't telling us these vital pieces of information? 

I'm utterly terrified, sad, angry.. all the feelings. I've been trying to stay strong and positive but I can't help being afraid. He's been my rock, my world, the light of my life since I was 16.. I cannot lose him. That cannot happen. I'm not disillusioned about the facts though. 

I guess I'm making this post in a last ditch effort to shine some light on this situation in a way that is hopeful. I really need hope right now. Success or even survival stories would help bunches just to keep my sanity right now. I've been fighting off a panic attack for days now because I have to be strong. Thanks for reading 💜",15,0

**The Good:** The simple pleasures of an early, hangover-free morning never get old. The latest pleasure: people-watching off the front porch with my mother while we sip our morning coffee and award ourselves points for spotting anything out of the ordinary, such as a woman pushing twins in an extra-wide stroller. (I won this morning’s game when I was the first to spot a man in tie-dyed pants riding a bright green bicycle.)

**The Bad:** Ever since I got sober, I have had uncomfortable moments of “hyper-awareness,” often when I am driving my car. I experienced one recently while driving over the [Sunshine Skyway Bridge](https://i.imgur.com/SfnfSys.jpg), which has a remarkably steep descent over water and is kind of terrifying.

I still feel that I’m at the beginning of my journey and that’s a good thing. It means I’m in this for the long haul. I’ve rewired my brain to completely disregard alcohol as a reward mechanism. I don’t hate alcohol, I just hate myself when I drink. And I’m a pretty cool person.

501 days ago I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. 501 days ago I didn’t see anything in my future worth going on for. And 500 days ago, I gave up trying to do it alone. 

My kidneys are functional again, my dog lives with me, I have a regular sleep schedule and actual friends. AND I can go in my bathroom with the light on... because I can finally look at myself in the mirror. 

Hold on. Dive into every support community you can find. When it feels like you can’t do it, ask for help. The pain of being alive will never go away, in fact it will become more intense. But you will learn to experience it instead of avoiding it, and learn from it instead of storing it as physical and emotional trauma. The pain lasts for only a fraction of the time it used to and turns an empty life into a meaningful one.

I never thought I could quit drinking. I absolutely loved drinking. I loved how I felt with a buzz, I loved how I felt when I was drunk.

But as I got older, I was drinking more and more often. It got to the point where going even two nights in a row without a drink was rare. 

By the time I quit, I was drinking a bottle of wine most nights, or I’d stop at the bar on the way home from work and drink 2-3 high abv IPAs before going home, drinking some more while cooked dinner, etc. 

The hangovers just got worse and worse. 

And then one day, I don’t know why or how, I just came home and decided I was done. I still can’t quite explain why that one day I decided I was ready and it just stuck. It was the same when I quit smoking years ago. One day I just stopped. 

Anyway, sobriety has been a journey. There are times when I still really miss drinking. But I live for my mornings now. Waking up feeling great, drinking coffee and reading before anyone else is awake, always feeling well rested and sharp. It can’t be beat. 

Anyway, here’s to all of you. To all of you trapped in a cycle that you’re convinced you can’t get out of, just know that you can. I promise you. One day at a time, you can do it. And life on the other side is incredible.

However on the call was some really high up people I handled the issue and stepped up when it was needed I worked through my lunch and got a lot of stuff handled because of me and my teammate. As I logged off my phone rang from my boss and his exact words were “hell of a job today I am so grateful for what you did for the team today.” 

I hated my job absolutely hated it 8 months ago I dreaded waking up and did the absolute bare minimum to get by. Now I still am not in love with my job but I really try now and get my hands dirty. My professional life has gotten immensely better and this is something I never expected. I went from being almost fired to being a valued team member that does anything that is needed. 

When I logged off I went downstairs grabbed a shower and sat on the couch. Used to nights like this meant I would pour 5 fingers of whatever whiskey I had and wait till my wife went to bed and hoof it to the corner bar until close and then be hungover as can be in the morning. 

Not tonight I came down to the kitchen after my shower smashed some homemade carnitas my wife made and had a piece of cheesecake. I still have the guilty pleasures but the cops are never gonna bust me for having Oreos on my breath. And that is just fine by me. IWNDWYT",83,0

Fortunately i didnt slip nearly as far down the hole as the first time, but i dont think my body can handle what it used to. Now im back about 8 months sober and trying to stay focused... had too many ""i could have just one martini after a long day"" thoughts

The first day sucked, but it had to suck because thats what got me sober. Multi hour panic attack. I could handle nausea, headaches, dehydration... but not panic attacks. Couldnt explain it to my spouse because i was a (maybe delusionally) private drinker. Didnt really care for bars, but nothing was better than sitting down in front of the xbox and putting drinks away nonstop until i passed out every night.

The next week was sweaty and itchy. Hands got real itchy and i slept on the couch a lot so my spouse wouldnt notice how little sleep i was actually getting. I was bored and pissy. Couldnt focus. Ate candy nonstop.

The second week i was up at 7am on a saturday. Went out for early coffee and fucking loved it - crisp air, empty streets, lots of energy.

Third week i started running again and signed up for some coursera courses

Fourth week i saw some estranged coworkers on a business trip. Got compliments all day about how good i looked - not sure if anyone guessed that the difference was booze (i did pass on drinks at a happy hour that night, but i said it was because of the calories) though i think they knew. I felt amazing on the train home, like i'd figured out some secret weapon in life.

2 years later i was in bed taking a half day because my hangover palpitations were getting bad and the panic attacks were back. That wasnt even what got me to stop again.


 i can relive the magic of getting sober every day i stay sober, just gotta put in the work and be grateful.

 I've personally known people who got sober with no meetings, but I've accepted that I just can't do it without an IRL support system. I'm so sick of booze at this point, I have so many little strategies to string a few days together, not really worth mentioning as their clearly inneffective and i have ran out of imagination. I was the only newcomer of like 32 people so it was interesting but everyone was very welcoming. I'm planning on going tomorrow.

I'd love any  critiques or praise of meetings too, I'll never be evangelical in my posts about them but I'm curious and interested in unraveling this whole novel (to me) experience.

Like..... I must say, that was the first time that I had people talking in real life about this stuff to me AT ALL. Most people I know are hopeless drinkers. And just HEARING people talk about these things, saying it's never too late, being vulnerable, that was VERY healing for me. The guy being kind but adamant ""Please, just don't drink tonight. Call any one of these numbers if you think you will"" That was so healing for me personally. I'm very independent, no real friends, and I'm coming to terms with how lonely i've become: It's so important to stay connected to other humans in any way we can.

I think I have finally come to terms with the fact that I have let alcohol get the best of me.  I am a 37 year old who since college has consistently binged 1-2 nights a week.  I am now beginning to realize how much this is catching up to me.  

I am fortunately healthy otherwise, but have recently noticed my lack of energy and motivation.  I hold down a FT job and handle my responsibilities, but no longer have the motivation to go the extra mile, etc and always feel a bit tired.  The only time I feel completely full of energy is when im binging.

Have people gotten on the other side of this and gotten that energy back, or have I gone too far?

I’ve been on and off the wagon for my entire adult life (started drinking at 13 mid 30’s now). I’ve always had problem drinking tendencies, often in my youth I would get black out drunk (and more often than I’d like to admit it happening as an adult). I’ve discussed getting help in the past to friends and family but the people around me would often down play and say it wasn’t that bad, or I would talk myself out of needing help because I wasn’t what most considered “rock bottom”

I would have months of self control where I could have a couple and stop, followed by a binge where I’d make a complete ass of myself often embarrassing the shit out of my awesome husband. He’s always hoped I’d get myself under control and stay under control, but for me it’s just a ticking time bomb for when I’ll lose control and become drunk mom again.

I have kids, I’m self employed, I own and maintain my house, I take care of myself and my kids, but mommy loves her wine and it needs to stop. Last year I lost my best friend due to complications from alcoholism, she left 3 kids behind, we didn’t know how bad it truly was until she was needing a transplant and they wouldn’t do it because she was a drunk. She was one of the ones who always downplayed my problems jokingly saying “if you’re an alcoholic what does that make me?!” She would often stick up for me to my husband when he was rightfully pissed after a night of bullshit from me always saying “she’s just having fun, leave her alone” And then she died. Her kids are young, but old enough to remember drunk mom. I never ever want my kids to remember drunk mom.

My dad is a “functional alcoholic” as well and when my first was a baby he was living with us. He had a bad accident caused by drinking and I was the one who found him and had to help him and call 911. He survived but I have severe lasting trauma. I never want that to happen for my kids.

But it’s so freaking hard. All my friends drink, it’s so common now it’s weird if you don’t. Mommy wine culture is so ingrained in society it’s inescapable. T-shirts and memes, tv and movies, I can’t avoid it. People always think of alcoholics as bums who can’t hold down a job drinking their lives away. But in reality it’s also a shit load of drunk ass moms hiding wine in coffee cups at the park giving knowing winks to each other. And this is normal? 

I had a frank conversation with my husband the other day about my drinking. He told me he has been super impressed lately by my self control. However, my best friend died, then I was pregnant and had a baby, all during the pandemic. It wasn’t self control, it was lack of opportunity. Lately I’ve been drinking bottles of wine to myself while I cook dinner and it’s not okay. I told him I’m done, I need to not drink anything. It’s easier for me to have nothing, then to have one and have to try and contain the drunken mom beast, because once I have one it’s pretty much out of my control. 

Anyways, hoping to connect with some former drunk moms who actually have coffee in their coffee cups at the park.

Do y'all relate?","For a very long time I have been in the brutal cycle of starting again and stopping again. For a long time I was just in denial. Then I was stuck, isolated, and miserable. A year ago I actually got help I needed badly and I was in rehab for twenty-one days. After that I made it to my birthday before slipping again, 67 sober days total. After that, for the last year, I have been starting and stopping starting and stopping. Sober for almost a month, drunk for two weeks, sober for a week, drunk for three until a particularly bad day, sober for three weeks, drunk for four days, sober for four days, and on and on

Beginning of December felt like I had finally hit my breaking point, I wanted to be ""better"" so badly. I thought to myself, ""this is it, I'm going to do it this time, I've got to""  
And then I drank again the whole first week of January. With the help of this sub, support of my partner, an action plan and a healthy dose of self reflection I picked myself up again. I thought to myself, ""this time. This time is it."" 

and I've been doing really really well. I'm much healthier, clear headed, so much less anxious, the self hatred is nearly gone, and I've been so so much happier. My life has found a sense of peace, I have motivation to move forward in big ways where before I was crippled with anxiety, my relationship has grown deeper, I'm spending more time on my hobbies and with my best friends. It's all I've been wanting for myself. It really has felt like maybe this time will stick, something is actually working, maybe I actually rounded a corner and I've actually proved myself capable of change. But part of me is so scared I might be wrong. It hasn't actually been \*that\* long, I've never successfully stayed sober very long. 

I'm coming up on 67 days this time. Since I hit 30 days I have had my mind on 70 days as my next big milestone, a nice round number to mark my longest ever sober streak. It has been my goal this whole time and I'm almost there. I'm feeling a lot of different things. I'm proud of myself. I feel protective of my days, I fought damn hard to get here no way I want to go back. And I'm nervous because I've felt that and slipped anyway many times before. What if I get complacent because I am ""doing well"". What if I hit 70 days and lose all my motivation. I do know  that if I slip I will pick myself back up again and keep going. Its not relapsing that scares me. It is loosing the life I have and want for myself, loosing myself again that scares me. I want so so badly for this to be the turning point in my life and I know that time is the only way to prove that it is. So, right now I'm a whole messy bunch of feelings while I wait and do my best in the meantime. 

I guess I'm posting here partially to help make sense of the mess, partially to vent to people who at least empathize, and partially hoping to hear from others who have been in similar spots or who have been doing this longer than me. I really want to be the many years sober person with advice to share one day, right now I'm the newbie asking for it.

We have a family wedding coming up in the summer time and I told him how anxious I felt about it... We are a large Irish family of drinkers and I've never seen my family drunk from the outside looking in, I've always been a part of the party. It will be strange, but I am confident I can do it sober. He suggested why not just have one or two drinks at the wedding? I explained to him that I don't think that would be a good idea and I am genuinely frightened of even giving myself the opportunity to go back to my old habit of getting blackout drunk and making awful decisions. I know he doesn't understand how it feels for that not to be an option....but it really got under my skin that he said this. We actually ended up having a bit of a heated discussion about it. He told me that I can't just blame alcohol for it and I should just try harder to 'moderate'.

I have so many feelings about this discussion...it got me speaking a million miles an hour defending my choice to be sober and I can feel my heart beating even as I write this.

Anyway, super happy to be drinking a peppermint tea in bed.

50 something here.

Have drank regularly since I was 18. Most days I have about 6 beers or a bottle of wine. 

Last year I had a scare, after a night out with friends and more wine than usual my wife fell down the stairs onto a hard tiled floor and was in hospital for 5 days with bad concussion and some muscle injury, she still has some after effects.

Immediately after the fall we both didn’t drink for a month. But as time passed we got back to our old ways.

Last night we had a meal at our favourite restaurant and during the night had about 1.5 bottles of wine each. My wife went to the bathroom and slipped and hit her head again, hopefully not as bad this time but she’s now in hospital.

These have been two of the worst nights of my life. This feels like a double warning. I need to stop drinking.

Problem is I don’t know if I can and I’m afraid of my life without alcohol. I think I drink to escape stress and worry but it’s also the basis of my social life. I don’t know how to be a sober adult or what I’ll replace it with.

Guess what I’m looking for is success stories from others, especially in my age group. I want the better sleep and the clearer head and I need to believe I’ll be happier and less stressed.",12,0

This group is amazing. I’m a long time lurker. I was/am inspired by this group, but didn’t take any steps myself.

I never admitted that I had an issue with alcohol although I knew I did in my heart. I grew up with great parents... except they were gone Friday night and Saturday night partying downtown, then spent all day Sunday in bed hungover. They never missed my sister or my lacrosse games and were extremely involved, but drinking controlled their lives. 

I had control over alcohol until I started law school. My parents announced that they were getting a divorce during my first week of school, I was in a new state living with new people, and about to embark on the biggest challenge of my life. I lost control. I found comfort at a local bar that I would go to almost nightly. If I wasn’t there, I was in my room drinking. Almost always alone. That pattern didn’t stop after graduation. 

Mid-February, I had a thought... “how can people do ______ without drinking?” No matter the activity, the part I was most interested in was whether it was a good excuse to drink. That’s when I admitted that I have a problem. Alcohol shouldn’t control what I do, but it was. I was curiously envious of people that could have one or two drinks and call it a night. When I drank, it was to get drunk. 

I pledged to take the month of March off knowing that if I told myself I was quitting indefinitely, March 1st would come and go and I would still be drinking regularly. 

Only 1 week in but I’m feeling better, I have more confidence in myself, my anxiety and depression have been easier to control, and I’m overall happier. Alcohol was a tool I used to control my overwhelming stress, but the control I was feeling was an illusion. I wasn’t in control, alcohol was. 

If it wasn’t for this group, I’d still be in denial. Thank you to each and every one of you for your strength, honesty, and vulnerability. None of us are alone although each battle is unique!

I've been particularly aware of my mood after drinking last night (1.5 L light beer), didn't sleep well of course, lately I tend to drink between midnight and 2-3 AM when everyone else is sleeping.

One big issue I noticed when working on multiple projects with a semi-hangover and not enough sleep is the big emotional rollercoaster I'm going through throughout the day.

My brain firing away thoughts like these: 

\- you won't finish this project on time

\- oh it's not that complicated

 \- you won't make it

\- I think this feature will look cool ! I can do it.

\- they won't use your work

\- this is not the right decision

\- people count on you

\- are you going to disappoint them again?

This is coupled with ups and downs, depressed for an hour, motivated another, anxious afterwards, then peaceful now.

I usually don't experience this without drinking....

My hangovers are rarely the physical form anymore, no headache rarely any stomache issues, they now have taken the shape of the mental.
I have two little kids that look up to me and I have no problem waking up at 5 in the morning to help get them ready for the day but if it's any earlier in the night I am completely passed out and no help to my wife at all. That will all change now.
After reading many of the stories here I hear a lot of complaints about the physical hangover.  I am curious if there are many out there that do not have those symptoms anymore and instead feel hungover from the mental issues that your head goes through after a night of drinking?

I'll reach day 20 tonight. I did okay getting through the first 2 weeks and now 3 weeks is so close. I've been trying to get a job and had two interviews since I quit, which were great to have a clear head for.

But as soon as I get a rejection, I want a drink to drown my sorrows. When I'm bored between job searching and exercising, I want a drink to feel the buzz. Today I finally got a job offer -- I'm relieved, happy, grateful -- yet I still REALLY want a drink to celebrate. I logically know this would be self-sabotage and a terrible idea. I still WANT IT SO MUCH. Right now, I'm writing this instead.

Everything that happens or doesn't happen makes me want alcohol, whether circumstances are good, bad or bland. Anything I do, whether it's completing a jog or (ironically) reaching any milestone of abstinence instantly pops into my brain with ""Phew, I got through that, so I deserve a drink"". Even when all I've done is something pathetically basic, like finish house chores. I want my ""reward"". I want that release and chemical ""pat on the back"".

With me, I can't moderate. I know ""a drink"" = as many as I can fit in for the rest of the day until I pass out. I can only control it while I don't have a sip. I'll want the fridge full of cans and bottles, and somehow they'll be gone within hours and I'll be figuring out how to subtly visit the shop again.

I don't want to be a slave to that compulsion and the constant fear of what it's doing (done) to me health-wise. To be honest, I'm not sure there's enough incentive yet other than health-worries. If someone could guarantee I can drink to excess and live a physically healthy life until I'm 70+, I'd carry on. I know that's selfish. The reasons should run deeper - more desire to be better and clear-minded for my job, relationships, etc. But 95% of the time I've got away with being a functioning drinker.

I wish I could be the sort of person who simply has one or two drinks on a Friday and Saturday night and that's it. Not possible for me. I've proven it time and time again. Once I start, I can't stop.

A crazy thing before I started writing this - I grabbed the keys to drive to the shop ""for food"", knowing deep down I was at high risk of picking up alcohol along with it. But the car wouldn't start. It's got a flat battery. No idea how, that hasn't happened in years... I'm taking it as a sign.

My wife and I had a gift card to a restaurant so last weekend we took our son and went to dinner. We sat down and looked over the menu and I see that they have the Zero alcohol Laginitas “hop refresher”. I had seen some Facebook ads for it over the past few weeks and wanted to try it. So I ordered it and when the girl repeated “Laginitas” I said “yes the non alcoholic one”. 

We get our appetizers and order our meals and they bring our drinks. I take a sip and go “oh man. That’s really good” my wife is happy I like it. I finish it and order another one.... the girl brings it to the table and I ask “these are really good, this is the non alcoholic one right?” 

The look on her face was mortified, her eyes got so wide and she snatched the drink right out of my hand.

I felt terrible like I had been cheated on. My face must have given it away because she got the manager with out me even asking.

When he showed up I explained to him what had happened and it was an honest mistake, but I have been sober for over 6 months and only wanted the non alcoholic drink. 

He personally came and brought me the “Hop Refresher” and poured it for me at the table and comped our entire meal because he felt terrible. 

Our poor waitress must have been embarrassed because she avoided our table the rest of the time we were there. But I made sure to go hand her a cash tip and let her know that it was a mistake and shit happens.

I am glad I had the sense to ask because I would have definitely kept drinking them. A strong will power to stop after one is what saved me. 

I had one beer unbeknownst to me and was able to stop. I’m not resetting my counter because I never wanted it. But One take away from this is... if you order a non alcoholic drink, make sure they understand what you are asking for. It could have evened up very very bad. IWNDWYT",3180,0

No one major thing, but an accumulation of little things over the course of years, fueled by my own addictive tendencies, led to the collapse of our marriage culminating in me leaving on Sunday. As I start to work with attorneys and family members to figure out what is next, I have come to the conclusion - at the strong suggestion of my family members - that I need to address this or things are only going to get worse. I could be putting my relationship with my son in jeopardy if I don't.   


I don't want to do a program like AA - I'm not spiritual and I don't like their approach towards personal freedom and personal power in general. However, I do think some sort of structured program would be the best for me, as I have a proven track record of languishing when I'm not put in a structured environment of self-improvement. So if anyone here has stories, suggestions, or ideas on how to proceed, I'm all ears.

# The Final Blow

&#x200B;

Dear alcohol, this is my letter to you to say our long tumultuous relationship is finally coming to an end. You've been nothing but trouble to me since the very start in 2015. Our first encounter led to one of my most regretable mistakes, I was in the wrong myself, but you insisted I become disorderly. For years we've had this affair, throughout all the love I've recieved from people, you wound up taking it away from me so we could cry at nostalgic videos or scream and become violent when people were only trying to help. A word I will bring up in this many times will be the word ""HELP""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The beginning:**

You began as a coping mechanism when I was at my worst, I felt like I could confide in you when it felt as if no one else was around. I remember when we seceretly met for the first time without the parents knowing. I can feel that first sip of you burning my throat and how nice thirteen year old me felt afterwards. I can remember storing you in my toy portal gun box so I could drink with my friend. (Who never came so we waited till 2016). I remember when we celebrated the beginning of my first band video with my first drink at 14. The warm feeling as I walked down the road to meet my parents finally realising what the phrase ""DRUNK"" meant. (At least I thought I did at the time). I didn't know at this point you'd create such a negative impact on my life, I thought we would be good friends. We were young and dumb, to me you were. We met only a few times after this, I wasn't interested in you. Why would I be? I was a fourteen year old child going to a school which was most likely built because of the damage you've done.

&#x200B;

You remember her don't you? The girlfriend who plays a big part in our bitter-jealous relationship. When you made her slump outside the bar after my show on a table, I thought nothing of it, but then again why would I care? I was fifteen with a passion for music. The sex, drugs and rock and roll which is always proclaimed to be a part of an artist's life didn't cross my mind... yet.

It was around this time, I was already a little unfair to her, not the best boyfriend I could've been, but it was about to become much worse in the coming months.

It was New Year's Eve 2015, you were there, I was told not to be with you that night by my parents. You led me in with the peer pressure of her family members. We connected properly for the first time that night. The beginning of my chaos-loving sensationalist self when we cross paths. That night I became an overdramatic maniac and started pretending I was in a drama series or something to that degree. I can't ask you why you made me do what I did, because there was obviously a part of me which is finding something else to blame. I guess it's natural when you love avoiding responsiblity as much as I do. That's the main reason we can't continue this any longer. What began on New Years Eve leading into 2016 became the running theme of our entire relationship.

&#x200B;

**""Incompatibility"".**

That word is, We're at a crossroads like Robert Johnson, where he allegedly sold his soul at the crossroads in exchange for talent and fame. I love you more than any girlfriend/boyfriend I've ever had. You've been the most loyal friend I've ever had. If I had money we could meet and forget the world exists for 8 hours. Until you leave my body and I have to go through pain for 24 hours.

Look at my friends, every one of them. It's always the same show with different characters. We cannot meet any of them together. We can't just have a little secret because the word will get out and we'll end up in trouble again. I don't know why we met because you've made my life a mess. But I still love you more than you'll ever know.

Look at 2017 with the headbutting incident, where you told me all these insecurities and lies I thought were true. Then without thinking I acted in violence. Look at a few weeks after when we made a fool out of ourselves at a party. Just a day before that we were screaming at my best friends out of pure paranoia. You manipulated my mind like an abusive partner, you made me believe my worst fears were really the reality of my life.

Look what I've done to every meaningfull person in my life thanks to you. My best friends all the way from childhood to now. Every one of them leaves for one reason. You...  We meet up, we enjoy ourselves together, but does anyone else? Of course they don't. How could they when we yell in their face and try to assault them because of some fragmented thought I've created from you.

&#x200B;

**My Family:**

&#x200B;

You're already doing a great job at taking away my nan, every day it seems she wants to see you. You rule everywhere here. You're tearing apart my entire life. For years I've seen you like my family. The days I'd be excited to have enough money to see you, the walks down the road to the shop. I see you on all the shelves and I don't know which one to pick! The joy as I leave the shop and begin my walk home only to know when I get in I can forget about my miserable life. Then the dread as I walk in the house to have my mother or father scold me for drinking. ""They'll never understand"" I thought, but then how could they? I'm just a moron.

For years it's been this way, I can't take it anymore, you're making my life impossible. When we cut ties in October I didn't think we'd need to meet again. Clearly you found yourself in the right place at the right time.

&#x200B;

**The Trauma**

You manipulated me into thinking you were helping my life, in reality you were destroying it. Every last fucking part of it. You took my friends away and when I was sad, you comforted me by becoming my friend. When I was too anxious to insert myself in conversation, you helped me become a degenerate fool. Now I must say to you alcohol, no more.

&#x200B;

**The Deal:**

When the world is normal in a few months, I won't see you, if you're around my friends, I won't speak to you, I won't think about you. I will remove myself if someone wants me to be with you, I won't let you take me over again. One day I'll reflect on this letter and be happy I saw you off before you took me to hell. I don't hate you, I just hate what you've done to me.

The last three years of my life have been at your mercy, I've been powerless to you and you put all these thoughts in my head. If I'd never touched you I guarentee my music career would have more success than it does right now. You've made me into everything I hate alcohol. I know you're not bad at your core, despite being poison. I know you're not the villain, but you turned me into one. I let myself become this horrible person because I was more interested in finding you again. But now as I turn 21 in the next 2 months, I can safely say this life we've created together is no longer feesable for me. What if I become sucessful? What will you do when I go to parties? Make me hit Yungblud or some other famous artist? As silly as it sounds It's a genuine question.

For 4 months I stopped seeing you and it worked out fine. I never missed you until valentine's day. You were the only love I had. But now I'm losing weight so other people will love me. I don't need you anymore.

&#x200B;

**Goodbye:**

This is it. I'll see you in the hands of everyone in show business, I'll see you in the hands of the poor souls you've taken in the form of homelessness, I'll see you in the hands of my friends. But you'll never see yourself in the hands of mine.

When you want to drink again,
Remember the occasions when,

Your heart has suffered, and your mind,
And happy thoughts are hard to find.

The week it takes to feel alright,
The palpitations day and night,

The constant anxious feelings too,
As panic grips you through and through.

The wasted days and sheer regret,
You find so easy to forget,

And go again when things seem fine,
“This time won’t be like last time”.

That thought will rear it’s ugly head,
And that’s the time to kill it dead,

Use all your strength to force it out,
And then instead just think about,

The hurt you’d cause to others too, 
The ones that love and cherish you. 

So when you want another drink,
Before you do, just stop and think.

Take care everyone ❤️",9,0

Here is to day 2 - one day farther away from feeling like trash. I miss that day 12 feeling, I really do. For me, I think it's great that I hit that 12 day mark which is a record.

...Alas, but no it won in the end. I saw it happening, I let it happen. Now I really see what's going on, I know what I have to do and I know how to stop it. 

Let it be a lesson to you - if you fail, try again. Please keep trying, each time you learn something and maybe the next time things will stick. As for me? I'm back at it again and doing my best for today. 

I will not drink with you today. I could abbreviate it, but I need to see it spelled out :)",8,0

I have known that my husband would start again the whole time; this was never permanent for him. That’s fine. I love him with every fiber of my being and this has never been a deal breaker for me. I’d always worried that I’d start up with him. Drinking with him is natural and fun. Not that we don’t drink all things—we do—but we especially have always enjoyed pairing great wine with great food (we have both been in the wine industry for decades, and yes, we are both on the hunt for new employment, it’s not easy during a pandemic). 

Last night, my husband bought two beautiful filets from the local butcher, arguably the best in our city. I knew he would drink some amazing red wine, and I knew I’d want some. Honestly, I’d already given myself permission when he said he wanted good steak. 

But something happened—reflexively, I played the tape forward. I realized that I wanted to sleep well, didn’t want to have a hangover, and wanted to enjoy my morning coffee instead of having it jumpstart a panic attack. And I wanted all that MORE than I wanted wine with dinner. 

I also realized that right now, one glass of wine is unrealistic for me. I love the complexity of wine, I appreciate every aspect of its production and its nuance. I also know myself—and swallowing a little bit would just leave me wanting to be drunk. I can sense how that would feel and I’m not strong enough to resist it. Maybe I will be in the future (I am aware of how unrealistic moderation is when you have use disorder of course), but it’s not possible right now. At the end of that glass I would have been looking for vodka to shoot straight. 

I understood the challenge of abstaining while my husband indulged as a personal milestone—if I could do it in that moment, maybe it would only get easier each time I was faced with that situation. 

So my husband had a glass of wine and I did not. I poured myself a mocktail that I had been saving for a special occasion (Curious Elixir No. 1). It was nice with the steak and it scratched the itch. I had restful sleep, woke up feeling clear, and enjoyed my awesome coffee. 

This is an accomplishment for me. My husband is also proud of me—it feels good to know he sees me as strong. I wanted to share here also because I really have no one else to share this accomplishment with. I’d love to hear from those who also have partners who continue to drink alcohol. 

Wishing everyone a wonderful day—it’s supposed to go up to 60 in Brooklyn today! IWNDWYT",315,1

The one friend I kind of regret doing it to but the other one I’m glad I did. I needed to get their toxic personality out of my life. But I wish I would’ve done it a better way. It’s like losing part of my personality but I’m still quite okay with it? Idk guys I’m in a weird state. The last 48 hours have been the usual sweaty shaky tremor ridden withdrawals I’m used to combined with my weird mood swings. Now as I come back to reality I know what I’m doing. I have to get back on the wagon. I stayed sober for 4 months. The longest in years. I have to get back on it because I was my most happy at that time. Only difference with this endeavour will be losing weight. I made the mistake of replacing booze with food and I gained loads of weight. I wish I could be one of these gym goers but I hate exercise. I can’t screw it up this time man. Every time I I relapse I become worse.,6,0

It's been 138 days sober and honestly not drinking has been pretty easy, but now I'm realizing I don't like the same things or same people anymore. I'm not even talking about drinking buddies or alcohol activities.
 
I also found myself still in the habit of thinking I'm a lazy garbage human, but I catch moments where I realize I'm not that and remind myself to allow for recalibration of my baseline. My brain isn't in the habit of hope and goals, so the biggest challenge isn't the abstinence from alcohol, it's changing my thought patterns about the rest of life.
 
Also a sidenote: I know this probably not most people's experience, but going to a 60 day in-patient rehab that also treated underlying mental problems was CRITICAL for me. Having proper mental health care really was my answer. I really don't like AA for many reasons, but that is such an unpopular opinion that people think I'm making a huge mistake. I feel the exact opposite, going to AA makes me want to drink, and I'm not powerless over alcohol. I don't need a higher power to control MY behavior. I felt hopeless going to AA during my dark days and hearing some dude say he was 14 years sober but the sadness and misery in his voice made me question if it was worth it.",23,0

Im back here after a long 2 years after i first realized i am an alcoholic. 2 years ago, i decided i needed to quit, as i was drinking 6-8beers a night by myself and nights of partying with friends up to 15 beers... and i did quit. 

Dont get me wrong, it wasnt easy... but somehow after multiple sleepless nights, feeling sick, i managed to go a full week without drinking. Then 2. Then a month. Then a whole year. 

At this point was when i decided i could reintroduce alcohol to my life, that i could moderate it. Drink only with friends, and on special occasions. I know now that isnt the case. At times i would succeed, and have 2-3 beers, and have a nice night. At other times, i would binge, and get absolutely wasted, to the point of not functioning the next day. 

Finally this past weekend i had one of those nights where i got terribly out of control, puked everywhere. I probably couldve died, all i remember is laying on my side sleeping and puking.  And my friends had to take care of me again. Im amazed they are even my friends anymore. 

I finally know now. I need to quit for life. I cant moderate my drinking. The risk for catastrophe is too high. Im an alcoholic and IWNDWYT.",24,0

I’m anxious, but still hopeful and holding onto that. I’ve spent far too much of my life trying to appear normal and okay to the rest of the world, hiding my illness and letting it take over while I hid in the shadows; drunk and scared.

I’ve ruined or stunted every relationship in my life and thats especially true of my marriage. My behavior didn’t just ruin my own mental health, but I dragged my wife down into the mud with me. I was verbally abusive to her to the point that I should have been arrested. I became subhuman. My only instinct was to keep up the charade and to keep everyone out. 

She kicked me out on Sunday and I’m staying with my elderly parents for the time being while I get myself clean and find a program. I have an apt set for Thursday for an intensive out patient, but that feels like forever away.

I may have ruined any chance at reconciling with my wife. And I couldn’t blame her for it, of course. When I can muster the strength to see the last couple of years thru her eyes I hate myself. Every horrible thing I said to her was like I was screaming into a mirror... but I wasn’t screaming into a mirror; I was screaming at the only person who still loved me. I acted like this in front of our 16 month old son, Elijah. What kind of monster could ever do that? 

I grew up with an alcoholic grandfather who lived with us. I hated him growing up. And yet I grew up to be him. 

I have contemplated death. If I could just remove myself from this cycle everything would be better off. People wouldn’t have to worry and I wouldn’t be this miserable burden that can’t function in the world. 

But I won’t. Thats an option I’m not allowing myself to consider. The desire to remove myself, to just disappear so I stop spreading my misery and hurting others, will not win. I will heal myself. Slowly, but surely, build myself again. And I will mend every broken bridge I burned down to keep others from seeing what I became. 

I want to live. I will hurt, and I will stumble, but I want to live. I want to feel connected to the world again and I want to feel human again. I can’t do any of those things with alcohol in my life.  

This community has been huge for helping me with feeling like I am not alone.

I had my last drink on Monday 2 weeks ago. That day I wasn’t supposed to drink but made a deal with myself that this was the last time. Sounds not too bad but I made that deal with myself on the Sunday evening too. And many times in the weeks before. The drinking was escalating because the more I tried to quit the more I drank more for my ‘one last time’. There were now 3 beers before and 2 after the whisky I was already drinking too much of. 

I woke up exactly 2 weeks ago and did not feel great. My first thoughts were not going to drink today but I had those thoughts every morning for weeks. Not sure what changed that day but my first thought was I am not enjoying whisky anymore. I’m telling myself evening after evening it’s one more time but I do this and don’t enjoy it anymore. I realised I was chasing my idea of fun while drinking but it hadn’t been fun in a long time. I guess that made me stick to it.

Once I began, in all honesty, it wasn’t that hard. I reasoned with myself in the mornings and have had zero cravings. I believe this has more to do with the fact that coming up to this I had 5 relapses in the previous 5 weeks and all at day 4. I think I kind of developed during those relapses.

The benefits - immense. I’m not over it yet but tummy bloating and pain are reduced but still there. Swelling in face also reduced. Mentally I am much better. I have been working better and also more attentive to those around me. When I began I managed 1.5 press ups and 4K steps. I’m now up to 3 sets of 7 press ups, 12k steps and full upper body workout with resistance bands. I will try and do more as I go along. 

My observation - well I try not to think too much. I need to learn mindfulness at some point. But the one thing that has struck me is my idea of reward. Whisky was my reward. But for what? Nothing really as I drank on a good day, bad day, and everything in between. The idea that my problems can be dealt with through drink or anything else is my mind playing tricks. We are supposed to feel what happens now in the now. All drinking does is move the problem to the next day and probably makes it bigger at the same time. What happens today is meant to be felt today and dealt with in a constructive manner.

Linked to this is the general idea of ‘relaxing’ and ‘reward’. My mind has a warped idea of this concept. As in, I’m supposed to do something in a Friday night. It’s just an idea that I have because that is what people around me have always done. But the last two Fridays this is what I did - log off from work at 5.30 (working from home), go for a walk while it’s still light outside, dinner around 6.30 and then tv or some form of entertainment. And I enjoyed it. 3 weeks ago I would not have believed it is someone said that to me but in all honesty it feels great. I want to be boring, I want the peace that comes and most of all I am fed up of seeing alcohol through the eyes of society. It’s not fun, it’s not normal and it shouldn’t be part of weekly life!

Thank you for all the support. This sub is a big reason why I made it 14 days. I will need help as I have a big change coming soon. But for now all focus is on making it 15 days and IWNDWYT.

Edit: I also forgot to mention that I am now well outside the window for serious withdrawals. Given how much I was drinking I am very fortunate to have made it out in one piece. That is also something I am grateful for and top of my list of reasons not to go back.",7,0

I also woke up without my top notch MacBook Pro, and I have tried finding it, but it’s gone. Literally taking my high end computer with me and not knowing where I lost it because of how blasted I was. I’m not insured, so there’s that, too. 

I don’t know why I keep doing this. Getting drunk. Losing things. Hurting others, hurting myself. Losing myself, a little more every day. Personal life is in absolute shambles, lost each and every friend. What’s it going to take for me to stop drinking? Losing my life? I swore I’d never go down the same road my parents went. They both died from drinking. 

At 18, I drove drunk and lost my license. Haven’t driven drunk since then. Have lost a guitar while being drunk on a train. And now I’ve lost the only computer I have. These are just battery powered things. Life goes on. 

I hate this feeling of not knowing where I’ve been, what I’ve said or what I’ve done. 

Here I am, getting drunk again. Am at my partners place while partner is at work, and will have to leave for the overnight thing again soon. I show all the signs of serious physical damage, like red palms, visible veins everywhere, pains behind the rib cage.

- I still feel super tired and really should go to bed earlier

- I’ve realised that some of the stuff I used to do in the evenings (video games mainly) was just a vehicle for my drinking. Now that I’ve stopped, I’ve largely lost interest in them. Weird. 

- My son is 13 and was getting interested in what I was drinking (“can I have a sip Dad?”). I no longer want to normalise daily alcohol drinking in this family. Stopping was absolutely the right thing to do. 

- I’ve not ruled out drinking in moderation in the future but I’m aware that it is a slippery slope so am treating it with extreme caution.

- I’m enjoying my life without booze so far. Summer will be difficult (BBQs in the garden etc), but I’m ready for the challenge.

I had a traumatizing experience, binged and now I feel like I have lost my skills and abilities. I'm scared.","I have recently gone through a breakup. The initial time was fine and I was fairly stable (though I was drinking), but then something happened that made me realize there really was no going back and I went into a bad binge. I must have drank daily for two or three weeks, often drinking myself into a stupor. A couple of times during that I also took a lot of ketamine, and cocaine once.

I believe that rather than this having been simple heartbreak it was a retraumatizing experience because of certain things in my past. My issue is with the mental state I am in now. I am afraid that the binge has damaged my brain. Today is my third day sober and I'm not sure how best to explain it but I no longer feel like myself.

Prior to the binge, even after the breakup, I was producing music in my studio. I have been making music for a long time, and being an electronic musician I knew a lot about the music technology that goes with it. But when I went into my studio following the binge I found that I no longer knew the most basic things. I had to look up everything online, and eventually I gave up.

This gave me a scare. The morning after I woke up and found that my mind was blank, and that I couldn't remember the simplest things, let alone anything about the skills I used to have (for instance, today I couldn't remember my ex' stepmother's name). I also truly don't feel like myself. It's like certain parts of my personality have simply been cut off. 

Of course I do remember what certain things are for, like a sequencer or a compressor. But I can't seem to recall my techniques with using these, and even some of the basic features on my machines I have no memory of how to use.

I am in a constant panic, and I'm afraid that I will never regain what I seem to have lost. Perhaps the mix of alcohol and ketamine has really damaged my brain? If anyone has had a similar experience, please share it. Also, if you know of good online communities dealing with this sort of thing I would really appreciate pointers.",6,0

I never intended  on stopping for good but now I just feel I'd  feel guilty to drink again, especially  the way I was. 3-8 drinks a night 3-5 x a week. All my social interactions. 

BUT learning to navigate  life without  it is still stressful. I live at work, I can't  see my family  bc covid, they  all live in another  state. I barley see my boyfriend  maybe  10-30 min every  other  day and a hi/bye in the morning. I'm  physically  and mentally  exhaused, and I have no off button for the stress.

How did I ever  work full time, go to school full time, and deal with hangovers multiple  times a week?

Happy Tuesday, Folks!

So allow me to sit crooked and talk straight with you all. I have been going through some shit. Good shit, bad shit, high shit, low shit, some literal landslides and explosions, as well as metaphorical ones. So basically a little bit of all of the shit. It’s been one of those weeks. So I haven’t been reading or watching anything like I intended to this past week. I had every intention of finishing off the Steve-O memoir I mentioned last week, and then moving on to the Stoics. The same friend with the impeccable taste and brilliant intellect who recommended Ted Lasso to me, also sent me some books in the mail (a big dose of the aforementioned “high shit”), one of which is *On the Shortness of Life* by Seneca, which I did start but each sentence is so densely packed that I wouldn’t even know where to begin (more of the high shit) - you’ll just have to read it yourselves. So, basically, I had these big plans to write something all clever and thought-provoking, or what-have-you, connecting Steve-O the jackass, and his sobriety, with an ancient Roman Philosopher, but I just ain’t up to all that this week. But if any of you have any thoughts on it, I’d really love to hear them in the comments below.

But what I am up to this week is the audiobook version of *The Clan of the Cave Bear.* Our own u/Cheebyl recommended it to me. And I remembered my mom reading it when I was little, and that she loved it, so I was super keen to read it, and I have not been disappointed. I wanted a really good, worthwhile novel to escape into, and this is hitting the spot, big time. The prehistoric setting is such a nice change from the world we live in, enough to get lost in imagination, yet the humanity is the same, so it’s still very real and relatable, and you can’t not care about the characters. It is undoubtedly the right book at the right time for me. There is magic and medicine in that book, I’m tellin’ ya.

I’d love to hear about books, movies, podcasts, or whatever, that you read, saw, heard at the exact right time. The ones that hit the spot, or gave you something you might not have received in the same way at a different time. What was magic and medicine for you and why?

Although in my youth I did my fair share of binge-drinking, in adulthood I rarely drank to ""excess"".  I haven't had an actual hangover for like 15 years.  When I do those online tests for problem drinking I always score low (ok, so I *do* 'drink alone', but I'm a loner so I do *everything* alone.)

But, as I've gotten older, I just don't think my body/brain can handle it like I used to.  I noticed that I was drinking both more regularly (3-5 nights a week) and always end up drinking more that the supposed 2-drink allowance (4-6 drinks).  And the upshot is I think if I go on like this I may really endanger my health.  I've noticed one warning sign already which is that I get negative effects more often now e.g. nausea, headaches, depressed feelings, sleep issues.  The other thing I've noticed is just tends to lead me into making dumb decisions (like blowing off projects that are important to me, or clumsy moves like the time I put a frozen pizza in the oven upside down - in my defense it was a plain cheese pizza so you can see how that might happen!)

Anyway, I wanted to give the sobriety thing a trial run to see how i felt about it, and also as a sort of self-check if I had developed a real dependency.   So today is my 82nd day without a drink (my plan was to go 90 days - but I may extend that now.).  It's been relatively easy so far (I miss it, but don't crave it).  But I'm realizing, I think alcohol, at this point in my life, will only get riskier and have diminishing returns.  I feel it hitting me harder physically and mood-wise, and I also feel it interferes with positive things I want to do like meditate regularly and read more, etc.  And I really enjoy not feeling sick after one too many drinks.  There is also the real possibility of slipping into a real dependence one day, without even realizing I did.

I had thought about maybe ""downshifting"" to moderation, but if I'm being honest with myself I know the idea of 1-2 drinks just won't work.  It's like eating a single potato chip, I'd rather just skip it.  Anyway not really sure why I'm posting - I guess I'm curious if others have reached a similar conclusion as me - that whether I ""technically"" have a problem or not, maybe I've just had enough booze for one lifetime and it's not worth pressing my luck.",6,0

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Tuesday/Wednesday, SD! 

It’s such a pleasure reading all your comments! Yesterday, it sounded like many of you shared the idea that connecting with other people is a basic human need, and pointed out how tough the past year of pandemic living has been as a result. 

A lot of you mentioned that you believe connection and attachment with other people are important, but have a hard time getting there, or are actively workin’ on it at least. For many of us, drinking served as a poor substitute for connection, and/or a barrier to achieving connection at the same time. Getting sober allows us to embrace connection anew! But it’s really hard work sometimes—I definitely honor that. 

Connection requires vulnerability. Vulnerability requires trust. At the end of the day, as much work as we choose to engage with as individuals, the way other people treat us is always going to be part of the trust equation. With trust and vulnerability, we either experience a virtuous or a vicious cycle depending on how skillfully we show people how we want them to treat us and whether or not they respect our boundaries. 

One of my favorite tools for showing people I trust how I want them to treat me is Non-Violent Communication. There are a lot of different resources within that, but the one that’s most closely related to what we’ve been talkin’ about so far is the Needs Inventory. It lists out 75 different human needs, 28 of which fall under the umbrella of connection.

Holy shit! 28/75! That’s more than a third of our needs! That means there’s a lot of nuance to connection and our need for it. Considering these different facets of connection individually helps me identify which ones aren’t being met, and I find that gives me a really helpful set of directions for where to set new boundaries or make requests of people I trust. 

I’m not going to list all 28, but some of them include: 
acceptance
affection
appreciation
belonging
cooperation
closeness
community
consideration
consistency
intimacy
love
nurturing
safety
stability
support
to see and be seen
to understand and be understood
trust


Whether from that list or not, what aspects of connection are most important to you right now? Are there any you’re especially grateful for or looking to bring into your life? 

May your needs for connection be met safely and completely! It might take some time before that’s possible safely, so may you have patience, resilience, and creativity on your side for some good ole “good enough” connection until then.",99,1
1931,2021-03-09 00:26:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/m0zo8h/looking_for_advice/,Looking for advice,"Hello everyone,
Last week I finished a pretty aggressive bender. I was blowing through whiskey and wine pretty steadily since the new year, and Monday Tuesday and Wednesday we're particularly bad. Each day my partner would come home, see me and get very upset, which led to a big argument, tears on both sides, eventually making up and me promising I wouldnt do that again. This happened three times. I sobered up on Thursday, and am feeling pretty ok now. I'd like a drink but the memory of how awful that was is enough to deter me. I'm going to the doctor today to get some help too.

So, the question I'm looking for help with is how I can reconcile correctly with my partner. Actually, she's incredibly good to me and even apologized for what she said during my binge. The problem is I don't remember! I know I can be a fucking asshole when I drink, so I genuinely apologized too but I don't remember exactly what I said either. I'm nervous and ashamed to ask what we said to each other. Can anyone give me some advice?

Side note: alot of my anxiety has drastically reduced, and just in one week I see an improvement in my bank account. I was spending so much money on alcohol it's like having a huge expense off my shoulders, which is such an awesome thing to experience, and if anyone is looking for reasons to quit I can tell you that's a big motivator! Have a great day everyone, I won't drink with any of you!",3,0

Two years ago I worked out 5 days a week and was always worried about my health. I would drink, but usually just on the weekend and rarely got drunk unless it was an occasion. I always had a handle on it and considered  myself one of the ones who could control their drinking. I learned I couldn’t.. 

My stressful job created reasons to have a beer after work. One beer turned to two and two to three and so on. Along with my job, my wife had a miscarriage after we had been trying for a baby for close to a year. We were devastated and I didn’t handle it well. A six pack a night would be the minimum and I rationalized my drinking because I was afraid to look weak. 

The pandemic hits and while we were lucky enough to not lose our jobs, it gave me a reason to have lunch beers. Day in and day out I’d drink  because “ I got to get through this meeting” and “ I’ll quit when I go back into the office” and “ let me just drink this case so I’m out and I won’t buy anymore”.  

Then we get the news that my wife is pregnant again and instead of taking this fantastic news and quitting, I used it as another excuse “when the baby gets here I won’t want to drink” and “I can quit, so I’ll just drink up until the babies here because after I won’t be able too”. I was always functional and if you asked my wife she’d say I was a good husband who just liked beer but I don’t think she ever fully understood that I had a problem. How could she? I never opened up and was pretty good at hiding it. 

The baby is born and I did slow down, but I couldn’t tell myself to just quit. I couldn’t wrap my head around never having another drink in my life. I remember having a beer in my hand and looking at my beautiful baby and crying and telling her I’ll quit for you. I wish I did that night but it took me three months to finally quit. On her four month birthday, I was 30 days sober. I can’t pinpoint a single moment that finally pushed me, but I’m so happy I did. I’ve been tempted but just said I’m good. I’m back to working out and eating right and I’m in such a better place mentally.",12,1

I would feel great when drunk but absolutely awful the next day.  I finally came to myself and realized that it was ruining my life and I quit.  Now I am 11 days sober and I wonder why I didn't quit sooner.  Drinking made it hard for me to sleep and I was always super irritable.  Now I feel great.  I sleep way better and don't feel sick all day.  I feel like now I can live my life so much better now that I am sober.  If you are thinking about quitting I would suggest it as soon as possible.

Getting drunk is like going down a waterslide with a bear.,"In the beginning, the water slide is exciting and new. There are new twists and turns as you laugh and splash with your friends. Theres a bear coming down right behind you but you don’t care because the slide is fun. 

Every time you get to the bottom of the waterslide, the bear attacks. 

When you’re young, fighting a bear is an awesome story! I went on a fun waterslide AND I fought a bear last night! I’m a badass! I fought a bear last night and I’m gonna do it again tonight! Dude! I’ve been water sliding and fighting bears every night this week! No bear is ever gonna keep me from that water slide! Did you see how fast I was going! 

The slide is always the same. Eventually you know exactly when every twist and turn is coming, you know exactly what to expect, you’ve been down a thousand times. The adventure, the discovery, the fun, the magic of the waterslide, it all ends. The waterslide becomes predictable. It becomes repetitive. It becomes boring. And it always ends with a bear attack. 

When you’re old, the bear gets worse. The attacks last longer. They become more violent. Where did these bruises and scars come from? Where is my ear? Jesus, someone in the news just died from a bear attack. That could have been me.  Why am I still doing this? Is the waterslide even worth it anymore? 

Its not. 

The waterslide will never be as good as it used to be and the bear will never stop attacking. 

People ask if I miss drinking, and the answer is i miss the time when the slide was fun, but it stopped being fun a long time ago and I’m much happier now that I’m not fighting a bear every day. 

It turns out that life is full of all different kinds of exciting and new rides, and almost none of them have bears.",165,0

And that I was on the same path of self destruction. 

Got a call from my sibling last night and they had been drinking. I normally have a rule to not talk to sibling after 6pm, but I felt optimistic and answered. It was a really difficult phone call because I found myself losing patience as the conversation is on repeat as they are focusing on the same issue over...and over... and over again with slurred words and it was just... messy. Tried to be supportive, but I cannot tell you if anything I said was even heard. It was just....sad. And definitely a deterrent to me picking up a bottle of wine. 

For now, I'm still focusing on my relationship with myself and severing ties with booze. Eventually, I think I'll need to set some boundaries for those in my immediate family who don't see the benefit of sobriety.

1. My kid told me late at night that she needed a creative costume for Dr. Seuss week at school for the very next morning. If I had been drinking I would have been irritable with her for waiting until the last minute or I would have already been passed out, but instead I quickly googled some do-able ideas and set to work prepping while she went to bed. Her beaming pride in her outfit the next day (complete with crazy hair!) made me so thankful that I was able to be present for her and not disappoint her. I’ve screwed up a lot in the last 8 years but I’m working my way back and this is the mom I want to be. 

2. We had a contractor coming by to give an estimate on some work and he texted me that he’d arrive at 4:30. I pulled in to my driveway at 4:05 from running errands and he was already there and politely told me that I was late. Instead of feeling shame that I’d messed up the time, I knew for sure that I was right and quickly showed him the text. He admitted his mistake and we moved on to the work but I was proud that I knew immediately that I hadn’t mixed up or forgotten the time and my memory was reliable. And I didn’t embarrass myself!

3. I was driving my child to sports practice and witnessed a car accident right in front of me— t-bone, airbags, the whole 9. I safely parked, helped one dude out of his car, made sure both guys were okay and gave my number to the main guy in case the cops wanted a witness statement. I let “holy shit!” slip out in front of my kids but since I hadn’t been drinking, I was clear-headed, prioritized my kids’ safety while my medical training kicked in, and helped some guys out who were having a really bad day. 

I’ve been feeling really great but all these little things just keep adding up to help me see that things are just so much better without drinking. I’m proud of all of you here, keep taking steps forward! Much love, fam.

I thought I'd told him about my sobriety but I guess not?  

I've lost track of who I've told and who I haven't.  It wasn't that I was keeping it from him, I've got plenty of people I've told in the office and I'm not ashamed (actually I'm hella proud) but somehow he missed the memo.

Anyway, the wine cellar we both loved just delivered 3 bottles direct to my door.  And I feel sad.  I really want to drink it, guys.  I want to open up a delicious bottle of something expensive now, and on my birthday, and feel like I'm celebrating myself.  I've EARNED IT, right?  Isn't that what all the adverts say?  I DESERVE IT!  

Except.....I can't.  Or more importantly, I WON'T. 

I won't go down that path again.  That path goes nowhere good.  That path goes back to continued obesity, and a lack of sexual desire, and unhealthy skin, and depression, and low self-esteem, and wondering ""is this really all there is to life?"", and feeling helpless, and feeling powerless, and being alone, and feeling like all I deserve is to be alone, forever.  And hiding in the haze to try and obliterate those awful feelings.

I texted my friend and thanked him profusely for the generous gift, and also told him that I won't be drinking it, and asked if he wanted it back or if he wanted me to gift it to friends who would love it instead.   

I decided to do that rather than just quietly regift, because he should know I'm sober, even if it's awkward that he just bought me a lovely present which I will not use.

And I feel sad.  And that's ok.  And if I just .... pour out those bottles? That will be ok, too.",18,0

Some context: I (26F) am just under 1 year sober, my partner (36M) drinks but not a lot. When we first started dating we had a lot of drunk/tipsy sex, and I suppose even later on In the relationship most times we slept together we’d have a drink or two beforehand. 

I consider myself a very sexually comfortable person. I am able to talk about my desires and communicate openly. My partner is fairly open about sex too.

When I got sober, my work schedule changed so I was going to bed much earlier than my partner. This is around the time our sex life seemed to fizzle out. We still have sex, but it’s far less frequent. Because of the timing, it’s hard to tell if this is due to lack of alcohol, different sleep schedules, or a combo of both.

Since quitting alcohol, I’ve become more sensitive to touch, so sex is more intense for me and I have to ask my partner to do things differently than what he used to. I think it’s getting in his head a bit and making him feel bad about himself. This might also contribute to the decline in our sex life.

With all that bullshit, I decided it'd be a hell of a great time to stop drinking. It's been 864 days. I'm pretty sure if I hadn't quit, I'd be dead.

Yesterday, I sent what I thought was an innocent, humorous note about having a crush on a podcast host. Turns out it was creepy and I totally understand.

This morning, I got a very honest and thoughtful response about  my crush comment being creepy. I've spent all day feeling terrible and it took me until this afternoon to figure out that I was feeling shame.

I went from feeling shame/embarrassment AT LEAST twice every month (or weekly, depending on my level of loneliness) to once in 864 days. While feeling shame is yucky, this improvement in the frequency and severity FEELS AMAZING. 

I sent a sincere note of apology and gratitude for their honesty/constructiveness. I didn't have to say anything ""made"" me do it and I'm very sure I won't make this same mistake again (unlike binge drinking which happened AT LEAST once a week).

I've been pondering this for the past 2 years now; quitting, relapsing, going back into a spiral of Hell and repeating the cycle we all know so well.  Self punishment based in self disgust, creating a deeper spiral of more self loathing leading to more self punishment.  

What am I so afraid of?  Am I afraid of going to bed sober and waking up clear headed?  Am I afraid of not waking up at 2:30 in the morning, stumbling around to find the bathroom because I have to pee (or puke)?  Am I afraid of getting good quality restful sleep?  Am I afraid of missing out on a pounding headache, a feeling of nausea, and frantically downing 6 cups of coffee by 8:00AM so I'm a hung over, jittery mess?  Am I afraid of having good hygiene habits, like showering, washing my hair, brushing my teeth?  Am I afraid of enjoying a gorgeous Saturday afternoon?  Am I afraid of sitting outside and enjoying the sunrise?  The sunset?  Am I afraid of quality time spent with the few friends and family I have left?  Am I afraid of the possibility of having hobbies again?  Feeling emotions again?  

I have yet to find a suitable answer that both my head and heart can agree on.  I don't think I ever will.  

Am I worth it?  Perhaps.  I've been reading these pages for months now, and I've read so many successes and struggles and relapses and my heart goes out to every single one of you.  I would never speak to anyone else that was struggling like this the way I speak to myself, so for me, hurdle number one is coming to that realization and going with it.

Completely new here (to Reddit) and frankly a bit intimidated. Anyhow. I'm an alcoholic at wits end with this issue and was hoping to get some feedback from others who suffer(ed) the same.,"Again, new here and not sure if I'm going about this incorrectly. So, please pardon any faux pas or shortcomings with this post. 

I'm 34 and live in the States. I've been an alcoholic for 14 years and I'm just so, so tired and deflated by it. I'm at the age where it's impacting my health (have been hospitalized twice due to atrial fibrillation, have gained many pounds, experience pains in by abdomen and vital organ areas, and have the ""drinker look"" where my capillaries are dilated and my face is constantly bloated). Additionally, the toll it takes on my mental health has been heavy. 

Luckily, I don't suffer from depression (though I have been prescribed Zoloft for about a year due to anxiety, which, I believe is a result of constantly interacting professionally/ in society in a hangover state). For this last I'm thankful. But what scares me here is that I'm just so apathetic. I don't care about things that I know I should be caring about. I have this ""damn the torpedoes"" attitude and I know that, though I haven't been pulled completely under due to this addiction, it's just a matter of time. And even when I acknowledge this, empirically, it just doesn't compute. At least to the degree that any positive change is made. 

I went to rehab in Fall of 2019. I received a lot of support from my friends and family, but if I'm being honest, I really only went because I had been calling out of work and was fearful to lose my job. So, to prove I was serious, I went through a 30 day in-treatment program. Though I was open-minded and understood that I needed that kind of treatment, I can't help but view it as folly just because I wasn't sincere- to the degree I should've been- when I went. And it worked for a little while. I achieved about 5 months of sobriety. But then I realized I could still get a buzz while taking Vivitrol, and once that was established, I had relapse after relapse.

I've gone back to the 12-step programs, AA and NA, but I just can't seem to click with it. It's not so much that I disagree with the message, but I just don't find comfort with the fraternal aspects of it; I don't really like the idea of a sponsor because I have a tendency to establish the flaws in a person, and once I see them, I just can't feel guided by them existentially. And not to say that I'm better by any means- the opposite is the case- but after several years of studying and practicing Stoic philosophy (something that should aid my alcohol addiction but unfortunately hasn't been able to, improper practice I guess), I don't feel that anyone that lacks certain virtues can provide me with true support.

I've read some really moving passages on this thread. Frankly, it's so very inspiring. A lot of the posts I've come across are so uplifting, and make me desire sobriety all the more. But I'm just so stuck. I don't even really know what I'm asking for here. I guess, maybe just getting this off my chest and sharing is a good start. Anyhow. There's a lot more nuance to my addiction, so many other factors at play here. But for the sake of wrapping it up, I just want to say hello to everyone. Would genuinely love some feedback about how you might've overcome your addiction to alcohol, dealing with apathy and drinking out of boredom.

Like a lot of people who get months of sobriety under their belt, my life and habits have developed into nice routine. I go days and sometimes weeks without cravings now and turning down alcohol is second nature these days.

But I want to acknowledge the trap in my mindset that still persists. The trap of thinking “this is easy”

Thinking this is easy is wrong and dangerous on a few levels. On the surface level, it is disingenuous to all of the pain and struggle that I have endured and that my fellow brothers and sisters are enduring. It disrespects the journey and is arrogant.

At a deeper level, however, “this is easy” is the voice of temptation. It is that insidious evil that alcohol promises. It is really trying to convince me that falling off the wagon wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world, because getting back on wouldn’t be that hard either.

And that is the key aspect to this battle: that mindset is false. In fact, **getting sober again is the single hardest thing many of us will ever have to face.**

Staying sober might get easier with time and become part of our routine and behaviour, but pulling yourself out of the pits of addiction is incredibly difficult.

I’ve tried a few times and this time has stuck. But I can remember being powerless not so long ago and I never want to go back there, so I’m going to actively watch out for this trap and stamp on it when it surfaces again.

I want to finish up this post by acknowledging all my “Day one” “Day 10”, “Day 30” friends on here:  I see what you have recently done to pull yourself back from the brink and ***I am in awe of you.***

I’ve had a drinking problem for years and have stopped a few times but never for more than 10 days. 

I got a DWI in December of 2019 and bc of COVID, it hasn’t been resolved in the court yet. My lawyer is hopeful that we can get it plead down, but I blew 0.28 so it’s not like it’s going to be reduced to a simple parking ticket. I was able to get a drivers license in another state before they pulled my original DL so I can still drive in all states except the one my license was pulled from. I work as a travel nurse and have been working away from my home state for years so my life really didn’t change that much, aside from this looming pending charge. 

I was getting by until this Monday my contract I was about to start got cancelled as my (pending) DWI was finally found on a background check. My company initially worked with me but told me the next day that they can’t employ anyone with pending charges. I have spent the week in bed gradually increasing my alcohol intake to try to relax, with depression and anxiety rearing their ugly head every time I was awake. I usually have 2 (large, 7%) beers before even getting out of bed for the day, and from there just move my drinking to the couch. I then drink to the point of blacking out, going to bed, and starting the whole cycle again in a few hours. I wake up every morning embarrassed to look at my phone bc I always find paragraph long ramblings to my friends and stupid things like tv shows to the point that they don’t respond to me half the time. 

I now have to be out of my Airbnb by Saturday and have no plan of where to go. I have no job, and I feel unemployable at this point. I’ve thought about getting a minimum wage job but at this point, I don’t know who will be finding this  DWI out on a background check and firing me before even starting. 

tl;dr: I lost my job due to a pending DWI and have to be out of my apartment by the end of the week with no place to go. What I do know is that something needs to change and at least for today, I will not drink with you.",7,1

My brain needs to not focus on all of the bad things that are going on, so I have a feeling I will be working as much as possible.

I'm just not ready to attack my demons yet. I have been contemplating getting a diary to write down my thoughts and the naughty things I've done when I was a heavy drinker. I also am focused on moderation, I'm a ""go big or go home"" kind of person and that is also one of my flaws.

Its so weird, I haven't been sober for very long but life is so different when you're not drunk all day. I like it but again scared. I know with time things will get better. I was at the lowest I've ever been and I can only go up from there.

I have so much work and so much life to live. Those dark thoughts are absolutely selfish thoughts. Apart of my recovery also includes not being a selfish person but also knowing when to say no.

So many of my family members who are also alcoholics keep telling me, I'm not a alcoholic and  just am going through a rough patch. But they don't know what booze does to me. And my body just cannot take it anymore. My uncle died of alcoholism. I won't let myself travel down that road anymore. I've gone down that road and now I'm searching for my way back.

My secondary goal was finding healthy low calorie snacks for my niece(the doctor told us she was on the heavy side and to watch her diet). I found quite a few healthy things I know she likes to eat and was feeling quite proud.

A song I liked came on the radio and I just... drove home. Totally forgot about my primary objective of getting beer. Just poof, something that used to be a compulsion is starting to take the back burner in my life. The only reason I remembered when I got home is that there wasn't beer in my jacket pockets to sneak upstairs.

Like, that just *does not happen*, I do not forget the beer or vodka when I go out on a mission for it. I'm sure you all know that. 

The only explanation I have, is that over this past month of following the sinclair method of taking naltrexone is starting to remove my addiction to alcohol. The formula is to only take naltrexone 1-2 hours before drinking, and then drink mindfully. Naltrexone + Drinking = Cure. I keep a drinking log since then, and I know these are rookie numbers but I started at 32 drinks in the first week(at peak I was a bottle of vodka a day), if I drink both days till my nal-week is over, I'll end up at 26 drinks this fourth week.

I left a live-in relationship with a heavy drinker 2.5 years ago. I've never loved anyone as much as I loved him, and leaving was the hardest thing I've ever done. My heart still hurts every day.

The hellscape that was 2020 finally made it obvious to me that my drinking was a problem. It had probably been a problem for a long time, but the isolation and constant sense of doom that came with Covid brought it into sharp relief. I've tried and really struggled with 12 Step in the past. I've been in therapy for a decade. This year I tried for a sober January after reading *This Naked Mind*. I never made it past a week, but I did have more sober days than drinking days over the course of the month. I convinced myself that this was an accomplishment. I was batting over .500, and I deserved a reward. Fast forward 5 weeks, and here I am again.  F#ck.

I 29 M have been abusing alcohol for more than 10 years. Until 2014 ish my abuse was on weekend binges, and the ocasional blackout. The only consequences I saw to my actions were the 1 or 2 days hangover that I would have to endure. Then I started drinking occasionally on week days up to 3 drinks, not daily - just some days. Again the only consequences I saw were that I would have a slight hangover for the next half day and would enjoy my weekend binges. I started drinking alone sometimes just to feel better.

On 2019 my week days consumption increased. Then one day I realized I have been on a bender, believing I was just maintaining mu buzz, until I could no longer maintain it without furthering my damage, hade some problems at work and my brain felt like jam. I don’t remember how long was that bender but probably a little less than a month. I stopped and for the first time I experienced withdrawal, it was extremely uncomfortable but tolerable, definitely sweating a lot, feeling like shit and having some trouble sleeping but achieving it for 5 hours or so every night. I said to myself, a couple of weeks dry and then committing to moderation, whatever that means to someone that would continue to drink to excess socially.

On 2020 around May I was feeling considerably low and again started a bender, not sure how long it lasted but. My benders are normally 750 ml to 1 l of hard alcohol every day. At some point I decided to stop and did a tapering. I started having withdrawal but again tolerable, difficult but tolerable. O was sucedió tapering that time, and to be honest I was not even aware of the concept at the moment, I just did it out of instinct. 

Throughout this I have been able to somewhat conceal the extent of my abuse, but some people noticed, I had some problems on my job but I did not lost it. My parents and some other loved ones had tried me to stop and accept that I had a problem and to some extent I accepted my problem privately to myself. 

Again on December 2020, another bender, maybe lasted two weeks, and again tried tapering. I was on what was supposed to be my last night with any sort of drink. I could not sleep, every time I was able to sleep I immediately woke up feeling ver altered, I started seeing faces in the dark that I knew were not there but the sight of them was making me feel terrified. That subsided and I endured the night. On the morning I felt again like complete shit and started with tremors. I took one last drink even though the taper should have been over. The tremors did not go away. I finally decided to call my mom and finally accept to her that I had a problem and needed her help. She stayed with me for 3 days. I did not drink anymore and the tremors just lasted that day. The nights were almost completely sleepless, but I got through it.

I finally committed to not drinking, started routine with lots of exercise. 

Well, my last bender lasted from last Monday to Friday, I again tried to taper, but my parents knew something was wrong so Yesterday they came with me looked around everywhere I could have alcohol stashed, threw it all. My last drink was a shot at 10 30 in the morning yesterday. They have stayed with me and I consulted with my doctor. He sent me blood pressure medicine, 0.25 mg Xanax taken every 12 hours which I read here is not something normally used for this and 5 mg of melatonin taken at night for 5 days. My blood pressure is back to normal. Yesterday was hell with tremors, cold sweat and the feeling of dread. 

The Xanax did help but did not eliminate completely the withdrawal symptoms. I’ve taken three Xanax, I should have taken another one an hour ago, decided to take it until the night and tomorrow suspend it. Do you think this benzo intake will cause harm? Or is the dosage and quantity I taken low enough as to avoid avoid dependency issues? Right now I just feel light headed with some headeache, I feel tired, still with low appetite but I feel I am over the worst. I read people that were generally ok and then at the 38 hour had seizures so I am a little scared that this feeling not as terrible as yesterday is my body deceiving me or something.

In the last days, I have admitted my problem with not only my parents but some friends and an uncle who is an alcoholic. He has told me to go to AA and he can go with me on my first meeting. My doctor told me that after getting through this I have to seek therapy. My friends have been supporting. I honestly believe that this network and accountability I am building will really help me not fall again.",3,0

Also, I really need to get this off my chest because it’s affecting my mental health and I know he will never listen to me. I can vividly remember having a good dad long ago, an attentive loving and vibrant father who played outside with me and just overall was a fun person. This all changed in 2nd grade, all too young to realize my parents were nearing the end of their relationship, I would often walk up stairs to play with my dad; and one day he was passed out on the couch around 1:30. This kind of thing continued to happen for several years, he began driving me to practices drunk, reeking of beer, I noticed he began calling women and minorities slurs and actively supporting the idea of stereotypes, something he avidly taught me to be against. Eventually he and my mom split, and honestly it just got worse for him. He moved out quickly and all he would do is go to wine clubs or stay at home and drink. I can tell he drank a lot from my 3rd grade to end of high school because he cannot remember a single story I remind him of, doesn’t remember me being in the hospital and needing stitches, he doesn’t remember going to certain events, he doesn’t even remember me bawling about my addiction to opiates at 17. its like he was never there, or rather i was never there. Eventually I moved out, at 20. But due to covid I’m back to living with him. I’m 25 and he’s 60 and recently I came to realize I do not have a father; but rather a drunk uncle. He wakes up at 5-6 am and drinks at around 9 and doesn’t stop until he passes out. Then repeats. He goes to work drunk and totally does not realize he’s isolated himself to the point of having no friends. He often morbidly brings up how he wants to be buried as some last ditch attempt for attention. He has become a giant narcissist and it’s everything i do not want to become. I grew up with a dad not because he died or left, but because he chose to drink than to raise me and love me. Please stop drinking.

Was drinking all day/night, even while working, to the tune of 2-3 bottles of wine a day for the last year. Then a month ago I stopped eating regularly too and really went off the rails. Last Thursday I only ate half a peanut butter sandwich all day and my body violently rejected the booze and emptied my full-of-liquid stomach into the toilet (not the first time in the last couple of weeks this happened).

Friday I puked up Alka-Seltzer in the morning, then twice more that day when I tried to eat a few bites. I thought I'd try to start tapering, but every time I took a sip I'd nearly or actually barf again--yet I kept taking more sips, thinking I'd calm my shakes. Nope, barf. Sip. barf.

Saturday I told my partner I wanted to set a goal of a ""wine-free weekend."" I was miserable but managed to eat a ""normal"" amount of food in between all the usual withdrawal symptoms--chills, sweats, shakes. Sunday wasn't much different than Saturday.

Here I am on Day 3, still nauseous but not puking, still feeling but not outwardly manifesting shakes, can still feel my sore liver. And I'm still fantasizing about drinking. I'm posting this here so I can check back when I inevitably get cravings, to remind me how my body hates booze, rejects it, and doesn't let me off the hook after a day in bed anymore. I'll quickly drink myself to death if I forget this feeling.

We found out my wife is pregnant with our 2nd back in January, and I told myself this was a perfect excuse to take a break from drinking (since she obviously can’t partake right now). That was 6 weeks ago. I somehow found a way to keep swinging by the liquor store and pushing it off.

This morning I decided that I can’t passively stop drinking (“oh I’ll just finish this 12 pack off and then be done”) - it needs to be an active choice.

I'm not really new here but it's been a while since I've come back to this forum. I have been seeking or trying to get sober for a while now and while I have good ""dry runs"" or weeks I don't drink I somehow fail on the weekends. I am very self aware of my drinking and know how it makes me feel but why do I continue to keep doing it? Like yesterday, I woke up after drinking all day on Saturday (literally like 12 hours straight) to eating shit food all day and now I still feel trash at almost 2pm on a Monday. 

I'm a member of many recovery communities (via Facebook) and online (like The Luckiest Club)..etc.  

I'm just so tired of feeling like a failure every time we post our day counts and I'm back on Day 1 as I often see people who have been in the communities just as long as I have be successful. I think I struggle with ""do..I have a problem or do I not have a problem?"" mainly because most people around me or the people who I let be around me tell me I don't and think I'm judging them if they are drinking around me..its bascially my parents/my sister..etc. 

They all don't drink normally and thats why I want to stop the cycle. I'm so tired of blacking out, drinking to excess..having 4 day hangovers I just don't know how to get out of it because I don't have other friends in real life to hang out with or things to do. I'm single, work from home and talk to the same co-workers during the week then my parents on the weekend and thats all they do is drink. Also, somehow I've become a regular at the bar up the street and constantly am fielding texts/calls from people asking where I'm at. I normally don't drink during the week but its every weekend where I come back feeling like a failure - I know comparison is the thief of joy..?..right? but I just am tired of doing all this field research.

I (27m) just want to type out the struggles I'm having lately. This might be a bit long and rambly, but I'd like to share my story.

I've always had a bit of a dangerous relation with alcohol. More often than not I drank the most of all my friends during social gatherings and last year I started drinking while being alone.  

What started as taking the edge off after a busy day, soon became a way of suppressing anxieties and boredom. After that I was having multiple drinking nights in a row while my housemate was visiting his parents. I had the place to myself and I felt free from any judgement, any shame of drinking alone.

After a couple of those drinking periods (3-4 days), while also *working* from home, I decided that I needed to change or at least sober up for a while. This worked for 2 weeks during January, but soon I was back at (secretly) binge drinking while alone.

The moment that my alcoholism became a reality to me was when I bought a bottle of rum, hid it on my room and drank it during the working week, while my housemate was home. I thought he didn't notice, but later he revealed to me that he knew what I was doing and expressed his concerns about my drinking habits. I promised him to stop right there and then.

This was the start of a 21-day dry streak, which was a very nice experience. I felt more awake and not as depressed as before. However, this weekend I slipped up.

My housemate is visiting his parents again for a couple of days. As soon as he told me he was gone for the weekend, a trigger went off in my brain. ""Finally, time to fully relax again. It's been 3 weeks, you aren't *that* much of an alcoholic. You can try to moderate!"" But at the same time I didn't want to drink. This struggle went on for a couple of hours, but I caved in and went to the store.

Well, it turned into two days of drinking alone on my room. This morning I woke up, feeling terrible about the weekend and knowing I wouldn't be productive at work today. I poured out my last two bottles of beer in the sink and I'm here again, starting from day 1.

Thanks for reading. I'm trying to take this experience as a lesson to recognize my triggers and reach out during difficult moments. I'm still struggling a bit, but I will not drink with you today.",10,0

I woke up this morning feeling like crap because I had a few too many last night. I used to have a nightcap every night of a single drink. After the holidays, work got more stressful and one drink turned into a few. I stopped exercising in the morning because I felt terrible. I'm gaining weight and I'm tired all the time. Every now and then I stop drinking for a few days - the first day is tough but I just want to convince myself I can. The second night is easier. Then on the weekend, everything kind of resets.

I'm going to try and not drink the rest of the month. Has anyone else been in this spot and found they can re-calibrate themselves to drink socially? Or does this sound like it's more of a all or nothing type thing?

The best I've ever managed is 3 weeks, I'm hoping things work out better this time. I've cut down during the last week as my consumption was quite high and I was a little worried about going cold turkey. I had my last drink last night.

One of the reasons I'm quitting is because my partner and I recently broke up and it's been really hard on me. We had a lot of problems but I think alcohol was a large factor in the end of that relationship. It was really the final kick that I needed. I've suffered with depression and anxiety for many years and drinking just makes it worse. My anxiety is already through the roof from withdrawals but I hope that will improve. My doctor also mentioned that my cholesterol is far too high for my age even though I exercise and eat relatively healthy. I feel like alcohol has ruined my life, and it's my fault.

When I was in my 20s, I was the sort of casual drinker who could have one or two, and then stop. Flash forward to the past few years, where I’ve been hiding liquor caches around the house so my wife thinks I’ve only been having a beer or two after dinner each night, and semi-regularly blacking out, unable to remember conversations I have, or things I’ve been told. 

For years I’ve rationalized my alcoholism to myself by only drinking at night, switching from liquor to wine/beer, etc., but at the end of the day, drinking the amount I do is wildly unhealthy, and sadly it’s the only way I know how to drink. I otherwise eat cleanly, exercise frequently, and am a fairly healthy person. 

Even this morning, waking up slightly less hungover than normal, as I resolved for today to be the day, I considered finishing off the last three canned cocktails in the house during the day today. I’m ashamed to admit this, but I’m still indeed considering it. But in all, drinking has been wreaking havoc on my anxiety and depression, and with my wife being 7 weeks pregnant, this is it - I gotta stop.

If anyone has any advice, or is seeking an accountability partner, I’d appreciate it!",6,0

I kind of thought I’d have more mental clarity by now, though it could be due in part to anxiety and the sheer length of time that I was a daily drinker. 

I’m in my early 30’s but I drank daily for a long time. Throughout my entire 20’s up until the day I stopped in late January. And that doesn’t include the high school years of weekend and occasional weekday binges. 

I felt pretty awful for the first few days, then I reached the euphoric stage, then reality set in and it’s been a mix of good and bad. I know this is all normal. I’ve read every type of experience on here, not that I am reducing the good people of this sub to their experiences.

Since I spent so much of my formative years drinking, I know I didn’t properly develop the coping mechanisms required to function as an adult. Sometimes I feel very stunted and immature in my reactions to things. I am trying to take this opportunity to learn and grow. 

I am also still having lapses in memory. I’ll forget what I ate the day before and it takes a while to remember. That’s just one basic example, the memory stuff has been further reaching than that. 

My personal life has been a little messy, but I am glad that I have the piece of mind in knowing that at least I’m not drinking. It’s just the after effects are still causing issues for me. The aforementioned lack of coping mechanisms is what I believe are causing me to continue to be at times snappy and irritable with people I care about. I do not want to be this way. My patience is sapped by my continuous efforts to stay sober, and my sleep has been inconsistent, which leads to more irritability and brain fog.

Total denial of accountability, sort of like what led to me over drinking in the first place. 

I think one of the main things I’m starting to understand in this journey, is that it is truly all on my shoulders. Want a different path? Find it. I have to be willing to put in the work I’ve shrugged off for so long, especially when the work is hard and doesn’t make me feel great. Last year I would have started this part, been discouraged two weeks of exercise didn’t work magically, and drank a bottle of wine or 4 instead. And then I would have proceeded to beat myself up for my failures, so I would have had fireball with my wine to compensate. Brilliant. I’ve spent my adult life drowning my inadequacies and depression and it’s time for me to step up and try a different path. 

So, friends, IWNDWYT. I will do squats, 300 of them to be exact, but not drink. 12 weeks of boot camp in front of me, and a whole lot of accountability in the mean time. Hopefully I’ll come out of this a stronger person in more ways than one.",3,0

Hey everyone! I realize this morning that it’s been five whole years since I was admitted to a psych ward, and wanted to share my story of recovery.

So to start off, at the time I was around 3 or 4 months sober from alcohol. I had gone to see a therapist who recommended a psychiatrist who prescribed me Klonopin to help deal with the anxiety of being sober.

I’m not gonna knock anybody who is currently using Klonopin or any other benzodiazepines, I would just like to warn to be very cautious with them, because in my experience Klonopin became a very easily abused substance in my hands. I think I was only supposed to take 2 at the most a day, or “as needed,” but I soon found myself going through a month’s prescription in less than 2 weeks.

About mid-February it was evidently having a negative effect on my mental health, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I started losing patches of reality, was more irritable at times when I (assume) I was withdrawing from it, and all around just unwell.

It finally boiled up to this morning 5 years ago where I woke up crying, paralyzed in my bed, asking my roommate to call the cops on me to take me to jail. My roommate thankfully had the presence of mind to call my mom instead who ended up taking me to the ER where they recommended I be transferred to the psych ward for observation.

I spent a week in psych ward until they figured out kind of what was going on and recommended I spend time at an in-patient rehab facility, which thankfully had a spot opening up on March 17th.

I spent a couple months doing rehab and seeing a psychologist, and then made plans to do a halfway house program in a neighboring state for 3 months.

While I was in the halfway house program, I went to meetings and worked some spot jobs to earn some cash. About a month there I relapsed on alcohol but nobody found out and I didn’t confess because I was too scared of what would happen if I got kicked out of the program. I tried staying sober but every 2 or 3 weeks I found myself buying another small bottle of gin just to get drunk off of, then I did the dirty dance of trying to hide/get rid of the evidence and sober up.

I “graduated” the program there and decided it was in my best interest to move to a new town to a sober-living house where I wouldn’t have to pay for rent as long as I stayed sober and the State continued supporting me. While there, I got a job and continued drinking every few weeks until my last day of drinking November 8th, 2016.

I wanted to share this story with you all, because I know I’m not alone in this experience, and I want you to know you’re not alone, either. Recovery is not a linear straight line. It’s going to be a lot of mistakes before something clicks, and it starts making sense. Relapse is not failure, it’s part and parcel of being sober. That isn’t to say relapse is inevitable. Relapses are avoidable, but it takes recognizing the signs of an impending relapse and being proactive about them. If I had been more aware while I was in the halfway program and actually reached out to my counselor and friends, or utilized the meetings more than just showing up and listening, I might have had a few more months of sobriety and less heartache, but I’m grateful for the journey I did have as it is and was.

I told her that every person is different, but that listening to Alcohol Lied To Me, and using the I Am Sober app is what kept me on the straight and narrow.

-On Fridays, which were the worst for me, I would call my recovering alcoholic friend on my way home from work who would list off all the reasons why I shouldn’t drink that weekend. 

-I made day time plans to look forward to, that I wouldn’t want to do with a hangover. 

-Reading posts in the community on the I Am Sober app really helped, these are all people at the same stage as me and we are all struggling through the same emotions and cravings. 

I told her that after about 5-6 weeks is when I finally felt I was over the hump, and that sobriety was my new normal. I had established a routine, and had methods to cope with any cravings that might pop up. I told her anytime she needs that reminder to keep her on the straight and narrow to give me a call and I’ll start listing off the million reasons not to drink.

I've been told that I should not be drinking at all before and after, so that puts me into I think April 31st for 2nd dose, and then another couple weeks after that so we looking at April 14th or so. 

Honestly? I'm fucking ready. This past few days even though I didn't drink heavy (I had about 5-6 each night in the evening - no day drinking at all), I was kind of in a sour ass mood. Sitting there sipping my whisky and basically saying 'what the f' every few minutes. Just was pissed off in general. At myself #1, but just a crap mood. I was a little snappy in the week, because some how my reptile brain decided to talk me into ""Hey you are on day 9, guess what's coming up? THE WEEKEND! You gonna get it or what?"". I'd get a little short fused because I started thinking about the reward at the end of the week, and my brain decided to start putting priority and focus on that event. Stupid stupid stupid. 

I was prepared, I figured that's nice, I'm going to be sober this weekend. I got crap from the wife about ""Are you going to drink this weekend at all?"" because of a diet we're on, like millions of other couples are at start of a new year.....yes it's march but still that's what we're doing. I said I might have something, but left it at that - just in case I did, so If I got caught I could say ""I told you I was going to, so I did"" but that didn't happen. 

Instead, here I am day 1. I feel fine but mentally? I'm freaking exhausted from this battle. I'm not going to do anything dumb, I'm going to put my best foot forward and just fucking be sober until further notice, which at this point is mid April. I'm tired of this bs, this nonsense that is drinking. It makes it even worse for me because I didn't piss anyone off, I didn't embarrass anyone, I didn't do anything. Yet, I'm more pissed off than I have \*ever\* been since I started these stoppages. It's a weird place to be in. I'm going to keep on keeping on and not drink today, that's all I know right now!",3,1

Fuck Easter's moving target. [No offense to Easter folks, truly].

Counting days feels like scratching marks on a prison wall -- on a deep, personal, visceral level.

I intellectually understand how//why counting days is important to people, but I just can't do it. I just want and need to do the date. I don't want to count days by scratching on a wall. This is exactly what it feels like. Prison, scratching on a wall. I just want to remember a date. No math, no subtraction. Just like my birthday. No added ""every day upkeep"" besides not cracking open a bottle. Everyone has just today, one day at a time.

Doing the math every single day, every day, all the time, is just one more burden I don't want to do.

Remembering one date is easy. One date, that's it.

Sure, some folks in here are way beyond that but for me, the longest stretch I can ever remember me attempting was 21 days. I'm learning to look at life a little bit differently. These days, I'm trying to focus on a few things like life without drinking, triggers, and things that I love but associate with drinking. The first I think about almost daily. My entire life I've been a drinker. In an earlier post, I admitted to actively seeking out drinking as early as 14. This scares me because we have 3 kids and our last is still home, he's 15. This means he's seen me drinking, and drunk, a lot. I don't know if he recognizes that I'm on day 32 but I a lot of the reason I am doing this is because of him. I love him dearly and don't want him to think of his Dad as a drunk or be embarrassed around his friends because of me.  
Triggers are weird to me right now. It's not like I'm actively craving drinks but the thoughts come and go and are sometimes very detailed and sometimes very fleeting. I'm been married once before and we married when we were both very young. I remember the first night after we separated and how it was difficult that I didn't know where she was, or what she was doing, or who she was with. It was a sad feeling. A feeling of loss. I equate these trigger feelings with those feeling for some reason. I will be working through those as we go along.  
The last one is probably the most difficult. Associations are weird things. You see a place, hear a sound, a certain time comes up and you think about a thing. In this case, drinking. I could be driving down the road and see a billboard for a burger, which makes me think of my favorite burger place, which makes me think of a frosty beverage that makes me think of drinking. It could be 4 pm in the afternoon, where I used to think, oh boy, it's almost time to knock off work and grab that first tasty beverage! It could be my wife asking to watch the sunset with her, we always had drinks. It could be a Facebook post of a brewery that I love. Do you see where I'm going?   
I know that I can drive around, enjoy my day, browse Facebook and spend time with my wife, all without drinking. It's the thoughts that make me want to avoid those things for fear of thinking about drinking which may or may not lead me to drink.

My father was an alcoholic.  I always vowed I'd never do the same.  And I managed this up until about four years ago when I met my ex-boyfriend.  It started out with when I came over on the weekends to hang out, he always had a bottle of Fireball and we'd do some shots.  But, when I eventually moved in with him, I noticed that he drank every day.  For some reason, with just about every relationship I've ever been in, I have always gotten myself into what they do because I don't want to feel left out, or I think they feel better than I do if that makes any flipping sense at all -- or I feel like I need to be on their same level?  Anyways.

So fast forward three years, we eventually broke up for reasons I won't mention, but I think it's safe to say the drinking ultimately caused our relationship to sabotage itself.  It got to where if we were going somewhere for more than 30 minutes... Let me bring a few drinks so I'm prepared, or let me make a mixed drink to put in a container so I'm prepared in case I need a sip or two along the way or during whatever.  If we went somewhere, we both would often shoot back a Fireball shot (the single bottles you can get and sometimes would buy the bucket full) before we went into a store to shop, before going into a friend's house, before ANYTHING!  And it became so that if I were coming home from work or ANYWHERE for that matter (if I were going fishing, leaving work, going to the mall, going ANYWHERE), no direction I meant to take home to avoid liquor stores helped... My mind just dug in to my self discipline.  I would end up at the store.  Always.

So after we broke up I have been living with my folks just to get my bearings mentally, physically, and financially.  I went from Fireball and mixed vodka drinks to a couple  malted beers (mike's harder cranberry) which to me just isn't better at all, I can just remember what I've done all night and I'm less angry than I used to be.  Anyhow, I've gained so much weight since I started drinking.  I think, even though my ex drank more than I, he wanted to leave because I didn't look the same after all this time due to my weight gain with the alcohol.  I used to feel so wonderful about my appearance... Felt so beautiful, etc.  And now, 50+ lbs later in a span of 3 1/2 years give or take drinking... I feel so ugly and unworthy, etc. Etc. 

I want things to change.  I'm 27, female.  I'm so fucking scared!  And I feel my health declining.  I don't know what to expect when I stop... I don't know what to do during my process... 

I just want to LIVE... Not just... Exist.

I started drinking heavily since the pandemic.  It was novel and fun to be drinking all day, heavier as the months went on.  Not even because I was having a terrible time; I am single and without children, living rent-free with my parents, working from home.  Sure it was a major change to my life, and a cool opportunity to slow things down, and how fun and wild would it be to party it up like I was in my early-20s again.

So three weeks ago I decided to go sober, and after some detoxing I was feeling good, emotional regulation was better, things started to temper out.

And now I can fully see how this pandemic sucks.

I can't be myself at my parent's house.  This was only supposed to be temporary anyway but I don't have side-gigs anymore so I haven't been able to save as much as I planned.  My friends are all having a far worse time than I am, so we don't even have fun conversations anymore, it's always a pseudo-therapy session.  I'm tired of receiving all their pain.

One of my side-gigs reopened recently, but the management is terrrrrrrible and doesn't feel safe to me, so I had to give it up.  I loved that side-gig more than anything.  It was a passion-project.  But I can't deal with the harassment and poor management.  It was falling apart pre-Covid but at least I could lose myself in the work; but now management is just straight negligent, and I can't risk it.

I dumped all my remaining liquor on day #2 and boxed up all the remaining wine (I don't know, couldn't bring myself to dump the wine), taped up the boxes, and put it in a storage place which is now inaccessible.  I'm glad it's not in front of me because today would have been the day I gave in.

It's taken a lot for me to not go to the store and pick up a bottle, just to soothe my heartache, blur the lines, and sleep the rest of the pandemic away.

Sorry for the venting.

I come from a family of folks who don’t believe in mental illness and don’t abide addiction and forgiveness is impossible for them. 

Well, I am nonetheless at my mom’s house. We haven’t ever been close: I am the family black sheep. Oddly the pandemic has brought us together. (Don’t even ask me to explain that one - I’m still perplexed). Anyway, things started getting tense again - things usually end in screaming matches around here.

Mom admitted to me that to be honest, she didn’t really know me or understand me.  I don’t know why or how, but I actually stopped our inevitable joint meltdown and I was able for the first time ever to have a candid conversation with her about mental illness, explained how I managed my life, i told her about the first onset of PTSD, that I don’t drink anymore, and we discussed treatments. She actually took notes while I spoke for a long time. 

During this time I stopped her repeatedly from interrupting and asked her to just let me finish, and that at this time i wasn’t asking for unsolicited advice, I was just asking her to listen. I don’t know how I managed this but I have to suspect having some sober time under my belt didn’t hurt.

It was very weird and afterwards, I am so mentally exhausted that all I can do is lie here and cry intermittently- feeling some sort of relief but also fear.

I am glad I have decided to not drink anymore. Sobriety has given me the strength to face this and her.

My drinking was out of control.  It took a few weeks to get her to let me come back.

We are building a new house.  About a week after I moved back in we were due to move into the new house.  Then the house flooded.  A plumber made a mistake and our brand-new house flooded.  Repairs will take six weeks.  

Our old house has been sold so we had to move out.  We moved everything we own into storage.  And then we had to find a place to live for a few weeks.  I feel like I have spent days and days on the phone.  

The next problem is that no one will rent to us because we have an 80-pound pit bull.  A family member has a condo we could use but it is not big enough for all of us.  The only thing we could do was to move my stepdaughters into the condo with the dog.  They are 18 and 20, but they have never lived on their own. 

The wife and I found an Airbnb but the host sort of tried to scam us.  We hade to move into three different apartments until we got to the apartment, we paid for in the first place.  We spent most of the last four days looking for hotels.

Not being with her daughters is very hard for my wife and so she spent most of the day crying.  She finally talked to the girls this evening and seems to be doing better.

It got to the point where I was drinking 2-6 ciders a night and it was really triggering my RA. I quit drinking in February and went 18 days before meeting up with a friend and had a drink. (I should also mention that I just moved to a country where alcohol is very much celebrated, but since we are in lockdown it’s not so bad atm but I’m afraid of when the bars open up again.) Ever since then, I’ve had 1-2 drinks on weekends. My goal is to not have any ever (for the sake of my health) so I feel guilty the next day just because I know I let myself down and have to start the count over. 

I’m pretty sure I’m just bored and lonely and I think 1 or 2 won’t hurt, but ever since detox 1-2 is all it takes to feel like I drank a whole bottle of wine (which I used to do, too). I don’t feel like drinking on the weekdays anymore, just Friday and Saturday.

I have hobbies and keep myself entertained but sometimes I’m just tired of doing that and just want to tune out for awhile, but then the next day I feel tired, headachy, depressed, anxious, and disappointed. 

After lockdown, I’m really looking forward to dating, meeting people, hanging out with coworkers, but alcohol is so celebrated here that most social interactions revolve around it and I am really bad at saying no. I know alcohol is bad for me, especially since it triggers flares, but I find the peer pressure to be just as painful. Saying I’m doing it for my health doesn’t seem to be a good enough reason and I don’t want to get into the details of my health every time I go out (it’s also none of their business). I’ve had less teasing and pressure when I went on temporary diets to see how good affects my flares. 

Anyway, weekends are tough I guess. It was easy in the first 2 weeks and have been difficult in the last 2-3. Whether I go out or stay in I’ll be tempted to drink I guess. :/",5,2

I read posts here and so many people celebrating how wonderful their life is when they stop drinking, how they achieve this, that and the other and how they are succeeding at life and getting things together etc etc etc. This just leads me down the path of feeling like a failure. I have 95 days and life for me at the moment is constant thoughts of food, calories, exercise as I relapsed into my eating disorder when I consciously started working on my alcohol use, I have started self harming again and my thoughts also turn suicidal at times (there is no need for concern, I contact the Samaritans when I need to and can also contact my G.P if needed so I have support and am safe). I am just trying to survive at the moment and I need to believe that that is enough right now. Not everyone is thriving in recovery and that is ok. I think where I am now is just something I need to go through, as horrific as it is, I guess it's my process and this is my journey and everyone is different. I have struggled with my mental health long before alcohol became and issue for me. I have a history of trauma and grief which was what tipped things over the edge with regards to my alcohol use. I need to be kinder to myself and I need to not compare myself to others. Everyone is on their own path.",7,0

That loss single handedly prompted me to finally get sober and I’ve been able to make some enormous strides (for me) since which is great. I’m incredibly happy with my progress. However, my mentor/sponsor urged me to write a letter to said person, which I wanted to do anyways, to apologize to them and take responsibility for my past behavior. I did, in the sincerest way, write the letter. It was returned to me with a letter of their own saying more or less go f#*@ yourself. I understand that some things are just too broken to put back together and that I should be content with the fact that I did all I can do and need to be ok with that, but I can’t stop thinking about it. It kills me inside to know that there is literally no amount of sorry that will ever be acceptable.

I only drank socially which meant like maybe 2-3 days a week. If I drank at home, it would probably only be like once a month if I had video chatted with someone. I enjoyed drinking, but I saw my friends often enough where that 2-3 times a week was more than enough.   
Fast forward to today. I currently live in a different country. I don't really have many groups of friends because the pandemic hit not too long after I moved here. The friends I do have aren't drinkers, so I don't really get to socially drink anymore. (also the pandemic lol)  
It started off with maybe a beer or a glass of wine at my usual 2-3 times a week. But as I've become more socially isolated cause of the pandemic, those 2-3 days a week have turned into 5-6 days a week. Maybe an extra drink more than I normally would too. I don't drink as much water anymore because I no longer need to drive anywhere or keep composure in front of people.   


I can't see myself ever cutting it cold turkey because I genuinely do enjoy the different tastes and drinking culture in general. But I definitely need to cut down massively...   
This is the first time I've ever admitted this problem to anyone, so I guess this post is to make it more ""real"".

I can't believe I chose booze over this.,"I'm two weeks into my first real, serious attempt at sobriety after hitting my personal rock bottom. I know it gets harder eventually, when the novelty wears off. So I tallied up some of the things I've noticed since I quit:

I'm sleeping through the night for the first time in years. I used to wake up in the middle of a panic attack/shame spiral at 3am and lie awake until I dozed off 15 minutes before it was time to get up. Now I wake up look at the clock and the alarms about to go off. 

The weirdest thing is to wake up, panic about how fucked up I was last night, and then have that glorious realization ""No, I *didn't* get fucked up and embarrass myself. I quit drinking. Everything is fine."" and it's the best feeling ever, but like... it really shouldn't be. It should be normal not to wonder what stupid, shitty things you did. It should be normal to wake up without a hangover, too, but it makes me feel like Jillian Michaels every morning I'm able to sit up in bed.

Speaking of Jillian Michaels, I run and lift weights now instead of my previous routine, which was to lie in bed and drink canned wine all day. I also polish off about a pound of gummi bears a day. You don't know my life, Jillian Michaels!

I'm nicer and more pleasant to be around. I'm more patient with my kids. They are noticeably happier. I have actual conversations with my husband. He's happier too. We get along. I'm more patient and now I can be supportive of him for once. We went out to eat and I offered to DD! He can finally relax 😎

I can remember things now. Seriously, I thought I had early onset Alzheimer's, but I stopped drinking brain poison all day long. Now I know where everything is! 

i can't imagine any earthly reason I would give all of this up. Not for like, a car, or even a really fancy night on the town even. But I'll give myself brain damage for can of wine? That shit is like Pruno for moms. I've spent the equivalent of a PlayStation 5 on canned wine since last March. *Wine in a can with a horse on it* was more important to me than being a functional, kind human being. 

So even when I get bored, that means I've *gotten used to the awesome parts.* So now it's time to find more awesome stuff and get used to that.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

–––

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning, SD!

As we roll into the weekend, I’d like to start this Friday off with an expression from the community that resonates with me:

*“No matter how far we drive down the road, we’re never more than a few feet from the ditch.”*

The weekend can be rough. Maybe you have increased social pressure, maybe you’re mentally and emotionally drained from the work week, or maybe you just have more free time. For me, relapses began in the mind, long before I actually slipped. Comfortability and complacency were often precursors to an impending fall.

A huge part of harnessing my addiction was pinpointing my triggers so I could see them coming, work through them, or sometimes avoid them altogether. I took different routes home to bypass my usual liquor stores, stocked up on sparkling water, and stopped watching my favorite TV shows that made me want to drink (I’m looking at you, *Mad Men*). 

HALT – hungry, angry, lonely, tired – is also often particularly spot-on in my case.

What are your triggers? And more importantly, how do you identify and deal with them? Oh, and on a lighter note, what are you looking forward to this weekend?

Happy Friday everyone! IWNDWYT

It's brutal and I regret going over there. Fresh wounds. Part of me wants to go to the store and buy some booze but I know that would leave me in more deep depression in the morning. But I know it will definitely help in this situation..

My happiness has been amplified but my sadness feels like it has been too. Has it though? Or have just not truly let myself be sad and feel my feelings?

Anyone else have to completely rewire their brain?
I feel like as soon as I quit everything I was numbing just came out. I've been trying to hard to relearn how to just be sad or upset and accept that my feelings are here, valid, and they'll pass.
 
My streak on my profile of sobriety is also my same streak of being free of cutting too. Weird thing is that I would numb myself by getting hammered then I'd cut because my entire existence felt numb in the worst way. I couldn't win. Moreso I wouldn't let myself not lose. 

My worst triggers and cravings come when I'm having a bad depression night. Luckily when that happens I usually just take some zzzquil and go to bed early. Or I play fetch with my cat. Or I do a full face of crazy makeup, take a bunch of pictures, then do my full skincare routine. I find something that I enjoy and do it. I never used to do that. I'd feel one hint of sadness and binge. Problem was with alcohol being a depressant, that sadness came every night. Before I knew it, I was drinking a fifth a night. 

Best part is that I now wake up without a hangover, no cuts, and I'm ready to take on the next day. 

I'm relearning my sadness and my scars are slowly healing. 

I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice here. Moreso just trying to let someone newly sober know the worst of the sadness and pain passes. Once you learn again how to be sad you'll have so much control over your life again. 

It's okay to be sad. Really.

2112,2021-03-04 22:21:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ly2srz/i_want_to_give_up/,I want to give up," Hi all.

I hope everyone is doing well on their journeys. It's a rough battle; beating addiction feels like fighting the Elite Four on Pokemon after you've only knocked out the first two gym leaders. I've grown up around addicts and have seen up close what alcoholism does to people. It makes me feel dumber and more hopeless, in a way. I see it up close and still can't kick it. I'm so hqappy for those of you that have and can; it brings me more hope for my own future.

That said, I'm still struggling.

A bit of background: I'm a 24 y/o eating disorder survivor. I mostly lurk Reddit without posting much, but when I have posted, it's on ED forums. I've been formally diagnosed with both anorexia and bulimia (AKA anorexia with binge/purge,) and it's a long, rough road out of that circle of hell. As some of you may know, eating disorders are an addiction by themselves. I did drink and occasionally smoke weed before my ED, but never had a problem with full-blown substance abuse before my ED spiral. Apparently it's rather common for ED survivors to develop substance problems while in recovery for their disorders; trading one addiction for another, I suppose.

Mostly, my issue was not with alcohol, but with weed. I grew up around addicts (everything from alcohol to opiods to meth) and I've seen the long-term effects of addiction up close. I never wanted to do hard drugs for that reason. I instead started smoking like a chimney when in the midst of my anorexia. Weed makes you hungrier, but I found it also relaxed and numbed me in a way that made the anxiety, the depression, the trauma, and the obssesive-compulsive tendencies feel easier to deal with. It unfortunately also made it easier to not give a shit about anything outside of food and calories, and my entire life (university, friendships, family life, hobbies) suffered because of my marijuana addiction (side note, but anyone who says weed isn't addictive is a damn liar.) This fed into my ED, making it easier to both ignore hunger and to complete binges/purges. I've been off smoking weed since the new year started. I've tried to quit and had relapses before then, but I've been okay for a couple months now and plan to continue my pot-free streak.

However, we've come back to that same issue of trading one addiction for another. And now I feel like I can't stop drinking.

I used to avoid alcohol like the plague when I was in my full-blown ED stage; too many calories that still make me antsy today. But without pot and without the desire to restrict to starvation-levels, I've been going all-out. I've been finishing 750ml bottles of vodka within 3ish days, all as raw shots. I've been relapsing into the bulimia because I'm too drunk to do much more than binge and purge. I'm frustrated because I've been making so much progress, ED-wise and weed-wise, only to find myself drowning in yet another problem that I brought on myself.

I don't know what to do.

I know that the solution is to just stop, but how? What else is there to do? I spend most days alone. My friends are at school and dealing with my family only makes me want to drink more. I have no partner and am only working right now. What else is there to do? I want to write, to exercise, to clean, to do anything to drown out the thoughts in my head. But next thing I know it's only 4pm and I'm already hoping the day ends soon so I don't have to be awake with my thoughts anymore. What else is there to do when I can't sleep?

I don't know what to do. I feel hopeless to fix myself. I don't want to keep going through 6 shots a day, but I don't know what else to do woth myself except sit in my empty living room and let everything else consume me.

Tl;dr: I feel so fucking hopeless and any advice would be appreciated.",3,0

I always considered myself “lucky” that as long as I drank plenty of water while drinking I felt perfectly fine in the morning. I’d drink half a bottle of vodka or several four lokos and be in perfect shape for work the next day. 

This lead me to drinking insane amounts and endangering my relationship by always being fucked up. So many lost evenings and my poor partner being forced to take care of me and dealing with the messy sloppy behavior night after night. He never complained and has always been wonderful, but I could start to see the impact it was having on him. 

After a couple times of him having to clean up my puke, I learned my limits more and cut down a lot but still drank like crazy. See, it’s hard to stop when there are minimal consequences to it. I knew I was drinking too much but it didn’t feel like too much because I wasn’t getting hungover, it wasn’t affecting my job performance, and my boyfriend tolerated it. 

Now I can’t drink without feeling like absolute garbage in the morning. I get heartburn all day, my head hurts I feel sick and get the shakes and feel miserable and depressed. At first I hated it! My “super power” was gone. It was a pride thing for me, being able to out drink anyone and feel great the next day. I used to be able to boast about never being hungover. 

But it’s a blessing. Feeling like I’ve literally poisoned myself the next day is good for me in the long run. I stopped drinking for a whole week and felt so fantastic and now there’s real motivation to stop. Not because I feel like I should, not because I’m worried about how it makes my partner feel, but for myself. I want to feel better physically and mentally, and finally I can tangibly see and feel the negative consequences of drinking. 

So yeah, just thought I’d share. I cannot wait to kick off on my new goal of actually really being sober. I hope to draw strength and support from this community as I’ve seen others do. You’ve all been so helpful even with me just lurking. We got this!",7,0

I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who shared their stories and that they helped make my decision to quit.

I didn't start drinking until college, but caught up really fast.  Could drink a 6 pack before a party and half a bottle of liquor during it.  That turned into having a case of beer in the house at all times and 2-3 beers a night.  When those lost their kick it went to whiskey or scotch.  My wife has been concerned about my ""beer a night"", but I was convinced it wasn't a big deal.   But last week I bought a 1.75l bottle of 90 proof whiskey for the garage stash, and it was gone in 5 days.  I didn't remember being drunk, but I certainly drank all of it.

Reading about the ""secret stashs"" and hiding bottles from wives really struck home.  Realizing that I kept making excuses to ""check the door"" before going to bed really opened my eyes to how serious a problem I have.

So, due to the pandemic and restaurant closures, I have been working my first non-restaurant job ever. I worked in restaurants from ages 15-40, and will be 41 on Saturday. Right now, I work at the Customer Service desk of a big box store (the one they based Superstore off of haha : ) I do a bunch of stuff, cash checks, wire money, etc. but at the top of the list is handling returns. And let me just say, I deal with a lot (a LOTTTT) of angry, rude, bitter people. I also wait on a fair amount of people under the influence of whatever. A lot of belligerent people. For context, I have been at this job since November. 

I am...a very silly person, a very outgoing person, but at the same time I am very timid. Most people describe me as ""sweet"" and I will do anything to avoid confrontation. I was (extremely) verbally abused by my Dad for the first 20 years of my life, and my first boyfriend was physically abusive for years. So, I mean...let's just say that I am constantly working on trying to stand up for myself after being conditioned for a lot of years to believe that I'm less than. I am not aggressive at all, and shy away from people that are. Well, guys - this job is actually helping me I think, because - I have to be pretty tough honestly! Like, firm.

So, at the end of last week I was working the desk alone, which isn't a regular thing. I also was working at night, and closing for the first time ever, so I know how to do it in case they ever need me to or whatever. Things are moving along fine, and then around 8:30 p.m this insane, deranged lunatic of a lady (100 percent sure she was on something) comes up from out of nowhere, and throws this like 40"" tv in a box on the desk, and (I still hadn't said a word yet) and is like screaming at me at the top of her lungs ""You give me back my money and you give it to me now""!!!!!!! I am like being the firmest I have been there, and was like ""No way do we accept electronics here without a receipt ever. I'm not refunding you anything until you show me when and where you bought it"" Blah, blah, blah. We go back and forth and then she is like ""You shut your damn mouth and give me my refund"" and my hand went up with my index finger pointed towards her and I was like ""DON'T YOU EVER SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY! EVER""!!!!!!!! Like, as loud as she was being. Like every cashier and person in the place was watching us, and after everything ended, like...every employee came up to me and was like ""Wow. You were Awesome""!!!!!!! Even this quiet employee guy was like ""Damn. You really held your own up there""!!!!!

Anyway, we had a quick work meeting tonight on my day off. Towards the end, my boss was like ""Alright, well everyone just remember not to make Frosta mad"" 😂😂😂 She was like asking everyone if they were there the other night and talking about it and smiling (she was there, and ended up involved later, almost calling the cops on the lady).

Anyway, I...I'm getting there. I stand up for myself more now than I ever have honestly. And I can be tough when I need to be. I can. I'm proving that to myself and to other people. The 428 Days have helped me do it too. I have a lot more confidence, and a big part of that comes from not drinking. IWNDWYT and I won't take your big old tv back without a receipt either!

For context: 

I'm a huge wine drinker. I love wine. I don't drink it often, but when I do I'll typically drink an entire bottle in a day. This usually results in me drinking two bottles of wine during a week, but that's usually one week every two or three months. I've been told I have an alcohol problem for having more than one bottle in a week.  


The main issue making me think people are right is that I feel like I have to drink for social events. Obviously not many social gatherings happening this past year, but a year ago I went to a wedding and managed to have several glasses of wine and a few dark n stormies at the bar.

My father was an alcoholic but quit years before I was born. 

As a result, I’d always been careful about my consumption. I didn’t even have my first drink until I was 21. Most of my adult life, I’d go months without a drink and limit myself to 1-2 when I did. 

That changed March of 2020, when we went into lockdown and I suddenly felt alone and disconnected, despite a wife and two teenagers. 

I started drinking vodka to help me relax and sleep easier. It started with only a few sips but over time, that amount steadily grew. I’m the beginning, I could make a fifth last over a week, but I quickly found myself moving to two, then three, and now, I drink an average of 500ml of vodka a night, and I find that I cannot remember the last hour or two before bed the next morning. In all of 2020, I went 10 days without drinking at all.

I’m tired. 

I don’t want to do this anymore. I want to save money. I want to lose weight. I want normal rest. I don’t want to hide my behavior from my wife and kids anymore. I want to get off blood pressure meds that I’m sure are only necessary because of my drinking. I don’t want to kill off any more brain cells. 

But I’m also afraid. 

I can do this, right?",13,1

Thing is I have lots of really great coping but I didn't use them. Why? Deep down I really wanted to drink. And I didn't use all of the supports available to me. 

The very 1st thing my former sponsor asked me was when did you start thinking about drinking  And honestly I was getting thoughts before the relapse that I didn't tell on. As in telling on my addictive brain helps.

 Back to the basics. Part of me wants to drink but I am choosing to feel my feelings today sober because that is so much better than the alternative.

And this pity party that I'm in? This isn't helpful. For me, it removes my personal responsibility in choosing to have that first drink. I can feel sad that I am afflicted with this illness or I can be proactive and do something about it.",4,0

I’ve always been sensitive to the issue of alcohol because my father is an alcoholic in recovery (he’s been sober for 18 years) and several other relatives of mine are alcoholics- in recovery and still drinking. Anyway...

My husband stopped by his parent’s today and told them I’ve been doing an alcohol “detox”. He said it came up because my FIL was talking about how excited he is to have wine with us tomorrow night at dinner (they make their own, ngl it is delicious but it’s alcohol so I’ll be passing). I was so mad at him for sharing this with them, not only because it’s nobody’s business at all but also because it made me think- does it really need to be justified when someone turns a drink down? No, it doesn’t. “No, thanks” is a complete sentence.

My husband is a really good guy and says he’s super proud of me for changing my life and ditching alcohol. I know he is. And perhaps I’m being overly dramatic for being a little pissed at him. I told him how I felt and he apologized. Just needed to get this off my chest and felt like someone here would get where I’m coming from.

I started giving recovery a shot around six months ago. I was 84 days sober, decided to have a drink, and I've been in and out of sobriety since then, slipping every few weeks. Without going into too much detail, I know that I'm an alcoholic. I don't have any doubts. I'm still trying to figure out whether AA is for me. I've been working with a sponsor over half a year and she's become a close friend. I relapsed two and a half weeks ago and told her I needed some time to figure out what the hell I really wanted for myself. I binge drank for a few days, hoping that somewhere along the way I'd wake up, reach some kind of turning point, and surrender myself to sobriety (...haha). Last Friday morning I woke up with every intention of drinking ""one more time"" and then calling it quits, for good. I didn't even want to drink. I just wanted to avoid all the fears and mental turmoil that comes with realizing that my drinking days were about to be over. I spent all day debating whether or not I should drink, until I decided that I would just go on a drive with my husband, get some chicken nuggets, and watch a movie on the couch together. I was nervous as we passed by the liquor store. I didn't want to think about how I had no intention of ever going back in there, that this may very well be day 1 for me. Then I realized that if I really wanted to get sober, I was going to have to deal with those feelings anyway, so I might as well get it over with and deal with them that Friday. We drove by the liquor store and I considered how it's over, hoping that one day I'll be able to drive past the liquor store without thinking much of it at all.

I don't want to be that person who's super confident about quitting...I'm afraid of saying things like ""I'm done for good!"" and ""never again!"" because I don't want to be shouting out broken promises. I really have no idea whether or not I'll drink again one day, I just don't plan on it right now. But part of me feels like in a way, I have to be confident, because when I was taking it a day at a time I would find myself daydreaming about drinking in the future. I can't do that anymore. I can't let myself think of any kind of future with drinking involved--it'll start to get to my head. I still feel incredibly fragile though...I've had drinking dreams nearly every night, usually where I'm trying to get a drink but never can. Then last night I had a dream that I found heroin at my parents house, took it to the bathroom, and snorted it. I've never even done heroin. What. The. Hell. I should probably mention that I've had issues with addiction since I was around 13.

I guess I should get back to the main question: What was you're ""I'm done"" moment like? Did you really think you were done, or were you not so sure? Is it okay to feel a sense of confidence about quitting for good?

I thought when you gave up alcohol, what you were was a ""tea totaler"" because all you drank was tea. Totally wrong. 

Though in my case I have been drinking a huge amount of tea, so I'm fine with continuing to think of myself as a teatotaler. Every night I have three or four cups of herbal stuff, without caffeine. A big part of drinking was having something to occupy my hands, a prop, something to do.

&#x200B;

> *Teetotalers*.—The origin of this convenient word, (as convenient almost, although not so general in its application as *loafer*,) is, we imagine, known but to few who use it. It originated, as we learn from the Landmark, with a man named Turner, a member of the Preston Temperance Society, who, having an impediment of speech, in addressing a meeting remarked, that partial abstinence from intoxicating liquors would not do; they must insist upon tee-tee-(stammering) tee total abstinence. Hence total abstainers have been called *teetotalers*",2,0

It’s been about a month of no alcohol for me.  I started drinking as a teenager and ONLY stopped when I was pregnant.  I started drinking as soon as I could following the birth of my children and didn’t even stop when I got on health-kicks over the years.  I used to “joke” that I’d prefer my calories come from my wine than from food.  So I would literally choose to drink alcohol than eat food.  

I’ve had what should have been huge wake-up calls over the years, but didn’t stop drinking as a result.  It was sometime late last year I started to really realize I had a seriously unhealthy relationship with alcohol.  It started when people would be surprised to find out I drank alone, and then I started to not move from my couch all weekend long.  That bled into the work week and I just continued to destroy myself, and it was a shame I wanted to stop but just couldn’t bring myself to stop.  

I spoke with my therapist about my desire to stop, and she said to start putting alcohol out of sight, speak to my primary care doctor and was referred to read “this naked mind.”  I did all those things, but the book was not available to check out at my library and I was waiting to see my doctor..so I just continued to drink per usual.  Then one day I got a call from my child’s school with concerns about something academically; but my instinct was that there was something else going on.  That was the last day I drank alcohol.  It was like a switch went on and I decided on that day I was done with this poison, and not only for me but for my children’s welfare. 

I announced to my circle, and they were all relieved.  Evidently people were worried about me, and for good reason.  I guess they were gently nudging me, but knew I had some stressors I was working through so didn’t want to burden me with their advice when they too were drinking.  

In the last month: I got that book, joined this group and got a prescription from my doc.  I don’t even think about drinking.  I don’t want it.  I actually have grown to feel bad for people who haven’t been liberated like I am.  It’s insane to me to be standing on this side of the fence without any desire to ever have a drink again.  My friends still know me as a party girl, just without the need for booze!  

My instincts were... right.  I suspect my drinking impacted my children more than I could have ever imagined.  That is what I am most ashamed of.  There is no shame in asking for help.  I have made a change and I’ve apologized and am doing the best I can in this moment and going further.

I'm 29 years old and for the past 6 years I have been on a spiral downhill with my drinking habits.  I would consider myself a high functioning alcoholic as it's never cost me a job, however it has affected me financially and has completely taken control of my mind and body.

I started to notice this in the past few weeks where I would wake up in the morning and if I didn't have a drink in me by 11 am my hands would start shaking slightly and my head would feel ""cloudy"".  I would take a couple drinks and everything would return to relatively normal.

I'm embarrassed I've gotten to this point with this evil habit, and I understand that it's time to change my life for the better.  I am certainly not going to stop cold turkey, but I don't have health insurance and I don't have thousands of dollars sitting around to properly detox with medication.  My plan is to keep track daily of my alcohol intake and start to wean off of it until I no longer depend on it.

Today is the first day I didn't have a shot until noon, and I'm going to limit them throughout the evening to make sure I don't go over my goal.  Then I'll have a new goal next week, and the next, until I can be at 0.

I am excited to be on this path to recovery and I really would like to utilize this community as a support system along the way.  Any advice you guys have for me would also be greatly appreciated!

My sobriety has been a long time coming!

Thank you",14,0

I began my journey for total sobriety 3 days ago, but due to fear of withdrawal, Ive been tapering pretty agressively!

I feel absolutely great though to be honest!  I've gotten more cleaning and chores done around my condo that I have in MONTHS!

This past year my drinking has gone from heavy and concerning to damn frightening.  I somehow completely lost my ability to regulate at all, was drinking 1.5 L of wine average nightly, sometimes drinking while working from home, and more embarrassing things I cant even admit.  My final clue is when I bought a 750 ml bottle of expensive whiskey that Intended to keep for months in my house for guests,  and I ended up drinking all of it in less than 2 days alone, on a weeknight, missing work the next day. I also failed ""dry February"", hard.

I am a healthcare expert in the field with a masters degree and counsel people on how to be healthy. It doesn't matter. This disease knows no bounds.

I am 31, with a good career and absolutely amazing partner.  However I could have easily lost either by now but barely held on by a string.  I cant continue or I will lose it all.  I'm at a critical turning point in my life.

I admitted to my partner, my therapist and doctor the true nature of my problem for the first time after nearly a decade of on and off therapy (which didnt help since I was drinking so much).

I know it's time to finally get off the elevator, or I can very easily lose all the things I hold dear in life.

He said he is very pleased with progress, but still concerned in that he wants one number (bilirubin) to come down more. 

When I first saw him August last year, the bilirubin was off the charts bad- like you're literally going to die bad. Next appt, 3 months later, the number had improved significantly- he was very happy in his words. At today's appt, another 3 months later, he said that the number has stabilized- hasn't shown much improvement, but hasn't gotten worse either. He said he is still pleased, and he thinks that if I stay with the program, it will improve (he said he is ""being greedy"" in what he wants to see- me too- I want it down farther). He wants me to do labs again in 3 months and 6 months, but doesn't need to see me until the 6 month- which means he isn't THAT concerned. 

He said that while he's being greedy, even if I were to  stay stabilized where I am now I could live totally normally and productively, but he'd feel better with a lower number. We'll see what happens with the next labs. 

Wow- even though we're both being greedy, it feels so good to have come this far. I think back to my condition 8+ months ago and I can't even believe how bad I got. Totally gross and scary actually. I NEVER want to go back to that. I also had edema (ankle-feet swelling) and that is all but gone. I couldn't even wear my shoes before, now it is virtually normal. 

What I tell people new to this is so true and something that I've had to learn- get on the wagon, then STAY PATIENT. It will come, but patience in this process is huge.

I sometimes crave a few beers- especially with the weather being so nice here and outdoor bars open with live music, etc. But then I remind myself how bad I was, and how awesome I feel right now every day. Helps quell that crave.

After learning about the effects of dopamine when the brain is triggered by alcohol, I realize that it's a learned compulsion and I don't actually feel pleasure when I drink.

Also, and this is funny because I don't believe in any of this stuff, but last Saturday when I drank last, I asked the universe to help me start over. I was thinking that it was about that breakup I had. But now I think that quitting alcohol is more important. And I was gifted with the worst hangover I've ever had and the greatest despair and fear in one time that I've ever felt in my life.

I honestly think this might have been a gift. Because I never want to feel that way again. And I know that if I drink that's exactly where I'll go again.

Almost drank yesterday.,"I was in a tricky spot yesterday and hoping to tap into the collective wisdom of this sub. I had a tee time with a golfing friend yesterday at 3:45pm. I was running behind because of a work call and when I got to the course about 15 minutes late, he had bought me two beers. Normally, not a big deal as I'd drink the two and then have 3-4 more during a nine hole round. At least that was what I was doing last year. He hands them to me and it catches me completely off guard. I'm not thinking, in a hurry, and already flustered because I'm late. I crack it open, take the tiniest of sips, say thank you, set it in my push cart, and proceed to the first tee. In a moment of clarity at the tee, I'm realize what I'm getting myself into. So during the round I proceed to take the roughest terrain and bounce that beer around and spill it all over the place. I make the first beer undrinkable. Remember, I'm an expert at deception. Been at this for 20 years. I crack open the second on the 7th hole and do the same. Tiniest of sip so he's me do it. I set it my push cart. When we finish, we go directly to our cars. I set the beer in the front seat console, say my good byes, and drive to a nearby grocery store where I throw a full beer can away in the trash. I was proud of myself but realized, it my effort not to drink, I was very deceptive and not very honest with my friend about what I'm doing. I know he'd be understanding as I consider him a friend of that caliber, but it just seemed like an awkward moment to bring it up. I also know I have a habit of drinking to deal with social anxieties to some degree. 

How could I have handled that better? How can I politely turn down a drink that's already been purchased without making it awkward and letting that person know where I'm at as it relates to not drinking? I think it would have been easier to say no had he not bought them yet. I've found myself able to do that. I know I'm going to run into this again until the word spreads I'm not drinking. 

tl;dr - someone bought me beer and I didn't turn it down. didn't drink it but also didn't use it as a chance to bring up my sobriety.",18,0

I’m dumb and stubborn. People and science overwhelmingly agree that drinking in excess consistently is bad and if you stop you’ll eventually feel better. It’s that simple.

But still, in my first couple of days quitting I read thru the threads here and I think “this is sad, everyone with sobriety here is pretending to be happy. It’s like the person who just got dumped who says they’re GREAT and they’ve never felt better, when really they’re dying inside.”

Now I’m seeing that this is real because I’m experiencing it for myself. I realize I am starting to feel like myself. I didn’t know how much alcohol had changed my thinking and my weekly, daily, HOURLY life until I put together a few weeks of sobriety. I’ve spent multiple years self-medicating with poison and it’s so weird to feel like a different person now. I’m beginning to feel pretty great mentally, which is so, so strange to say.

A big part of this is that I’ve been working with a doctor and therapist and am taking an antidepressant that makes me actually want to start the day. I’d love to say sobriety and therapy alone are enough for me. The reality is even when my life is going great, I feel indifferent about being alive and I don’t find joy in much of anything. I have a chemical imbalance I was trying to fix with alcohol. I’m upset that it took 10+ years of my adult life to figure this out but I’m glad I’m here today.

Now, here I am nearing 55 years of age, and I can easily drink a few beer, then more than my share of 2 bottles of red wine...every...single...night.  Like so many others, I would awake early, feeling crappy, not remembering the end of the movie (""What did we watch again last night?""), swearing I would not drink that evening, only to find myself around noon looking to see if there was anything left in the wine rack, making excuses for why we needed to go into town, then buying more wine, more beer.

There were times I chose to abstain with no troubles.  Despite what I write above, we love to backpack and I would easily not drink when we were having adventures, but as soon as we were off the trail we would head first thing to a liquor store.

Although I’ve seen a lot of face gains and I’ve lost bloating, dropping the sauce hasn’t been a magic bullet for weight loss like it has for others, but over the weekend, I went below 160 lbs for the first time in about 3 years, and yesterday I was at 158.8! 

I’ve been doing IF/light keto since July and had gone from 177-162 by October, but had stagnated. Dropping from 162 to 158/9 isn’t much but I’m CELEBRATING this milestone! With Fresca. I’m celebrating with Fresca. 

I also just noticed the biggest thing though, and I didn’t really notice it had become an issue. And now I’m a little worried. 

While still actively drinking, I had started to see small movements/things (?) out of the corner of my eyes, usually when hungover, not while drinking. It had me worried but I was honestly ignoring it as it was infrequent and brief. There was nothing there 1/5 times this happened. 

Just now, sitting at my desk, the wire to my mouse started to unfurl on its own. I was turned slightly away, jumped at the movement and turned back to see it was just the wire. It was right then that I realized I haven’t had a single instance of the phantom movements/things out of the corner of my eye since I stopped drinking. That’s a relief, but also something I will mention to my doctor. I don’t know much about the mechanics of something like this but it seems like something that bears a note with a professional. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I hate to call them hallucinations, but that seems like what it is.

You’d think the uncountable number of day long awful hangovers prior to that would have done it. Or losing friends due to being a jerk when drunk. Or falling down and hurting myself a million times. A full decade of this! I was your classic binge drinker, not every day but definitely four days a week drinking at least a six pack. It’s wild and sad to look back at how much time I wasted trying to use booze as a substitute for being myself. 

I have an 18 month old. I was able to quit while pregnant but after she was born I allowed old habits back, this time in the form of two or so glasses of wine. Laying there with the migraine from hell I realized I don’t ever want my kid to question whether she’s a priority for me. I don’t ever want her to know me as a drunk unreliable mom.

How much of my own personality, interests etc has been built on being the guys who knows about beer/wine etc? If I keep on the sober path, will people even recognise me when the world gets back to some level of normality?

Fat, anxious, scared. And I really didn't clock that at all until it was way too late and I was in too deep. I had so much fun until I reached the end of the cliff and then it was a complete and utter free fall into misery.

Then it would snowball from there to the point where he would drink so much that we would have to drive him to the hospital with the DTs.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

———

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning everyone! Happy Thursday.

Getting clean didn’t solve all my problems. Far from it. But it opened my eyes to solutions, and gave me the tools and the confidence to stand on my own and take steps toward facing my fears.

Confidence is a funny thing. Society colloquially calls alcohol “liquid courage,” and in the short term that might have felt true. But in the long term, what I didn’t realize that alcohol was slowly stealing from me was a real sense of confidence in *who I am*. Drinking robbed me of my courage, and my spirit. Ultimately it robbed me of the faith that I am enough.

Love, and acceptance, is the way forward. Love for yourself, and for others.

Today I’d like to invite you to say a few words about confidence! I’ll start with a more lighthearted anecdote and say in November 2019 I went on my first sober date, and I was truly terrified. Guess what? I got through it, and I was fine. And the next date was a little bit easier!

Love to you all. IWNDWYT",95,0

2234,2021-03-03 23:32:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lxcnml/thankful_thursday_goodbyes/,Thankful Thursday: Goodbyes,"*Thankful Thursday is a weekly thread where we share and discuss our gratitude. Feeling grateful is a skill we can develop. This is an opportunity for us to practice*.

I’ve never been very good at them, goodbyes. Which is odd given how many times I’ve had to say them. All the people and places. Family members, pets, homes, homes away from homes, lovers. I think I inherited this fear of bidding farewell from my mom. She can’t say goodbye without a cascade of tears flowing down her contorted face, the kind of face you make when you’re trying to suppress or hide your sorrow but the sadness is too overwhelming. So I developed an aversion to good byes and did my best to avoid them. Or at least I avoided sincere good byes where I fully expressed myself in the moment. I never said goodbye well.

I think the thing that always bothered me about goodbyes was that they entail a transition, a rupture. And if there’s one thing in life I absolutely loathe it’s change, especially dramatic change. I’m a creature of habit if there ever was one. I like comfort zones. So I tend to just leave and get on with it, grudgingly, without giving myself over to the people and places I’m abandoning. And I’ve become more regretful of this pattern of behavior. It troubles me that I’ve been incapable of showing my appreciation and gratitude for the time I had with these individuals and spaces.

I recently left Chicago for good after calling it home for eight years. I wish I could say I visited all my favorite restaurants or coffee shops or bookstores. Relished one last train ride. But I just left. And I wish that during our last coffee and smoke together that I had told my advisor what he meant to me. But that was a quiet, solemn ten minutes. How do you even begin to wrap eight years into ten minutes? So the embers slowly burned and then our lives, once so intertwined, diverged.

But I’m starting to appreciate goodbyes more these days. Not the act of performing them but the reflection they trigger. They create space to ruminate on the past in a positive way. It’s in the midst of the transition, I’ve discovered, when my appreciation for the time I spent with these people and places is most intense. I think about how richer my life is because of them, all the experiences that will forever be a part of me, that form me, that are me as I continue on in the ceaseless process of becoming. And I think about how part of me will live on in those people and places I’ve left. Above all, reflecting on the times that are now spent and gone has taught me to accept as well as embrace transience. Those ephemeral moments of our lives that turn out to be some of the more meaningful. Nothing lasts forever and nothing should.

Although I strive to be present, I’ve found it’s good to dwell in this corner of the past, to revisit memories now and then that sustain me by continuing to nourish my soul. I won’t stay there for long, I don’t want to linger. Just long enough to appreciate and express my supreme affection for those people, places, and times that I’m so grateful for.",45,0

Lost my housing situation in a very very cold Midwest state that was 1,500 miles away from all of my family. I had isolated myself from everyone in my pursuit to oblivion, starting with running away at 16, basically faking my death in a severe storm by disappearing. I decided to take my chances while I could and drive home to stay and try to piece together a life from the rubble I left to myself of crumpled cans and cigarette packs. I’m currently homeless, living out of the car, and storing my valuables with trustworthy family so my car isn’t an easy target of goodies. I happen to be at my grandparents, and my grandfather is quite hard of hearing. He got a phone call from another family member whom I haven’t seen in a while and she’s asking how I am.

“He’s doing Good! Looks better than he has in a long time, he has a short haircut, and he’s trimmed his face well. He lost some weight, even.”

Also I realized that I was partially numbing my emotions with it to forget about my ex. 

I realized I needed to stop because it was affecting my physical appearance and my capability of doing school work well.

I thought I could hold out but I could not stop myself from thinking about a drink.  It was kind of unbelievable in my head.  A little more time passed and then it broke.  I committed to driving home that night and drinking was no longer an option.  Funny thing, I watched him as he finished a bottle of wine, smoked some more weed, and opened a bottle of something else.  I felt so grateful on my way home that I didn't drink.  Waking up this morning, I listened to music, made my breakfast and coffee, and was like thank God!!!  I had a spectacular day today which would have never happened if I drank, and it would not have made that experience with my friend any greater.

(For reference, I was the waking up with the shakes/vodka in the water bottle at work/still drank 10 units a day when I was nearly dead from the flu with a 103 degree fever/incapacitated by anxiety so severe I was literally afraid to fold my laundry unless I’d had several drinks/an actual fucking shitshow of a human being and somehow still fooling everyone but my immediate family kind of alcoholic)

Around six months after I quit, my life stopped being wholly and entirely about maintaining my sobriety. It turned into...a life? A real life, like the one I had before alcohol took me for a shitty ride. Am I allowed to have one of those? 

I don’t think about either alcohol or sobriety constantly anymore. I don’t crave a drink whenever something mildly frustrating happens. I don’t feel insane and depressed to the point of tears when I think about never having a drink ever again. The idea of going to a party whenever covid finally ends doesn’t fill me with dread - I’m looking forward to being the sober person laughing at all the fucked up people. I used to love that before I started drinking. 

To be clear, I have always been glad to have quit and I don’t feel that I have struggled (yet) with a massive craving that truly tempted me. It’s not worth it; I never want to go back to that hell ever again. But for the first six months after I quit all I though about was alcohol and sobriety. My brain couldn’t process anything else. I was foggy, anxious, depressed and out of it more often than I was genuinely happy, and the times when I was happy felt like a bizarre mania. I got spoken to at work multiple times for forgetting stupid, basic aspects of my job that I’ve had for years, mistakes I never made drunk. I couldn’t remember a god damn thing anyone said to me for more than a single second. I couldn’t even think of Christmas presents to get my family. There were days when the only thing I felt either physically or mentally capable of was sitting on the couch, chugging LaCroix, and refreshing SD constantly. 

I have stuck it out for (almost) 240 days, a lot of which were spent wondering whether I’d given myself permanent brain damage. It took 200 of those days before I felt like a person again. 

Maybe now I can have a real life, instead of a series of annoying, fuzzy moments that interrupt the act of pouring vodka into my face. Maybe I didn’t quit too late. Maybe it’s actually gonna be okay. 

I swear to y’all, it gets better. It gets easier. The place I’m at now is a worthwhile location to arrive at. Hang the fuck in there.",25,1

**Sorry, this ended up longer than I thought it would. I have never posted or commented here before, but I have been following since my journey started. Everyone’s story is unique and has been very helpful to me on my journey.**

I was never a drinker when I was younger, nor was I one after I turned 21. I Started after moving me and my, at the time fiancé, to Kansas from California for a better job opportunity. Well not long after that she up and left one day, with no return ticket back... And that was it. Moved to Kansas in Late 2015, she was gone by 2017. I did not immediately spiral; this is over a span of 3ish years from 24-28 Years old

I began drinking after work, first beer, then liquor, then 1-3 shots a night become half a handle. Slowly, I drank more not even noticing. Then after a few months I started day drinking from the time I got up on the weekends, until I passed out, wake up and repeat until Monday. Over time, I would wake up at 3 am with heavy withdrawal like symptoms, but I always had my handle of vodka or rum on my nightstand. The greatest cure but also the worst thing I could ever do.

During this time, I tried dating online and at times this did help me not to drink as much. Eventually though, I would cancel more and more plans just so I could drink. This is when I stopped going anywhere besides work and the liquor store. All I did was drink and buy the cheapest food I could so I could afford to drink more. On July 5th, 2018 at 12:10 am I was woken up by sirens, and an odd smell. I had just day drank the whole 4th away, until I passed out at around 10 pm. After a few seconds I finally realized the whole complex was on fire and I just did not move. It is not that I couldn’t, I just did not care enough about myself at the time. Luckily, my body or whatever brain cells I had left forced me up and out. 

I was hungover, shoeless, keyless, and now homeless with no family or friends around to help (I did grab my bottle though!). Red cross gave everyone a debit card with money on it, and off I went to a hotel for more drinking. Eventually 2 weeks later I find a place and move in, drinking continuing with more and more everyday and night. Sometime early 2019 I believe I had alcohol hep, but instead of going to the doctor I took the week off and drank to feel better, sleep, wake up in pain, drink more until after a week I think I finally recovered because I was able to eat again. 

I was getting in trouble more and more for my work, and I ended up putting my 30 days in at my job instead of just stopping drinking. I booked my flight back to California and spent the next 30 days doing the bare minimum and drinking ALOT. Somehow after I left on my last day, my boss calls and tells me to take a week and come back to work in California instead. So, I of course booked Business class so I could drink as much as I wanted. I move back, drinking continues but now I have less responsibility at work so win-win for me.

Life continues much the same until I start talking to a girl I really liked, we hit it off and started dating. I of course hid all my issues from her, from everyone. I did eventually tell her a little bit, I said “Hey, I have a drinking problem... I drink 3-4 drinks a day” Of course that sounds like nothing to normal people, right? Well, it was partially true, I drank 3-4 BIG cups of vodka. Then I get the same symptoms as before, cannot eat or even drink a sip of water. This time though, my girlfriend urged me to go to the hospital and I did and spent 3ish days there until I was safe to be sent home

At this time, I didn’t want to stop drinking, I just wanted to not drink everyday anymore. So, after a few months I started drinking alone again, hoping I could handle it. Well, that did not work out at all. I slipped back in and even harder before. I was mixing pills and alcohol by July of 2020. End of July I became sick, just like all the other times. This time though, I wanted this to be over. 

I finally told my family about my issues, and then told my GF that I was hiding it from her. She of course was not happy with me at all, I lied to her, I was ready for her to leave me due to this. Not sure what I did to deserve her, but for the 2nd time she stood by me during this all. I tried to just come off it myself, but after 2 days of not eating or drinking anything, I finally asked to be taken to ER. This is during the height of summer covid, so I waited in one tent for almost an hour, then the next tent for another. I finally gave up and walked out, made it to the street and then crippled over and began getting sick from Bile buildup right in front of 2 EMS that did nothing. I went back home, tried to just get through it, until I woke up the next morning and getting sick. This time, it was blood. I called 911 and forced them to get me into ER.

Since August I have not had a single sip of any alcoholic beverages and it has been so worth it. Recovery was hard, my body was telling me to drink but I did not want it. This was the single best choice in my life, everything is so much better without it. Since that time, I have gotten a promotion at work, learned a ton of new skills, started reading again, started investing again and just generally trying to take care of myself. It had been so long since my body and mind were this healthy and I am forever grateful for my gf, her son and my family for being there for me so I could be the person they deserve.

I've been serious about not drinking. I've had a few slip-ups these last couple of weeks but I'm realizing that the slip-ups only happen to manage withdrawal symptoms. I think. I hadn't drank in a couple weeks until today, had 2 shots to alleviate the headache. I don't want to be drunk. I don't want to drink. I've been having crazy intense migraines (and also constant regular headaches) for about 5 days. It's becoming unbearable, I got migraine-specific meds from urgent care today but it didn't help at all.

I've been trying to contact a primary care doctor (I very recently just got insurance through my employer) and be brutally honest and see if the alcohol withdrawal is what's causing my migraines. I do have a history of migraines so it could be unrelated - I often go a week or two without drinking and don't have physical symptoms like this. So i'm not sure if it's related. But damn I can't even think through the pain enough to call doctors anymore. Honestly I only called a couple places before I gave up and closed my eyes in bed, the only way to alleviate the throbbing in my brain. My household constantly has screaming children (edit: I should clarify that these children aren't mine). My partner is angry at me because I've been irritable and wanting quiet for almost a week and his response to my irritability is to hide downstairs with his friends (that are my roommates but truly they are always on his side in any conflict we have) and ignore me. I'm crying all the time, in pain, in anxiety, in a desperate need for help and quiet.

This is partially a stopdrinking/mental health post I suppose, I just need help and typing this out is taking so much effort but idk what else to do. Anyone here have BCBS from Michigan? I'm in metro detroit, would love a recommendation for a trustworthy doctor that I could come to with all of this.

I know it's a strange weird thought, I'm just wondering if anybody else has struggled with this. Not just the not drinking today but the pestering thought of not having any excitement to look forward to in the future.

Edit: as a secondary question... for people that have some time under their belt without drinking, did you try to do a back and forth with, ""I will only drink on the weekends"" or ""I will only drink once a month"" etc?

I attended an AA meeting for the first time on zoom today. I think I may need to do it every day for a while. I’m debating coming clean with my therapist as well. I’ve been in therapy since the beginning of January and don’t feel like I’m making any progress yet. I haven’t been dishonest about anything, but I haven’t been forthcoming with all the deep dark shit either. My therapist seems to be having a hard time fitting me in for the next couple months as well. I don’t blame her at all for being booked up, but I’m in a deep dark hole right now and I really need help.

I feel like I have absolutely no idea who I am. Today feels long, still haven’t really sleep since yesterday, but for me day 1 is relatively easy. It’s tomorrow and the next day and after that that I’m going to be beside myself depressed and anxious and hating myself and dysfunctional in my life. I know the drinking is sabotaging my life...I get in such a bad state that I don’t care, I figure maybe I’ll get alcohol poisoning and die, and that’ll be fine. Of course it’s not fine at all because I have a beautiful little girl who needs her mommy and I’m terrified of fucking her up - I’m terrified of fucking her up no matter what I do because I am fucked up.

It’s not really accidental anymore, like when one drink turns to 6 or whatever. I totally know when I’m driving to the store buy alcohol that I’m going to get as plastered as possible until I pass out.

I’m starting to let go of the fantasy that I’ll be able to return to alcohol in a healthy way after having a break from it. I think my life is just going to have to look a whole lot different now. I have no idea what that’s going to look like. My marriage isn’t what it used to be as well. I keep trying to convince myself that it’s fine and we’re working on it, but my heart isn’t convinced. I haven’t worn my wedding ring since January 2020...I keep thinking I should, but I can’t bring myself to.

It’s really terrifying, the idea that when I stop drinking, that’s when I’ll actually need to deal with all the shit and the problems underneath the drinking. How do you face it??

I’m posting it here as an illustration of the lengths that my brain/body/addiction went to to keep me drinking and the reasons that I’ve chosen to stop drinking. Some people may be able to moderate with ease or without effort, but that’s not my experience. 

The following is my internal voice:

Okay! I have *the* plan to help us control our drinking. So, simply keep it to X beers a night. Actually, that’s probably too much. Let’s keep it to X beers on Friday. That’s easy. X beers, once a week. 

Wow. Tuesday was rough. I know that we're waiting for Friday for our X beers, but this was really tough. Let’s take the edge off and allow ourselves (X-1) beers tonight. Since it’s less than the number of beers we allocate for Friday, I think it’s okay. Besides, that just means that we have Y beers per week. Y = X + (X-1) or Y = 2X-1. That’s fine, we can handle that.

Oh, look at the calendar. Next week is the company holiday party. It’ll be weird and uncomfortable to totally not drink, even though it is Thursday. So, let’s allow ourselves Z beers at the party. This is an atypical event, but we do have usual happy hours at work about twice a month and I don’t want us to miss out on those. So let’s allow the Z beers at the company party and have half of those for each happy hour. So… we have a total of M beers for the special events. Where M = Z + 26\*(Z/2) or M=14Z.

Maybe it’ll help to think about this on an annual basis. So far, we have Y beers per week, just for regular life--because it turns out that all of our Tuesdays are rough at work now--and M beers for special events. So, N = 52Y + M = 104X + 14Z - 52. Well, it appears that there are two degrees of freedom in this equation and no constraints other than we can safely assume that both X and Z are greater than 0 and are most likely not equal. So, let’s say X > 0 and Z > 0 and X != Z. For simplicity, let’s just assume that Z > X, since Z is a “special event” kind of day. We’re still under-constrained, though, and any increase in X is going to result in an increase in Z and over time, this is going to be a disaster. Or is it? Maybe drinking more will be okay for us this time. After all, we have an equation, so we have control!

In the interest of science and math, let’s proceed! 

A few months later, we’ve discovered that in general, Mondays aren’t fun. Sundays leading into the week are a huge stressor. Tuesdays we’ve already observed are hard, but they’ve gotten harder. Thursday has the happy hours every other week that we can look forward to, as well as the once a year company holiday party, but on those off weeks, I think we should be able to enjoy a drink on Thursday, too! Friday is a good night to really cut loose and Saturday, being a free day deserves a drink too. Also, since Friday can get a bit crazy, I’ve noticed that we need to drink a few more beers on Saturday a little earlier in the day to address the beers/hangover from Friday. The math is getting more complex… Here’s what I have for my weekly drinking, though:

Y = 2X - 1 covers our initial weekly drinking on Tuesday and Friday, but since Tuesday has increased, we need to reassess. So, going from Y = X + (X-1), it looks like we’re more or less equal between Tuesday and Friday. Okay… let’s be honest with ourselves, that’s why we’re here after all. Friday is a fun day, one where we can really cut loose. We're usually drinking 2-3 more beers on Friday than on Tuesday, so we’re now working with Y’ = (X+2.5) + X or Y’ = 2X + 2.5. Let’s call the rest of the week R, and R = X + X + 0.5X + X = 3.5X. This covers Monday, Wednesday, every other Thursday, and Sunday and since I’ve been drinking about the same every night, I went with the same number of beers on all the nights. Thus, if I look at our entire year, or 52\*R, I get how much we drink on those nights combined. Then add in 52\*Y’ and I fill in the other nights. Let’s put this together. For a full year, Q = 52Y’ + 52R + 14Z. Expanded, I think we have Q = 52(2X + 2.5) + 52(3.5X) + 14Z or Q = 286X + 14Z + 130.

In terms of constraints… well, I think that the driver is Z, or how much we drink at the company party, and I guess there really aren’t any constraints? Since we're drinking half of what we drink at the company party at the happy hours and feel the need… I mean, “*desire*” (which we can **totally** control) to drink the same each normal night as we do the happy hours. I mean, we only want to drink as much at the happy hours as on a normal night. But, who am I kidding, if we have a beer or two at the happy hour, we're definitely going to go home and have a couple more; we wouldn’t want anyone at home to think anything had changed and we really don’t feel *that* buzzed when we get home, so I’ll add another beer… two beers onto our every other Thursday, ugh, and I completely forgot that we drink 1.25 beers on Saturday for every beer we drink on Friday, to help fight the hangover. 

Okay, let’s start over.  We're okay having a beer tonight. I mean, three beers tonight. No more. The happy hour is Thursday, so we can have a few more, that’s okay, it won’t mess up our plan too bad. You know what, this is a lot of planning, and we’re here to drink and have fun. When we're at the happy hour, I’m okay letting my count slide a bit. Then again, we’ll feel awful on Friday, so it’ll take a few more to relieve the stress of working through a hangover. Oh, that’s right, that’ll bump up what we need on Saturday. Ugh, that’ll lead to a concerning number of drinks on Saturday… Okay, I can fix this, we have a stash in my basement workshop so no one will know how much we drink so we don't have to count those.

OR. I can just not drink. 

I think that’s the easier choice. Letting go of all that incessant planning has been a huge boost for my mental capacity these last five months(!) and that’s not even taking the logistics of buying (managing the rotation of visits to grocery stores, gas stations, and liquor stores and multiple bank accounts and credit cards to hide when and how much I’m buying) into consideration. Although I’ve been on here for much longer, this is the first go round where I’ve really been *investing* myself into stopping drinking and everyone here has played a key role, whether through direct support or just reading and tolerating my (at times… like now) rambling and ranty posts. Thank you all. You’re awesome.

I will not drink with you today. After all, that is the simpler way to go.",20,0

I am 40 and have drank heavily everyday since 21.  I sometimes wonder why I decided to put myself through this awful experiment.  It’s because I am weird and am not a normal person.  When I was younger I used to watch programs on the television that oftentimes featured an addict who had lost everything to drug use, which in my childhood had such a stigma attached to it that no one would go near these substances of their own volition.  But in my fucked mind I wondered “if a substance caused this person to sacrifice everything, I must know what it is like to be on the other side of it”.  And literally went out and got myself an opioid addiction.  As a young adult I bestowed this upon myself, I know it sounds like I was a schoolboy but I was in my 20s at the time.  Got off that 5 or more years later, curiosity sated, liver in somewhat less of a condition than when I started my little journey.  My alcohol problem started earlier and for different reasons.  I’m not going to sit here and blame my parents, or anyone else.  They did the best they could, trying to be the best mom and dad there ever was to me, their first experiment in raising a child, after 2 miscarriages which devastated my mother.  They always tried to protect child-me from the world, and of course when I was of age I fled out into the world, full of zero confidence and even less practical experience.  I was shit at getting laid and hadn’t a clue how to go about unlocking that achievement, so I found beer.  I would go out to the bars by myself (even if that is it’s own tired and sad trope) in my early 20s when I should have been out with my friends.  Got thrown out of bars and pissed many people off who in reality you could say this person writing this has technically never met before, because by then the machinations in my body which drive the ship on autopilot would have engaged without effort and I by that time would have long since stopped being me.  I didn’t learn then, and not years later, even after meeting my beautiful wife who has given me the best 18 years of life that anyone has ever had.  Drinking was a routine at this point.  It was mechanical and started at a time and place predetermined by me that on a work day would result in the maximum alcohol intake possible in a two or 3 hour timeframe before sleep was administered artificially by use of zQuil and marijuana in combination with alcohol’s effects.  The effects over time were carefully calculated and measured to ensure I awoke in what I determined beforehand to be a suitable and functional state in order to perform my job without ever raising curiosity that I was a drunk.  I was very skilled at this.  I would use breath mints, mouthwash, my job enabled me to choose my locations so early in the morning I could avoid being in close proximity to other people.  I would use cologne, but not shitty cologne it would be good stuff, as shitty cologne would be an obvious masking tactic.  My hands were starting to get minor shakes, but over the years I had perfected a method to disguise this as well, by stopping the use of my muscles below my elbow to the maximum extent possible so as to minimise and visible shakes.  To my knowledge no one was able to catch on.  I had higher than normal levels of discipline and my career was very important to me.  After all, I was smarter and much more careful than those drunks you see on television /////s.  The weekends were basically two hangovers, the big one on Saturday morning and a slightly lesser one on Sunday.  Saturday all day I was unable to operate a motor vehicle, and I would always laugh it off.  I’m not sure now how you can laugh that off.  Maybe because covid made everything feel more hopeless, like the whole world was slowly getting fistfucked and nothing really mattered anymore, cheers pour me another one LoLoLzzz.  My wife would stay up and drink with me, she would never get as wrecked and blackout fucked up like me, and of course in my deluded mind I always think “yeah girls are more ladylike, yeah, they don’t get drunk like us guys” cause they’re smaller etc....it’s not that I have a problem it’s that she just happens to drink LESS.  So on my 40th birthday we were hanging out having a good time no problems, drinking some beer and everything was great.  Was in a good mood having a great time.  That’s the last thing I remember before I ceased to exist and some unknown entity whom I’ve never known existed took the controls to my physical body and proceeded to do God knows what.  My wife still thankfully hasn’t told me.  I wasn’t there.  I know it was bad.  I know nothing else, just that familiar terror/shame combo you get the next day when your wife asks why you are no longer angry with her and you never were.

  26 days ago I ended that life.  I ended it cold turkey, along with cigarette smoking by proxy.  I only smoked those when I drank.  In my new life my office looks different, it has a different desk with which I’m hardly familiar, I drive a different truck, a really nice loaded expensive truck that I could never own.  I probably look different, feel smaller, it’s weird.  I sound different when I speak.  This is my new life.  My wife is still here, and my house, my dog, my job.  I pulled the trigger on what was my old existence before I hit rock bottom.  I would REALLY like to think that anyhow.  This new existence comes with someone else’s sleep pattern, it’s unknown to me and feels like cloths that don’t fit.  I will get used to it I tell myself.  It’s not easy rewinding time and going into the past before you died from a drunk driving incident, suicide or cirrhosis, being killed by police, etc, but I’ve managed to do that.  
The first week was fine no DT’s no withdrawals.  Felt good.  Second week the never ending headache started.  It’s still there now, unaffected by medication (both anti inflammatory and pain relievers).  I get hungry at lame-o-clock (like 5 or 6 pm) when the normal people eat and I use to drink and laugh at them and then eat at 9pm after many beers and sleep horribly until the workday started.  I think to myself that there are icing people out there who live this way and have no issues with it.  Yes there is boredom, it’s minor, I used to be able to watch paint dry if I could drink beer whilst doing so.  It’s not that boring.  I have my sweet wife, whom all of my effort is for, for our marriage and our life together.  Whenever I have doubts I think about the things I have wrote about.  I won the game.  At day 26 lol.  No I haven’t won yet, but I tried using my head.  There is a drug called Antibuse (disulfarim).  It’s chantix for drunks.  It causes your body to metabolise alcohol into a toxin which makes you violently ill if you drink.  The effects of the last dose (this part is genius) last two weeks, so you can’t just have a bad day and stop taking it and start drinking.  I will continue taking these everyday.  I want my headache to go away someday.  I don’t particularly enjoy having basic energy some days and feel like no energy other days.  I’d like that to stop as well.  But bear in mind, these affects on my physical body are nothing compared to the hell that is opioid withdrawal.  That’s like being frozen to death by liquid nitrogen and AT THE SAME TIME being incinerated with a flamethrower for 24 hours a day everyday for 3 months, and the following (and preceding) 3 months you hardly have the energy to crawl or even to fucking breathe.  I use these ragged memories of mine for strength during this next fight against my other addiction in which I am currently engaged.  

I’m not sure how finish this, I have to leave work and go home and finish the 26th day and make it to the 27th.  I’m just going to end it here.  It feels good to write this down, and maybe some of this will help someone else who feels the same.",6,2

# “The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.”

― **Stephen McCranie** 

&#x200B;

I remember when I wanted to stop drinking I tried and failed soooooo many times. I would tell people in my life this is it, I'm done, no more alcohol for me. Then the next time I'd see them, I'd be ashamed. In fact, it's one of the reasons for why I isolated myself even more, so I wouldn't have to deal with being seen as a failure (in my mind). 

If you feel like a failure because you drank AGAIN, stop it. It took me years of saying I would stop before I stopped. This is not a easy thing to do, and it takes courage to face your demons, whether you beat em this time or not. If you relapse, give yourself some credit for trying, pick yourself up, and try again, because as long as you don't give up, you will win eventually.",27,0

First time I quit people thought it was weird, most of them couldn't tell when I was drunk. I wasn't always drunk but you know how that goes, you have a few, you have a few more, suddenly you're in the middle of a binge drinking episode. 

So my new thing is getting drunk and having random conversation with random friends. Sometimes I don't remember them when I wake up in the morning. None of them have been controversial or offensive but damnit, I want to be in control of those conversations and remember them. 

I want my health to come first. I want to meet a woman and have a healthy relationship completely sober. I want be around people who are enjoying themselves and not indulge but not be uptight. 

Last time I quit I publicly called out that I was an alcoholic. People were weird about it. This time I'm just stopping. I like to exercise and drinking just gets in the way of exercise. 

I applaud all of you, I never stopped reading your posts, I never stopped thinking about what I was doing to myself. Now it's time for me to hold myself accountable. I have a couple friends I'm comfortable telling but it's a short list.

He told me I actually become LESS interesting and engaged when drunk, and he has noticed that friends stop paying attention to me/what I am saying and focus their attention on others.  That was eye opening to me.  I agree, once I get a strong buzz I kind of zone out and the obsession takes over.  I think I become quiter because I don't want to embarrass myself.

Thinking back on events, I realized I was obsessing more over drinking/where my next drink would come from that I would frequently MISS important parts of the event!  For example, missing long stretches of comedy acts or concerts because I was standing in a long line to get another drink at the bar.

The mental gymnastics of trying to figure out how to sneak an extra drink when socializing so I can still get as drunk as I want while appearing to be drinking socially.

 However, after relapse I reached out to them and I got amazing support which was amazing and and thinking about how much easier it might have been if I had just send a quick text or ask for a phone call to say that i want to drink.

 I also reached out to my former sponsor after drinking versus before and she was incredibly helpful. Why didn't I reach out before drinking because it wasn't just a spur-of-the-moment let's drink, I had to do things like take out cash, go to the liquor store etc

i am a pescetarian and dont eat any meat besides seafood. i have no issues with people eating meat or being around meat. once in a blue moon ill even have a bite if my bf says hey this is a good piece of meat, but ill never be tempted or crave it after that. i even cook meat and have no temptations to eat it. i also dont drink soda but i did have an addiction to that before. now i cant stand more than a few sips. im the same mindset with cigarettes too. dont at all crave it, even though i sometimes smoke when i drink and did casually when i was younger. just never liked it. alcohol on the other hand... once i have that first drink there's no stopping me. such a pity how i can have so much self control in other aspects of my life but not alcohol once i start. of course i know alcohol is addictive but so are cigarettes right? even soda for some people. and most ppl i know wouldnt give up meat. why cant i just feel the same way about alcohol? these are more rhetorical questions. i know the reasons. and i know meat and sugar is not the same as alcohol. 

anyway just taking it day by day still...

I was driving my SO to work for shits n gigs and was laughing because it just felt so good to not feel awful. I just said “god I love being sober and being this clear”.

I still have to sometimes convince myself I’m not hungover. I realized I focused all day, every day, on my gut pain that would be caused from drinking. It only went away if I drank more (momentarily) or if I didn’t drink for a couple of days (but wow we couldn’t be doing that). I would have to sit in certain ways to feel some relief and it also had me at the store buying a ton of stuff I thought would help relieve the pain. Today I realized I was sitting in a way that wouldn’t have flown if I was in pain. It would have been pressing on the spot and my anxiety would make me feel like I couldn’t breath.

But nothing hurt, I was breathing normal, and I just felt GOOD. 

Another thing I’ve noticed is feeling like I can’t recall everything that happened the night before. I’ll see something that reminds me of the previous night and start thing “shit, what happened”, but then I remember I didn’t drink and I can recall everything. It’s really bizarre.

But whatever. I feel good. I’m happy for today.

So I'm worried (more like convinced) that I'm drinking too much because of underlying mental health issues. My mother had some pretty severe issues with anxiety and depression. She eventually stopped working a very physically demanding nursing job at a nursing home a few years before she passed away because of health issues. I'm assuming most of it was her back and heart, but as I look back on my childhood I'm seeing a lot of signs that she really struggled with her mental health. I also feel like my family most likely has some functioning addicts and I'm definitely one of them. My mother never drank, but my dad loved to drink and smoke weed and my uncle likes to drink. Everyone ""has their shit together"" enough, but there are clearly some issues there. 

I don't have any crazy tales about my drinking, but I know it's a problem. I'm drinking more than I should, I'm drinking alone, and I look forward to drinking alone early on days off or just on days I don't have a lot to do.  I just got a new job with good health benefits and I'm going to start going to therapy. I have plenty of issues to sort through, but I know my drinking is going to be a focal point. 

I'm not even sure what I'm asking or why I'm making a thread. I guess I want to hear about other people's experiences with therapy? I'm afraid that if I'm honest about my issues with drinking that there will somehow be some kind of file my employer will keep on me that shows I'm an alcoholic even though I'm pretty sure that would be a major HIPAA violation.

So I put forth the intention that as I get rid of the addiction I will reach a point that it is not a ""thing"" anymore. Where it is nothing, with no cravings & no mental energy required to stay away from it. Not drinking will be as natural as breathing air.

I’ve been in psychology/social work for about 4 years now, and I’m starting to get the hint that is just the nature of these jobs. It sucks, I feel like I’ve wasted a lot of time. Almost all of these jobs caused stress and anxiety enough to where I felt like I couldn’t sleep or get a peaceful moment without being hammered. I’ve drank pretty heavily for about 6 years, and in the last three its ramped up quite a lot. This last year has been the worst, working from home got me into the habit of drinking from 10a until I went to sleep at night, almost non-stop. Since leaving this job, I’ve worked to build in more self care time, be more mindful of my why’s for drinking, and have worked very hard to cut back as much as I can, as I’m really scared to just stop cold turkey. Some days have been more successful than others, but the last two days have been amazing. I’ve reduced my drinking by over half what it was previously, and I feel like I’m really starting to understand why I wanted to drink, and am combatting those thoughts and learning to sit with those feelings. 

Yesterday I was hit with such a wave of emotions I had been suppressing with drinking. It all started getting much much worse for me when I lost a very close loved one three years ago. Ive still not been able to let myself feel and process all of that. Ive drank nonstop to keep those thoughts away. Luckily, I was stone sober throughout the whole day! I spent a good amount of time at the gym, cooked a nice meal, and then went to sit by her grave in the evening. I just sat and sobbed and talked to her for a while. She was the only person I’ve ever felt like really loved me unconditionally, always listened, and always supported my decisions. It fucking blows knowing I cant have this with other family members, and I cant just pop in to see her anymore or even give her a phone call. All in all, I just really needed to experience that feeling again and it was tremendously therapeutic.

I feel like I’m finally figuring this out, and I want it to last. I have seen all of the love and support here, and I’m absolutely blown away by it. I’m going to tap into this more frequently as I keep moving forward. Thank you all for your wonderful examples of compassion.

We all know how attitudes toward cigarettes have swung drastically over the past 4 decades. These days smoking is considered extremely unwise/deadly/filthy/expensive, etc. Alcohol gets none of this treatment. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. All the harm and danger gets glossed over. I think it will be interesting to see how alcohol is treated by society in 40 years. Perhaps by that time drinking alcohol will be viewed as cigarette smoking is currently. Hard to say, of course. But there’s probably a decent chance that it will be less popular in the future than it is now. If alcohol is more popular in 40 years than it is now, that’s bad news in my opinion.

After decades of drink I knew personally I was in trouble.  Hidden bottles around the house, lying to my family and lying to myself that I had things under control.  Things were not under control, I was slowly being squashed to death both physically and mentally by alcohol.  I was entrapped and I was a slave.  I'd quit a couple of years earlier for six months but fell back into the enjoyment and routine of drink quite easily.  Then one night five years ago today a traffic stop.  My wife and daughter were in the car and I was driving.  Roadside breathalyzer testing and all the fear and humiliation that comes along in that situation.

I was having dinner in my room at Caesar’s, and I really needed something to wash things down and I wanted something different than water. I had the mini bar in the room and it had Pepsi in it. I thought “they will probably charge me $10 for a can of Pepsi” or some ridiculous price. 

And then I thought to myself, “Self, if you were still drinking, you would have probably spent at least a few hundred dollars on drinks by now. So go ahead and have a $10 Pepsi!”  And then I had another one after that. 

It’s crazy to think about how much money we wasted on alcohol over the years. According to an app I use, I’ve saved $9500 in two and a half years I’ve been sober, and almost $3000 in cigarettes since I quit those.

He truly is the most amazing human when sober. We dated twenty ish years ago and I know he was the one who got away. I didn’t know he was heavily drinking when we dated, or that it was the start of his heavy drinking. 

He says he’s been diagnosed bipolar, which makes a lot of sense, and that he wants to be sober, and I believe he does.  He’s had a rough round of things the past couple years, and since we’ve reconnected (I thought) we both fell for each other hard again. He wanted to get inpatient care and rehab but, keeps falling through the cracks. 

When I say he’s amazing when sober, that’s an understatement. He’s also amazing when drunk, but it’s not healthy and it’s scary. I know he’s put away 2-3 liters of booze a day at times. Right now, for the second time this month, he’s gone to detox in the hospital, ended up in a behavioral health ward, we don’t hear from him for days, and this time his mom says he’s only allowed to get his stuff and leave when he’s out. Through her I’ve heard he finally contacted her and he wants to just go to a homeless shelter. 

I can’t stand that thought, yet I can’t have him move in where I live. 

This man, counsels people for a living, he’s an amazing musician, a beyond caring person, and an amazing soul. Everyone he comes in contact with has always been drawn to him. His amazing blue eyes you could get lost in, his enigmatic personality, the way he makes you feel safe and cared for, he makes your fears wash away, he tries to shelter you from not only his BS, but the worlds. There is almost nothing he can’t do...except stay sober. 

I know that even me going to bed and him not hearing from me for hours one night scared the crap out of him, at the same time one of the guys he used to counsel was on a bender and he was scared. He knows death can happen in the blink of an eye, so I’m very unsure we he can’t stop, even for a week. 

There was a post the other day by someone who hit me like some bricks. It fit me to a T, except my friend, is still alive. I know I can’t be with him until he works on himself and that’s also killing me as much as knowing he’s going through this. I am powerless, just like he is to the alcohol. 

Is there anything I can do besides listen? Hopefully he contacts me when he’s able, and I want to be prepared. I tried tough love on the outside, but he also knows I’ll pick up the pieces. Do I not pick them up this time? Is there anything I can do, even if small to help him out? He’d move mountains for me, I’d like to try to do the same.",1,0

After a really bad holiday season I made the decision to get back on the wagon. I did some other positive changes too, like finding a therapist and an antidepressant that works. I feel like all of this stuff has been working, and my life has just been getting progressively better every day. My mood is better, I'm friendlier, I'm laughing a lot harder and easier, I have more energy and passion for my hobbies. 

This is the really sick part. I didn't want any of my positive changes to work. I didn't want to feel better. I specifically wanted all of that stuff to NOT work so that I could give up and go back to self medicating with alcohol. I haven't been checking in here, I haven't been talking to my therapist about my alcoholism, I haven't told hardly anyone that I'm sober now, because I haven't wanted the accountability. 

The upshot is, I'm kind of stuck in this rut where my life keeps improving but I kind of resent it for improving. But all of this stuff I've been doing IS working, whether I like it or not. When the weather gets better I can even start exercising again, and annoyingly, that will probably make my life better as well.

Today marks day 2. Yesterday was a bit of a challenge but I made it! One day at a time. I started to get cravings but I was able to do the right thing. I’m proud of myself. It’s a start. 

The one downside is that I’ve been completely exhausted yet when I try to sleep, my mind races and won’t let me. I’ve tried all different methods to try and crash (all sober methods like meditation, breathing techniques, counting, sounds) but nothing seems to work. I think it’s because I’m so used to getting stoned and/or drunk to pass out but now that I don’t have that, my body is confused about what to do. I’m hoping that eventually I can normalize a sleep schedule and possibly use this extra energy for something positive like the gym. But one day at a time. The last time I quit I think I stayed in bed for my first week since I experienced similar but after that I felt like a million bucks. It still beats hangovers though. This time I just can’t get too cocky once I begin to feel “better.” I took a week off from work just for safe measure so I can hopefully get over the first rocky week with as little stress as possible. At least the last time I quit, the first week was the hardest. 

I am happy to make it to day 2! Today I have an appointment with my therapist and we’re going to discuss options for my mental health, potential outpatient treatment as well as something to possibly curve the cravings. I’m really hoping it helps. My fiancé has been incredibly supportive with my sobriety goals and I think that if I do it right this time that perhaps we can rekindle things. After all, the only time we typically have issues is when one of us drink. 

I’m looking for some new hobbies to pick up in order to distract myself from the bottle. Unfortunately where I live, it seems like just about everyone drinks to have “fun.” I’d like to pick up some cool, unique hobbies that aren’t super expensive but entertaining, productive and positive. What are some hobbies you picked up during your sober journey?

I started questioning my behavior pretty early on, as it seemed like I always wanted more than my female friends and was sad when there was no alcohol around. I had some bad things happen but nothing that would make people call me an alcoholic. I'm almost done with grad school, have a clean house, people see me as caring. But I was making myself suffer through hangovers, upset stomach and I kept drinking out of boredom. There was this creeping thought these past couple of years, that asked why I was drinking when it didn't even make me feel good after the initial rush. It made me complacent and it increased my anxiety. It's probably the reason I stayed with my ex as long as I did, all we ever did was drink together. But at the same time it felt so hard to give up, like it was part of my personality. I'm that beer girl you know? 

Then last year my partner got addicted when he was depressed. After work he'd have to drink 3-4 tall beers to get to sleep. Whenever we'd meet in the evenings he wanted to drink and even for me, it was hard to keep up. I started getting tired of all the drinking. I felt distance between us because of the alcohol. Finally he told me he had a problem and wanted to go to a clinic. I was so relieved I almost cried. And I finally stopped drinking. I bought ""Alcohol explained"" (brillant book) and immersed myself in all the info I had been avoiding all those years. It was like I had the perfect ""excuse"". My family was certainly experiencing mixed feelings. Wine is a big deal for my parents. They definitely use alcohol as a crutch, as does my brother. They started justifying their drinking without me asking. People wouldn't call them alcoholics either but they definitely cling to stuff like ""I only drink for the taste"" or ""I don't drink to relieve my anxiety"". My partner and I don't drink now and it's helped in many ways. Our relationship is even stronger than it was, emotionally and physically. I had been taking antidepressants since I was 16. I feel healthier now overall and I was able to finally start therapy and exercise/physiotherapy (turns out I was numbing feelings and fibromyalgia pain!). I now have a lot of time to figure out what I actually like doing.  

But I want to be honest, after listening to Naked Mind a lot, I was kind of hoping to cure my depression like the author. She got off all antidepressants and I thought that was so awesome. Now I'm in the middle of an anxious/depressed phase and I will try to change medications and work through it with therapy. But I guess I have to come to terms with the fact that sobriety isn't a cure-all.
I wish I was an entirely different person, the truth is I have the capacity to change things about my life now, but it still takes time and effort.

I'm sorry for the incredibly long post. I hope someone who's had depression since childhood and has used alcohol or other drugs can relate. Let's continue to try our best together. I'm happy I moved on from alcohol. This sub has been great and motivates me every day.",45,0

But the last couple of years my drinking has gotten so bad I'm making decisions I never would have, caving into temptation and making mistakes and now its cost me. 
She even said she would still be willing to be friends with me but I cant be just friends with her and I wouldn't want her round me anyway. I've become a mess and am so ashamed of myself and for what?

I mean I could probably have just one and no one would know and I’m sure I could have just one. 

I would go weeks before the thought would enter my head... “see, I can have just one with no problems. So if I can do it once, why not again. I have a handle on this”. 

So there you go, go from zero drinks, to having “just one” once in a while; no problem, right? No harm no foul if it stays like that. 

HOWEVER, it never works out like that. Sure, it may start out like that. But in quick order, it would go a little bit like this. 

Every 2 weeks having one drink 
Every week having one shot
Every weekend night having one drink 
Every weekend night having a couple 

Tipping point...

Let it go a bit on one weekend night 
Let it go most of the weekend 
Weekends now start on Thursday. 

Same as always. It Never changes. 

I know this all to well, it happens  EVERY single time. I don’t know of one person that was able to restart and drink like a gentleman, it just does not work that way. 

So the secret to my longevity in my recovery is simply this… Don’t ever have that first drink under any circumstances. We are just one drink away from the ditch my friends, avoid at all costs, or it will cost you everything. 

It is far easier to stay quit, then to quit.

Like it’s absolute misery. We have been so busy I work 12 hour shifts and I’m just balls to the wall. I haven’t gotten a lunch break the last two days because we’re so busy. I work from home so I eat it’s not like I’m starving but I just can’t afford to walk away from my desk. 

Anyways my coworker he’s a nice guy but he’s older and he responds to my questions or things with one letter or one word answers Biggest being K to everything just irritates the life out of me. 

Today I was at my wits end like I had had it. A few months ago I would have been planning on going to the bar and I would be wasted. Instead today I decided today’s the day I try to conquer my Goliath and run up this giant hill by my house. The hill is about a mile long and insanely steep. I see joggers all the time and envy them. so I clocked out for my lunch put my headphones in and took off. I failed miserably I made it one third of the way up and was so out of breath I thought I was gonna pass out. 

So I sat on a bench and got my breath back and decided to just walk up the hill and down it. Well I got to the top and thought screw it see how far you can make it jogging down it. I had music on and was just kinda jamming out. Before I even noticed I was at the bottom of the hill still jogging and not winded at all. I mean I was panting sure but not the OH GOD I CANT BREATH IM GONNA DIE! Panting I had before. 

It really cemented how far I have come this year. 8 months ago I never would have been able to run let alone up an incline like I did today. Not only did I drink like a fish when I drank I smoked like a chimney. I quit smoking cigarettes 2 months into quitting drinking. I have a vape I use when my cravings get out of hand but it’s nowhere near as much as I used to smoke. I bought a bottle of juice when I got my vape and I still have 2/3s of it so from a pack a day to a few puffs here and there I’ll take it. 

My body feels better. I’ve noticed myself drinking water more and cutting out most junk food. I didn’t actively make the decision to quit drinking sodas and eating candy I just stopped without noticing. When I was hungover Coca Cola and monster energy was the only thing that made my hangover feel better. I would drink 3-6 cokes a day. Now I’m down to 1 a day on a bad day and usually that’s just if I’m having a meal not just on its own. Part of why I started a new diet and whatnot is because I had already made enough little changes the big changes I needed to make weren’t going to be as bad as I thought. 

I have come so far in these last 7 months and I’m proud of the person I have turned into. My relationships are getting better my temper is easier to control I haven’t done anything I regret I just am so damn happy with my progress. I get texts or calls from  the old drinking buddies and I just ignore them. They aren’t doing anything to better their lives or situations and I don’t need that in my life. 

On my first day of this journey I never thought I would be where I am. I was sleeping on my parents couch my wife was done and about to divorce me I was in jeopardy of losing my job and I couldn’t see my kids. Tonight I’m writing this post because my daughter (2) scared the crap out of me by waking me up to cuddle my wife is sawing logs next to me and my son is in his crib sound asleep and my daughter is next to me in bed. These nights are what I live for now. No amount of whiskey or Guinness can ever give me this. 

Anyways I’m rambling. I am so thankful for all the help I have gotten through this community. I am the dad my kids deserve and the husband my wife needs. I will never meet most of you who have commented or given me support but I love all of you and I hope your journeys go as well as mine has so far.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)   and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me  and  feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a  long  time and want to inspire others.

It   doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or   been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a   sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

–––

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.   It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes   impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person   can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**   A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next  24  hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a   pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you   do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:**   A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek   advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in   your own thread.

Good morning, SD! It’s Wednesday and we’re halfway through the work week.

Right before the pandemic hit, I remember going to a gathering sober and realizing I didn’t have to empty the cash out of my wallet beforehand. I didn’t have to worry about losing my coat. Or my phone. *Or my shoes*. I didn’t have to worry that I would devolve into making incredibly reckless, dangerous, and irresponsible decisions once I’d had one or twelve too many. This was something I used to worry about all the time.

Trust is something I try not to take for granted now. My loved ones can trust me to be there for them and that I’m reliable. But most importantly, I can trust myself. And that, is freedom.

How are you feeling today, SD? How’s your relationship with trust, and has it changed since getting clean? I’d love to hear from you.

I'm learning a little more each time..but it's annoying (and dangerous due to already being hurt by my pancreas before) that I have to keep learning shit I already knew.

The last time i had any, i bought 2 shooters and a selzter - tossed one of the shooters and poured out half the can...But, even the shitty food i eat could set off the good ol' pancreas so ANY is a bullet loaded. Plus, why stay a slave to that shit if i'm willing to only consume THAT little of it? Like.. clearly if during a craving that's ""all i need"", then i dont need it.

I think drinking just became an anchor to a world that didn't exist anymore...a taste of nights with friends that no longer stop by, songs that just dont sound the same,worlds in video games felt so much bigger,and time didnt go by so fucking fast. But, making wine out of Member-berries isn't a time machine - it's just a suicide booth. At this point, I'd really rather NOT be that drunk i used to be...and if i tried it would just kill me fast. I just hope I can survive the damage he left behind.

That ""5 days"" is just a technicality. I literally spent the entire day drinking, every single day..for most of this decade. I know when I ""quit drinking"" and the world hasn't been the same since. It changed in the blink of an eye and now I just have to catch up to it... And you know what... even if it turns out I drowned myself too deep in this ocean for any lifeguard to reach? That's no reason to further allow the bottle to steal what life I have left...Some people get cancer and live to 90, Others never see enough birthdays to have their first drink. If there's no method to the madness... then we're just in pure unhinged chaos and that's all the more reason to buckle up and keep my eye on this bumpy road.

1. Addiction is patient.  I've got two years under my belt.  At times I think I could now moderate, but then I snap back to my ""right"" brain and remember that no. I couldn't do it before, and I won't be able to do it now.  Dont throw away all these days!

I’ve had my black-outs, I’ve spent my last dollar on alcohol before when I could’ve bought food, it used to be a way to open up socially but it wouldn’t be long til I was on the floor in the bathroom of where ever I was. It would sneakily become a coping mechanism, I’d buy a six pack or wine as a special thing to “unwind” and end up continuing to drink every evening after work.

The other day I felt crushed, my job has been treating me horribly, it’s led me to such a dark place and I work in a grocery store so when I got off, I went and I stared at the beer section, I fought off thoughts about “drinking away my sorrows” and I made the decision to walk away. I fought the thoughts back with reminders of the fights I’ve started with my partner when I’ve drank during times like this, with how amplifying such darkness would only lead to irrational choices and it was only the self destructive part of me that wanted me to say yes.

Sometimes I’ll be staring at a tree or a sign and just feel so bizarre at how crisp and clear it is.

I was getting vertigo way too much when I was hungover. And just plain dissociating. It’s awful what I was putting myself through for literally a decade.

Today I was filling my car up with gas and I was staring at the sign of some company across from me and thinking “Is this what I felt like as a kid when I would be out in the playground? Or when I played sports? Or as I sat in school and learned? Was this the lens I looked from?” It sort of made me sad to realize how long it had been for me to feel properly sober and clear. 

It still feels so foreign to be sober and to feel so steady. But I’m really loving that aspect. I dread the idea of losing this clarity. I hope it keeps being a pushing factor for me - and I’ll keep playing the tape ahead to how awfully “out of body” I was while constantly drinking.",22,0

I think it is possible for some, though not easy. What is up with that? I honestly got a little frustrated for a while with the ""You'll seeeee"" tone and avoided this sub (yes, even when strictly sober), because we're all different with different needs and goals and some folks seemed to be as vocal as vegans or keto or exercise junkies or yoga folks or those pushing mental health meds as a cure-all. What about those who got themselves under control and just don't need this sub anymore? We'll never know, because this kind of space tends to self-select for those who currently need to talk. 

I'm not sure what my long-term goals are other than just not drinking today because it would get in the way of my fitness and creative projects at present. It's easier not to consider drinking, and I'm currently counting calories like a mad woman so vanity might be my deciding factor..... Who knows, but regardless of my choices now and in the future, I think there is a certain hubris that should be cautioned against when it comes to being certain of the alcoholic fate of others and we should be supportive of our individual goals.

I've decided to finally gain the courage to post in here. I've been lurking through this subreddit for a while and thought that I'd take the plunge and attempt sobriety. I'm a 31-year-old guy who recently decided to pick up the pieces of his life that alcohol scattered everywhere. I was never a daily drinker. I never drank at home. I am that kind of guy, though, that goes to the bar and one shot instantly turns into an entire late night of drinking. It would lead to fights. It would lead to drama. I lost relationships over it. I found it easy to justify my drinking, though, because I only did it once a week. Well, I'm finally over it.

I hope you all can accept me and hopefully I can meet some fun people to chat with. As a bartender, the majority of my circle of friends can talk about nothing but alcohol. I don't want to go down that path again and depend on alcohol to be the focus of every conversation. I have also found sobriety difficult as a gay man so I was hoping to reach out to anyone who has a similar experience. 

I can't wait to hopefully share some triumphs with you all, as well as pouring my heart out during trials and tribulations.

I’m very privileged to have a counselor helping me through my sobriety journey. I told him yesterday that I honestly feel the best I’ve felt mentally since high school. 

It’s so encouraging to read the posts of people who have made it much further than me, especially the posts that describe certain experiences that sobriety has enhanced. For example, I love coffee. Instead of using it to attempt to shake off a hangover, I get to wake up alert and fully enjoy my coffee. I look forward to my cup of coffee for its own sake. 

I could always drink tomorrow. But today, I feel good. I look forward to looking forward to things, and that’s keeping me going.

I then allow myself to drink for a time and quit again all over again & again & again. Hours...a week ..... some times for a few months but always back to drinking. 

I have been thinking about getting a tattoo of some kind. A reminder so when my mind says “I’ve got you covered. Don’t worry about it and have that drink!”  I’ll have a very clear sign- NO. It is that bad! And don’t take that drink! Another way to help hold myself accountable.

Instead I got rip roaring drunk and slept until 12p and barely struggled through work. I also got a text from the fam that my mom was/is having medical issues and I ignored it so I could work off the drinking from the night before. I’d already blown them off that day because I was a bit under the booze weather then too. I feel like the biggest piece of shit son to ever walk this earth right now. Family is important and my parents aren’t getting any younger and here I am sacrificing time with them for booze. Or only talking/hanging out with them when I have been drinking. I don’t even know how to look at myself in the mirror. I am so upset with myself and ashamed. 

My ex-best friend and boss is having surgery this week and I’m trying to be there and available. I’m in a space to be able to make a difference and hold it all together. It’s adding a fair amount of responsibility onto my shoulders, which I’m fine with, but I have to be present. So what did I go do, got seriously fucked up and wasn’t half the person I could’ve been today. Not to mention the perception she got of me at a friends bday party last night probably didn’t ease her mind. She’s been up and down and around with me personally and professionally in regards to my drinking. So that’s a guilt and shame fest too. Last time I actually came back to help her out when she was having medical stuff and I just boozed my way through that too. 

Not to mention the worry/reality of people’s perception of me as the drinker and partier and the one who always takes it too far. Most of these people have seen me as a hot fucking drunk mess and it’s embarrassing. And I just keep solidifying that persona by my actions. Most of my friends are in my life personally and professionally so that only adds to the equation. 

I can’t help myself let alone others when I’m drinking and hungover. In fact I just hurt all of the above. So here I am, already feeling like a trash human and then just adding more reasons to the list. It’s a self perpetuating self hate and guilt/shame cycle. I give in and give up way too easily and then here we are.

I have to be better, one way or another. My girlfriend is actually three years sober from alcohol, I didn't know her in her drinking days. She's known I drink since the day we met, but she assumed I was responsible about it until it started to come out that I'm so not. 

More and more often I was sounding drunk on the phone but saying I wasn't, pretending like I didn't know what she was talking about when she said she could smell it on my breath. She broke up with me once before because she wouldn't tolerate the lying, and I begged and pleaded for another chance before eventually accepting that she did the right thing for herself by ridding herself of me. She came back on her own, however, after a period of no contact, and I remained stone cold sober everytime we hung out and I loved it. I don't want to drink when I'm with her because I'm actually happy. But everytime I know I'm going to be alone, I binge, as if I'm compensating for lost time.

I called her last night while again under the influence basically just because I missed her and she said she didn't want to talk to me if I'd been drinking. I talked to her earlier today and she said that drinking is just not part of her lifestyle anymore, and she can't have a partner who is drunk regularly, but she doesn't want to control my life if drinking is truly an important part of it, and she certainly doesn't want me ""keeping up appearances"" to remain on her good side if I'm just gonna go on a bender whenever she's not around.

But the thing is, I don't want this to be my life. I've known I have a problem for a long time and I have been on her side of things. My longest streak of sobriety was 13 months, two years ago, and I was in AA while coming home to an ex who would be wasted every night and I hated it. I was the person in the relationship asking my SO not to contact me if they were drunk. Yet, somewhere along the line I started thinking I would be fine to ""drink responsibly"" and here we are.

 I don't necessarily want to change because of her as much I wish that I had remained who I was before I even met her. I was perfect for her when we didn't even know that each other existed but now that we're together I'm a toxic mess. 

I love her to pieces, and I know that I give her everything she wants in a partner when I'm sober, which is why she hasn't been able to leave me for good. Even today she told me she still wouldn't break up with me, but wants me to take the time and space to put myself on the right track and she wants to be there if there comes a time when I'm capable of actually keeping the promises I make.

It's just really slapping me in the face that I've become the person who would do this to someone else when I *know* better. Maybe she will meet someone else who makes her happier or maybe this really will work, but the only certainty is that I have to change.",23,0

I wrote 5 months ago about my relapse. It is still current. Manageable on the edge of unmanageable. I didn't want to do the shitshow again. I have been trying. It doesn't stick. But in my trying, I stumbled upon what I, personally, am trying to escape from.

I like drinking because it allows me to be selfish, it allows me to ignore others. Their wants and their needs. Sober me cannot ignore or walk away from a job expectation or a friend expectation or a family expectation. I am not a perfectionist but I am a people pleaser and I hear a million voices in my head every day. But when I drink I can turn them off.

It is so nice to not give a shit.

Of course, I do in the morning.

This is not as simple as saying 'no'. I have spent a lifetime being available and helpful. Saying 'no' doesn't lead automatically to peace, it leads to people getting pissed off. Y'all know what I am talking about.

It is not an excuse, just an insight. And learning to be sober includes learning to sit with the uncomfortable emotions of letting people down (or at least accepting the narrative that they think I let them down).

Sure there’s that stupid slightly euphoric buzz and you get your goddamn dopamine fix, but more than anything it just makes me lonely, tired, sad, fat and useless. 

Occasionally I’ll find myself saying “your problems aren’t severe at all, they’re barely problems, why are you doing this to yourself?” I know it’s just addictive thinking at its finest, just my brain trying to get back to what has been comfortable for the span of half my life.

And that is the true lunacy of it all, isn’t it? How central alcohol is to almost every culture, almost every form of society in history since its inception. Most people are brought up to believe that getting fucked up on the weekend is just how you’re supposed to relax and unwind. Don’t overthink it, just work hard, play hard, man!

But if society took a different form and I was raised with a complete absence of alcohol-obsessed culture, I would never turn to the bottle for my fun or relaxation, right? I wouldn’t even know what the bottle was.

Which leads me to think that the only reason I crave sometimes is that over a long period of time I’ve taught my brain that this is a reward, this is enjoyable, this is fun, this is relaxing, etc.. And if I can teach my brain that alcohol is all of those things, then I should also be able to teach my brain that something else can be all of those things too. Maybe exercise, maybe meditation, maybe sudoku, I don’t fucking know. 

But the point is it’s just a silly association, it’s just neurons that I’ve trained to fire together. And if it can be learned, then it can be unlearned, and other associations can take its place. Other things can be fun, relaxing, and rewarding as well. So why do I need alcohol? I don’t.

Is that an easy task? Fuck no. But things that are worth doing are rarely easy.

I'm grateful to have found this sub. 

I was sober for a year and a half after going to rehab for an opiate addiction.

When I started a stressful job, I stopped going to meetings and ditched my sponsor. I relapsed with pot and then alcohol. I've drank on and off since the relapse started, more so since I moved in with a few big drinkers/driggers (didn't get to know them enough before moving- whoops!).

I had a heal scare last month that landed me in the ER; It reminded me of how precious health is. I've got health issues as it is- I don't need alcohol draining me any more. 

I stopped drinking almost 1 month ago.

Not drinking today makes me a better student, because these textbooks  aren't going to read themselves, and alcohol sure isn't going to pitch in on the courseload!!

I tend to drink high alcohol content beer. Think 8% abv being low.  And it's largely because I tend to like the taste of imperial beers, etc.

So I go out 3 or 4 nights a week (usually 4) and drink with friends. Usually with my run groups.  And drink say 4 or 5 high abv beers.  Then get home and have 1 or 2 more. At home I usually have cheap beer which is lower abv. 

I rarely drink at home by myself. 

A month or two ago my closer running friends started saying I drink too much. And they're right.

So I already kinda shifted things. I still drink the same amount of liquid but go after lower abv beers half the time. So I intake less actual alcohol.  And I even noticed last time while numb I was alot less numb.  I think one run I even started with a diet coke after. 

But I need to continue doing something about this.  I'd like to go out with running friends. I don't want to quit drinking. It's not my goal.  But I want to to take in less alcohol. And maybe have 1 night that is more like an average night right now.

The first week went well because it was new and I learned that my biggest concern, the withdrawals, was more manageable than I thought. But now any time I’m alone or bored the thought of winding down with a drink comes up, and that voice is harder to ignore now that sobriety is becoming a routine and not a phase.

While I can't be entirely sure this is related to limiting and then stopping my alcohol intake, it sure doesn't hurt. I started limiting my drinking to weekends back in November because I needed to be more clear headed for a new project at work. After a few weeks of that, I noticed the hangovers were much more severe and the act of drinking was more out of habit than anything and not enjoyable. So about five weeks ago, I decided to stop and it has been one of the best decisions of my life. The last few weeks, I have also been waking up early to get in some extra OT, which is obviously great for the wallet, too!


Now, because of this decision, I'm a more present father, a more attentive husband, and my work has been on point which was reiterated today with the good news I've been waiting to hear. Thank you to everyone here giving daily motivation to keep things in check and add one more day to the longest streak of not drinking since I was a teenager.

I have 1.5 years sobriety, and right now I'm having the strongest desire to drink that I've felt in a long time. Most days I have enough clarity and wide-lens view of my life—and how it's improved since quitting—to not even feel the desire to do it anymore.

But a few minutes ago I was fired from a work-from-home part time job that was crucial additional income to afford my rent, which is also related to my parents being able to secure housing (loooong story) (and it was totally my fault for getting fired; I flaked and wasn't available as often as they needed me to be) and my first impulse as soon as I got the news was to buy a bottle of wine and drink it alone in my apartment, like I always used to do whenever I fucked something up. Or just felt like I had. Which was often.

I'm having that extremely anxious, self-hating physical response to the news where my hands are cold and I can't regulate my breathing and I'm a little dizzy and I just want to not be in my own mind/body. I want to drink because I want to feel better and punish myself at the same time. Some of you are probably familiar with this feeling.

but NOT TODAY. Yes, I am partly (mostly?) writing this to talk myself out of it/remind myself how I feel about sobriety most of the time.

I just wanted to share a thought I had the other day regarding recovering from alcohol. I'm 25 years old, drank heavily for about five years, and I've stopped 14 months ago.

Anyways, in the first few months after I stopped drinking I'd go to AA as a form of support. One thing that always confused me was AA goers always tell you that once you're an alcoholic, you're always an alcoholic and it never goes away. And I always had my doubts about that whenever they'd say that. I'd think, surely these people who have been sober for five or ten years or more aren't honestly still addicted. I'd think, once I've stopped drinking for a year or two, I won't feel the urge to drink anymore and it'll all be smooth sailing from there on.

However, now that I've experienced some longer-term sobriety (and I do realize a year isn't a ton in the grand scheme of things), I've come to realize that those urges don't really go away. While it doesn't come close to the pressure to drink that I felt in the first six months or so, I still experience a desire to drink on a regular basis. Like a few times a week at least, often more if I'm having a difficult week. So, I suppose I've realized that those people at AA were right, that the alcoholic tendencies don't totally disappear over time. However, for me, at least, I do feel that they've become much much easier to manage. Nowadays, feeling a desire to drink, for me, isn't a serious consideration, but instead more of an intrusive thought which I can more or less easily swat out of the way and go on with my day. So it did get easier, just not in the way I imagined it would.

Anyways, that's all I had to say. Thanks for listening. I apologize if this post wasn't as cheery as is the norm for this sub.",19,0

It’s my first time here and I’m nervous but I’ve never told anyone this before. I’ve always drank in secret though I’m sure some have suspected.


I started drinking because I’ve always had difficulty in social situations. As a kid and into my college years, I had friends and boyfriends, but I was always very shy and awkward. I would drink in college on weekends, but It’s when I moved away from my friends and family, completely starting over is when the drinking started to become excessive. I found it difficult making new female friends so I focused mostly on dating...But even that was hard. I felt awkward and uncomfortable sober. Give me a few drinks before hand and I’m sure as many of us know, I felt like a different, more engaging person. It started off only before evening dates. Then it escalated to drinking before phone calls and day time activities. I ended up leaving the small beach town I lived in just over a year later because I was hearing rumours about myself from a town 1 hour away. How mortifying. I was sleeping around and generally making an ass of myself on the regular. I up and left almost immediately out of shame and embarrassment. Back to my home country I go, but not back to my hometown. This place was going to be different, I told myself. But after a decade here I can say things are worse than ever. I drink everyday, and the amount I need to feel ‘good’ is beyond what it ever has been or could imagine it getting to. I don’t only drink before social situations now, but mostly alone. My heart races daily at work from withdrawal. Wearing a mask only makes things worse because now on top of my racing heart, something as simple as talking to my patient or walking up to their house can make me completely out of breath. If I drink less one day, I wake up in a pool of sweat and with terrible anxiety. Working from home has also made the situation worse, I know I’m not alone in this. My fiancé pretends he doesn’t know but how can you not? My drinking has caused embarrassment in front of our friends and family. It’s ruined relationships and is on the way to ruining this one. Im overweight and bloated all the time and miserable when I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I don’t even know who I am anymore. Not only physically, but as a person as well. Something needs to change. I will not turn into my father, the man I always said I would never be like.

Almost a decade of my life wasted is more than enough. Today is day 1 for me. I’ve read about the amazing support from this community and hoping this is what I need to finally quit. Thanks for reading... IWNDWYT.",218,1
2462,2021-03-02 14:37:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lwakfv/one_year_of_freedom/,One Year of Freedom,"One of the things that surprises me the most about sobriety is its ability to sneak up on you. In the early days I was refreshing my counter on here every week, meticulously tracking how many days it had been. Now here we are, and just like that, I have gone one whole year without alcohol. That last drink feels like a lifetime ago, but I can remember the taste, the burn, the buzz, as if it was yesterday.  I look back at my first few posts in this group, celebrating a week, then 18 days, then the frustration asking when the cravings will wear off, when I will stop looking at those around me wishing I could drink ""just one"" like they could, trying to rationalize my addiction, trying moderation, rinse, restart, repeat.

They are the words of someone broken. I was so weak, and so aware of my own weakness, that I was desperate to blind myself and quiet my mind to it in any way I could. Sneaking, lying, hurting myself and those around me. I saw their hurt and their quiet judgement and I had no choice but to do it all again.

\*Trigger warning: violence, neglect, horrible parenting\* I'm 25 years old, and the idea of a young female alcoholic was virtually unheard of to me. So, after having my firstborn, I rationalized my pull to alcohol as me blossoming into the much more acceptable ""wine mom"". But I lost control, and I lost it quickly. I dropped my newborn baby because I was coming off of a bender in the summer of 2019. You would think the sterile lights of the hospital and the conversations with social services would be enough of a wake up call. Not for me though-I snuck mouthwash in the bathroom the days after to numb the guilt. I was THAT terrified of looking at myself in the mirror and facing the guilt and consequence of what I had become. My husband couldn't even share the same bed as me. And still, I ran to it. I bought pre paid visa giftcards at the drugstore and stocked up my stash the day after I went back to work from maternity leave. I drank through my anniversary, through the holidays, and couldn't stop the cycle of self destructing. Simply put, it was a cycle of turning my mind off, and chugging. To this day, I cannot believe I didn't kill myself or someone else.

The day I stopped was like any other day. Nothing special happened. There was no ""wake up call"" for me. Instead, I had one can of spiked seltzer left in my stash, and had to hide in the bathroom to chug it while my husband was in the shower getting ready for a low key dinner with friends. We left 30 minutes later than planned, and I was an irritable bitch to him the whole way there because we were pushing my ""buzz time""-I was frustrated because by the time we would get our meal going, my buzz would have worn off and then what was I to do? Run to the bar and sneak a couple of shots? But then he would see it on the credit card..etc. I sat at that dinner and had never felt more low. Despite almost losing my child, my marriage, my job, and a stable relationship with those around me, I hadn't felt any lower than I did in that restaurant. With a puffy face, dry mouth, blood shot eyes, it was like I found myself floating above our table and was hit in the face with the realization of what I was: an addict. I judged my best friend's brother through his entire heroin addiction up until the day it took his life-I always wondered: why didn't he just stop? Clearly this addiction is ruining his life, how is he too blind to see? Yet there I was, unwilling to admit to myself that in my three short years of drinking alcohol, I had formed an unhealthy and toxic relationship with it

I don't know why I kept getting another chance to wake up every day without consequence. I read the stories on here compared to mine and almost find myself wishing it had been something worse to make me stop than sheer complacency and frustration. But I learned to stop wishing for circumstances out of my control long ago. I woke up so ashamed of the person in the mirror every day, I didn't trust her, I didn't like her. Now I am learning how to trust myself again. For everytime I said yes to alcohol, I am making up for that lost time by now saying NO. I am a good mom to my son, and now have another one on the way, I am a faithful wife to my husband, and I'm not cheating on him with the bottle in my closet anymore. Admitting I am an alcoholic is not weakness, it is a sign of a greater strength than I could have imagined. This has, without a doubt, been my strongest year, and I am damn proud of myself. 

A GINORMOUS thank you to this community. For being encouraging and helping me in the times where I felt the most alone. I couldnt have done it without you guys, and I still can't. Looking forward to many more days of flavored seltzers, waters with lemon, and the newfound capacity to appreciate the sunrises and sunsets. I will not drink with you today!",29,0

I initially was pretty apathetic about quitting drinking. It was a major crutch in dealing with my pervasive mental health issues; better to be numb to the world than be in pain was how I justified it. I was drinking a fifth a night of cheap whiskey, commonly skipping dinner so I could black out quicker. I gained over a hundred pounds over a few years. I put myself in massive credit card debt blackout shopping for stuff I didn't need. It was self-destructive in every way. I'd show up for work (high school teacher) still drunk from the night before, and walk out of meetings to puke on the lawn. Thank Odin my principal is a good man and a friend, because he had a lot of reasons to question my employment.

My co-workers were actually the catalyst for me to quit. They got together and told me if I made it 100 days sober, they'd pitch in and buy me a tattoo. I'd tried quitting a few times before, never got too far, but the carrot they were offering me was a pretty good one. So, I reset my counter here, swore it was the last time, and really committed to quitting.

It's been a struggle at times. The mental issues haven't gone away (if anything, they've gotten worse), but I found other ways to deal with them, rather than falling back into drink. I've lost somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 pounds, and have a much easier time sleeping than I used to. I managed to correct my debt and have a great credit score again. No surprises, most every issue in my life began with alcohol, and quitting the sauce was the first step to fixing the rest of it.

The longer I've gone, the more I recognize just how much better life is without being drunk for most of it. I'm committed to keeping this counter ticking up. I see posts here all the time celebrating a year, two years, and more; I can't wait to join y'all in that club.

Cheers, friends. Thank you for all the help you've been through this first hundred. I will not drink with you today!

So I basically stopped drinking all together when covid hit. It’s not that I had a problem before, but I’m essentially allergic to alcohol (Asian flush) and would only drink due to social pressure. When covid hit and no one was going out, it was honestly a relief and I hadn’t had a drink in almost a year, no problem (again, it wasn’t an addiction, I would just drink cause everyone else did and I was self conscious about being “boring”)

This weekend one of my best friends I’ve known my whole life was in town visiting on Friday night, and he’s a big partied. Well one thing led to another and I got good and drunk at dinner with him. Just went full speed ahead. 

The hangover was not terrible on Saturday and the headache etc. was gone by Sunday, but yesterday and today I have just been feeling weirdly anxious! I can’t focus on work and just feel off. 

I’ve decided this is a clear sign to completely stop drinking for good, but my question is is it normal to feel anxious this many days after drinking after such a long break?

My cravings are way down and I wasn’t even tempted to drink when I had dinner with my parents over the weekend, which is typically a 2-3 glasses of wine type event for everyone involved.

So things are fine, but not great, so now I’m thinking about my other major addiction - sugar.  My understanding is that, in terms of brain chemistry, sugar provides a lot of the immediate satisfaction of alcohol, and can cause the same kind of depressive backlash.  I’m hoping that quitting sugar will help me feel even better, perhaps even well enough to become a more energetic and productive person, which is what I was hoping would happen once I stopped drinking, but so far has not.


In the early days of quitting alcohol I let myself indulge in extra sugar with no guilt because my focus was 100% on being alcohol free, but I feel like now I’m ready to look at other changes that I can make to improve my life.

I think (know?) it's time to give up for good. I fucked up this weekend and am a ball of intertwined anxiety and shame.

I have made some positive changes in the last year, though mostly in an attempt to moderate tbf. I no longer drink on weeknights and I now only drink beer (lower percentage). It's mostly worked out, the trouble with only drinking one thing though is that once you've had a few of those that rule goes out the window.

I really truly want to give sober a try. For at least 3 months. The thing I'm really afraid of is that I'm really anxious about socialising sober. Pubs I know I can do, and have a lot of fun with! I did it before. But one of my favourite things to do is to get dressed up and dance. Can I go to clubs sober? Weddings? Festivals? Will I be fun any more? Will everyone think I'm weird? I know a lot of people do 'dry places dry people' (I mightve got that wrong), but at this point in time I don't even wanna try if it means I have to give up truly joyful things in my life. Please tell me I'll learn, be less awkward?

Pluses: I was able to do some cleaning that I’d been meaning to do for a while. I’m going to continue to organize more of the house. I may keep those chores for the afternoon because ,when I do get cravings, it’s usually at the witching hour. There’s nothing like blasting music and finding things to keep me busy to drown out the voice in my head that thinks drinking is the best thing ever. Also, sleeping has been great for me. I’m still dreaming a lot, but they aren’t as vivid and stressful as the first days were.

Downsides: I didn’t enjoy being around my friends this weekend. Everyone I was around was drinking. But at the same time I didn’t want to be stuck at home because drinking alone is my biggest issue. It was easier to tell them I’m not drinking and then to be around them, than to allow myself to be bored and lonely at home alone while my SO was out of town. Somehow I’m still feeling a little icky stomach-wise. I actually think it’s because I’ve been giving into snacking which I don’t usually do. And my caffeine intake has gone up. I think this week I’ll be working on cutting down on giving into my sugar cravings and cutting out caffeine after one cup of coffee. 

I didn’t think too much about alcohol yesterday. And I try not to focus on drinking/not drinking (when I can) by distracting myself with my hobbies. I’ve been writing a lot.

It was always kind of known with my partner that if we got together then there was a shit show to come. We hadn’t hung out in a while due to busy schedules and then we did for the first time in a long time the other day. 

When we got together she was like “yeaaah let’s go!” ,  I said I wasn’t drinking and that I was on day 35 and wanted to keep it going. She responded that she thought I was just doing one dry month. The pressure was there and there was more than one time of telling me “just come on, one sip won’t throw you off... etc”. Multiple times it was like come on and just take a sip or something. I didn’t cave and stuck to my N/A beer as she did her thing. But I don’t want this to be a thing every time we hang out. 

I’ve explained why I feel like drinking isn’t something I should be doing and what not. But I don’t know if she truly gets it. We do have sober fun together too but I feel like it’s more of wanting to drink for the fun instead of that makes sense. 

Any advice uber appreciated!",2,0

Here is a detailed list of what I experienced and tips that helped me get to this point. Enjoy!","# Here is my experience over the past three weeks in hopes that it helps the newcomers, and gives reminders to the old timers:

**Sleep** \- The first couple days I experienced insomnia that kept me up until the sun rose. This is to be expected. I had taken Benadryl one of those nights, and Valerian Root another. It didn't seem to help too much so you might have to tough it out. I found an alternative method which was exercise, forcing myself to get up early, and proper diet. Exercise can be as simple as going for a long walk, no need to pump out an insane workout routine. I would avoid caffeine in general because, not only did it cause anxiety but it will also disrupt your sleep. Since then my sleep has improved. I actually get tired and am able to get myself out of bed at 6am every day. There will still be struggles of falling and staying asleep from time to time but that is okay. Look up *PAWS (Post Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome)* and it will explain the sleep troubles along with other things you may experience.

**Anxiety** \- There was plenty of anxiety, sometimes crippling early on in my sobriety. Like I stated earlier caffeine did more harm than good so if possible avoid it for a week or two. You will start to notice the anxiety subside with each passing day. **TRUST ME IT WILL GET BETTER**. The drinking would relieve anxiety for us, but quitting will cause anxiety without a doubt. Take vitamins, drink water, make sure to rest up, and sleep in as much as you need to (if possible) through the beginning. Chamomile tea helped to put me in a relaxing state. Ambient music such as Marconi Union also helps with relaxation. Look into breathing techniques such as the 4 square breathing method.

**Mood Swing** – Yes, the ever so annoying mood swings. Through the first week (and still today but not as frequent) the mood swings can be heavy. One moment I am jamming in the shower thinking about how great things are, then not so long after I start to feel down and out. Do not fret my friends, it will get better with time. Eating healthy and getting exercise will boost your mood. Try writing down your feelings or logging your day into a journal to get a release from these feelings.

**Lethargy/Soreness** – Oh man this was a **BIG** one for me. I was so so sore the first week or so because my brain was angry with me for taking away its ""*best friend""*. Because I did that, it punished me by making me sore and lazy as hell. If you are sore and lazy don’t not worry about getting many things done and give your body the rest it needs. It will get better with time.

# Here are some tips that helped me get through the first couple weeks:

**Calls/Reach out** – **Please please please**, I cannot stress this enough. Reach out to **anyone** you can. It doesn’t just have to be in moments of weakness. You can even just call to see how someone is doing. If you can find fellow alcoholics that would be **awesome**. Knowing you’re not alone in this struggle is *extremely* helpful. Reaching out to other alcoholics helps us and you maybe even be helping them by letting them help you. We can discuss our problems with alcohol and learn from each other.

**Clean** – One thing that worked for me was cleaning and organizing everything and anything I could. I went on a **frenzy** of cleaning the entire apartment along with going through old boxes of stuff that I had locked away in my apartment storage. Organizing the pantry or your room is another sure-fire way of distracting yourself. It is also a beautiful thing when your place radiates because of the cleanliness.

**Gratitude list** – If you find yourself in a bind and can’t reach anyone make a gratitude list of all the things you are grateful for. Not only will you realize how great sobriety is, you will start to rewire your brain into thinking positively and noticing how great life is!

**Weed/Pot** \- If you think it will help you get through and stop drinking then by all means use it. This is a stop drinking sub. In my personal opinion though use it sparingly and only if you need to. I relied on weed too much in my past attempts and this time I decided to stop completely and I feel **10x** better than when I was using weed as a crutch for myself. It is tough but it will get better, no doubt about it.

&#x200B;

# Where I am now:

Since day 1 I have changed my sleep schedule to the point where I see the sunrise after sleep, instead of sleeping after sleeping after sun rise. I have eat much healthier and consistently go for hikes, walks and bike rides. I managed to get a a handful of job offers and accepted one which I enjoy very much. My mood is better and my outlook on life has changed completely. My relationships with friends and family improved tremendously.  If I can do it, you can do it. **WE GOT THIS!**

**Welp**, this is all I have for now. If you made it this far thank you for reading and I hope that you enjoyed this and found it helpful. **Love you all :)**

Got sent 3 urine tests to do before I go and the first one I did yesterday (Monday, after over 24 hours not drinking) it came back positive. I have to do a 2nd one tomorrow (so 72 hours after the last drink) and if that comes back positive, they won't take me. So I'd have to wait months before going back, as my detox got cancelled this time because I was able to stop by myself over Christmas. 
I was supposed to be going to rehab in Jan, but they told me it wouldn't be til late March/early April, and I've been drinking on and off since then. 
Got told only last week I can go rehab early, but I had been drinking for about a week and couldn't just stop. I'm not supposed to check in until Friday, surely the alcohol would be gone by then? But I've been told if tomorrow is positve, then that's it. I'm so pissed off at myself.",2,0

I think I have to be the best at my job to matter as a human being.

I think I have to be perfectly attractive, I can't have wrinkles on my face or zits. If I just didn't have these things or I dressed better I would be worthy of love.

I'm too weird and people don't like me and no one will want to be in a relationship with me long term.

I don't get it, and I'm crazy. And as soon as people really get to know me they'll see this and leave me.

These are my underlying thoughts. I recognize them as irrational, but I still respond to them emotionally without recognizing that that thought is there.

I feel really good today though! I finally have my energy mostly back and I'm feeling less insecure. Time to work on my psychology more so I'm not trapped in these thoughts.",6,0

No more guilt. No more hiding bottles. No more hiding cash from my wife, so I can but that next bottle without her knowing. No more having to dispose of trash bags full of beer cans and vodka bottles in the neighbors trash so she wouldn't find them. No more worrying about when I can run to the liquor store to replace that dwindling bottle that won't last me through the night. No more searching the house the next moring to try and figure out where I hid the bottle I was drinking from last night because I was too drunk to remember where I put it. Or waking up to a very pissed off wife because I snored all night, keeeping her up just so she can find the half drunk vodka bottle sitting on the dining room table because I forgot to put it away.

Now the bad..

Everyone told me I would feel better once I quit drinking. That hasn't happened yet. I still have to take viagra because Mr. Johnson still won't stand on his own (Doctors said it was because I was drinking too much and it would go away, wrong!) 

Friends have all but disappeared (Coronavirus hasn't helped this either). Once you quit drinking, you're kinda of the odd man out when friends get together and you have the stigma of ""oh he can't drink, he has a problem"".

Planning a vacation has been an issue. The wife and I used to plan our vacations around drinking (She has also quit in support of me) but we used to go to Vegas every year to eat and drink. That is pretty much out the window now. Hell we went to disney land just so we could do the drinking around the world tour at epcot. 

The good defiantly out ways the bad and I wouldn't go back to drinking but it also causes some issues in modern day life. 

But here's to one year sober! Don't have a drink on me!",13,2

Second is that bin collection here is Tuesday morning. Tuesday last week was my first sober day. So for the first time since we moved here in 2015 there have been no alcohol bottles in my recycling. Not sure why that makes me happy but I have always had a thought in the back of my mind that what if the bin man sees my recycling bin content.

In general, the last week has been the best I have had in a long time. I’m eating well, exercising, sleeping through the night and don’t wake up in the morning feeling bad and hungover. I have tried to protect myself as much as possible and blank out dealing with stuff yet. It has started to bubble under the surface and I am actually not worried about dealing with things as they come (looking forward to it so I can move on in life) but for now I am focusing on just being sober day to day. 

The interesting thing has been that I have been able to watch tv and listen to music without being triggered. I was worried at first but it has felt like I have reclaimed back tv and music at least from whisky and I can enjoy the two without being drunk (not that I did enjoy them whilst drunk - just a stupid routine). I’m discovering new music now instead of being stuck in the same old drunken favourites I used to turn to.
