Often times on Friday or Saturday nights I find myself at the bar. Sometimes I have friends with me, but often I am also alone. 

I feel like this is not healthy for my social life or emotional life. I am looking for an outlet of people to talk to when I feel the need to socialize. I am not religious or spiritual, and I am not interested in AA.  Mostly looking for an online community of sober people.",3

My parents and I finally talked. I told them that I had been drinking too much and was stopping because I have a bad relationship with alcohol. They were wonderfully supportive. I believe my mom brought La Croix to Thanksgiving secretly so I would have something else to drink. 

The hard part though was seeing their reaction. I think the first week had been easy for me because I saw this decision as empowering. Alcohol is bad. I don’t need it in my life. I’m giving it up. I could tell they saw it as me needing to give up this good part of life because I had a problem. 

Anyways, it doesn’t matter for now. The effect is the same. I’m not drinking today...

Happy Holidays everyone!",31

I felt confident and relaxed throughout. The best part was leaving having had so much fun and knowing that I would be going home 100% sober. 

You know how sometimes when you buy something on credit and it kind of feels like you’re not really paying for it? Even though eventually yes, you will have to pay? Not drinking tonight felt like getting something on credit with the full knowledge of never having to pay it off. It felt like a gift. Happy to share with you all.

Made the decision to finally stop after an embarrassing, out-of-line night out last week. I was by far the drunkest person in a pretty large group of friends (as per usual). I remember dancing on a table, trying to get other people (who were perfectly happy sitting down) to get up and dance at a bar. You probably know the drill. It's never enough. I won't regret making an ass of myself etc. There's no tomorrow.

But of course there is, and when morning did come, it turned out I had come home and peed on the bedroom floor, in front of my girlfriend and our kids. I remember being on the toilet (in my mind I was at least), but that was evidently not the case. I still have no memory at all from the incident.

I confessed to my girlfriend right there and then (she confronted me about an hour or so later). I have a drinking problem. I can't have two beers. Not at home and especially not on a night out. I'm always looking for something that's not there, it feels like. 

It doesn't stop with nights out either. I've been more and more prone to drinking while working from home and have been delivering some extremely sloppy material for my clients as of late (I run my own business. Don't wanna say more than that). I've been exhausted for a long time now, making it though to be a good father and boyfriend, though I am trying my absolute best. Alcohol has been my only real release.

Anyway. Seven days sober today and I'm really scared. I don't know how to keep telling my future self that I actually have a problem. Part of me knows that alcohol is going to ruin everything for me. Another part says 'Really? *Never* again? Come on... You're not an alcoholic. You're making too big a deal out of this. Why don't you just quit drinking except for on big occasions?'

I don't know guys... I really don't. I feel so embarrassed just writing this post. But just know that reading this subreddit everyday is the biggest help I have right now.",34

I was looking for the Elf on the Shelf and stepped off the step stool wrong. My poor kids, 4 and 6 at the time, were so scared and sad for me because I was hurt. I had always been able to “hide” my addiction and cover it with excuses and games. But not that time. My husband had to take care of all of us and on the day of surgery both kids got the stomach flu...in the truck and all week long. 

I slipped twice since then but nothing major; just an affirmation of the truth. I Am Done With That Shit. My actual last drink was 1/18/19. But tomorrow marks the day I accepted the truth. 

I didn’t realize that this was the first thanksgiving sober. It didn’t even dawn on me. Then I read it in a comment here about someone else and had drinking dreams last night. I woke up thinking I had to reset my badge. I wasn’t devastated...it was odd... I knew I didn’t drink anymore. I’m done. Later that morning I realized it was a dream.

That wouldn't be a bad thing, however their reason was that they did not think they should be drinking around me. 

Normally they would all be drinking wine or beer with dinner, but now when I'm around, everyone is just drinking water or tea.

I've told them countless times that I don't mind if people drink around me, I'm ok being the only one not drinking.

I feel like them actively going out of their way to not drink when I'm around, is calling uneeded attention to the fact that I'm not drinking anymore. 

It feels like they are assuming that if there is anyone consuming alcohol around me, that I'm going to try and drink it.

They never had a problem drinking heavily around me before I quit. And I rarely drank much around my family to begin with, all my drinking I did when I was alone.

They've acted like this before, two years ago, the last time I quit drinking; and when I started drinking again 4 months later, they were all fine with drinking around me again.

Maybe I'm being oversensitive, maybe they're just trying to be supportive, but it's really coming across as them calling more attention to my not drinking than is needed.

It was my second social neighborhood gathering of families that day. We were invited to a cocktail hour at noon, and I was proud of avoiding the cocktails for about 2-3 hours. Then at 4 another neighbor had a thanksgiving dinner. I wasn’t ready to “come out” to my neighbors and friends, who I used to drink with very regularly. I might have also been running low on not-drinking willpower. I accepted the first drink I was offered.

I didn’t feel a buzz. I didn’t feel the compulsion to keep drinking that I usually felt. I was in some good conversations and didn’t say or do anything that I regret. Tbh if there was a seltzer pill I could covertly drop into my drink and remove all alcohol I would have used it last night. I was having a good time and just didn’t want to bother explaining why I wasn’t drinking. After the third drink in 5 hours my family and I walked back home. I didn’t feel drunk or buzzed. 

I woke up this morning and went to the gym. I enjoyed an awesome breakfast, then watched my wife and 7 year old make a puzzle. I feel a touch of a hangover, but overall present and ready for the day. I still don’t want to drink, though. The soft hangover isn’t worth it. I don’t need to experiment with 1 or 2 or 3 drinks to know that 0 is the best number for me. 

I’m hanging out with my neighbors again today. I don’t think I will need to but if anyone asks me why I’m not drinking I will be forthright and say I’m taking a break. It’s not worth feeling less than 100% in the morning. Waking up sober has brought me so much joy these past few weeks, and I want to keep this good thing going.

I don't want to reset my clock...I try to not let my day count be my reason for abstinence though. So, here are the reasons I will not drink this weekend:

I am with family and I will remember the weekend better if I stay sober - I will cherish these memories.

I don't want to be hungover on one of my getaway days -- being poisoned is not my idea of fun or health.

I am almost through week one (again) and I'm hoping the underlying irritability has almost run it's course.

I need to remember why I don't like drinking...unnecessary calories, say things I don't mean, embarrassing myself, numbing my senses, feeling sloppy/dizzy, making myself crave it when it's almost out of my system will not help me.

Nonetheless my day is still tossed into turmoil because of those who did.

One worker flat out said on Monday he was not coming in today because he'd be hungover. 

Another called in to say he'd be late because he was bailing out his cousin who got a DUI.

Still another had a panic attack and left as he came to terms with the fact he cheated on his girlfriend the night before. 

There are times I miss the initial buzz and first taste of a nice beer or shit of tequila. I will not be answering that siren's call today as I watch other ships crash against the rocks. I'm reminded that almost a year ago I myself was heading in that course and am grateful to be in the position I am today.

BUT dealing with all the crap I’m going through with work atm- I can’t even imagine doing that in the grips of regular binge drinking without having some kind of breakdown. And I’m proud of myself.
I know that my last go at this I made it to 9 weeks or perhaps a few days after so next week at 10 weeks is going to be my longest stint of sobriety since I was 12 or 13 so 25 years 😬

2019-11-29 13:07:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e3iax7/medication_for_withdrawal_and_craving_management/,Medication for withdrawal and craving management,"Does anyone have experience using medication for withdrawal, cravings, and otherwise smoothing some of the rough edges of recovery?

I've been through one round of sobriety before, which was temporary by design (90 days). I did all the lifestyle changes. On the med side, I used accamprosate, gabapentin, and topiramate to help myself get through it, but it was still brutal. I'm not sure if any of them really helped. Towards the end of my 90 days I was eating a pint of ice cream every day just to get a dopamine hit.

This round I'm looking at:

**Immediate withdrawal: Librium (or other benzo) vs carbamazepine**

I've taken benzos very infrequently in the past without any addiction or rebound issues, but I'm still very wary of this class of drugs. I'm looking at carbamazepine as an alternative. Does anyone have experience with either of these?

**Maintenance: topiramate vs zonisamide**

I've used topiramate in the past and the cognitive side effects were an issue. Has anyone used zonisamide? I hear it has a lower side effect profile in this regard, but can still cause issues with working memory.

**The rest of it**

I'll also probably use high-dose gabapentin since I seem to tolerate it well. 

I'm not interested in Antabuse. Naltrexone gives me weird fatigue. Baclofen sounds like it would give me even more weird fatigue.

Is there anything else I should look at? There's a lot of pseudo-science out there about vitamins, aminos, and supplements, has anyone nailed those down?",2

Chris Hadfield speak once and how he described returning to earth somewhat parallels my experience with early sobriety.

While up in space, the astronauts were having a grand ole’ time and then they had to return home. The descent was rough and the landing of the Soyuz capsule felt like a car accident. Hadfield talked about how difficult it was to move/function once gravity was re-introduced on the body – he detailed how the astronauts, these big, strong, fit, capable men, were like shivering kittens upon landing and had to be pulled out the capsule. They had to sit in folding chairs, covered with blankets, and drank tea as they very slowly got their earth legs back. There’s a famous picture of one such moment: [http://asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/search/images/watch.asp?id=2540](http://asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/search/images/watch.asp?id=2540) It took time, but eventually strength returned through exercise, and the astronauts were again, strong, fit capable men.

My first 30 days sober were rough – I was that shivering kitten. This forum helped pull me along in the early days. I worried tremendously about the upcoming weekend nights, boozy corporate events, family gatherings, beers in the parking lot after ball games, you name it. Slowly, I worried less and less. I had reasons/excuses lined up to give people explaining why I wasn’t drinking. Now, it’s just a nonchalant, I don’t drink. If tea is a good enough celebratory drink for returning astronauts, then it’s certainly good enough for me.  Big thanks to all of you who have encouraged me so far.",12

That's what you feel if you drink - tired. Tired and lazy, all day every day. I have been drinking not heavily but consistently and daily for the past 5-ish years, 1-2 drinks on a normal day, countless if it was a party. About a year ago I started feeling changes in my body - skin doesn't look so good anymore, it's much harder to work out or run (more like make yourself do that). 

Now, I want to stop and I need to stop. I have a kind and loving person for a husband, couldn't ask for a better one. We are planning on having kids soon and I want to make sure they are born to a sober mom and raised by sober parents. I don't want to be a mom whose only highlight of the day is the ~~glass~~ bottle of Pinot Gris after kids are tucked into bed.

I may be delirious, but I don't think I have a strong physical dependency on alcohol - I can go weeks without drinking, I don't crave it, it's more of a habit. I've read the Naked Mind as well as another book (don't remember the name) and it spoke to me. I don't like the taste of liquor in any shape or form. I don't like taking shots. I don't like being useless after work, slacking on self-development, waking up with a buzzing head. But ""one for the team"" wouldn't hurt right? I also don't go on a binge after taking a break as I lay my hands on the first ""doze"".

But. There is always a but. I shouldn't be drinking. It stops me from getting closer to the goals in life, it makes me look older than I am. Yes, it hasn't ruined any relationships. Yes, I haven't gotten a DUI. Yes, I don't have health issues from drinking. None of the ""Yeses"" should matter. I must stop drinking for my sake and my family's.

I danced for 2 hours straight, met a lot of new people and just had a great night overall. It started at 8 so I headed home right past 12. I had the 'opportunity' to drink some more self brewed beers with some people back stage but I declined and went home!  

But here's the thing, I'm 18F and I identify as an alcoholic. I've delt with several drug addictions in the past so I know I'm prone to addiction. But after this night I just miss the old whole going out shabang! I have had miserable nights out in the past aswell so I'm aware of how quickly things can turn sideways. 

I'm still so young and I don't know anybody my age who already decided to get sober. Most people my age are just getting into drinking/drugs, but I've already been through all that. When I don't go out I isolate myself. I deal with depression/ptsd and find it really hard to meet up with new people sober or even people who I'm already acquainted with. Last night was such a 'freeing' experience from my isolation and mental problems, that I don't want to go back to being completely sober. 

I want to learn to drink with moderation and to only drink when something special is going on! I want to set strict rules for myself. Only drink once every two weeks, never have more than 4 drinks, always drink water, wait between drinks and to take care of myself properly when I have drunk.  Is this a reachable goal for someone who identifies as an alcoholic? Or is it just a slippery slope back into addiction? Sometimes I just have to get out of my head, you know!",2

I guess, I need to be honest and say that even though the amounts I drank were small (1-2 glasses) I drank regularly which was worrisome.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I am happy to report had my first sober Thanksgiving since I was 16 years old (31 now). It was wonderful. My loving, adult-self captained my ship. I let things rest where they needed to rest, stayed present and was grateful. I knew I once had this person inside of me, and I was afraid I almost let her die. She's still here. :)

If you've ever considered hosting the Daily Check-In, please raise your hand! The only requirement is 30 days of continuous sobriety. Please say so in the comment section and the mods will add your name to the list! Santa's List. The ""Nice"" List.

I've been working towards sobriety for almost 2 months. I went to a wedding in the first weekend of October, stayed in a hotel all weekend with the wedding party, party bus, open bar, post reception bar stops.. all a recipe for disaster that I dove right into. As is my normal fashion. After a weekend of blacking out, waking up with horrendous anxiety and derealization, starting drinking early to make that go away, and not actually enjoying the wedding of my good friends but rather enjoying the free booze.. I decided I wanted to get sober. 

Around that time, I luckily stumbled upon this page. I found recommendations for This Naked Mind and am about halfway through that. I've talked with family, my boyfriend, and friends about my decision. I stayed completely sober until Halloween. ""1 night out won't hurt, I already bought a costume and committed to going to a party."" I blacked out the majority of the night and had to be walked by 2 friends out of downtown and into the car. Since then, I've drank here and there, maybe one or two nights a week. Those instances being heavy alcohol use. One of those times resulting in finding coverage for my work shift and laying in bed miserably hungover all day instead of getting a proper paycheck. It's time to stop trying to cut back and start cutting out.

I am 27 and I have 2 DWIs from my very early 20s. That should have been enough to quit, but ""it's the drinking AND driving that's the problem... not the drinking"". I have a severe anxiety disorder that seems managed when drunk, but is wildly out of control when hungover. I've had attendance write ups at past and current jobs due to call-outs as a result of being hungover. My finances are drained due to alcohol, Ubers, garbage food when hungover, and unnecessary ER trips when hangovers trigger panic attacks. Once I start drinking, all of my true hobbies hop off the train and getting drunk is the destination. 

This is getting long. You get the point.  This is not an unfamiliar story. 

This is mostly a post that I'd like to look back on (sober) in the future and be proud of. Proud that I am hopeful of recovery and sobriety. Proud that I'm acknowledging my anxiety most likely stems from my alcohol use. Proud that although I'm not happy with my past decisions as a result of my drinking, I'm still not ashamed of myself. Proud that I'm finally admitting that I have a terrible relationship with alcohol.

What I've learned so far, that's taken me years to figure out.","Despite my relatively short time on the clock I've been absorbing sobriety materials for years now. This advice isn't for everyone but it might apply to you if you're a binge drinker.

First, if you're hung over, I've been there. So, so many times. The depression you feel is chemical. If you upset someone, embarrassed yourself, people will forget about that. But so will you. The anguish will pass. It won't get worse. You're sick. It's a sick day for you. Being a binge drinker is an illness. Treat yourself with compassion.

Deep down you know drinking ends up this way. Powerful chemical and psychological forces bring you back to it. 

If you're a habitual binge drinker, there is basically zero chance you'll become a normal drinker. Someone that has two and is just too sleepy after that. If you're thinking ""just have two?"" Bingo. You and I don't want two drinks. We'd rather have zero. So give up on this lunacy. You want permission to binge drink.

Calling yourself an alcoholic... Kind of pointless. Don't give yourself a title to live up to. You have a drinking problem, to be solved. Any fear or anxiety you have over this label has to do with the fear of never drinking again. If you have this fear, you have work to do. You'll eventually drink again until you no longer want to.

That's right, when sobriety is not natural for you, or it takes willpower, it is doomed to fail. When you see alcohol as having no benefit to you at all, that's when you're free.

Your subconscious is infinitely more powerful than your conscious. Deep down you must visualize a life without alcohol. What does it look like? Do you have any happy successful friends that don't drink? What must their thought process be like? How do they attend parties? Relax? Have fun?

Break the subconscious love affair with booze. It's not enough for the conscious brain to know it's bad. You have to feel indifference to it. If you feel its pull, if you consciously have to make yourself avoid it, you have work to do.

Alcohol is a powerful drug and that's not your fault. But you have to work to get sober. Stop playing games with yourself. Stop playing moderation Russian roulette. You don't have to join AA and live life in the shadow of it. You have to learn how to live, period. Want to thrive, and then thrive.

If you can't envision that life, that is precisely where to start.",62

However, I knew today of all days would be tough. My relationship with my family is a huge trigger (my father especially) and usually at family functions I'd show up 3 drinks in or more, and proceed to drink as much as I could upon arriving. 
However, today I showed up sober, I stayed sober until right before dinner and then resorted to one drink after being seated next to my father. And drank it incredibly slowly, a few sips in I realized I didn't even want it. It felt more like a security blanket I just wanted to have around, rather then a necessity. 
So even though I technically lost today, I still feel immensely proud. Seeing my cousins face when I said no to multiple drinks is a feeling that will stay with me. 
I'm confident that I will make it to six days and beyond after this.

I'm worried my relationships are going to negatively change in my sobriety. I need to say ""no"" more but I need to figure out why I feel so guilty when I do it. I had to tell a friend I could not dog sit for her last minute because her dog snapped at my husband the last time he was here and we have a baby now. And I feel guilty being truthful about it. (I should have addressed it months ago when it happened instead of waiting until shr needed to make plans to mention it.) My husband and I have been bickering a lot lately and it hasnt improved since I stopped drinking. It's too early on and he's still tense about my previous use (and with good reason.)

I think I drank to stifle negativity. Meaning instead of honestly dealing with problems, I suppressed a lot of things and slapped on a smile thanks to alcohol. I'm finally realizing this has been destroying my mental health. I am hoping that in sobriety I address problems in a more straight forward way instead of people pleasing myself to death. Hopefully my stress will decrease if I live more honestly. Trying to be patient but this is a long process. Thanks for reading my rambling, I needed to vent and I'm feeling lonely right now.

Last night I commented that drinking has seemed appealing more often lately. I have accepted now that my increased workload is bringing up issues with seeking comfort and escape and that I need to address this head on, especially as it relates to my sobriety.

I am not looking to drink; my temptations have not been that strong yet. But I want to address the feelings underneath that desire and find healthy ways to cope with my work stress, since it is only going to get worse, and may last into next spring. It’s okay that I’m stressed; I really need to grasp that concept. I think a big issue is that some part of me doesn’t believe it is okay. That I am weak for feeling stressed out.

So, I am sticking with my commitment to post nightly, even if sometimes it is just to say hi and things are well or uneventful.

That is what I normally would have rationalized doing. I don't know why I would chose a solo Thanksgiving as the moment to try again.  The only thing I can think is that I just can't justify it.  The intensity of the cravings has brought me to tears a couple of times.  Then they went away and I moved on until I was hit with the next wave of ""cravings"".  I say ""cravings"" cause it doesn't fell like a strong enough word.  One time I was about to cave so I got in the bath and read until it eased up.  It has been pretty painful.  I live in a city alone with no friends or family and am off work for 2 more days.  I hope that the victory of making it through a solo Thanksgiving with so few days will help me these next couple of days.

Some childish part of me hoped that hitting a milestone like this would bring some long-term certainty and clarity which has yet to set in.  So day by day it is and will continue to be.

Physically, I feel better than I have in a long time.  Today’s morning weigh in came in at 179.8 lbs, which is territory I have wanted to get to for a while now.  

Mentally, I’ve been continuing to have brain fog, memory lapses and flare ups of irrational anger, but they have been less frequent than they were in the first two weeks.

My thinking sober has been somewhat different and I have been able to maintain more of an open and even perspective about other people and a lot of things.  

One song I’ve been going back to a lot lately is this one: https://youtu.be/lqURPBtGJzg.  I have liked this one for a while, but now that I have been sober for a month, I hear a lot of my relationship with alcohol in the lyrics.  Maybe it will sound familiar to some of you as well.

I've drunk a lot more in the past than I have done recently but I just feel like enough is enough.  I binge drink at the weekends and spend most of the working week recovering only for it all to start again. I've been binge drinking since I was 14 and I'm not 35. I love it and I hate it.

A couple of weekends past I had friends visiting from out of town. We went on an all day drinking session from 1pm to 3am.  The standard, awful, waste-of-a-life hangover ensued the next day followed by sleepless nights, anxiety and generally feeling like a total POS for pretty much the whole week afterwards.

I have no idea what made that hangover the one that has pushed me to assess my drinking more closely but here I am.

12 days sober and with some serious challenges coming up. I've made it to a month in the past (dry January usually) but always slip straight back into comfortable old habits.

I have very recently started a new job. It's a very serious gig with excellent career prospects and I'm not really sure how I swung it.  However, a lot of fitting in to my new team seems to revolve around going out (and drinking to excess into the early hours). I have two christmas parties coming up. Both with open bars. I committed to going to both before I made this decision to go sober so it would be difficult to pull out now.

Then we have christmas itself. I'm going away with the same old friends (heavy drinking friends). Again organised before I went sober so that will be interesting.

I'm going to take each day as they come and do my very best to stay off the booze but it's so engrained into who I am and how I live my life I just dont know if it's going to stick on the long run.

Just typing this out makes me want to get smashed.",2

Using this throw away account to vent. Thanks to anyone who will read it. It's been 86 days since I finally but down the bottle. I've had a drinking problem for a very long time -- I was a binge drinker who had the tendency to black out often. I didn't need alcohol every day to operate, but it admittedly was a big part of my socializing life and was used for both celebrating the highs and coping with the lows. I can't pinpoint what that exact turning point was but I just decided I wanted to one day take 'a break' from drinking. Then I extended it another week. And on and on. And here we are now at 86 days. My resolve is pretty strong and it's been tested.  

I recently got engaged to my girlfriend after being together for a few years. On the day when we celebrated the evening of our engagement she had a glass of champagne and I had an apple cider. I felt like having a drink ... just one ... to help celebrate that moment but I stuck to my guns. She's been very supportive and proud; I'm very lucky to have her.  

Last night my dad gave me a call and let me know that the lung cancer which we hoped had been destroyed by radiation treatment has come back. And based on his resigned tone it doesn't look good. I gave him words of encouragement that it's not the end and that he'll overcome this ... but I cried after we got off the phone. I knew that a drink wouldn't help me as of that point but I did think of the taste of comforting whiskey like I did the first time he told me of the initial diagnosis. But I'm glad that I'm that far in my soberness that I can acknowledge that alcohol just numbs pain and it doesn't actively and bravely confront it. So, I'm absorbing this pain, acknowledging it, and accepting it. But I still wish there was something to help give me a little bit more comfort right now. But I know it's not alcohol. 

Anyway, I really just needed to get this off my chest. It's something I haven't had an opportunity to tell my friends/fiancee since they aren't dealing with the same issues with alcohol. I wish you all the best in your journey to soberness. We are all fighting a fight everyday. Take it one day at a time and remember to be kind.",12

This will be my first sober thanksgiving in a long time, and like most stereotypical Russian families, vodka is essentially water. Ive been scared of this day for the last few weeks. Drinking games for the Macy’s day parade, the dog show, and every movie watched afterwards. Lots of toasts, new fall cocktails to try, and a seemingly bottomless supply of alcohol. My family now knows I am sober, so my mom went out of her way to get me a few bottles of sparkling cider. I was more touched by that gesture than I expected. I told them in advance that I don’t want them all to feel like they can’t drink around me, because I still want them to relax and have a good day as well. But it is a good feeling knowing that they still have my back and want me to succeed.

Well, that dragon has been defeated for now. Again. But my failure makes me feel ashamed. I won't let myself to come up with this ""well maybe just one is fine"" excuse anymore. I'm not ready for casual drinking, even though I wish I was. 

Is it allowed to exchange discords or something with people in this sub?

This isn't an 'if I can do it then anybody can' message, because I won't claim to have had it any worse or any better than any of you. This is more to say, if you feel like you're stood at the bottom of the mountain looking up and thinking 'I can never do it' (be that tapering your intake or quitting completely), you're not the only one who's been there. This group has certainly shown me that. There are countless people here who have stood in that exact same spot, and here there are no end kind-hearted people to play the Sherpa on the trip upwards, sharing their experiences and offering their support.

I was utterly convinced that I would never be able to take control, and yet there have been other times when I thought it would be a walk in the park 'so I'll do it tomorrow' or 'I'll just have one or two after work, no problem'. There have been times when I've felt ashamed of my reliance and guilty for my actions, times when I've laid the blame anywhere but at my own feet, and plenty of times when I have simply not wanted to face facts and accept some hard truths.

Here I am now, only 25 days sober, but that's the longest I've been sober in over half my life my quite some margin, and at the beginning I thought I wouldn't be able to go a single day without a drink. Then I did a day. Then two days. Then a week. Then two... So far I've surprised myself beyond belief.

So if you're feeling daunted by the task, look to your peers here. The concept of sharing a problem or looking to a support community for assistance was completely alien to me as recent as a month ago, but this group has given me a support I didn't know existed and that's helped me enormously thus far.

Nobody will claim to have all the answers, but all will have your back.

Always a different assortment of alcohol in the house. My family knows I’m sober and knows I can never drink again. But being around them makes it not a fun thanksgiving as they are all drinking. A few of them quite heavily. I’ve made so much progress the last 10 months being sober but the stress of cleaning and cooking leads to fighting and bickering and the cravings come back. I’m fine now as I’m drinking coffe about to start cooking but I’m not really looking forward to the dinner. Just needed to vent.,17

Edit:  Thank you all for the kind words.  I am taking a break for dinner before heading back out and wanted to say to all of you thanks!  I have had some great conversations and definitely helped at least two folks that had no business being on the road.

I have destroyed many relationships due to my drinking. 

I messed up really bad with my recent gf by getting wasted at home in my bedroom all by myself on a nightly basis and, at times, reaching out to other people in a manner I shouldn’t have been (If that’s not obvious enough...sexting other females). I broke her heart and destroyed her trust in me. Our relationship was pretty amazing up until that point. At that point, I stopped drinking and started attending AA and talking to a sponsor and tried to do everything in my power to make amends to her and fix what I had done. During the 6 weeks of being sober, the events kept getting brought up again and again (she was hurt and angry so she had the right). On Nov. 7 I broke. And I broke hard. I didn’t want to be here anymore and was pretty determined not to be. I literally wanted to die and felt everyone would be better off due to the destruction I had left behind me throughout the years of hurting people.
I spent the next two days in a vodka, whiskey, beer downward spiral. My therapist said oddly enough that me getting so wasted probably safes my life. Meaning I couldn’t function enough to actually kill myself.
During this little episode, I lost my job, my gf and worst of all, visitation with my kids for a couple of weekends. And I definitely lost my mind.

I’ve heard nothing from the now ex gf since the night of Nov. 7. Not a single message asking if I was ok. But I have heard from others she has basically been trying to kick me while I’m down by telling all kind of false truths about me. Why? I have no clue. We had a pretty great relationship until I messed up.

Either way, I had one more night of booze after that and then started going to meetings again and this time actually working with my sponsor. Working through the big book and started working through the first couple of steps. Today is day 9 and while I’m still pretty f’d in the head about the relationship, I’ve not drank and I’m putting in the work I need to in order to be the person I know I can be and truly am.

By no means is this a declaration of “I’m healed!” but it is a statement of “I’m healing!”",2

I tried to keep it quiet because I hate attention focused on me.  I only told my best friend and my wife.  

Well, last night my best friend's wife called me.  She had heard I quit and she confided that she was also quitting.  I was shocked because she's always been totally ""together"" and I've never seen her even tipsy (I thought).  Apparently, she's been secretly drinking in the afternoons and evenings while taking care of their toddler.  So now we're being each-other's accountability.  We decided to text every day reporting on our sobriety.  My wife is obviously very supportive, but she's never struggled with alcohol.  She's one of these ""psychos"" that can just drink a couple glasses of wine twice a year.  Lol!

I would say to just let the word out if you're going sober.  You might never know who else can be struggling and willing to join the journey.",19

I've got 6 days today!

For the past 5 or so months I have been doing the same pattern, 2-3 days sober, then I go out from 2 to 5 days.  It was a horrible pattern.  I could never escape the horrors.  I lost my third job during this period due to drinking.  I am searching for a job now and have two prospects currently so hopefully I get out of this and stay straight.

My main issue is that I don't drink because I feel bad.  For some reason feeling bad helps in staying sober because the self loathing helps in me not follow my impulses because I feel like I deserve to suffer.  Day three is the worst for me.  I start to feel good, both physically and emotionally and then having a drink doesn't seem so bad.  I got through it this time and I hope I keep it up.  I need to stay straight to interview.  The my prospects make the interviews very hard but nothing I can't handle if I'm clear headed and calm.

He quit smoking but ending up drinking a lot to compensate. This eventually led to multiple DUIs, alcohol monitoring bracelets, the whole 9 yards.

My point is not that smoking weed is better than drinking (though it probably is), my point is there is always a danger of switching one vice for another. In recovery lingo there is a common phrase for this: Switching seats on the titanic.

We addicts always want more. One drink is never enough and there is no such thing as too many. We are extreme creatures. We try to fill that void with something: Drugs, sex, food, work, etc. 

Quiting drinking is an amazing step, but it is not enough.  We need to ensure that we are not hurting ourselves in other ways.

At the time, when I originally made my account to post on here, I don’t know what I thought it would do for me, I don’t even think I REALLY wanted to quit drinking altogether. And that’s why I would always go back to drinking and hating myself again.

A LOT has happened since the last time I’ve been on this reddit page, both good and bad (mostly bad), but now I am back on here again to talk about something that happened last night.

Currently I am 16 days sober (17 is the longest I’ve ever went), and honestly I feel great, physically but especially mentally. The idea of quitting drinking FOREVER always sounded daunting to me, but now it seems like an actual possibility, one that I want to achieve. I know we’re supposed to take it ODAAT, and I do, but I also look forward to my future, and when I imagine my future, I like to imagine living it sober. 

With that being said, last night I was in a weird spot. Not that I was tempted to drink or anything but just something had happened that seemed so odd to me. 

My ex who isn’t really my ex, hit me up (she was intoxicated). She kept telling me she missed me, and saying all these things that I knew were just her drunkenness talking. She even called me, and this little voice in the back of my head kept telling me that I should feed into it, I should succumb, and run back to her. But what was crazy... is that I didn’t. I didn’t listen to the voice, I told her the harsh truth about us, how what we had was in the past, and we both needed to move one. It wasn’t easy though, every text I sent I probably looked over a million times before actually hitting the “send” button. But what was really shocking to me, was the fact that I WAS her not too long ago. I WAS the one getting fucked up and sending those “I miss you” text, and I WAS the one getting rejected. It all came around full circle.

Me & her both know a lot about one another, and we both struggled mentally, I think that was why things didn’t work out between us. But it is hard to forget & leave behind that kind of emotional intimacy, cause you think you will never find it again. However getting sober allowed me to see through the bullshit clearly. I’m only 16 days sober, but I’m working the steps to stay this way. & today, just for today i will not drink with you all.

To get to this point, I started to go to meetings, got a sponser, and worked the steps. I began to change. I continued to go to therapy, and worked through a ton of issues that kept me sick.

I do it for the quick dopamine rush that helps me forget about my panic disorder.... then it completely crushes me the next day.

I decided to stop drinking a few weeks ago. Since absorbing a lot of new information here, on blogs, podcasts, books etc., I feel a lot happier about my perception of alcohol and how I'm going to navigate my new sober life going forward. 

What I'm struggling with more are my memories of all the stupid, embarrassing and sometimes dangerous things I did while I was under the influence. I still cringe when I think of them. I don't know where to draw the line on my accountability under the fog of alcohol. I want to move on from feeling shameful and guilty, but I also don't want to absolve myself completely. 

Can anyone offer some advice on how I can learn to forgive myself? 

Thanks :)",17

&#x200B;

I can't safely have one drink. I have one drop pass my lips and the floodgates open. I never get sick anymore, and I blackout every time I drink. So I never throw up and I am a functioning blackout, where people don't know I'm blacked out. 

&#x200B;

I had a drink yesterday, which turned into four heavy IPA's. Never listening, only hearing. Never talking, only demanding. Never rewarding, only drowning. I made a fool out of myself for the millionth time, my heart and wallet sag together. I'm afraid for my safety if I drink because I become such a blowhard, stubborn, maniac. A crazy person who will literally stop at nothing to get what he wants. I had a moment where I felt like I was disembodied and watching myself thinking, ""WTF, what a fool, this has hurt him so many times and never helped. No caretaker would recommend this lifestyle to somebody in their care,"" instead of pretending I'm living the Mad Men tv show. Here's to no beers today, thanks for being here.",10

I got mixed up in the wrong crowd while I was young, thought it was normal, and, I'm ashamed to say this, but even cool to drink and do drugs regularly. I was stuck in that mindset for a long time. I ruined a lot of amazing opportunities for myself, I hurt people and I blamed others for my own problems. Everybody was fucked. Not me. I think I kind of noped out of life. I wasn't expecting to achieve anything, be anybody, or even live past 21. So why should I try? I was here, but I was merely existing. Repeating the same habits over and over again. Wondering why things weren't changing. 

Fast forward to now. 

I've been sober for 4 months. It's the longest time being sober, since I started drinking 11 years ago. The turning point was getting black out drunk at my best friends wedding. I was a bridesmaid, it was a beautiful day; but when I woke up the next morning, I had flashbacks of crying, being inconsolable. My partner had bathed me, taken my makeup off, put my pyjamas on, and put me to bed. The next day he said it looked like a switch had flipped in my head. One minute I was happy and laughing, the next I was saying I hate myself, that I don't know how he could be with me etc. I was so fucking embarrassed and so done with doing this shit. 

A crazy thing about getting sober is that I actually have no fucking idea who I am. My previous hobbies were partying, day drinking, or recovering from drinking by smoking weed and watching Netflix. I mean, there are so many fucking hours in the day. It's overwhelming. What am I supposed to do for 16 hours a day? I'm finally realising how much drinking made up my personality. I am really pissed at myself, you guys. 

I guess I'm posting this to try and get some ideas from other people who have stopped drinking. What kept you going? What helped keep you busy? I'll be honest, I have been napping a lot to get rid of some hours in the day, and I know that's not helpful. I've also started meditating, taking my dog on regular walks, and spending more time with family. But that only takes up so many hours. I'm finally present for the first time in what feels like forever - and it's super uncomfortable

Hoping to hear from some people who have felt the same.

Thank you.

EDIT: I am overwhelmed by how many responses are coming through. Thank you all for your kind words and support! I wrote this on a bad day, I'm actually doing pretty okay. I'm realising that I like science, how things work, why things are the way they are etc. I'm thinking of maybe applying for a diploma of science in the new year, but I'll see how things go. Patience has been an occurring theme in the responses, and I think I should get back to basics before throwing myself into studying.

Also, some people are under the impression that I'm unemployed. I work. Full time. 8 to 4. My work is great, hence why it wasn't mentioned. My main issue is what I do with my time after work and the weekends. But I appreciate the concern.",862

I ended things with my boyfriend of almost two years because I felt the need to put distance between myself and my dependency on alcohol, sex, and love.

I've cried my eyes out the last two nights because I have effectively isolated myself completely now and broken something precious beyond all repair.

He said not to leave him and that he'd help, he'd get sober too, but I said I couldn't go down this road with him and hold both him and myself accountable. That the moment I slipped up I'd be ashamed to tell him, or worse, he'd want to even the score somehow and my actions would affect his sobriety.

My CS was in a shorty glass like hers and I never saw the bartender make it drink, but I did hear my friend say “and a club soda.”  I didn’t taste any vodka and I would definitely know if there was gin (one wiff would make me nauseous). 

Maybe I was tired and dehydrated from work, maybe it was the two cups of coffee I had at dinner, which in the past has had a loopy affect on me at night. Maybe I am getting a cold?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

 

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

 

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

 

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

 

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

 

\---

 

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

 

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

 

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

 

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I hope you're all doing well right now.

I am trying to stop drinking, like completely stop drinking. A day at a time; I can't think of the long-term future rn. My issue was/is more so that I drink alone - just straight vodka/rum/gin - and get absolutely f\*cked by myself. I've declined multiple social gatherings that would involve drinking because I'd rather just get wasted in my room and dance and forget all my worries (that never works, ofc, and mostly just leads to more worries), however since I've been attempting to stop that, I've found it really difficult to see friends where I know I'll have the opportunity to drink. I am terrified of falling into a trap of, 'well, you're not drinking alone at least, it's totally normal to have a few drinks when you're out with friends.'

I met up with my ex on Tuesday (we're still in touch and it was just as FriEnDs, not a drunk decision). Anyway, we did a pub quiz (I know it's silly to even go to a pub, but man, I love pub quizzes) and I ordered 3 double rum and cokes over a few hours and while it was still a great evening and I didn't get drunk drunk, just ""tipsy"", I've spent all of today feeling really disappointed in myself and confused. 

My ex isn't a big drinker and he drank a diet coke throughout the evening, so it wasn't even a matter of feeling pressured. I don't know, this entire post probably doesn't even make any sense because I'm not even entirely sure what I want to ask. I just feel so inspired by you all and when I read posts on here, I feel motivated, but I also feel myself mentally shifting to: as long as you don't drink alone, it's okay, you're okay, as long as you keep it to two/three drinks, you're FINE, but I want to just completely stop. At the moment, I feel like I need to be at least a bit buzzed to have a good time and I hate it, because up until maybe the age of 22 (I'm 25 now), I rarely ever drank and would constantly be asked, 'yo, are you drunk/high?', because I was so upbeat and had such a high level of energy, and now I feel like unless I drink, I just can't enjoy myself.

OKAY, I'll stop rambling now and just ask my question: can anyone relate even a little bit and (especially to those who are in the early stages of sobriety and have found it makes them more upbeat for a hot minute) how do you all continue to see friends and stuff without feeling you need to drink?

TL:DR - Probably wise, it's a wall of trash text.

Am struggling to feel on top of life right now. I don’t want to drink but I have been getting twinges of desire every few days, usually when watching TV and seeing someone drink. I took Friday and Monday off and am not sure what I will do with my weekend. I’m wondering if I should do some focused work on my mental state. I really don’t want to backslide.

It’s times like this that I start to slip into negative thinking. Why do I have to let things fall apart when I get busy? Why can’t I just stay on top of things? Why do other people seem to handle stress so much better than me?? I know that’s not necessarily true, but it feels like it. I just feel like a failure... like I’m on a stationary bike, peddling my ass off but getting nowhere. It’s exhausting.

I've been known to make people uncomfortable with my openness before though. Should I be more careful about telling people that are asking why I'm not drinking? What am I not considering that others seem to be so concerned about? I feel like I'm setting a good example by showing others that you don't have to feel ashamed about not partaking.

Not drinking is very much normal to ne now. I've got the hang of day to day life without alcohol and I'm in such a better place in all aspects of my life:

*Always present for my child. 

*Getting to know myself properly as a person rather than just getting through. 

*Mindfully grieving for my father. 

*Appreciating my SO. Not blaming them for my unhappiness. Our relationship has shifted into a much better place. 

*Maintaining my weight without unhealthy eating habits or excessive exercise. 

*Taking pleasure in evening hobbies when I feel like it
*Getting on an even keel at work and having the mental energy to spark interesting projects. 

I don't expect it to always be plain sailing and my first Christmas and birthday are probably going to be a test in some ways. But I've got this! 

I seriously could not contemplate an existence without alcohol in mid-May.  

Reading This Naked Mind and immersing myself with you guys here in this sub is what has given me the strength, honesty and perspective to start a new chapter in my life.

2019-11-27 18:06:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e2okds/how_ive_stayed_sober_through_two_years_of/,How I've stayed sober through two years of Thanksgivings...,"It’s the most wonderful time of the year. I mean, not really. 

Depression spikes over the holidays because of three key factors:  

1. An increase of demands that are perceived as stressful 
2. Family issues
3. The feeling that we’re unable to manage expectations, either financial or otherwise 

For me, some of those unmanageable expectations are the ones that have to do with people EXPECTING ME to get drunk even though I've been sober for three years. Every year, I'm shocked by the fact that as someone in my mid-thirties I still feel vulnerable when it comes to peer pressure. I'm embarrassed even typing it. 

While I am not a licensed psychologist,  I have a few quick tips from one non-drinker to another in an attempt to help you get through Thanksgiving without getting drunk. 

1. Realize that one really cares whether or not you’re drinking once they’re two drinks in. Read that twice. Now read it one more time. Do you remember ever being two drinks in and being aware of what or how much other people were drinking? Exactly. 
2. If you’re used to just being shitfaced and useless, turn it around and become useful. Find something you can do to help whoever is hosting Thanksgiving and do it. This can be thwarted if your host is a control freak in the kitchen, of course, but be creative. It’s unlikely that you are the only stressed-out person at your Thanksgiving table. There are kids who need to be entertained, dogs that need to be walked, fires that need more wood to consume… you get it. 
3. Do not isolate yourself. One of the best parts about modern technology is that it literally allows you to keep your friends in your pocket at all times. Make sure you have someone to reach out to when you start to feel like saying “fuck it” and going for the bottle of port in the center of the table. Popular recovery advice is to call someone or go to a meeting. Depending on where your family lives, and what your responsibilities are around the holidays, this might not be possible. Do not feel like you can’t reach out for help because you are doing it via text. Many  text threads have helped me through dark times. 
4. Treat yourself like you’re a little toddler. What are you going to do the day after Thanksgiving to reward yourself for getting through the holiday without getting drunk? You deserve a special treat. This can be Black Friday shopping (if you’re a freak and like crowds) or, if you’re like me, it could be something as simple as a special fancy spin class with an instructor you enjoy.

Lastly, remember that it’s within your power to get up and walk away from any situation that is doing more harm than good to you -- even Thanksgiving dinner. ",46

Today is 31 days, and while I do feel like there's something missing (kinda foggy, kinda bored, tired but not), it also feels so good to know I'll wake up tomorrow clear headed and head to the gym.

The kid’s blanket analogy just came to me one day. Sobriety is growing up, being brave, and achieving all my dreams. My drinking is the opposite. It’s reaching for my old blanket: an old familiar habit that helps calm whatever bad feelings I‘m having at the time.

I’m reminded today of the amazing ‘Man in the Arena’ speech by Roosevelt (included at the end of this post).

We’re all in the arena, fighting, falling, trying so hard.  I’ve never been prouder of myself and the people I’ve chosen to align myself with. If you’re on day one (again) or day 1000, you’re doing it, and you’re amazing.

My choice to finally get off the insane ride I’d been on for 25 years was the hardest and best decision I’ve ever made, and the start of the hardest and most rewarding journey I’ve ever undertaken.  

I’m so proud of myself, and I’m so grateful to and proud of all of you for being here, for being willing to share your stories and your shame and your triumphs.  We all benefit from your voices.

Let’s continue this journey together. Let’s dare greatly.  Because we deserve the better lives we’re building for ourselves.



“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”",156

I'm spending a few days visiting my parents, whom I don't yet feel ready to tell about my strict sobriety and the reasons for it. Tbh I feel like I barely made it through yesterday. I was thrown off guard. My parents showered me with alcoholic gifts from their trip to Europe: a bottle of absinthe, a bottle of fruit brandy, a bottle of ""the most alcoholic beer."" And a whole beer advent calendar with a bottle for each day. They offered me wine with dinner, then later almost poured some fruit brandy from their bottle for me to try, until I stopped them. All I could think to say was ""I'm good for now"" and ""No thanks."" And for today we were discussing things to go do downtown and half of the options were alcohol.
It feels imminent that I'm going to have to tell them something for now. Maybe just something about fitness goals, but I don't want to leave the door open for ""oh just a little taste won't hurt."" I'm fine with accepting the gifts for now and just holding onto them until I do come out with it later. But damn, this short visit is harder than I expected. It feels like I'm hiding something or putting on an act, which is ridiculous when you think about it 🙄

P.S. My parents are not alcoholics, they just like to celebrate when I'm in town.",22

The first day of not drinking I was pure zombie and had extreme high levels of anxiety, all the classic symptoms.  That evening the true hang over set in and it's the worst one I can remember.  To try and keep my mind occupied and also because I wanted to know, I looked up alcohol poisoning/medical assisted detoxes, etc.  My anxiety being so high, being in extreme pain, having huge bouts of paranoia and after reading some of the information I was convinced at times I was going to have a seizure.  Which easily could have happened given the state I was in.  Knowing that, I was unable to fall asleep even when I was tired.  That mixed with delusions, being extreme hot and then cold in seconds kept me up all night.  The only thing I had going for me was I had drank over a gallon of really good mineral water that day.  And so I fell into this zombieish routine that night:  I'd try and watch or read something on my phone to occupy my mind, I'd get up to go pee every 5-10 minutes (as I was drinking so much water it was going right through me) come back rearrange the sheets to try and find the impossible perfect temp my body could find, then read some more, almost drift off and panic, etc, etc... rinse repeat.  

Was finally able to fall asleep for an hour to wake up from a night terror.  I did my best to sleep on my side but at one point in my dream I couldn't breath or talk and I'm wondering if I almost swallowed my tongue.  Hard to say really.  It crossed my mind to go to the hospital many times but I just couldn't bring myself to the door.  To add to it a giant snow storm was in the middle of blowing down a foot of snow and the roads were in the process of being plowed.  Looked dangerous as fuck out there.  

But I made it through the night.  Not smart, I know.  What a horribly dangerous position I put myself in.  But I'm already feeling better today.  Was able to get some food down, much more water, cleaning my place, etc etc...

I've been lurking here for a bit and this is my first post. I'm a woman in my mid/late twenties. I didn't start drinking until college (just a couple times in high school), and I didn't have a problem at first. I didn't have a problem for a while. I do have an addictive personality, and I struggled quite a bit with bulimia and anorexia in my early twenties. This past summer, I went through a breakup with the man who I thought was the love of my life. I loved him with everything I had. I won't get into the details, but he broke my heart and my trust, and I had to change pretty much everything about my life, very quickly. It's been devastating. My depression is back, and it is terrible, and I don't have access to medication. My confidence is shattered, and some days I can hardly get out of bed.  


Onto the drinking. Since the breakup, I've been drinking nearly every day, and quite a lot. It's not uncommon for me to down a whole bottle of wine, or a bottle and a half, or 2. It leaves me feeling gross, disgusting, and defeated. I hate myself. I don't feel like I ""need"" to drink, but I want to, all the time. When I don't drink, I feel okay. No withdrawals or anything. I'm still active and I'm in good shape, and I appear happy to most of the people around me. My family knows I a struggling, and struggling with my drinking, and they are supportive. I'm very grateful for them.  


I feel embarrassed to be posting this. However, I have been so impressed with this community, and I wanted to introduce myself and look for some support. I don't know if I belong here, because I'm not sure I'll stay completely sober forever.. like I said, it's been a recent problem and I don't think I'm too far gone to reel it back in to the social drinker I was for most of my adult life. I know that when I get off work, I'm going to want to stop by the store on my walk home for a bottle of wine.   


I am not going to do that. IWNDWYT.",4

2019-11-27 14:07:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e2kxpf/saturday_share_on_a_wednesday/,Saturday Share on a Wednesday,"Here’s my story you guys.  

Started drinking beer in high school. Immediately loved it. Drank beer most days throughout college. Some of my favorite memories involve alcohol - parties, concerts, nights around a campfire. I thought I was a “typical college boy,” although a friend did one time ask me if I had a drinking problem. I reacted defensively. 

My twenties were actually fairly under control. I mostly drank red wine and could do a decent job of moderating it. Had a few occasions of getting completely blotto drunk at weddings etc but, hey, who didn’t. (I thought)

Around age 30-32ish my heartburn kicked in. Couldn’t drink wine or beer anymore. I discovered vodka, the second great love of my life besides my wife.  Around time of Great Recession, I had two kids under age 2. Layoffs left and right, which I somehow avoided... but my anxiety was off the charts. I began drinking vodka nearly every night. Started with 5-6 shots, in a cup of ice, 4-5 times / week. Evolved to something like 6-10 shots/day. 

What began as a daily anxiety reliever morphed into a habit. It made me happy. I so very much looked forward to putting the kids to bed and pouring myself a drink. My wife goes to bed early, so 90% of the time I would drink alone, zone out, feel my brain get fuzzy, and fall asleep in my chair. 

I functioned pretty well. I didn’t drink on the days I was too hungover, so I convinced myself I didn’t have a problem. (“Hey, it’s not everyday!”)  And I was generally a happy drunk.  

But I had one instance per year or so where I would get stupid drunk in front of friends or acquaintances. Falling down in the middle of busy streets, or in my house. Getting in huge argument when having my keys taken away from me. Calling someone on the phone and forgetting my words. Getting shut off at bars. Having to leave parties early (escorted, sometimes held up, by my saint of a wife). Over 10-15 years, that’s a lot of instances.  

What was funny as a 20 something is not funny as a 40 something. It’s pathetic. 

Around 4 years ago I knew I had an issue. I discovered that running helps me deal with my anxiety.  I moderated my drinking, and ran nearly every day, and lost like 20 lbs. Drinking was always there, though not as much since I wanted to run and couldn’t be too hungover. 

Then came my car accident earlier this year. Rear ended. Hurt my neck. Couldn’t run anymore. Or do much physical activity, actually. Working out of my home office, I’m lonely and bored as hell. Drinking became one of the only things I liked to do.  

At the same time, my youngest daughter’s depression and anxiety went off the charts. She had panic attacks, mentioned suicide.  Her anxiety became my anxiety.  

So many days I would wake up hungover. Not remembering stuff. Feeling even more anxiety than I did the day before. Self loathing and regret, all of it.  Knew it was a problem but no one besides me seemed to know. (Or at least told me about it.). So I kept on drinking. Couldn’t be that bad right?  I mean.. compared  to some of the people on the TV show Intervention, I was pretty normal. 

I tried to control it by buying “lite” vodka. Just drank more to get high. So I tried buying only a certain amount (like 4-5) of nips for the house. The first sip was heaven, but of course the nips didn’t make a dent.  I would just drink those in like 20-30 minutes and look up on my phone where the nearest open liquor store was. Feeling absolute panic because I didn’t have any booze.  Never drove there, but I was so tempted. I’d just ravage my cabinets looking for spare nips or beers I might have missed before. 

It’s amazing how slow the descent into a “worse me” was.  I used to have a bright mind.  But I started forgetting words.  Not being able to solve puzzles or problems as quickly as I used to. Forgetting the names of people I should know ... like one of my nephews.  Often feeling irritable .. most everyone in my life (except my wife, kids, and super close friends) began to annoy me.  Then came stuff I never used to do, like wake up at 4:30am with so much anxiety in my belly that I needed vodka. And I drank it, alone in the dark. 

Then came my recent exam/blood test revealed markers of disease ... high blood pressure, high cholesterol.... and the thing I’ve known is coming but dreaded ... high liver enzymes. 

I cried at my doctor appointment.  He said I should check out a therapist. 

All of this - anxiety, memory loss, early signs of liver disease - has a clear link to alcohol.  I never had “one big event” which made me want to quit. Now I see that it’s a million things that add up to a Worse Me. Now, at age 44, it’s not hard to see how that story ends.  F’ing booze will rob me of the thing I enjoy most in the world: spending time with my daughters.  And hopefully someday with their kids.  

My girls are teens now. They adore me. I love and adore them even more than they could possibly know. They watch every move I make. I stay at home while my wife works, so I’m with them a lot. 

I am extremely conscious of the role model I am for them. When they were younger I could get away with stuff. No more. 

I can’t control my drinking.  So I have to stop. 

I’ve been seeing a therapist.  So is my daughter.  We talk about it together and help each other through things. She’s doing better now, thank God. I’m O.K.  

Finding this group has been amazing. I realize how many people have similar experiences to me. The generosity of spirit you all share is undeniably human.  I feel so much understanding for each of you.   

Knowing that when others say IWNDWYT... you won’t. We are together in that.  My last drink was Saturday Nov 24 2019.  Im hoping this network will help me keep it that way.  Much love to each of you. Thanks for reading and understanding.",29

I used to use alcohol to make everything else seem better - to soften and mask the feelings of depression and hatred towards myself. In reality, it was just making things so much worse. Before, I couldn't imagine going through a day without getting at LEAST somewhat sloshed (usually more than somewhat, though). Now, I still think about drinking, but I try to force those thoughts out by focusing on how amazing and productive I am now. I am lucky to have a really good support system of family and friends. If I could go back, I would have done this WAY sooner. I am not sure that I would go back far enough to eliminate getting the problem altogether because as shitty as everything that has happened to me has been (and I know it is my own fault), I believe overcoming this is making me an even better person every single day. I've started doing things that I have wanted to do for as long as I can remember but always previously prioritized drinking.

I'm 25 and coming up on three years sober, I have a sponsor, a sponsee, a higher power, a home group, have worked the steps, all that good stuff. I feel like I'm fairly active in the program of AA and I don't want to drink today. Rarely do I have thoughts about drinking and I'm generally pretty happy with my life.

Yet, I keep having persistent thoughts that I could (should?) do acid.  For me, acid was my favorite drug and the only one that would cause me to refuse alcohol when offered to me (not sure what that's about.) I'm not going to do it, I don't want to throw away my time, I just keep having these thoughts and they're really starting to bother me. They tell me I could do it safely; that I could just do one tab and listen to/make music, have a good time and not ruin my life. They tell me that acid did way more positive things for my mental health than negative, if there were any negatives. When I relapsed the first (and hopefully only time) it was with weed and I had a terrible time, I was super anxious and bugged out, but I think that'd it'd be different with acid. I don't have access to it anymore and anyone who could get it for me wouldn't cause they know I'm sober. I just want the thoughts to leave me be. I shared it in a meeting last night and the whole meeting turned into a discussion about not doing trying to get away with doing one substance or another, yet I still can't get it through my thick skull.

Has anyone else had thoughts like this specifically about hallucinogens? Has anyone relapsed on acid and can share their experience with me about it?

TLDR; I want to do acid but know I shouldn't. I'm not going to, but how do I get freedom from that thought?",5
2019-11-27 11:31:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e2igs5/90_days_booze_free/,90 Days Booze Free,"Before now, the longest that I have ever gone without alcohol has been a month, which usually turned into 28 days because 4 weeks is pretty much a month, right? I have been drinking since I was 14, and I'm 31. I have had many problems due to alcohol throughout my life, but if you're here I don't need to explain that to you. Here are the most effective things I did to help me along the way:

* My therapist suggested I write a letter to myself, when I was still in the lowest of the lows when I decided to stop drinking. I wrote about how I was feeling and why I finally made the decision to stop drinking, and looking at that letter is the most effective way of shutting down my monkey brain when it tells me that I can drink a little and it'll be okay.
* I am actively rewiring my brain. Having done CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) has taught me a lot about how we can train our brains. **The spaces between our triggers and our actions are the most important moments we live each day.**  When the weather is lovely I used to always sit out on my patio drinking. Because of this, lovely weather is a trigger for me. Now, when I experience lovely weather, if booze comes up, I turn my thoughts away from it and to other ways to enjoy it and focus on it for a long while. When I think about drinking in general, I take time to sit in the feelings of where I was the last week that I drank. I just think it over and over again. I remember the fear and the helplessness. I am slowly rewiring my brain so that my positive emotional triggers don't automatically make me want to drink anymore, and to where I associate negative emotions and experiences to alcohol instead of positive ones. It sounds a bit weird, but it has been extremely helpful, because I generally relapse in celebration or because of positive emotions rather than negative ones.
* At social events where there will be alcohol, I always have a mocktail or something to drink. This has gotten to the point that my friends will pick me up a NA option if they know I'm coming and don't have time to shop for myself. This will be especially important with how much my family drinks during the holiday season.
* This was the hardest part for me - I came clean to the people I spend a lot of social time around. I have a group of mountain biking friends who I told straight up that I have a problem with alcohol and wanted to stop drinking. That way I didn't have to deal with the questions about why I'm not drinking or the pressure to do so. This is the one group I still spend a lot of time with where there is heavy boozing involved, so I felt it was best to just come out and say it. I have had a blast each and every time I have been with them, without feeling the need to drink.
* I journal daily or weekly depending on how I'm feeling. I write down the positives associated with not drinking. Not just the lack of things such as hangovers and guilt, but the added value in my life. IE I spend more time reading when I would have been drinking, I am more present when playing my weekly D&D game and remember what we're doing much better, etc etc.

Those are the big pieces that have helped me get this far. It's crazy to know that I have drank more than half of my life, and have never had a healthy relationship with alcohol. It is exciting to know that I don't need booze to have a fulfilling life, and that I've (hopefully) got a lot left to live.",109

It was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving day in 2016 that I had my last relapse. I had given in to the belief that having a 6 pack of beer to celebrate the holidays would bring me happiness and comfort, and that it would be worth it to break my sobriety streak.

I woke up hungover on Thanksgiving day, feeling miserable physically, and my self esteem took a big hit after realizing the streak of sobriety I had given up. (At that time, about 4 months). I threw up my whole Thanksgiving dinner while the whole extended family was eating in the next room over.

That relapse would continue until July 2, 2017, when I had my last drop. 

Please keep the bigger picture in mind this Holiday season, think about what you have, and be grateful for it rather than ruining your happiness over a relapse.

There is so much joy to be had, and so many things to look forward to outside of the bottle.

I don't know who needs to hear that, but I wanted to share.

I almost died more than once.

I've been studying Taoism for 9 years. It's a subtle and profound philosophy. Six months ago I made a personal breakthrough. Wu Wei clicked on an intuitive level I had never reached before. I haven't had a drink since. This is the longest dry streak from alcohol I've ever had, and I'm starting to feel sober, not just dry. I'm happily the most functional I've ever been as a person. I'm six months sober.

I don’t know. I feel like I’m still on this wheel of feeling strong for a few days and able to control my drinking so then I let my guard down...But then It might not be the first night out or even the 10th but eventually I’m back to where I began, stuck in a place of self loathing, regret and embarrassment.

I'm curious if my story is like any others here.  I am not a social drinker, I don't party, I am family man, church going christian with a wife and two girls.  No one in my life outside my wife knows that I drink.  My friends don't drink, my family doesn't drink, but I always had a desire to drink.  About 6 years ago we went through a lot of stressful stuff and I struggled with anxiety, etc and during that time I started drinking.  First a few on the weekends, then binge drinking on the weekends, which progressed to every night after putting the kids to bed. 

I cannot tell you how many mornings I woke up and told myself that today is the day I'm stopping.  Tired of feeling like this, but by the time the workday was over, I was doing my mental calculations on how much alcohol was at the house and if there was enough there to do the job or if I had to go the store.  I had it down to a science based on alcohol % how many oz in the drink, etc..   I knew exactly how much I needed.  I even rotated the stores I stopped at so the clerks wouldn't think I had a problem... 

I don't know how I got here, but the past 5 years have gotten progressively worse.  Its time to stop.  Its time to put my family first.",5

I continued to tremor and be unable to balance. I hadn’t slept for two days. I couldn’t even keep down water. I decided I was either going to the emergency room in a Lyft or ambulance. I called Lyft and he so sweetly escorted me in. I had willing escorts all through evening.

Turns out I have not destroyed my liver but should very much cut back. (Lol who you telling). I am determined that I’m going to get my life back. And while I wasn’t excited to get a $400 plus bill it took that much to enable to balance and not shake.

So I've been doing pretty well up until now. Once I got past the first couple weeks, I was feeling pretty strong, and motivated... and while I definitely still think about booze regularly, it's been pretty easy to silence the voice in my head for the most part.  
  
Yesterday was very different. I kept thinking to myself that yesterday was a ""bad day"" but really, that's not true either. Nothing in particular was bad yesterday, except my mindset/attitude. Fine... fair enough. I was even able to acknowledge that.  
  
I worked through it. I made a list of ""what would happen"" if I drank. I got some fast food, and crawled into bed and watched TV.  Good, great. Yay me....  
  
But DAMN when I turned off the light to go to sleep.... I went all dark and twisty. I really started to FEEL all the shit that I've probably been trying to drown out with booze. I started to think about how shitty and awful 2010-2014 were and all the stupid fucking things that I did while I was drunk... and how I probably just spent the last 5 years trying to drown out the 5 years before that. I thought about how I'm emotionally crippled and incapable of loving/being loved. I spent forever trying to figure out exactly where along the line I got so messed up.  
  
  
Anyway... it was a pretty bad night. I feel ok again this morning... though I've concluded that I probably need some intensive therapy/counselling... which I really can't afford.  
  
  
I'm not really sure what I hope to gain by sharing this... maybe just some solidarity/encouragement.  
  
Or you know... some good stories about how you got all healthy/whole and healed after you got sober ;) hahaha.

I am finally becoming aware that drinking has led to the many, many problems I am experiencing in my life today. I'm 21, turning 22 in January and I no longer want alcohol to be a part of my life anymore.

I was 16 and with the ""popular crowd"" when I first started drinking. 5 years later, my friends are still in university partying and digging deeper holes, so I had to cut ties with pretty much all of them in order to get this far. I want to change my life and I'm hoping that documenting this can further set that tone for me.

As for how I feel? 1 month sober is starting to feel realllly good in the mornings; night time not so much. The key really is to form new habits and find the ""new you"" and you absolutely can't look back. I'm trying to remind myself daily of the ""bigger reason"" and everyday I wake up to new opportunity and an opportunistic mindset. I feel refreshed, but have much more work to get done.

1 month is the longest I've abstained since I had my first beer at 16 and I can't wait to make it to 2 months.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

 

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

 

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

 

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

 

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

 

\---

 

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

 

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

 

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

 

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It never did and time just passes differently when you're drinking to get drunk and such things aren't considered.

Anyway, it's helping me to not drink, and becoming something I'm slowly realising, that 'the things are the things'; me writing is 'the activity'; me reading 'is the activity'....there are no other activities and these activities will not be made better with drinking.

I tell myself I simply need to go 'harder', 'deeper' into these activities than ever before, and this is a very good thing.

I keep checking my sober counter and surprised that it isnt higher. Not sure why as I'm an adult who is fully aware of how time passes, yet here we are.

 Been reluctant to go back to meetings yet. I will go back I'm an addict who needs accountability of more than just myself. However, I'm also a perfectionist. Admitting that I failed and have to be back disturbs me as much as going through the first week of being sober again. Maybe I'm just being to hard on myself. Maybe I need to be harder.

One of biggest fears of being sober is losing my lovely personality. If I could be naturally two beers deep to before I become a drunken monster I'd be happy. That man is truley to life of any party. Problem is I've been a alcholic for over a decade and dont even remember even who I am sober. There is only drunk and hungover and very little variation of that. Even my early teenage years consisted of lots booze so I dont feel I ever developed a personality that wasnt dependent on liquar. Oh well that's just one of my own fears.

I DONT WANT THAT. I have to remind myself that this scenario will absolutely happen again, it just takes one. Every time it starts with one and then I end up there.

Sorry for the rant, I just had to put it out there so I could remind myself why I want to stay sober. IWNDWYT",7

2019-11-27 01:55:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e2c76z/alcohol_intake_and_the_connection_to_your_blood/,Alcohol intake and the connection to your blood test results indicating possible liver damage (Serum Gamma GT),"I keep quitting and then not being able to resist at the weekends. I have cut down a lot but when Friday rolls around I’m like a moth to the light! And it seems that once I’ve decided I’m having a drink, the flood gates are open and I’ll drink beers on Friday and Saturday and probably wine on Sunday.

Then I’ll hate myself for it on Monday, feel better on Tuesday and by Wednesday (today) I’ll be rational and trying again to stop. I had a blood test on 15th November and back in 2016 I had one and the doctor said I had very high levels of Serum Gamma GT, indicating possible high alcohol intake. Of course I knew this was true and so confessed.

She said I need to go booze free for a month then have another test to see if the result definitely indicates alcohol abuse. So I did that and of course it dropped.

This week i signed up to see my personal medical records online and I’ve never seen my blood test results before and frankly I’m shocked. I’m now worried to death about drinking and what it’s done to me.

To give some perspective, I like a Belgian beer which is 6.7% and on a Friday night I’ll probably drink 3 bottles of that at 750ml a bottle. One bottle is roughly 1 and 1/3 pints, so 3 bottles is 4 pints.

I don’t often touch the hard stuff (literally hardly ever). This past weekend I had 6 bottles of Leffe over the weekend and one bottle of wine. So that’s 8 pints of beer at 6.7%, which is equivalent to about 10 pints of Budweiser or Stella.

Not a lot you may think.

The normal range for Gamma GT serum for an adult male is 12-65. Currently I’m at 292! And that’s after cutting back from the summer! In July I was 392!

In 2016 my GP told me I should consider taking an alcohol awareness course, which I did and for about 6 months I was really good. Still drank but only a little.

And at that point I was at 107, I’m now at 292!  This may mean that my liver functionality is reduced due to alcohol intake. I have been having some other health problems recently and this may be a contributing factor.  I have a doctors appointment today to discuss these results and I will post back.

I’m very worried about what my GP is going to say.

This could be it for me. The end of drinking. If you are struggling to give up drinking, you could get a blood test and see where you are at and then if you are like me you can use this to help you stop. If I can.

Hope this helps someone, if you have had this please comment below! Big love to all in here you help keep me sane (and hopefully sober!)",6
2019-11-27 01:48:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e2c4of/it_was_easy_then_it_wasnt/,It was easy... then it wasn't,"so I went 7 days without drinking and at Sunday brunch I got 1 mimosa and ever since then I can't stop thinking about alcohol. I stopped at 1 but since then my boyfriend has had to talk me out of going to the liquor store 3+ times in the last few days. I hate that I keep acting this way because hes my number 1 supporter and I lash out. Hes understanding because hes been in my shoes before.

But theres always 2-3 hours everyday since Sunday were I say f\*\*\* it and all I want to do is drink. I start sweating, light shakes, and anxiety through the roof. I know a big trigger is the snow that started today and the power going out shortly after, but nothing is an excuse to drink. Im feeling defeated because if my boyfriend wasn't here id be drunk right now. Im thankful im not. 

Im not starting over completely in my head over 1 mimosa because I don't want to lose motivation and getting to day 10 was hard as shit. I made a pros and cons list of quitting and the pros went on for 2 pages and the cons-I could only think of 2 things. Gives me hope I will pull through. I will not drink with you today.",2
2019-11-27 01:40:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e2c1mk/i_thought_it_was_supposed_to_get_easier_after_a/,I thought it was supposed to get easier after a year and a half,"well, technically a year and ten months. Also throwaway cause I only use my main to lurk.

&#x200B;

I quit drinking a year and ten months ago. Did it straight cold turkey and, honestly, it was way easier than I expected it to be.  Moderate withdrawal but it was nothing I wasn't expecting. I struggled mostly with finding something to fill the time I used to spend drinking. 

I was always the very heavy drinker of my friend group. People would comment on how 5 foot tall, petite, female me could put away ten+ high ABV drinks every night. I was high functioning but barely. I always told myself and them that I only drank because it was really \*really\* good at getting my brain to shut up. But then the next morning everything would come back ten fold. Did I drive last night? (the answer was always no, thank god) What if I killed someone and I dont remember it? Did I vomit in my sleep again? Did I start a fight with my roommates? My body hurt constantly. I would have random, severe abdomen pains. Now that I'm sober and they're gone I think it was probably my liver.

Long story short, turns out I have a mad case of OCD and none of my previous therapists caught it. The beer made the little obsessive voice in my brain get quieter. And in the beginning, quitting drinking worked wonders. I slept better. I was able to start eating real food again (I spent about 9 months thinking all food was poisoned and going to kill me and only eating this one brand of really gross protein shakes, it was a weird thing. OCD is like that).

But as of three months ago this sober shit is getting ROUGH. I started an intensive program for OCD. Think the not fun kind of therapy where you have to do the thing that triggers your compulsive behavior and then not do the ritual. It's draining. It makes my anxiety way worse. And I know that I could shut my brain up so easily. 

I also started a new job recently. I love it, dream job for sure and I wouldn't be able to hold it down if I was still drinking. I'm an audio engineer- you know those guys who stand behind the mixing board at concerts and stuff, thats what i do. And in the least cocky way possible, I'm really good at it when I'm sober. I love the job but the phrase sex, drugs, and rock and roll is definitely true. 

Frequently at the end of load out when everyone is getting ready to go home, the bar will come over and hand our crew literal cases of wine and liqour. We each go home with a couple of bottles. They've been opened so the bar can't re-serve them so they go to us or they get tossed. My fridge is crammed full of liqour I've been giving away to my friends but they can only take so much. But boy oh boy are they calling my name tonight.

&#x200B;

Pouring them down the drain seems like a waste. I think I'll go collect them and leave them outside my apartment building.  I live in a pretty happening part of town, I'm sure someone will take them.

&#x200B;

Thanks for letting me let this long rant out. I never told any of my friends that I got sober so I don't really have the opportunity to reach out to them on rough nights.

Sure, I’ve had the normal fear that I might lose this group of friends, and maybe I will, but I was craving social interaction today, and my friends were meeting at a restaurant.. the one I used to love to drink wine at. I thought I would have a shitty time. I thought It would be too tough to not drink. I had a great time- I was more present than ever with my friends.

2019-11-27 00:48:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e2bhij/i_thought_i_might_do_some_good_here_describing_my/,"I thought I might do some good here, describing my day (trigger warning: death)...","I'm in my 50's and eleven years sober. My middle brother is 44.  Call him Wayne. 

Wayne has a drinking problem. Or maybe a living problem made worse by the alcohol. He really fell apart when mom died six years ago and the drinking got bad. He left his wife and took the boys (because her problems were worse than his then). He started drinking so much that it was affecting his work. He got better for a year because he got back together with an old flame and they had a beautiful daughter. She left him because of the drinking and he fell off the deep end.

I helped as much as I could. I took him to meetings, held his hand through DT's at the hospital, visited, took care of the boys, even provided a rent free home. Our sister helped out with groceries, helped with the electric while he was in rehab - we did what we could.

Then this spring he lost custody of the boys and had to have his visits with his daughter supervised. Then he lost his job. Then the unemployment ended. He stopped answering his phone. He stopped answering the door. He changed the locks. His teenage son kept tabs on him because he had the password to Wayne's online banking so he could see the debit card charges.

Imagine checking on your dad online because you don't know if he's alive or dead. None of us knew.

The last time he used his bank card was a week and a half ago. 

We finally broke in today and found him, dead, on the floor. The gas had been shut off and it was 50 degrees in there, so it could have happened up to four days ago.

Do you know what happens when you find a dead body around here? Well first you call 911. The cops come and the paramedics. They pronounced him officially dead and the cops made us sit on lawn chairs in the driveway until the detective and crime scene techs could come.  

Meanwhile, the cops found a medical bill with his current doctor's name and I called them. The cops asked if the doctor would be willing to sign a death certificate. Initially the answer was no. So after the crime scene guys left, the detective called the coroner's office. They were held up.

Sitting, freezing in those lawn chairs, wondering what to tell the kids.

Finally the detective got a call back from Wayne's clinic and they said that the doctor he saw most often was willing to sign. The detective asked what funeral home.  How the hell should I know? And how the hell am I going to pay for a funeral director? I pulled a name out of my ass... I think these folks took care of my in-laws maybe. They said they would come get him in an hour or so.

I decided to try and find Wayne's important papers so I could start getting his affairs in order. He's made a mess of his life (and his house - ugh!) but somebody has to take over doing the adulting. I refused to do it for him when he was alive, but I can't let it fall on his kids' shoulders.

I had to walk past him on the floor and it broke me. I'm broken now. I love him and I'm so angry at him and he's never going to get a chance to get better anymore. It's a fucking tragedy.

His only grandbaby is a toddler. He'll never get to hear her call him grandpa. His boys won't have a father to help them. The younger one is eleven and his voice hasn't even changed yet. He's never going to take them to another game and throw peanut shells on the floor or go camping and make giant hamburgers and toast marshmallows. His youngest starts kindergarten next fall.  He'll miss her first day of school. How's she even going to remember him?

So if you're drinking, *especially* if you live alone, I wrote this for you.

I'm still sober and I dare say I could use a meeting... because by the grace of something I put it down and made it through and failed to  drink every day since then. I wish I could have gotten it through to Wayne that it *can* get better and you *can* come out into the normal world and thrive. But it's too late for him.

Thanks for reading. I hope it helps somebody.",120

Feeling burnt out with work.  Overextended with social commitments.   Dating a girl I am starting to fall in love with (which leads to trying to resolve separation).  

I was really romanticizing drinking last few days.   Prerelapse thinking I know. 

I had a long text exchange tonight with a good friend.  We are in mid 50s and long time friends and was just good to share all my overwhelming thoughts. 

What I learned is that I can make it through a day sober and drinking as plan B is a terrible plan.   My problems will resolve one way or another and in some respects better than I can imagine or control. 

I will not miss drinking if I never drink again. I can not manage being sober the rest of my life,  I can only work on my sobriety today.   And that's all I need to do.

From time to time I get these fairly weak residual urges that somehow my life could improve with some drinking. That life is too still/predictable, despite the fact I generally feel great and life is clearly much better. These urges are not strong enough at the moment to act on, but eventually they do build up and they were the catalyst to the slip-ups (when combined with an actual trigger like social events in pubs/bars etc).

Something that I'm thinking about lately is the idea that these urges are just 'old/defunkt' - there is nothing to go back to with alcohol. It wasn't working and just makes me physically ill, and ruins my life. This is on top of my other tools - like thinking about the freedom from no longer being controlled by a drug, being part of the recovery community, the health dangers of alcohol, and the fun/rewarding things that I now do instead.

*I'm just done with it. There's nothing to miss, as there really is nothing left to go back to*

I think I'll make that my motto of the week. Thanks for reading.

I had committed (to myself) to doing the check-in every night and writing a post every night. For the past week or so, I haven’t felt like I have had much to say and I have been doing really well on my sober journey. I really thought about it and decided I could rethink my commitment and maybe only commit to posting twice per week and whenever I feel like I need help.

I still feel like that may be the right choice but I do have concerns. I have been slipping in other areas. The ones that are affecting me the most are diet and exercise. I am still exercising four times a week but I had been doing 5-6. I had been eating really well and working on healing some known gut issues but now it has been two weeks plus that I haven’t been eating so well. This leads me to feel gross, not want to exercise, not sleep well and be really irritable. This has led to me not feeling as good in general, both physically and mentally and that worries me when it comes to decision making, which obviously could tie into drinking.

So now I have a choice to make. Do I stick to my commitment and post every night, even if it’s just, “Hey, unremarkable day and I didn’t drink” (I feel kind of silly doing that), or relax on that commitment even though I have been struggling to keep commitments in other areas?  

What would you do? All thought welcome. Please note that I am not beating myself up about exercising less or what I’ve been eating. It’s not a self-esteem, self-worth thing, I just honestly feel worse since changing these things but can’t seem to get back to doing what I know is best for me.

(Re: Thanksgiving weekend),"As someone who has long struggled with anxiety, I'm used to dealing with a lot of negative what-if's (what if this person secretly hates me, what if I get fired from my job, what if I do something stupid and embarrass myself, etc.). But recently it occurred to me: why not try out a few POSITIVE what-if's? 

What if on Thanksgiving day -- instead of eating as little as possible to make sure my stomach can absorb as much alcohol as possible and getting as drunk as I can -- I actually savored the delicious homemade food that my mom makes? 

What if throughout the day -- instead of getting increasingly plastered, slurring out every dumb thought that pops into my head, talking too loudly, repeating myself, overall embarrassing myself and barely remembering any of the conversations the next day -- I actually have meaningful conversations with and connect with my family? 

What if during my family's annual post-Thanksgiving-meal walk around the neighborhood -- instead of blundering around, feeling physically numb all over, sneaking wine in a travel mug, and barely feeling the cold because I'm so drunk -- I feel steady, grounded, grateful for the warmth of my winter coat, and appreciate the cool breeze on my cheeks? 

What if at the end of the night -- instead of snarfing down crescent rolls and pumpkin pie with alternating sips of wine, obsessing over how much wine is left in the house, mentally calculating how I can maintain my buzz  -- I enjoy dessert mindfully and with a clear head while I play board games and laugh with my siblings? 

What if at bedtime -- instead of passing out into bed while the room spins and my stomach churns -- I get comfortable in bed, curl up with a cup of tea and a book, and listen to ambient rain sounds on my phone before dozing off?

What if the next morning -- instead of feeling like I got run over by a truck, vomiting, nursing a hangover all day, barely able to leave bed -- I sit in front of the fireplace, get cozy, work on my holiday crafts, and enjoy Thanksgiving leftovers? 

What if I was productive rather than destructive? What if I actually took care of myself? 

I haven't NOT been wasted at a family holiday since I was about 16.  This week I feel mentally shaky, but also hopeful.  I am changing my perspective.  Instead of feeling like I'm deprived of alcohol, I will focus on all of the things and experiences that sobriety gives to me.

Im a functional alcoholic so it doesn't affect my family so much. Well my main goal was to lose weight, all my calories go into beer. Every time I tried to diet I wouldn't eat because I would go over my calorie count, I had to save that for beer. I drink a lot and really wanted to just slow down but one beer turns to 12 and months of 12-18 drinks a day. It has been such a hard year. My husband was hit by a drunk driver and was almost killed, he is crippled now, mostly blind in his one eye he has left. My life was flipped upside down. Beer is like an energy drink to me, I dont like to cook or clean or do anything sober. It also gives me crazy insomnia. I will stay up till 8am drinking.

Im scared going into this during the holidays, plus my 37 birthday is in like a week, the 1year anniversary of the accident is coming up. Those are 2 days I just want to sleep through. I really have no plan, do I quit forever or try moderation after a year and if I start slipping stop. When my skin feels better and my weight decreases I hope it will be enough to keep trucking. Im just so lost at the moment. I feel like Im on my kick it app all the time just staring at it.

Im hoping that will ease the craving. I reseached how docs will prescribe benzos to heavy drinkers to help ease the process.

I was a drunk, an alcoholic who drank on average 10 or more drinks
 Every. Single. Day. 


At first I thought I would never drink again. I was scared I would fail and start drinking in excess again. I would become a loser again. 


So I did an experiment two weekends ago. I had a tall glass (probably equaled 2 glasses) of wine with my boyfriend. He doesn't have issues with alcohol and is a responsible drinker.


 He was so nervous and apprehensive for me. It took us hours to finally get around to taking a first sip together. God, after that first sip, I missed the taste. But it was almost like muscle memory and the memories it brought back weren't ones I wanted to remember. I nursed my glass for a few hours and didn't much enjoy the buzz feeling I was getting. 


These past 3 months I grew to like the feeling of being completely in control of my body and my actions; even though I'm an extremely anxious person (mostly the reason why I drank) 

When I started to get a buzz it scared me. I was losing my sharpness, I was losing the ability to be in control. So I poured out my wine without a second thought.



Let me say, I have never ever ever poured out a drink. That in itself was a huge surprise to me. I've only been sober for almost 90 days but I feel like I am miles away from the person I was.



So that's why I'm keeping my days. I'm 90 days away from the person I let myself become. And if I have a drink once in awhile it doesn't take away my hard work. I will only lose my days if I decide to get fucked up and drink to get drunk like I used to.

As a seasoned bartender I grew a love for the taste of alcohol.
I love the taste of a good old fashioned, or a bold cab sav. 


I still haven't tried beer yet because that one is hard for me. I really loved beer and i don't want to turn one into two into three. Maybe in a few more months I'll do another experiment with beer. But for now I'm satisfied with my results from trying wine. I proved to myself I have more strength then what I gave myself credit for. 


I hope this helps anyone else who is considering their relationship with alcohol. Your sobriety can be tailored to suite you. As long as you are staying sober and happy with your progress, anything is possible. I commend all of the people who go completely abstinent from alcohol for life. That is the strongest will one can have. 


But for me I think I would give alcohol too much hold over me if I say I can never have it again or  I'll slip up. I will get back to being a responsible drinker. An occasional drinker. One drink for special occasions and that's it. Nothing more. Because I know if I do drink more than two drinks I'll probably convince myself to get fucked up. I've proven I can have one and done. 

Happy Thanksgiving everyone ❣️ I'm thankful for this sub. Without y'all I wouldn't have been able to quit and find myself again.",0

2019-11-26 16:53:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e259sz/addiction_gollum_and_the_ring_of_power/,"Addiction, Gollum, and the Ring of Power","1285 days. No joke.

I've been thinking about the end of ""Return of the King."" Specifically the penultimate scene where Frodo is about to cast the Ring of Power into the fires of Mount Doom.

I always used the One Ring as a metaphor for alcohol. I saw it as beautiful, powerful, and the solution to my woes. Through me it wielded unimaginable evil. Only with ""The Fellowship"" (of AA) was I able to make the journey to have the ring destroyed once and for all. I use Frodo as a metaphor for myself -- a nice person in the process of being corrupted. I use gollum as a metaphor for who I become when I drink.

*Spoiler alert*. When Frodo is holding the One Ring over the fires of mount doom we are happy! He has made it! He has gone this far to destroy it and all he has to do is *let go*. But it is then that the ring has the most power over him. He cannot destroy it. He wants the ring more than ever. His best friend wails: ""Just let it go. Let it be done.""

So too was my reaction to addiction. When it became abundantly clear that it was time to be done with it, that it was time to remove this thing from my life, that is when my addiction had the strongest grip on me. That is when my friends and family where most desperate. It was clear what had to be done and I wouldn't do it.

But here the metaphor goes deeper.

My alcoholic self -- the sick and impulsive creature. That is gollum: obsessed with dopamine hit of my precious. His life is full of isolation and suffering. At this moment is when Frodo decides he is going to keep the ring forever, gollum goes insane with rage. In that impulsive act, and the fight that goes on between myself and my sick alter ego, the ring is dropped into the fire. *By accident.* It is almost as if the ugliness of my sick self does the job for me.

This last part is what is so insane about the movie and addiction. In the end, it wasn't up to me to make the right choice. In fact, I would have made the wrong one. But the darkness inside, ironically, became the demise of my addiction. It was just too fucking crazy to bear anymore. 

I feel like I've had some small victory over alcohol with 3.5 years of sobriety. However, if you watch the closing scenes of Return of the King, Frodo is forever changed. He's content and focuses on what matters in life, but haunted by the past and has never fully recovered. I feel the same way. That is OK. What I would have become if I held onto the One Ring would be infinitely worse and hurt many people.

Does that make sense? I don't know, and I guess I don't care. I said it for myself and maybe the few people who have seen LOTR and are in recovery (ok that is a million people now that I write that out).",33

In between the holiday parties, being swamped at work, family gatherings (both sides like to drink), my birthday and the big drinking day for me is New Year’s Eve. 

I’m hopeful, but still terrified. Thankfully I have therapy scheduled the morning of the first holiday party of the year and that always boosts my resolve to quit. I know I’m going to be gifted several bottles of wine for my birthday, I hate that wine has somehow become part of my personality and a go to gift. It’s going to be hard to ignore the whispers that I must be pregnant from the in laws if I don’t have a glass in my hand. 

NYE is going to be the big hard day. It always is. I  have spent every year hiding in my house getting blackout. It’s like my brain has convinced itself that if I stay sober and leave the house I’ll die. Ptsd is fun like that. For context I was ran over by a cargo van on NYE and almost died. That’s where my drinking went from casual and controlled to this mess I’m in now. Booze was cheaper than pain killers and a therapist at the time. Now it’s just a crutch I use to bury everything and stay numb.

It worked well for about a week, then I went right back to old habits.  Recently I got a serious case of the flu - worse than I can remember, the body aches have been debilitating. The flu hit late Thursday and I had my last beer Saturday night (3 days ago).  The cravings aren't what I expected, they aren't that strong.  While the flu symptoms seem to be abating, I feel horrible.  A little depression, no energy and it's nearly impossible to sleep through the night. I can't get more than about 4 hours of 'decent' sleep per night.  Things are certainly confused as I can't decide which symptoms are attributed to being sick and which are attributed to any potential dependence on alcohol.  

&#x200B;

I feel like tonight being 3 full days, I should be past most of the danger and I don't have much desire to drink, but I have to get some decent sleep and fast.  I have no idea how long of a ride I'm in for, but I'm starting to get nervous.  

&#x200B;

Is there a general rule or rough estimate as to how long it will be until things start to be less physically demanding?  Other than benadryl and THC are there any trusted solutions to get more sleep?

I've struggled with substance abuse since I was 15. Me(30M) and my girlfriend(26F) have been dating off and on since December 2015. She's broken up with me 3 times and taken me back each time. Each breakup was worse than the last. 
 When we started dating, I was going through a really hard time. I had recently found out that my wife at the time and mother of my two children had been cheating on me. I was trying my best to be sober during this time, but I was still hanging out at the local bars just to hang out with people and distract myself. I moved back in with my parents, my ex wife moved in with her new boyfriend, and her mom took the kids back with her an hour away, I took them as much as I could.
 I met this girl at one of those bars through a mutual friend, and within a couple weeks we were dating. Obviously since I met her at a bar, she was a drinker. But she wasn't a bad one like me. She helped me through my divorce, took care of my kids like they were her own, drove me around everywhere until I got my truck(when we started dating I didn't have my license or a vehicle because of a couple DUIs) and so much more. She took care of me and obviously was in love with me, and I loved her too. I told her she was the best thing that had ever happened to me. 
 For the first year or so I kept my drinking to a minimum and mainly only drank when she was drinking. So like 2-3 times a week. Still quite a bit but not as much as I used to. About a year and a half into our relationship we took a trip out of state to visit one of my old friends. Me and this guy have a history of drinking and drug use together so when we got up there of course the whole time we were drinking the entire time. This made her uneasy seeing me drink like that but I assured her it was only because I was around my friend. She knew I had a problem with alcohol but I had been keeping it to a ""minimum"" with her before this.
 But when we got back, I went right back to my old ways. I was still drinking around her, but I started a nightly habit of drinking alone in my room and hiding it from her. Sometimes when she was over and wanted to stay the night I would refuse and say it wasn't a good night for it just so I could sit alone in my room and drink. On top of the dishonesty, my drinking started causing more problems in our relationship. I didn't realize it at the time but it affected my mood and made me seem distant, and unable to deal with any issues she addressed to me, making me blow up and turn them around on her because I was emotionally unable to deal with her problems because I couldn't even figure my own out.
 After a few months of this she broke up with me for the first time, and I was heartbroken. I don't remember how long it was for but it wasn't very long. I tried my best to win her back and I even told her about the drinking I had been doing since our trip to see my friend. I told her I would stop and try to be better and she took me back. When I told her this I fully intended to stop. I hated what I was doing and I hated myself for doing it. But I'm an addict and I didn't know how to stop, so when we got back together I went right back to it. 
 For almost another year this kept on like this until she broke up with me again... this time when I had my kids for a month straight. And this time I was done. I didn't want to live like this anymore and I told her I never stopped and I was so sorry and I wanted to quit but didn't know how to stop, but while she was hurt that I had been doing this, she told me that it wasn't the reason she had left me. I knew that it was the reason behind everything I did that she had an issue with but I couldn't make her believe that. This time I remember we were broken up for about 2 1/2 months, and during this time I went back up to that friends house from out of state and got messed up beyond belief, almost dying on the last night from suffocating on my own vomit after passing out. On the long drive home I decided that I was done drinking forever, and when I got back I started going to an outpatient program and aa meetings.  
 Eventually after another month or so she started missing me and saw that I had gotten sober, and she took me back again. I found out she had gone on some dates with a couple other guys but nothing serious had happened. It kind of bothered me but I just tried to bury it and not discuss it with her, but by this time, even though I was for the most to blame for her breaking up with me, I had built up resentment over her leaving me. I was new to being sober and had a lot of emotional growth to catch up on. I reacted wrong when she brought up her own issues because I simply didn't understand what to do or say to make her feel better, and just three months later she broke up with me again. 
 This time I lost it. I was sober. I was doing the best I thought I could possibly do. I needed to fix myself before I could help anyone else and I knew that but she didn't realize it. So she lost patience with me real quick this time. This breakup was 7 months long, in which time I had 3 relapses, and her coming in and out of my life, giving me hope that we'd get back together and then taking it away. The last time we were hanging out for a couple weeks I was doing everything I could possibly do for her. I went out of my way to make her feel special and tried my best to win her back. The last night of this I made her dinner and she had a panic attack and kicked me out of her house. I did one more really bad relapse the next day and drove all the way back over to that friends house out of state with another friend and had a 4 day binder. Got back and drank for a few more days and then quit again. Got really deep into AA, finished my steps, and was trying my best to just get over her. I started going to the gym daily, going on a bunch of hikes and surrounding myself with healthy people.
 But 6 weeks later she hit me up... And told me she had rebounded with one of the guys she went on a few dates with in the previous breakup, and the space away from me to clear her head and the perspective she got by being around someone else made her realize that she couldn't love anyone the way she loves me, and she wanted me back. At first I didn't even take the news that bad. But over time it really got to me. We now have been seeing eachother again for over 3 months but it still haunts me that she was with someone else. I know I have a lot to blame in all this, and I'm still trying to grow into the best version of myself that I can be now that I'm sober, but I feel betrayed. I didn't even try to date during the whole breakup, mainly because she kept giving me hope that we'd get back together throughout the year.. and she was with someone else within a week of the last time we had seen eachother. It fucking hurts, and she doesn't understand why I feel this way. We were broken up. It shouldn't matter. But it does to me. I was trying so hard to show her I could do better right before she did this and she pushed me away because she thought I was just trying to win her back just to go back to my old ways. She has done a lot to try to make it up to me, and I do still love her and I'm trying to work through it but it's not going away. Some words of wisdom would be appreciated.",4

Sure I can stop for a day, maybe even 2, but I haven't gone for an extended period of time in months. The past few months is when I feel it got out of control. You know when you kinda think you have a problem, but your still functional and still think your in control of it? Now I'm aware it has control of me. I was never really a big drinker during my teens and early 20's, sure I drank socially but when I was alone I was never like ""I could really use a drink"" mostly comes from my mom being an alcoholic so I was always cautious. 

Well in comes Xanax. Easily obtainable for me, and helped my anxiety. I never really liked Xanax by itself, it doesn't get you high or Euphoric, it just kinda dulls you out. But combined with alcohol...just pure numbness and indifference. It was great at first, doing innocent dumb shit like buying stupid things. Even my performance at work was better. Then comes the alcohol. It started with a few beers just to enhance the feeling of xans, then quickly turned to whiskey/vodka. There was an incident in the summer where I showed up to work smashed and my manager knew and sent me home, thankfully nothing came of it since we are friends, but the shame and embarrassment I felt should've been the wake up call I needed. It was so out of character. Unfortunately it wasn't. All it did was make me not drink at work and save it til I got home.

The thing is I've always been able to quit drinking, sure I've gone on benders but was never a daily drinker for extended periods of time. Over the past 2-3 months or so is when the drinking spiraled out of control. Instead of being drunk at work, I've missed so much time due to being hungover, or sleeping through my alarm I'm on the verge of losing my job. The problem now is instead of waking up hungover, I'm waking up with guilt and shame when I look at how much I've drank, the money I've thrown away and the texts and convos I had. It's always the same cycle on repeat when I drink that I feel I can't escape.

I just don't like the person I am anymore, especially drunk. I hate the money I've wasted, I hate that the past 6 months have felt like a blur, I hate reading the text convos the next day which don't even sound like me. Just shame and embarrassment. I thought I was done 2 days ago, but what do I do yesterday I buy a 26er of vodka stay up until 4, knowing I have work in the morning and sleep through my alarm and call in sick. I should have learned my lesson by now, I've been blacked out, passed out on the bathroom floor, puking uncontrollably, wasted thousands of dollars, drinking vodka for breakfast like it's normal, almost losing my job. 

This isn't a cry for help, I'm just hoping getting it off my chest for once is the help I need, so I can look back and reference this and just how miserable I am. If you actually made it through this wall of text you deserve some sort of medal haha thanks I just needed to get this out there for me.",6

I picked myself up fairly quickly and didn't let it spiral into a full blown relapse and am still going strong now.

Today isn't my sober date but today was the start of my journey into sobriety. So I just wanted to give a shout out to that scared girl who didn't fully understand just what her decision would do for her life moving forward (which is something I'm still learning) but still decided to do the better thing for herself and do it anyway.

Long time lurker with a question.   
I'm a week away from hitting 7 months sober from alcohol. I was in a near death accident on May 3 of this year that only by the grace of God I survived. I fell 30 feet onto concrete after having a withdrawal seizure. My third withdrawal seizure.   
Due to the nature of not only my injuries, but also to brain bleeding & the concern that I would have another seizure while in the hospital, I was put on a whole host of medications including a whopping 4mg of Clona zapem. No prior history of any medications.

  
I've been working with my addictions doctor since I was released to taper off the Clona zapem & I'm down to 0.25mg as of today, with the goal to be completely off of it in 21 days.   


I'm scared shitless that I'm going to have another seizure. Does kindling apply in this case? From what I've researched about alcohol kindling, it is not something that repairs itself. Basically once you've had a withdrawal seizure, you will have them going forward when you withdrawal. Obviously these meds target the same receptors in the brain....So is this now something I have to worry about?!   


I haven't had any withdrawal symptoms through the course of my taper & it's been an aggressive one - down 0.5mg every 21 days. Thanks in advance!",1

I get to about 4 days and I usually end up at the pub or buying a few beers from the shop. I also only used to smoke when I drank but that has become a lot more frequent too.

I was with my parents after a nice dinner. We went to a little liquor store in a small town and it was closed on a Saturday night. I was so desperate, I was willing to drive to the next town over to raid their liquor store, but ""luckily"" my dad went and found the owner of the store and made him open it. 

I searched the store and couldn't find my kind of wine so I finally settled on a case of bottles simply marked ""chardonnay. ""  When I got them home, they were too warm to drink and once again I was delayed from consuming this thing I thought I so badly needed. 

It was such a simple dream and a simple concept but the chaos I felt over not being able to get my hands on wine was so real. I woke up so happy and clear headed, grateful that isn't my life anymore.

Here I come back to a year sober (my only other attempt) and beyond!","I am contuing back up one day at a time to get to a year again. That was 2018 that I stayed sober (part way into 2019). I am back, so I know I am committed.

Before 2018 I had been drinking frequenly for 15 years. It got worse and worse. Then I tappered down in 2017, quit in 2018 into 2019, and tried moderation; it worked for 8 months. Then I drank heavily due to work pressure and felt like hell. I saw some of my old drinking/drug user friends from way back when in HS when I visited my home town. They are still at it. Some have decent jobs (I do too) yet most do not (including some new people I met there) and their lives are a mess. Frankly, they annoyed the hell out of me. Why would I want that life? I would not and do not want it. I quit the next day.

The first time I got drunk I got hammered on Everclear (with some of these same friends). I felt up a girl (she was into it); yet normally I would not do that and it was risky... I caught myself and walked away. I then puked out of sight off of a balcony into the grass. Despite drinking I rarely got blackout drunk; my toleralance just kept building resulting in riskier and riskier behaviors despite my smarter self begging me to stop. Still I came back to drinking after that; too many triggers. I never got over 30-34 units a week but still that is too much. If I was having pain near my liver that was a sure sign I needed to stop. And I was hitting 30 units every single week early 2017. That was my worst. I was using it to cope with work... no more!

So here I go again, wiser, smarter, calculated, calm, and listening to those with more experience. I will be that guy that can be relied upon to stay sober, present, and I will continue to be successful. I will help others and I am stronger physically and mentally than I have ever been.

I know my path and I am following it.

I've been able to function on less sleep lately and have been so much more productive. No longer do I hit snooze 12 times and then realize I have to get up for work like 10 minutes ago and then barely manage to get dressed and brush my teeth before I stop at the liquor store to make it through the day. I'm not the first customer buying 2 packs of mini bottles of wine to hide in my bag at 7 am to get through work. Then 2 more on the way home. Thats what I was doing the weeks before I ended up in the hospital. Still able to work and function for the most part.

Instead I've been waking up early, going to the gym at work to stretch and do some cardio before I clock in. Over the weekend I saw my trainer twice. I got my ass kicked but in a good way. I was able to work out harder and I felt better then when I'd go in half hungover half buzzed. My work has improved because I can focus better and am not forgetting things. One of my best friends/complicated relationship just got out of jail for his 2nd DUI and so I finally have someone I can talk to about this stuff. He wasn't impressed with my bender and hospital stay.

My only gripe, well I guess more annoyance, is that I still look puffy and bloated. I've barely lost any weight despite having cut my calorie intake by probably a 1/3 of what I was consuming when drinking 3-4 bottles of wine a day. I eat really healthy and pretty small portions. I drink at least 80-120oz of water day. Being healthy and feeling good is number one priority, but I also am really trying to lose weight I've gained which is one thing really motivating me. I want to go visit said best friend/complicated relationship (he lives in a different state that's why I say complicated. Oh and we're both alcoholics.) I'm going to keep at what I'm doing and hope for some results soon. That being said it's not even 5am and I'm going to try and get some more sleep before I start my day at the gym.

What the fuck did those people do for fun? I mean seriously who doesn't drink? As it turns out, now I don't drink and I have just as much fun without the hangover.

For those of you just quitting you can quit for good if that is what you want and or need to do. It does get much easier as the sober days add up. I don't think about drinking every day anymore and very seldom have had the urge to get drunk 

Quitting drinking has been the best decision I have made so far in life. It did not magically make all my problems disappear but I can manage them now in a much better way. I am more confident, much happier and far less depressed without the booze. I never realized just how much of an impact drinking had on my mental health. So much has improved in my life without it that it is hard to imagine why I never quit before. Staying drunk blinded me to what I could become or how much my life could improve without the constant fog of being hungover. 

I also want to thank all of you fine folks here. This place has been a big part of me staying sober for a year. I wish the very best for all of you.

This is way more than I expected when I began this journey a bit more than 3 months ago. 

I'm enjoying the benefits each day : 

\- Better sleep, waking up sober and clear minded is a daily gift. 

\- Mind clarity, memory and overall speech are so much better. I feel better in my job and in my everyday life.

\- As a runner, I am much faster, and have a bigger motivation to wake up early to go training! I have two new PB within the last 100 days : 10k (39'06"") and Half-Marathon (1h33'10"")

\- and most important to me, better mental health, more confident, no more guilt or discouragement. This is the main issue I had while drinking, so this is a victory

I still remain a bit unconfortable with questions people ask me : why are you doing this? when are you planning to drink again? Are you serious about not drinking for Xmas?? But I stay focused, and more convinced than ever that I want to keep on living my life sober

Then i got groceries, made dinner and watched a crime show.
I feel lighter right now. Like I don't have to be a mess anymore. It has been really really hard.
But i know that my brain sends me in cycles so it's the crash I've got to worry about. But I'll run again tomorrow.
Tomorrow is a fortnightly work meeting which we have at the pub because I made it that way. I think I can do that- get some juice or something. But I might tell them. I think they'll help me",7

I won’t get into details but I’m in full time school and unable to work a job currently but that still allows me a lot of time to drink. 

Typically I would fill my time with productive activity and I often do during the day but find myself slipping at night when I’m alone. I know this is a journey that if I want, I’m meant to conquer myself but I can’t help but feel as though a supportive system would be enormously helpful. 

I’m honestly fairly introverted and don’t have a lot of friends, and those that I do have don’t know about my alcoholism. Those that I do have I can only see once a week or so due to a myriad of factors, and many were my drinking buddies when I was young. 

I hate to mention this when I don’t feel it’s relevant, but I’m a strong atheist and due to local AA being heavily religion based I’ve never connected with them and feel as though it’s not for me. I really feel as though I need genuine socialization and friendship to keep me sober but I don’t have enough acquaintances I consider friends to open up to and the ones I do have as friends aren’t around frequently enough, or ones shallow enough that our friendship would dissipate without drinking? 

The last thing I’d want to do is make my alcoholism someone else’s problem but I’m not sure where else to turn. Does anyone have any recommendations for how to handle lonely drinking? I’m just not really sure what else to do and I’m frustrated and want to help myself.",2

I just started crying and talking out loud to no one (I was home alone lol) and just ranted and raged and yelled and cried at the unfairness and sadness of it all.  I don’t think I realized how much drinking kept me from feeling the unpleasant emotions going on in my life right now.

I guess I didn’t really think I had a problem but a bottle of wine a night is not a normal amount. It came to a head last Monday when I took an overdose, I was in hospital until Friday and my liver is now not happy so it is more enforced sobriety.  

I’ve been lurking for months so I did know I had a problem, I’ve always been one to push everything to an extreme and I have come to realise that drunk me does not make good decisions. I’ve hurt so many people with my overdose and I need to sort this. It just feels a little insurmountable at the moment. But baby steps, and not drinking is one of them.  

I keep telling myself it’s just for now and that I can drink again, but I’m not sure that’s reality.  I still feel like I am going to be missing out and I’m hoping that will fade.  Anyway, I just really wanted to say that I have read lots of your posts and have found support throughout, so thank you.  Xx",7

It’s not worth worrying about what friends and family drink, and trying to fit in. I (and you) can choose to enjoy water, tea, apple juice, tea, coffee, whatever, just not alcohol. Save the calories for pumpkin pie and cranberry sauce. Save the embarrassment for someone else. Say stupid stuff, fine, but NOT because of alcohol.  

Better yet, maybe I won’t say stupid stuff at all, but pay more attention to conversation topics, facial expressions and nonverbal cues, thoughtful comments on subject, try to add value to this time with family and not just go through the motions and take advantage of time away from work as a free pass to get wasted multiple days in a row. Life’s too short for that garbage. 

One more food for thought, seeing a family member once or twice a year around holidays, for an elderly person might mean seeing that person only a  dozen or 2 more times period.  Making memories that you can actually remember with clarity is of the utmost importance.

My sister was worried too and like it kind of upset me at the time because it felt so presumptious because I have hardly drank around either of them.

I have called my mom three times trying to like say ""I'm going to try AA"" "" I got pamphlets about AA"" and ""I got my first chip from AA and tried to make a chips and no salsa joke but just cried instead""

But like I just chicken out for some reason. I don't want her to look at me differently, or like worry more about the hot mess I can be. I don't want my dad to know because I feel like he would be dissapointed in having an alcoholic daughter. 

I don't know. I'm reading too much into it, but its like so hard to shake the feeling of inpending dissapointment, even though I'm taking a healthy step toward sobriety. 

Sorry for the personal spew of insecure thoughts, but it feels better to at least get it off my chest. The lonely feeling is shitty, but I know how to keep busy, and I like myself so much more sober.",9

I've hit day 4 of not drinking and am laying in bed with a hot cup of tea listening to music. I'd been drinking pretty much every night for the past 5 years to self-medicate insomnia and depression. 2 weeks ago I woke up so hungover I decided I was tired of this shit. Too much wasted energy on buying booze, passing out, and waking up feeling like crap. Wanting to stop but afraid of withdrawals, I decided to try and taper myself down. With all the will power I had, I cut back 1 drink a day until 4 nights ago when I had my last 1 drink. That last week was hell full of anxiety, no sleep, shakes, and cravings. The last few days of my taper the withdrawal symptoms subsided and for the past few days I've felt better than I have in a long time. Rather than the bottle, I've turned to night time tea, melatonin, and mindfulness exercises. I haven't slept this good in quite awhile. I wake up feeling refreshed which is something I forgot existed. I have more energy during the day, the bags under my eyes are gone, and I'm starting to get interested back into my hobbies I've thrown by the wayside. I still get cravings, but I've been doing the best I can to distract myself and get through to the next day. It's just the beginning of a long journey but I look forward to where I am headed. I've been lurking this subreddit for quite awhile and it's been one of the main reasons I've been keeping on track.

I've wanted to quit, but have fallen time and time again. I haven't been able to string more than a few weeks together here and there for the past decade.
 Drinking at first was a way to escape my social anxiety and past traumas. For the longest time alcohol has tricked me into thinking it was helping while completely making a mess of my life. I've lost good relationships with lovers, friends, and family, lost my health (I've gained a lot of weight, am starting to develop fatty liver, having major issues with my digestive system), a lot of money, my self esteem and self respect among other things.
 I've decided enough is enough. I'm posting to keep myself accountable and not lose sight of where I want my life to be. I can't let alcohol rule me anymore. The negative self talk, calling into work because I'm too hungover to go, feeling depressed and alone, not feeling like my life is worth anything. I can't keep living this way.
 I've read so many stories on this sub that has made me feel like I'm not alone in this addiction and that there is hope. I'm so glad I found this wonderful place with like minded people to grow and heal together. 
 I'm ready to take the first step into living my best, healthiest life. Sobriety never seemed attainable to me, but I feel like that fear of not getting better is a thing of the past. I know it's going to take a lot of work and self discipline, but I'm sure I'll get there.
 Thank all you kind people for being so supportive in this community! It feels good knowing I'm not alone in this fight.

It's been awhile since I've posted and this milestone felt like a good day to check in. I'm creeping ever closer to my 2nd year anniversary as a non-drinker & I have this sub to thank!

At this point it's been long enough without a drink that I don't think about drinking at all on a day to day basis. However, I had an incident recently that reminded me I need to stay vigilant. 

I went through a health scare just a couple weeks ago & had to get a biopsy on my left breast after a lump was found during a routine check-up and mammogram. All signs point to benign at the moment so it looks like I'm in the clear. But I gotta say, I thought to myself, what if it's cancer? How will I deal with the stress of that? What if I just want to forget? Is getting black-out drunk an option? 

Thankfully I didn't drink & now that the stress has passed I know I won't drink. But what about the next time there's a health scare? What if it was cancer? How would I deal with the stress?This whole experience has been a very humbling reminder that I need to stay on top of my shit & continue to take care of myself physically & mentally so I don't even consider drinking again to be an option for dealing with my emotions even when faced with something as life-changing as a possible cancer diagnosis.

A damn motorbike (lol)

I’m really not one to brag. And I’m certainly not telling you I bought a motorbike to boost my own status…

The reason why I’m sharing this experience with you is that before I stopped drinking…

I had already thrown away my first Personal Training business and broken up with my girlfriend.

I moved to London to try and do a graduate job in recruitment but quit because I couldn’t survive in the drinking culture.

I tried Personal Training in London and went -£2,000 in my bank account…I was trying to train people whilst STILL drinking…

Broke as a joke, I had to come back to Oxford to stay at a friends place for free and start working in a restaurant.

It was so embarrassing.

I had gone from sober, running a successful personal training business, to having to go back to a restaurant…Man wtf…

I knew I had so much potential but just couldn’t get out of the pit.

I hit rock bottom at that restaurant, after realising EVERYTHING I had built from my last sobriety stretch, I had now destroyed.

When I stopped drinking, I started working on my new Personal Training business and slowly transitioned into making videos.

The only reason I was able to make both of these transitions, is because I was sober.

You see, the sober Leon and the drinking Leon are two very different characters.

The word that describes me when I am drinking is fickle. I would never truly commit to anything - jobs, girls, friends. They were all means to ends.

The difference is when I’m sober, I am capable of infinite times more. With the clarity, energy and confidence, I am able to take on ANY of life challenges.

I can learn skills, move countries and do it all with joy and confidence.

So, with the money I saved, I did buy a motorbike.

But the only reason why I bought it, is to celebrate my sobriety.

And believe me, there is no better service I can do in the world but share this experience with you guys who are also walking this path of sobriety.

I admire you all.

Guys, my message is simple but it’s always the same. Sobriety is worth it. It truly gets better and better and better. You really can create the life of your dreams if you get and stay sober. I hope you can see that this life is possible for you too.

Have a wonderful day.",10

But this past weekend at his friends place and his uncles wedding I was a real piece of work. Embarrassed him in front of his friend. Fine at the wedding but got back to the hotel and started fighting and his parents heard and got mad.

We both come from parents who are alcoholics and I’m not happy about my behavior at all. I told him I’d stop. Told him today. 

Spending thanksgiving and the holidays with his family who drinks a lot is going to be tough but for once in my life I’d really like to not be wasted out of anxiety and feeling awkward.",4
2019-11-25 19:28:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e1povh/im_trying_again/,I'm Trying Again,"Last drink on Friday night/early Saturday morning. Blacked out as usual. Sick of this shit. The feeling of guilt, the multiday hangovers, the money wasted, the damage it's doing to my body.

Not the first time I've tried to stop. Have drank heavily since I was around 16. It has gotten progressively worse in the last five years.

I went around three months sober earlier this year but ended up at a family social event where it all went downhill again. Heading into Christmas this is probably the worst time to stop but fuck it.

I'm 33. I'd like to be 63 one day and healthy as fuck. When I binge I binge heavy. 20+ beers a night.

Struggling a lot with anxiety and many unresolved issues in my life. I'm not sure if drinking is a coping mechanism or if it has just become a ritualistic habit.

I don't know how long I'll last or how good it will feel, but the stories here are inspiring. Thank you all and good luck to everyone trying something similar!

EDIT: I didn't know people would reply, just kinda wanted to keep a record here for myself. Thank you all so much for sharing your thoughts. Collective experience makes me feel like I'm less alone in a struggle that I've very much kept to myself. You guys motivate me to succeed.",7

But this morning waking up too hungover to show up for work and remembering that my SO left in the night with our dog after a huge, and cruel, drunken fight was a new low for me. I know this is no longer working for me. I'm 32 now and have been drinking practically every day of my adult life, usually a pint whiskey or a 6 pack of something high gravity. I cannot remember the last time I went 24 hours without a drink, but as of 30 minutes from now I will have done it. I don't know what comes next but I know that I will not be having that first drink today. I've spent several hours today reading over posts from this sub and doing some research into AA, and am glad to have found this resource.

I’m trying to write how I feel and I’m wondering if anyone else understands how I’m feeling. Wanted to also preface by saying I was more of a weekend binge type rather than daily drinker but I’m still noticing changes: 

So I thought cutting out alcohol would magically cure my mental health? Turns out it didn’t. Don’t get me wrong, I feel different. Different in a mostly good way. My mind sort of feels sharper and I feel a bit more confident. But I also feel ... more restless. And realising my natural self is quite fidgety and energetic. Which is good but has also meant my mind is constantly under stimulated. Without alcohol to self medicate or cause me to feel tired, I’m channeling my constantly hungry mind into other things ... buying stuff, eating stuff, clicking on stuff. I just can’t sit still. It’s never enough. What do I use to numb my mind now? I get bored of everything so quickly. Alcohol helped me focus and find stuff interesting for long periods of time. 

Considering getting checked out for ADHD. It’s something I’ve suspected for a while that I’ve had (had it as a kid) and it would explain a lot. 

What do I do with all this....brain energy?",5

I’ve been somewhat active on this sub for a year, and thank those here who have had success for painting a picture of what a happy, sober life looks like.

I needed in-patient as a way to ensure I was going to stick to my promise to myself. I was too good at talking myself out of it otherwise. 

Luckily my liver was all good after a blood panel, the pain was gone in a week, and I’m slowly getting a handle on what post rehab reality will be like without alcohol.

It’s terrifying to be honest. But as opposed to past attempts, I believe I’ve made good with the universe that alcohol will never be a part of my life again.

The cravings are easy some days, hard others, but none of it is as bad as my life was getting, and the extent to which I deluded myself and others is shocking to me with a few weeks of clarity.

For those who think they need help, get it. I wish I could take back the year I spent fooling myself more than anything. But I’m sure as hell glad I didn’t wait another year.

I’m thankful I set aside my pride and am doing what is right for my wife and kids. I know it will get easier with more time away from the active disease, but today is hard. Wish me luck and IWNDWYT.",13

I just turned 31, I play sports and coach during the summer and I can put a good(enough) social face on when I have to. I don't drink when I go out, and that was honestly never my problem. I drink at home by myself, away from those who worry about me. For years I thought I wasn't hurting anyone, but as I'm sure a lot of you know, it's the absence that people start to notice..I have gone to rehab in the past and I've done my 12 steps and everything, I just can't seem to make it on my own. I have no knowledge of honestly being an adult, I can't save money, I can't even go to my sisters wedding because I always rationalize a reason to drink, and then I have no money to do anything, let alone go to a destination wedding. It's a nonstop struggle 

 I stop myself before my ""slips"" turn into what a lot of us know and hate. But I feel like I'm strangled everyday when I do drink, and when I don't..I haven't been truly happy for many MANY years and it's really noticable when I'm with friends and family. I feel permanently altered(and maybe I am). I just can't seem to kick the feeling of numb. I can't think of another word for it.

2019-11-25 15:08:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e1lt3o/not_always_smooth_but_still_sailing/,"Not always smooth, but still sailing...","About a year ago, after a Thanksgiving weekend bender, I decided to hang up my drinking cleats for good. I had been battling pretty hard with it for a few years. I would take extended breaks thinking I could reset my brain back to normal...and then once I started drinking again, I would quickly end up right where I had begun. I felt like a fish on a hook. Every time I tried to wriggle free, the hook just went in deeper.

So I decided to stop fighting and accept sobriety. My Mom had been diagnosed with lung cancer and I saw clearly that I could either face her challenge in a way that made me proud, or regret it for the rest of my life, and that I had to choose. There was no third way where I could handle this situation in a way that I can live with and also included drinking.  I understood for the first time that drinking any amount of alcohol at all separates me from my own personal values.

I still know that to be true. If I take a single drink, I'll become consumed by someone I don't like. I will split from my values and become what seems like a dual personality. One that says and does most of the right things, and one that's deviously maneuvering for his next drink all the time and doesn't much bother himself with things like 'ethics' or 'integrity'. The ""good"" part of me will be so distracted trying to manage the ""bad"" part of me's needs that I won't be present for anything. So I need to stay whole, I need to stay sober. I know how to do this. I am equipped to get through any social, family, or work situation without alcohol.

But the ""bad"" part of me (I use quotations because I don't really think it's morally wrong, it's just easier to explain that way) is still in there. I think when there are a lot of certain cues around, my mind throws a tantrum. I believe it has to do with some trauma. When triggered, I start to crave to disappear from the earth for a while. I don't want to die, I just want to not be here for a spell... and I want everything to be OK when I come back. When I was drinking, that's when it would get out of control - I would go to my private den at home with some booze and disappear for awhile. I would emerge blinking into the light, ashamed but also rid of that nagging sense of discontent.

Because I don't have that coping mechanism available, now I just feel angsty and discontent and....become impossible to be around? I want to pick fights, I yell in traffic, and roll my eyes at the slow store clerk, and make snide comments to my spouse while also expecting constant affection. I throw a slow motion passive aggressive tantrum.

I've been in that triggered state for a few days.  This morning while walking the dog, I realized how much growth I have yet to do. The start of the holiday season, coming up on my one year anniversary since my last drink, I'm seeing pretty clearly what my next step is.

I basically immediately fell back into picking up a 12 rack of PBR every day on my way home from work, moved in with a friend and gave up on my healthy diet and routine. After some serious self reflection, I decided to move away from Arizona up to Washington where my sister lives (my only family and also strongly encouraged the move) for a fresh start. 

I know it just sounds like I may have been running away from my problems, but my reason for being in Arizona was initially to help take care of my Mother. 3 months turned into 7 years, and after she passed in 2014 my drinking skyrocketed, thus driving my relationship to the inevitable divorce that I mentioned. 

Anyway, I finally made the step a second time and am halfway to meeting my previous record. For the first time in my life I feel like I can say that I could never drink again and be okay. 

This sub has a lot to do with finding the motivation, so I thank and commend you all.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Relapsed after 9 months, got divorced, quit my good job, moved out of state and finally sober again. Kay love you bye <3",2

I am back on the wagon now.  I hate losing sleep.  I’m not going to beat myself up but I will remind myself if I have a craving again to think about how my entire rest was ruined for a few hours of “enjoyment”, when really I didn’t enjoy myself at all.

I work in an office setting, and one of my coworkers is particularly moody, unpredictable and well… Just downright nasty at times. She is prone to bringing her moods and problems to work with her and then taking them out on other people. I am the newest administrative assistant in the department… So guess who that usually is. 

Anyway, when I was still drinking every day, she used to get me so upset with one of her condescending and unfair comments that I would be almost nonfunctional. I couldn’t think, couldn’t concentrate and if I touched something… You can pretty well guarantee that it was going to be done incorrectly. This, by the way… is not my normal way of being.  Naturally… those mistakes only set me up for another round of acid tongue lashing... I should mention that I’m not getting into trouble for mistakes that I have made. This is the type of person that will tell you to do something a certain way, and then two weeks later “move the goalposts“ and give you shit for doing something exactly like she told you to. 

I started noticing a couple of weeks in of not drinking that I was able to let her rudeness roll right off my back much better than before. She did it again to me this morning… And, while it still pissed me off… I was able to continue work without distraction and remain focussed. 

I consider this a major win and look forward to seeing more positive changes in the months to come.",22

Today is 29 days sober.  

My husband came home from work that morning.  He found me in bed, incapable of getting out of bed due to my legs not working properly.  Because of this I had soiled the bed.  He thought I must be on my period because there was blood everywhere.  He helped me to the bathroom and washed me in the tub before realizing that the blood was from my butt.  

Once clean he helped me out of the tub and managed to get my shirt on before I fell unconscious.  I wasn't breathing and he couldn't find a pulse.  He carried me to his truck and drove me to the hospital going 160km per hour so while doing chest compressions with his right hand.  In the 8 minutes to the hospital he said I only took 3 gasping breaths.  He drove across the lawn to get to the emergency bay faster.

Once there he wasn't allowed to be in the room while the nurses dealt with me.  He was freaking out when one of the nurses came 10 minutes later to say I was more responsive and told him ""You did good"" 

I was air lifted to the closest major hospital where I stayed in the ICU for 5 days.  I was delusional and couldn't hardly even lift my hips for them to place chamber pot under me for the first 2 days.  I had 6 different IV bags non stop for the first 2 days, 4 bags on the 3rd day, then down to 2 and finally only 1 on the last day.  They didn't let me eat for 2 and a half days and then it was just a liquid diet.  

On the third day I called a nurse at one point so I could try and stand on my own but wanted her there just in case I fell.  I managed to edge myself to the side of the bed, throw my legs over and stood for maybe 3 seconds before I had to sit down. Later that day I managed to walk the 5 steps (while a nurse held my arm) to the potty chair they'd brought into my room.  Before this, after the chamber pot, they'd bring the chair to the bedside and help me into it.  On the 4th day I again called a nurse thinking I might be able to walk the 5 steps on my own but wanted supervision just in case.  I couldn't do it.  After a single step I nearly collapsed.  I cried once I was back in bed.  

While in the hospital I had x-rays, blood and urine work, a CT scan, an endoscopy and a biopsy done.  I had major bruising (like black) all up my arms from the 7 IV lines they had in me for the 6 different bags and 1 to take blood from several times a day.  I had bed sores on both hips as well as bruising.  My platelet count was 9 when normal is above 140.  I gained 17 lbs in 5 days from the fluids they pumped in to me.  I was told that they didn't find anything with the endoscopy and that the CT scan showed my brain has already begun to shrink.  

I have lots more to share but I'm going to leave it at that for today.  Reliving everything is hard even if I'm only reliving parts of it through what my husband and the nurses told me.  Either way, scary shit 😔",11
2019-11-25 13:13:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e1k1fc/ive_decided_to_completely_give_up_alcohol_cw/,I’ve decided to completely give up alcohol (cw: sexual violence),"Hello, all you amazing, strong, and self-reflective people. Thank you for being such a supportive community!

After a lot of thinking, I decided I don’t see a benefit to myself when it comes to drinking, and it’s often a catalyst to bad situations. I never was a big drinker. I never blacked out, I never threw up, and I only drank at most once a month on average. So giving it up isn’t a big change. But earlier this year, I was assaulted by an alcoholic (and probably sociopathic) “friend” of mine. We were both intoxicated. He claimed after he’d “blacked out”, yet he also magically knew “bad things happened” so I knew that was bullshit. I know now that he’s done this multiple times to other women before. I think alcohol reduced my ability to know what to do right away, and made the situation worse. Though I also trusted him so the whole thing was shocking. I won’t go into details about what happened. Long story short, he plead guilty and got deported. However, if that had gone to trial, I would’ve been brutally cross-examined by his psychopathic lawyer and questioned about my drinking (and even more personal details). Alcohol somewhat absolves violent men of their responsibility, apparently, and gives women more responsibility for being a victim, apparently. Yes, it’s bullshit, but that’s the world we live in, and until that changes, I would just rather avoid alcohol. Moreover, I don’t think any of that would’ve happened in the first place had I been sober, so it’s not just about counteracting the judgment in a hypothetical trial. I’ve had other bad situations from alcohol, but nothing like that.

Our culture likes to shame people for not drinking. Even before this, I would often not drink at house parties where everyone else was, and people would make fun of me for it. I was never one to really succumb to peer pressure, but it’s still uncomfortable. This subreddit helps with that too. There are no physical health benefits to alcohol. And a lot of crime happens when the perp is intoxicated. I don’t remember the stat, but I think the majority of sexual assaults also involve alcohol. Alcohol is the most popular date rape drug, after all. I was never one to mix alcohol and sex, partly for that reason. Alcohol is expensive, too, especially at bars/restaurants. I’d rather spend that money on Krav Maga lessons or something. And regarding socializing with heavy drinkers, I’ve also read that half of all alcoholic men are sociopaths. I know substance abuse is common with them in general. So socializing with heavy drinkers also doesn’t seem beneficial. Really, I just don’t see the point of any of it.

Tl:dr: after being assaulted while both me and my attacker were intoxicated, I’ve decided to go completely sober.",3

Developed even worst alcoholism due to self-hatred, spent the last two years drinking my life away. Ready to stop drinking and looking for some support.  

&#x200B;

Hey, I have been a lurker on this sub for awhile and I think I am ready to share my story. I am active duty Air Force and I have struggled with alcoholism for the past three and half years. I moved to Turkey in May 2016 and the base I was stationed at had base restriction policy where none of the US military were allowed to leave the base. As you can imagine this bred a culture of partying and drinking while not working to let off steam. I would drink now and then as it was part of the culture and I could handle myself. Fast forward to April 2017 and I had just returned from my end of tour vacation around Europe with some of my co-workers, I can say my attitude about being there had changed from being happy to be doing my job to wanting to move to my next assignment as soon as possible. I started drinking to blackout daily and several times woke up in the shower with it blasting water in my face. It is now the first week of June 2017 and I got plastered and went to eat at the chowhall one of my mates drove me there and I don't even remember getting out of the car, all I remember is waking up with medics all around me and being taken outside where my supervisor picked me up and took me back to my room. I woke up at 3am that following day with true dread in my heart as I had now risked my assignments to Cyprus and then Japan. I got to work and was talked to and was told that I would have to go through alcohol education but would still have my assignments. I knew I had gotten off lucky but that luck lasted about a month, when I got into a huge verbal fight with one of my subordinates in the first week of July on a Friday. I went back to my room after work and got plastered again and messaged some suicidal ideation messages to one of my friend/co-workers, she called the police on me and I was taken to the base hospital and because this was my second alcohol related incident had now lost my assignments. I was diverted back stateside for alcohol treatment but all it did was make my alcoholism worst, I would drink about 400ml of tequila everyday after work and in the span of 1 and half fractured my pinks in both my hands, cut my head open, and brused my rib but was able to play it off as just being clumsy and that my dog tripped me several times (I am sure my office knew what was going on but didn't want to throw me under the bus). I would consistently be angry because I was mad that I had got myself sent back to the states and considered suicide more than a few times. I got another alcohol related incident in April 2019 and this would later screw me out of another set of orders in August of this year as I was told that I didn't have enough time of stability. After losing this latest set of orders back overseas I started drinking again and I am still miserable. I got drunk this past weekend and I spent all of Sunday trying to shake off my hangover, I wrote all of this to say that I am ready to stop drinking and get my life back together for myself. If you read all of this thank you and any advise would be much appreciated.",2

I need in person help. I do not feel like going to a therapist for now. I have a psychology background (2 degrees in it) so I will do it eventually yet I am seeking different help right now. The therapist client relationship will be something I tackle later.

However... I am a naturally skeptical person. I believe in God from a practical stance but I do not buy into magical thinking per say. 

Is AA a place for me? What worked for you if any of this sounds similiar to your situation?

My wife was sooo surprised to see me coming to bed at the same time as she was. I’ve only been a part of this community for a few weeks but it’s had such a positive effect on me. I’ve cut my days of drinking down by 60 percent (i love excel sheets) so far. And i can’t believe I didn’t get drunk last night after those social beers when there really wasn’t anything stopping me.

I took as much time as I needed to be all the way sure, fought some hard fights inside my head and played the tape way forward. Like all the way, until the very end.

And then, I did it. 

I told my wife I'm not a drinker anymore. What a freaking relief. She is the only one so far, but the big one. I seriously feel like I can start being the real me, right now, today. 

So, why is this such a big freaking deal?

Everyone I know who tries to stop drinking has this very real primal fear of being cast out of the tribe, not fitting in. What about all the friends and social life, and nights out? And in the case of my very long and happy marriage, What About Us?? 

I got so deep in my head with that, I was ready to go live alone on an island, even if I had to build the damn island first. Thankfully that may not be the needed, but I had to look it right in the eye. It was scary. 

The only real answer at the end of some hard inner conversations, was that I don't know what will happen at all, can't control  it, but I'm going to live my truth anyway. I just can't take it anymore! was the loud, underlying cry. 

I knew from childhood that I was not a drinker. Never liked getting wasted, never went to a single bar until I was in my mid 20s, and even then not often at all. 

I grew up around dysfunctional marriage all the way up the family tree and hated seeing what it did to people who were supposed to have my back. I knew better. I know better. 

But somewhere along the way, I normalized it, and took one big step off my own path. Guess what, screw that. I'm back. 

Admitting I'm not really a drinker is like saying I'm not really down with the way the world sees me, and finding the courage (word of the day!) to come out loud and proud. Maybe I have some closeted non drinkers in the mix, waiting for a sign that it's safe. Maybe my people will still love me anyway. 

I really feel for anybody who has ever had to make a stand against a religion, prejudice or other expectation in their own inner circle. This stuff is hard, people. But so worth doing. 

Even my very conservative side of the family is pretty damn liberal with the wine, every day including Sunday. They may think this is just as weird as me quitting milk and meat when I was fourteen. Honestly that kind of still freaks them out. 

But, whatever. I'm doing this anyway.

yesterday I convinced myself it was okay to drink and that I’d be proving something to myself to drink responsibly. In my hubris I thought bc of how “easy” it was for me to go 27 days that it was okay to drink responsibly, like it was what I should strive to be able to do. 

I had 3 beers over the course of three hours at a party and now all my progress is just wiped away. To me I consider this drinking responsibly but that doesn’t make it worth it. For people like me there’s no point to drink in general other than to escape. I guess I just had to see for myself that it’s not worth it to drink, even responsibly. 

Today would’ve been day 28.

Now it’s day 0.

ITS NOT WORTH IT TO BE ABLE TO DRINK RESPONSIBLY. it’s just not. What kind of delusional thinking is that anyway?

Long story short - it was overall a fantastic year. My social life constricted some, but I lost weight, was healthy, more productive, not broke all of the time, etc.

I actually kept it up through March of this year.

Then, I started back. Very slowly. I told myself I could control myself and keep it from getting as bad as it was. I could have a happy hour drink every few days and be fine. 

It started off that way. But fast forward 8 months - Over the past few weeks I've been drunk at ""my"" bar pretty much every other night. I've picked up a really nasty coke habit when I'm drinking. I only smoke cigarettes when I drink - and I'm smoking about a pack a day.

Anyway, it's time to start again. I find it's easier for me to quit if I tell myself it's not forever - so I'm not telling myself I'll never drink again. But I also have proven to myself I can't do this responsibly.

So here we are. Glad to be part of this community again.

So I've been reading other posts about people stopping and some posts are about violence, police, drama with relationships and family.

I like to stay healthy, only drink water and milk, sometimes juice or unsweetened tea but if I have soda it's always with alcohol.

I put a lot of hours into my body at the gym (I got 5-6 days a week), but my friends and I always wanna get a drink for happy hour. 1 turns into 2, 2 turns into 4, and 4 turns into 8. And sooner than later I drank my entire day a way.

Yes, I have fun and safe when I do it. BUT it's the feeling the next day or that night I hate. I feel like I'm physically putting poison into my body. I'll deal with the hangover. I don't feel I'm addicted cause I don't drink everyday mostly weekends but I don't want to waste my weekends drunk, hungover and sick anymore.

He recently expressed the tiniest bit of regret over some seasonal beer he’s missing out on. I get it, feel guilty as hell, wish he’d give himself a pass, worry I’ll feel resentful or slip up if he does. Anyone relate?","First off, I was pissed when my husband decided not to drink just because I wasn’t. Lots going on there. My drinking was an issue between us and it was hard enough for me to admit it was a problem, hard enough to be responsible for my own sobriety. I didn’t ask for his help, didn’t need his damn help. But once I stopped fighting it (and him, and myself) so hard, I really came to appreciate it. And appreciate him. 

He recently expressed a little regret when he saw this year’s Mad Elf release. It was something we used to look forward to every Christmas. It’s been a couple of years since we stopped drinking, so it’s not like this is the first holiday without it. But, yeah, I get it. That little pang still hits me from time to time. A lot less often and a lot less painfully than it used to, but I totally understand. 

I’ve been thinking about having a conversation with him about how he should have some if he wants. That I feel strong in my sobriety and while I appreciate his support so much, I don’t need it to remain sober. 

I truly believe that...but what if I’m wrong? We keep beer and wine in the house for guests and it’s never been an issue for me. I can be around others who drink without feeling resentful. But what if his support (and abstinence) play a bigger role than I realize?

Couldn’t figure out why I couldn’t lose weight. I mean, I was eating salads, going gluten free/fat free/paleo/whole 30/etc.  I never ate “bad” foods. My treat was beer!

So to put everything into perspective, let’s say I’d have a pound of wings and four pints of beer. Gluten free, right?  No sugar there!  One pint of beer is roughly 200 calories. Multiply that by four, add the wings, and I’ve blown my calorie intake for the day. 

A couple beers a night?  No problem. Tack on an extra 400+ calories to your day. 

Now, I couldn’t care less for the stuff. I’ve been slightly deviating (okay, majorly deviating) from diet and exercise lately. Still no alcohol. I’ve indulged in bowls of ice cream, popcorn, pieces of cake, etc. Haven’t gained a damn pound. 

I was trying to wrap my head around all this when I spoke with my dad. Major heavy drinker for his whole life (he’s in his 70’s now). Recently quit. Spoke about how he’s enjoying a dessert after dinner, got a box of donuts the other day. He’s lost over 30 lb, just from giving up his daily beers.

Without my regular drinking, I’m maintaining my weight loss. I’m happier and more active. I can indulge in things I usually don’t (sweets, lattes, etc). I don’t waste a whole day hungover or feeling like shit (two beers will do this to me now). My calories are saved for yummy things. 

Today I plan on going out for lunch. Won’t be having a pint, as I would usually do when I’m not driving and not working for the day. Nope. I’m treating myself to whatever I want. This may end up being a croissant and coffee, whatever works. 

It just makes sense :)

This is my third attempt at sobriety---six weeks of white-knuckle dry-drunk ""sobriety"" seven years ago, followed by a nine-week stint earlier this year that crumbled as soon as I got back into the old environment.

This time, I'm trying something different by reaching out. Keeping it to myself is too much work. My wife says, ""You can drink, you just have to control yourself."" She drinks maybe a beer per year, so she doesn't get it. (Of course, she's happy when I don't drink!) I read the stories on here, and there are plenty of people in the same situation. So I'll reach out to you guys.

Three weeks is enough to feel some positive changes---my body is healing and my mind is clearing. In my day-to-day life, it's pretty easy to avoid drinking, but the weekends are a different story. I'm reading through the ""quit-lit"" canon to keep my mind focused and free of illusions.

So far, the main kind of dangerous thought I've gotten is, ""Sure, you feel ragged after a night out, but you had a lot of fun with friends. It's normal in life to feel ragged, so you might as well laugh it off."" But I have to remember that feeling after 8-12++ beers is not ""normal."" The fun stops somewhere well before 10 beers and it all becomes a blur. The blur can become something unpredictable and dangerous: ""undesired consequences,"" as I read earlier today.

I have a tendency to fantasize this intoxicated state as a ""different level of consciousness"" or some other bullshit. Maybe it was at some point in the past, but it's definitely not these days. That understated and subtle part of me goes away when I'm drunk and is replaced with a shouting, spitting blowhard. I'm not drinking today, and that's the level I'm working on right now.",9

Either I’m suffering from PAWS or I have a newfound clarity that’s given me a different take on my husband. He’s not a heavy drinker but hasn’t stopped drinking. The new feeling is that I’ve lost him. I used to turn to alcohol to find closeness with him. We’d open a bottle of wine with dinner or sip a G&T together.  Now I think that feeling wasn’t closeness, just numbing. Whatever it was I can’t find him any more. This is scary. After 39 years.",7

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hidey-Ho, there neighbors! It's Thanksgiving Week, so we know what that means... Gratitude! One of my delightful old redneck friends I met in a program likes to say, with a big wad of tobacco pushing out the right side of his lip, ""If I ain't got gratitude, I got at-ti-tuuuude. Gotta put tha' 'G' in attitude. Ya' know that 'G' is God, right? Gotta be grateful.""

I'm not really a religious person, but I can hear what he's saying and take a moment to be grateful for my sobriety. I am one of the lucky ones that I was able to get sober and stop drinking before it stopped the rest of my life. Whatever floats his and your sober boats. :) Happy day, friends!",79

I’m the type of person who gets mean and violent when I’ve drank in excess. One particular night I had been drinking all day, and was absolutely wasted. Probably starting at around 9am and the incident occurred at around 10:30pm. I was in full on rage mode. My husband, who does not drink, and I got into a HUGE fight over it. I had already attacked him, punching him in the face several times. Things escalated and I ended up grabbing a knife and cutting his throat. Luckily, the knife was very dull and only gave him a superficial wound, but it did bleed. I was obviously arrested and taken to jail. I was charged with a 1st degree felony. Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon with the intent to cause serious bodily injury. I spent 53 days in county before I was able to get my bond reduced to an amount that allowed me to get out. I’m now going through the court process. I worked in the dental field for 10 years, was an insurance agent for 3 and all of it is gone now. I’ll be a felon and unable to get a decent job. I’m 33. I lost custody of my son.  All of this because I wanted to get drunk. I never thought I would EVER do anything like this. It isn’t me. I am posting this because I hope this can be a warning to stop before you get yourself in serious trouble. It isn’t worth it. You aren’t the same person when you drink and you will live with the consequences of your actions while under the influence. Please don’t be like me. I felt like I had to get this out because it’s been weighing heavy on me lately. I have nightmares all the time. Get help if you need it. I wish I would’ve when I had several chances before any of this happened.",103

Another day sober, another amazing experience…

My Sundays used to be all about the “hair of the dog”. Now they’re about taking a day off work and spending it with my lovely girlfriend.

I now wake up at 6, without a hangover, and do something fun for the day. Photography, bike riding, whatever!

Guys, I don’t tell you this to brag…I tell you this because when you give up alcohol, great things start to happen.

Listen…

Out of all the people I used to drink with, you’d look at me and think “He’s gonna have a SERIOUS problem one day”…

Well, they were right.

If I had continued drinking, I have no idea how far I would have gone.

I’m almost certain I would have ended up dead…

Luckily, I recognised I had a serious problem.

I gave up the booze and started working on myself instead.

I’m 452 days sober now, and these amazing experiences didn’t come in my first few months.

They have only come because I have had a good amount of sobriety under my belt, which has meant I can spend time building my life, rather than destroying it.

Guys, my message to you today is to hang in there. Hang in there because it truly gets better and better.

Hang in there for your family

Hang in there for your friends

Hang in there to inspire others in these excellent communities

But most importantly, hang in there for YOURSELF

If you in you’re first few days, weeks or months, do whatever it takes to hang in there…

Post in this group, speak with someone that understands your problems, read one of those amazing quit drinking books (Allan Carr’s is my favourite)

…Just do whatever it takes…

You can finally put the DESTRUCTION behind you and start CREATING a worthwhile and meaningful life.

You can start creating a life worth living - not one you need to run away from with alcohol.

Guys, just hang in there… and keep it up.",91

Back then, I lost my voice nearly every day, and I could no longer sing to my kids at night. I’d wake up all times of the night with terrible throat and chest pain, and bending over to pick up an item from the floor led to the horrible sensation that I was “passively” throwing up. 

Omeprazole has played an important part in helping with many of the physical complaints, but in the years since I’ve still gotten pummeled by respiratory and stomach ailments every year, and I’m usually the first in the house to get it.

I'm the reason the rest are gone. There's not much in my life I wouldn't trade away.  The entire circumstance has grown foul, sober or not.  

Long before this current sobriety I stopped going to parties.  Music is my life and I stopped going to shows. I stopped making an effort,  as a test, to see who is gonna try to stay in my life. 1 person genuinely has my back, and while a drinker herself, is pretty thrilled to see me go down this road. I was pretty dead set on doing a certain thing, playing music, but the reality is that's not going to get me where I need to be in life.  Not on time anyway. I still nerd out over my favorite bands but I just dont base a social life on it. I'm not involved in my local scene anymore. It was sucking the life out of me. So I'm focusing right now on just improving my body, mind, spirit and attitude for the journey to come, but most importantly,  in the face of the ugly truth I am free. These associations and attachments were shackles. I have nothing but a roof and a job to lose and the world to gain. I have no kids, no pets, and a cold distant toxic family. I can devote my life to whatever I want. I think you see where I'm going with this. 

The biggest hang up I had about getting started with a program has been how radical of a change it requires, how uncool or square I might be perceived as, and chiefly, the surrender of control to a higher power. I lost my friends and my arrogance and through some crazy experiences I now firmly believe in a higher power.

There's a meeting close to me tomorrow.  I'm going,  I'm drinking the kool aid, I'm starting the program, finding a sponsor and working the steps. I can't afford rehab so it's the best shot I e got.

When does that start?  I’ve struggled with weight loss all my adult life.  With concentrated effort, I’ve gone from 230 to 180ish several times.  One of the things I keep telling myself is, “at least stopping drinking will make losing weight easier”.  So far, no so much.  However, I’ve always been the type person that unless I’m counting calories, I won’t lose weight.  I drank in the most minimally caloric way possible which means I went from beer to straight liquor with Diet Coke a long time ago.  Needless to say, quarter bottles of hard liquor every night speeded my downward spiral.

Don’t get me wrong.  I’m 30 days sober and very happy about the life change.  I struggle with anxiety days when I want a drink to “calm myself”.  Today was one of those days.  My drinking was almost always when I got home from a stressful day at work.  I’d drink to the verge of blackout, take a handful of Advil, and then drink copious amounts of water every time I’d wake up to try and avoid the inevitable hangover.  I LOVE not being hungover.  I choose to wake at 4AM and start my workday early so I’ll be exhausted and pass out (alcohol free) in the evening and avoid my temptation hours.

Sorry for the rambling.  I appreciate this sub and the stories here.  Whenever I’m struggling, I head here and it gets me through another day, or hour, or 5 minutes.  Thanks for the community.  For me, it’s making all the difference.  IWNDWYT.",6

I didn’t really enjoy it cause I was obsessing over it, analyzing the way it made me feel and just feeling guilty. The dream moved on and I ended up at a bar a while later, where I was offered some shots. Apparently in dream world you get wasted off of a beer and 2 shots spaced out by a few hours. But anyways I got pretty tipsy, and I felt guilty. I remember feeling really good and euphoric. I’m a big fan of This Naked Mind, and remembered the book suggesting that if you drink, to really analyze and process and think about the way you feel. So the whole time I was dream drinking, it felt like I was taking mental notes about my reaction to alcohol which was pretty cool. At first I had a nice buzz, felt pretty euphoric after a few shots. The original beer awakened my craving and made me accept the shots. I felt high and really nice, but it was all on top on guilt for breaking my sobriety. I was kind of devastated. Thinking about 7 months down the drain for this light headed spinny feeling?!? What a waste. And then I got the spins really bad and fell on the sidewalk. And after I sobered up, I felt like shit. I had a headache, and I was lower than I had felt in months all for a 20 minute buzz brought on by literal poison. I just remember thinking about how guilty and physically shitty I felt. No energy, my head hurt, I was thirsty and hungry for greasy unhealthy food, and I still wanted another drink even though 3 had just ruined my night. I knew I was gonna be hungover as fuck in the morning. I came across a drunk girl on the sidewalk, tried to help her walk home. She ended up getting into her car and wrecking it like 5 times on the residential streets. What a strange awesome dream. I’m almost 7 months sober, but I’ve been having sobriety/using related dreams for quite a while. The subconscious is a powerful thing. I highly recommend This Naked Mind to anyone struggling to quit, it helps you realize alcohol is the enemy and not your friend that you’re going to miss dearly. I very rarely have a desire to drink, and when I do I think about it critically, and realize I don’t ACTUALLY want to drink, I want to relax,  I want to fit in and feel more comfortable, I’m bored or I fear I’m missing out.... all of which have solutions that don’t involve drinking poison all night long.... This Naked Mind works so damn well, you’ll use the tools from the book in your dreams!!! If only I had broken down my original urge for the beer and dissected my alcohol craving like I do in real life..... Maybe I would have done something fun and wild in my dream instead of drinking!!!

Today, we went to church and then had brunch.  After that we went and picked up a few items from the grocery store.  

When I was drinking, I would have a hangover in church and would have to go to the bathroom immediately after eating food.  I also didn't want my husband to go to the grocery store with me so I can hide my wine in my bag.

I went to Lowes and looked at all the lovely and beautiful Christmas decorations.  

We we got back home and I went to the gym...came home and raked/bagged leaves.  

I listened to my 6 year old neighbor tell me a story that made me laugh.  She also came outside with her child-sized rake and offered to help me...she's so sweet.  

I then made the mac n chz for Thanksgiving and enjoyed sparkling grape juice in a fancy crystal champagne flute.

I washed all the dishes and cleaned my bathroom.  I never did all of these in one day...especially on a Sunday when I was drinking.

Everything is getting more clear to me now.

The constant comments about why you're not drinking at the Christmas parties? 

'Why not have one glass to celebrate?'...'You're too young to have a problem with alcohol' (I'm 27 - I've had plenty of years to develop an issue).   

I just end up finding myself irritated that people think it's their business to enquire why I don't conform to what they consider to be the norm. Just let me enjoy my diet coke in peace and let's talk about something else.  But in today's society, if you aren't drinking, you stick out.  Whats wrong with you tends to be the look I get all the time.  

But I'm dressed up to the nines to enjoy an evening out but find myself dodging questions left right and centre & eventually it always ruins my night and I leave early.  I leave because I find myself wanting to just shout the reasons why I don't drink.  Blurting out in detail why alcohol has almost ruined my life many times over, then they would understand..

Alcoholism took my father from me 3 weeks after I turned 13.  He was one year sober almost to the date and he died from multi system organ failure following a surgery in an attempt to fix his liver failure.  He went into a coma and I couldn't speak to him or say goodbye.  For him it was too late even after making the decision to change his life.  I decided this year that I would make that change for myself. To put my future first and put alcohol behind me. 

Alcoholism is in my family.  My grandpa goes to AA 4 times a week, he barely speaks when he's there. He just goes to remind himself why he abstains every day.  For some of us it's a struggle we will have to battle every day for the rest of our lives.  Other than him, there is no-one else who I can speak to about my struggles so I'm hoping to find some support here! 

But of course, I don't really speak to anyone about the above.  People always seem to get uncomfortable, they haven't experienced anything like I have before.  Alcohol doesn't affect them the same way.  They look like they wish I hadn't told them so in day-to-day life, I tend to keep my reasons to myself and they are what keeps me going every day but it is tough not being able to speak to anyone about it.  

I would appreciate any tips on how to handle this for this year as I've moved to a new city & that means a whole group of people asking questions!  Thank you in advance.",6

I don’t know why this always happens, I’ve done this loop so many times.  It seems like I’m incapable of controlling my drinking.  I’ve gone cold turkey before, that I can execute.  But trying to enjoy one or two and show restraint is much harder

I’ve recently entered a new relationship that I really want to invest in for the long term.
This weekend I became horribly drunk and missed a dinner plan with this person.  The next day I apologised and they told me they don’t want to be around me when I drink, they don’t want me to message or call them.

It’s a clear sign to me that...  the problem I have is bigger than I thought.  And I am incapable of showing restraint so I just need to go cold turkey again.

When I am sober, it is really mostly only the kind parts that manifest - and that's down to *me*. My own hard work and values.

~

Like Jekyll and Hyde, I had split myself in two. I thought that drunk-me was better (more free, more fun etc) than sober-me, but I'm realising now that the things I like about my drinking self can all still be there when I'm not drinking - and without the side effects.

I was always a scared kid. Discovering alcohol in my late teens was so liberating: to learn that I could make myself relax, that I had opinions about things and people were interested to hear what I had to say, and that I'd no longer feel so acutely self-conscious in social situations. I was amazed that I could literally lose my mind - lose all of those anxious, negative thoughts - and just relax in the present moment.

I preferred the cool, relaxed version of myself that had had a drink or two, and I've spent a decade relying on alcohol to feel like an interesting person.

Anyway. I love live music and last night I went into town to a gig by myself. I'm a small woman and a fan of metal/hardcore/etc and I used to drink to feel, I don't know, brave enough, to go to gigs where I felt so different from everyone. Last night I was anxious in a kind of existential way, and I thought I might have a drink to calm me. But then I remembered last month and all the shit I said and did after planning to have ""just one drink"", and so I decided not to risk it.

I've been practicing mindfulness on and off for half a year and last night I used those techniques like I previously used alcohol. I was able to relax. I could hear and see more details than I normally do at gigs. I had good conversations with some friends there. Seems I've learned enough over the years to be able to drop the crutch of alcohol. I didn't drink to lose my mind as usual; instead I stayed sober, observed and appreciated the full sensory experience of the music.

I don't need to obliterate my mind with alcohol in order to enjoy myself. I don't need to risk ending up on a wild path of destruction. Instead I can mindfully, consciously bring out the parts of me that I like, and to carefully protect myself and others from any Mr Hyde aspects that might want to come out.

When I drink I can be good, kind, fun, melodramatic, a flight risk, scary, wrathful... When I am sober I am much better at addressing the negative feelings before they become too much of a problem.

I am good, kind and fun. I am better off without alcohol.

I’ve been sober since August 2015. Last night, my wife and I went to my good buddies birthday at a pub. Now, I have been lucky to be able to be comfortable going to pubs or any place with a lot of booze and not really feel tempted. 

I was enjoying a non-alcoholic beer, finished it and asked for another from the waitress (my buddies sister) She was super busy and frazzled, seeing she had only been there a few days. She came back with a bottle that looked very similar and I was busy talking to friends. I just picked it up and took a sip. It tasted awful, I thought it was bad. 

Turns out it was a regular beer. I had a moment of panic but realized she had made a mistake and told her that there was alcohol in it. She fixed it (she melted down, I’ve known her for years and she knows I’m sober). Everything was fine for the rest of the night, had one more non-alcoholic beer and went home for the night. My wife asked if I was melting down, which I wasn’t.

Move over to today, I am still fine but my irrational brain keeps sneaking in thoughts that I messed up my sobriety. I know, this isn’t true but it’s still a sneaking thought. It’s something that will go away, I’m sure.

I went through the withdrawals and stuff with medical help, and I'm happy to report that as if this moment I feel fantastic and really don't feel the need to drink at all.  So that's great.

Here's what I am struggling with, though, and I'm wondering if anyone else has struggled with this.

I've been dating an amazing woman for about 2 years.  But now that I don't have a foggy, alcohol controlled brain, I'm starting to have some realizations.  Some if the things she says and does... I don't know, she just seems like a mean person who doesn't really care about what I went through and says things that, in the past I may have found funny- but now just seem uncalled for.  Just leaves me scratching my head.  Maybe she has always been that way and in my 24/7 drunken stupor I accepted it as a good thing.

So has anybody else experienced anything like that post-sobriety?  I love her, I want to marry her eventually.  Maybe it's my feelings being affected by what my brain is going through?  Just looking for some advice.  Thanks guys, IWNDWYT.",18

Over the past few weeks, I really don't think my wife has any idea what I've gone thru, and how I feel like her and others have provided zero support.

Like I said, I'm fine, but it would be nice to have other options than to be trapped at the in-laws during an all day drink fest that will pretty much go on from Thursday till Sunday, because 'it's family'.

I was constantly drunk or hungover. A couple years ago, on days like today I'd still be in bed nursing a hangover, trying to piece together the previous night's events, looking anxiously through my phone to see who I called/texted during my blackout, and planning to order greasy food to make myself feel somewhat better.

As the title suggests this is me returning to the page and sobriety after a bit of a hiatus. With this page, meetings, and self determination I successfully went a month sober. Which doesnt sound like much, but for me it was the longest I'd been sober in over a decade. 

The problem was that I slipped up and didnt hold myself accountable. I went from a month sober, to a few drink every few nights, to I cant remember the last time I didnt get black out drunk quicker than I could of imagined. Some people can controle their drinking. I am not one of them. The alcoholic in me is out of control, and always will be. Me getting a handle on this requires complety sobriety. No more half in half out I can control it mentality, because it will never work.

Through alcohol my life has become completly unmanageable. I'm usually waiting for the hangover to slow enough to start drinking. I know if I continue like this I will never see my thirtieth birthday. Happy for the first 24hrs, but if I remember correctly it's going to get rough for abit after this. But it has to happen, so it will happen.

I also have a prescription from my doctor for another condition for benzodiazepines but I don’t want to take those every night because they can be habit-forming and are linked to long-term cognitive issues.

I’m wondering if anyone out there has encountered similar issues and if so, if you found anything that helped.

Edit: I’m also not sure if this matters but when I have tried to sleep, I’ve been lucid dreaming more. I typically have 1-2 instances of lucid dreaming a year but I have had 2 just in the last 3 weeks.

I read this subreddit at least 3-4 times a day the first few months, and it helped a ton.   I needed to be in a community where people are sharing the same issues I was going through.   As the months went on, I found myself just peaking in from time to time.   But as I come to an end to almost my 2 year sober mark.  I just wanted to reach out and say thank you to all the dedicated members of this forum.

693 days from alcohol today, and I honestly don't even think of it anymore.   I did not use AA, I read the book This Naked Mind and quit.  I was pretty bad, so I did see an outpatient addiction specialist for the first few months and was prescribed meds so I wouldn't have a seizure.

 Some background, I was not just some light drinker that was able to quit because I had a few light beers on the weekend.   I was a ""when I wake up till I go to sleep"" whiskey drinker daily for over 6 years, before then I was a just drink after work after night guy and in my teenage-mid twenties range I was a weekend drinker.     

For me, it was a gradual thing that eventually just took a hold of me and I think that's key.   If you think you might have a problem, catch it while it's early and don't let it end you up in the hospital shaking on a bed or having to wake up at 2am to do a shot of whiskey just to keep the shakes in bay so you can go back to sleep.

A couple months ago, I was living in a different town at the peak of my self-destruction. I was drinking 4-5 nights a week, if not more. Sometimes I would drink 20 ounces of liquor in a night. I was doing cocaine most of those nights too, sometimes mixed with other substances like mdma or mushrooms. I was really, really not in a good place mentally. I ended up moving, for unrelated circumstances, and used the change in scenery to quit doing drugs (10+ weeks drug free!). I've still been drinking, but 1-2 times a week. Usually only a few beers, sometimes I would binge and get really drunk.

I just went 6 days without drinking. That isn't the norm for me. That's a win. I've been working on myself and re-evaluating my mental state more this week than I have at any point in my adult life. That's a win. I had some drinks last night and I didn't ruin my life. It was really the best case scenario for drinking: had a good time with friends, watched some movies and ate some pizza. I went to sleep, woke up a few hours later with a dry mouth and a general sense of being unwell and thought - ya, that was as good as it could get for drinking and it still wasn't worth it. I'm sitting here with a headache today, having woken up a little later than usual. When I think about how last night played out, the alcohol didn't add anything to the experience that sparkling water wouldn't have accomplished better. So ya, I'm not getting mad or down on myself. I'm still working hard to find a good lifestyle for me after years of being a party girl. It's a process, there's gonna be hiccups. I'm doing miles better for myself than I was even a few months ago.

4. Dreams are so vivid and interesting that I kind of look forward to sleeping every night just for that.
5. Sleep has been really good.

(Sorry if this got too long too read - I just had to get it out)","Last sunday I woke up prepared to NOT start the morning with 5 shots of liquor and a cup of coffee.  


I had been drinking way too long and way too much. Every day. I hated myself for drinking but couldn't see how to it was possible to stop. I had tried to stop before, but I couldn't remain sober. Every time I tried, it felt a little bit harder... And now it seemed impossible. But I wanted to stop. I needed it! I knew that I had to pour every drop of alcohol down the drain - Several bottles Liqour, boxes of wine and a case of beer, it all ended in the sink saturday night. Except for one Christmas Ale my wife had bought for me to enjoy. This went down my own drain.  


I poured my coffee - Smiling to myself ""This is a new era"". Immidiately I started sweating and while trying to control my breath I closed my eyes. Reminding myself that I had to stop and why. Health, wife, children. I'm not a churchgoer but I know the power of praying. So I prayed in silence for the above mentioned. I opened my eyes and finished my coffee. We were going to my mother in laws 72th birthday and the thought that I knew I was going to be offered beer and wine, made me anxious again. I tried to plan my response ahead. ""Just shake your head politely, say no thanks and raise your cup of coffee"".  


My father in law had been hospitalized last summer for drinking too much. His liver count was rocket high and he was told never to drink again. But he has slowly begun. Not much, maybe a beer or two a day. But what to do ... It's his choice. He greeted me with a beer before I could grab a cup of coffee - And it felt soooo good in my hand. I immidiately started sweating and hyperventilating. I wanted to open the can and smack it down in two seconds. I took a deep breath, found a chair and put the beer on the table. Unopened. Now every time I was offered a new beer I pointed at it. Showing that I had a beer. I couldn't tell I had stopped drinking. I was embarrased somehow. Not that I wanted to stop, but the fact that it was such a struggle.  


I was smiling so hard when we left the party late at night. I had resisted every tempting toxics I had been offered and I knew that when I came home I would be safe.  


I didn't sleep too well that night, but I woke up without the usual hangover! The morning played out pretty much the same as the morning before. Anxiety, sweating, hyperventilating,  praying. I got through the day but at night I turned to reddit, you guys at r/stopdrinking, writing this  


*"" 2 days sober and my head is exploding.*

*It feels like my brain is too big for my skull. I can't focus or stop hyperventilating. My heart is racing.*  
*I try to be calm - Writing this helps.*

*2 days ago I cleared the house of all alcohol. A thing I have never done before when wanting to stop. I thought I could control it, but I've come to realize that I can't. It's both sad and liberating. I know what must be done.*

*I pray. I pray for tomorrow. For waking up sober.""*  


You offered good advice and I read a lot of your posts. I went to bed not drinking.  
The headache continued all week. It came crashing in waves - And the cravings for alcohol were strong. I wanted to go to the nearest liquor department and buy ... ""Just ONE beer"" my brain begged. ""Just one - You can handle it"" But deep down I knew I couldn't - Not now not ever. I said it out loud to myself for the first time   


""You're an alcoholic. Like your father was, like your grand father was. Your mother died by an OD on a roof. Her mother died drinking. Your recently discovered half brother a drug addict. It's in your genes.""  


Tuesday - I went to the gym for the first time in a year. I ran 3.5 km/2.17 mi. Woop woop! I was sooo proud.  


I stayed away from buying any alcohol and made it to wednesday where I took my kids to Scout meeting. I had promised to give a helping hand that evening, and had really feared how I would be able to keep my drinking hidden. But as I was not drinking, this was not a problem I had to deal with and I enjoyed every single minute of the meeting. Nobody knew why I was smiling as hard as I were - But I was so proud and reliefed. I cherrised the love for my kids and that I could be a part of them.    


Thursday I went to the gym again -  I had to prove I could do something and get immidiate satisfaction.  I knew my legs would hurt for days but every step I would take would be a step towards sobriety. I ran 7km/4.35mi. (Mixed walking). Almost collapsed but extremely proud.  


Friday. Experiencing big bodily changes. Especially when going to the toilet in the morning. The poop is solid! Ha! Imagine that this can be thing to be joyous for. But I can actually go to the toilet without exploding diarrhea.  
I used to visit a local brewery every friday. Drinking way too much high vol. draft beer, walk home, drink some more and pass out. This friday I stayed home. Cooked a good family dinner and enjoyed the evening with tea and lots of popcorn. It helped my urge to *treat* myself. And I came to the conclusion that it was much better to eat popcorn than drinking. So no bad conscious. It was still hard not to drink though, especially when a near and dear friend texted me a photo. It was a picture of him sitting at home drinking a dark beer followed by a ""cheers mate"". I had to do several long breaths that day.  


Saturday went ok. Except for the ongoing head ache waves and cravings. Popcorn is a new friend. One which I will have too see a little less of in the future. But for now the aquintance is good.  


Sunday - Today. My seventh sober day. I had to go supermarket to buy groceries. As you walk through the store there is no way that you can avoid the liqour section to get to the register and I was hell bend on walking past it, preferable with my eyes closed. But I stopped and glanced. Red wine, white wine, light beer, dark beer - All my old favorite friends!. ""Toxic friends."" I reminded myself. ""Move along"". I was about to move when I saw some christmas draft. Not much alcohol, lots of sugar. Something even kids can have a sip at for Christmas. I grabbed a six pack ""This is not dangerous"" I told myself and began to walk.  


There was a line at the register so I stepped into the queue as no. 3. When I was no. 2 I stepped out the line again. Turned my cart and went back to liquor section. Looked at all my old friends and whispered ""Here is one more to play with"" I then grabbed the six pack from my cart and placed it where I took it.  


Grabbed some microwave popcorn on the way back to the register and smiled the whole way home.  


I am now at home... Still having a head ache, but a very mild one. Still have cravings but knows how to deal with them. Still anxious for tomorrow but know that I can find peace in praying for my life, wife and children.  


In two weeks I will be going to a concert with a group of friends. There will be dinner and lots of alcohol before the concert - Other than taking one day, maybe even just an hour at a time. This will be my next big challenge.  


Thank you all for sharing your stories of struggles and success. You are the best!",24

I can stomach not drinking, the physical desire is usually nil to none, but I so crave the feeling of escape that drinking brings. It just makes all my problems go away for a moment, only to come back ten fold I know but, short term gain, long term pain is my currently MO I guess. Which is some backward ass way of thinking! 

For some background: 31M. Been drinking heavily since my divorce four years ago but never really had a healthy relationship with alcohol. Child of an alcoholic father. Identify as part of the LGBTQ community. Diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and bipolar2 and on medication for the above as well as in therapy. Active job, outdoorsy. Have few to no hobbies, sadly, I’m just at a loss for them currently. 

So I’m just wondering how people got over this extreme, for me, urge and seeming need. I’ve long thought I’m simply hell bent on destruction, and maybe some of that is true, but currently I’m really struggling with the desire for escapism. Just to get the hell out of my world and into a different, number one. 

Any advice is very welcome. IWNDWYT as hard as it already seems to be. Damn.",4

I definitely found it harder to glide into the atmosphere and dance, and my brain wasn't desensitized to suppress feeling self-conscious, but it just took longer than usual. Eventually I was *in it* and instead of being in a haze, **I was present**. 

As I sat in a cab driving home in the middle of the night, I reflected. Normally I’d be dizzy, falling asleep, maybe nauseous, and I’d wake up the next day having forgotten much of the night. This time I will remember. I’ll remember how the smoke passed through the beams of light emanating from the ceiling, and how the vibrations of the music reverberated in my bones, and I'll remember having this wonderful experience with my friends.

When I think back to every enjoyable concert I've attended plastered, all I have is the memory that I had fun. The rest is a complete blur. I nearly cried near the end of the concert thinking about this very thing. Joyful tears. I just wanted to share for anyone that needs it.",7

But even though I didn’t enjoy it, I couldn’t stop. I was bored, and so I drank, but I did pretty much exactly what I would have done if I had not drunk. I watched a film and listened to some music. Except, I’m pretty sure I would not have cried if I had been sober, and that I would have slept better (woke up at half 4 and couldn’t get back to sleep for 2 hours,) that I would have been able to focus better and enjoy the film more (now it's just a blur), and that I would be hangover and anxiety free today.",5

2019-11-24 10:07:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e0zkvx/doldrums/,Doldrums,"This word has changed from its original meaning. Like many others in the English lexicon. We use it now as a synonym in reference to depression, dark periods, rock bottom, ect. Initially doldrums referred to literal areas between the trade winds. These areas lack winds. In turn stranding sails for long periods. In the past when we relied only on sails this would last weeks or even months.

A period of stagnation. Also known as The Calms.

Doldrums stems from two words. Dolt, meaning slow or stupid and Tantrum, meaning an outburst of anger or frustration. These words together make Doldrums a juxtaposition in itself. The word is very much like its intended meaning. It makes no fucking sense. It’s a feeling that is so indescribable, the English word for it is a goddamn contradiction 

Addiction makes you miss things in life. Most of the things we miss are good. Others are hard. Somewhere in the middle, we miss the doldrums. They don’t feel bad or good. But they do feel something. Something worth paying attention to.

Sometimes things make sense. Sometimes they really don’t. If you get caught in the calms, as I currently am, do yourself a solid. Take the time to look around. The view isn’t so bad. The winds will come at some point. You might find them or they might find you. Sometimes in places you couldn’t see before.

I was guilty as could possibly be. The events occurred 11 months ago. Both charges were dismissed due to a fatal flaw in the charging document. Attorneys I've spoken to have all said that this is a one in a million occurrence. I have no idea how I got so lucky I began a voluntary monitoring program with my professional assistance program a month ago and its given me some additional accountability. Life has gotten measurably better since getting sober.

I've lost weight and can fit into the clothes I like to wear. I have less social anxiety and depression. I now take better care of myself and put myself in a position to succeed. My confidence grows with each day. I don't feel overwhelmed by my problems. I do a better job of accepting myself as I am currently constituted. My relationship with my family and friends have improved. I've grown my network of other sober people. I've reconnected with nature (this one was huge for me). I don't have a sense of impending doom that used to always hang over me. 

r/stopdrinking has been such a huge help in my sobriety also. Especially early on when I didn't know who to talk to or where to turn. I used to love getting to see my day counter tick up one more day. I also always looked forward to reading posts from people who were at the next milestone I was looking forward to reaching.

Hi Reddit,

Background. I'm a 34 year old male coming up on 18 months or so sober.

Lately I just feel like a massive black cloud has settled over my life and is taking a great, big shit over everything.

I've been scaring myself.

I don't recognise who I am anymore and when I think back to my old life it feels like it happened to a different person. It's scary and strange. Everything is just so different now. But not always for the better.

I think back on my old life of bar hopping, carelessness, fun, laughter, colour. Talking to strangers and making new friends. Singing into the summer night, smoking endless cigarettes, flirting with cuties. Being stupid and carefree. The beautiful destruction, the ruin, the numbness.

I know I can't have that old life anymore. The fall out is not worth those seemingly beautiful aspects listed above.

But I just want to push the fuck it button. I want that old life back. Is being sober really worth this grey, boring, lonely existence? I've lost all of my 'friends'. I live in a country 6000 miles away from my family. I don't speak the language well. And I'm trying to fill my time positively. I'm training, I'm running, I'm working on music, I'm reading, I'm sleeping well. I'm doing everything I should be doing.

I've had a great year of so many firsts. First time performing in a music show, first marathon, first 100km ultra hike. PB's in every race category, 15kg off in weight. The list goes on. I'm not just sitting around. I'm doing all of these things. Because I'm sober, I understand that. I can see and feel the positives. So why do I feel so shit?

Is it FAB? Is it loneliness? I'm so confused.

The early days were amazing. Pink clouding it. Those halcyon days of skipping through the summer streets. So thankful, so aware of everything. I had been released from the prison of hangovers, the groundhog days of anxiety and lethargy. THIS was living. THIS was the beginning of the rest of my life. Oh the places we would go my friend...I was elated and so sure of myself and my decision. Best thing I'd ever done etc, etc.

And now I feel like I'm on a downward trajectory. I feel like I'm going nowhere and I'm still thinking about alcohol every fucking day. Not even because I want to drink it. Just the whole thing. The journey, the past, the present. Sobriety in general. When does it go away? Why can't I just move on with my life without having this constantly on my mind.

How do I get the sunshine back?

Thank you for reading my words.",25

2019-11-24 08:22:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e0ygm1/getting_sober_in_japan/,Getting Sober in Japan,"I’m currently living in Japan as a foreign language student, and while I’ve been here I’ve had to finally face my problems with alcohol. 
I’ve always struggled with emotional issues since I was young but as I got older I learned how to suppress this strong emotions and keep them in check.... unless I’m black out drunk and then it’s like I’m a lunatic (well at least there is a 50-50 chance this alcoholic demon appears, on good nights I’m just a friendly giggly dummy.) 

I moved into a share house which I love living in but on nights I got super drunk, I would scream and cry in my room and cause a huge fuss. I got reported by many of the residents here and I am now on a last leg of being evicted. I was so ashamed and I hid from everyone while I tried to sober up, until eventually I stopped hiding and tried to hold my head high while recovering. As my therapist said “no one is above alcoholism.” 
I noticed that the other members were being kind and understanding to me, they went out of their way to talk to me and ask how I’m doing. I was so surprised because I was sure everyone despised me or thought I was some nutjob psycho. Turns out they love who I am when I’m not drunk, and they’ve been understanding about my depression and appreciative that I’m trying to get better. 

However the other night I had a party with my friends. I drank. But I didn’t drink so much that I was black out drunk, and I didn’t do anything crazy.... until I fell asleep. My friend slept next to me that night and turns out I don’t MAKE the choice to scream when I’m drunk.... I scream in my sleep. 

It was a relief to know that even drunk I didn’t choose to scream and cry, but as I said I’m on my last leg here and I can’t keep these problems up. Of course I’ve had great memories drinking with friends.... but every stress-inducing major fuck-up has been because of alcohol. If I didn’t drink my life would be so much more different now. But all I can do is continue to stay sober. It’s just so hard when you’re friends with people who can drink and get drunk like a normal person and doesn’t have to deal with terrifyingly strong emotions that spill out under the influence. 

I don’t really know where this post is going, maybe I just need some support.... it’s hard especially in a foreign country. But I’m done running away from my problems, I’m going to continue fighting and if I don’t get evicted I’ll do my best to repair my relationships and clean up my mess. I’m so tired of running away and taking the easy way out. 

I think it’s also just so therapeutic to finally get this out.... I don’t talk about this with my friends from school, as far as their concerned they only know the loving, sober version of me. I know I can’t please everyone and not everyone will forgive me, and I know I need to focus on myself and the ones who love me, but I can’t fight this battle alone. It’s been so hard, because I made a lot of bad choices while drunk, some that have left deep scars. Not everything that happened while I was drunk was MY doing rather what others have done to me as well. I just feel like my life has exploded due to alcohol and I’m trying to pick up all the pieces with full arms. 

The hardest part isn’t immediately after I get sober, because the shame and sickness and disappointment helps me stay away from alcohol. The hardest part is when I finally feel in a happier good place.... because I feel like “yeah ok! I can control it this time for sure.” And seems like for the most part i actually could (not always though) but then, once I fall asleep I scream. 

I really want to stay sober. I just don’t trust myself anymore.",12

I couldnt throw out suicidal thoughts from my mind and lost my trust in doctors. 14 days ago I decided to make my last move to save my life and quit cold turkey everything (xanax alcohol fapping, sugar, eye drops etc) .

I will admit to being a higher functioning alcoholic. I don't like therapy as I can pick out the easy route of what they are saying. It hasn't worked for me very much. I'm not being a prat but the everyday psychology I get and I just get frustrated by it.

Not my job this week but I still need to check in!","We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn’t:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

2019-11-24 06:28:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e0xe62/100_days_ago/,100 days ago,"100 days ago I woke up so hungover I couldn’t get out of bed.  I spent the whole morning wallowing in woe, wondering why I do this to myself, pretty desperate for an end to this madness.  

In agony throughout my whole body and mind, I searched the internet for answers. Two things I found stand out.  First I came across this sub and made my first post.  Second a response from a user suggested going to a smart Recovery meeting, something I never heard of before. 

When I finally dragged myself out of bed to get some water I told my wife that I never wanted to drink again (for real this time).   She was likely skeptical. I made note of Day 100 in my calendar and noticed that it seemed soooooooo far away.  So impossible.  

I stuck with it one day (one moment really) at a time.  Made not drinking part of my daily life and part of my character.  I went to smart meetings and actually bought in.  I kept reading for inspiration and posting for expression. I avoided the things that triggered my urges.  I was open and honest about it to my closest friends and my wife.  I made an earnest commitment to change my ideas about what I am and instead set my aim on who I pictured myself to be. 

I made it here to 100 days sober. And it’s not as big of a deal as I thought it would be because not drinking is normal to me now.  I like my life so much better I think “Why would I ever go back to that way again?”  

There’s still battles but not as many, still urges but not that often, still temptation but I am stronger.  I like myself and I’m proud of my accomplishments so far.  Here’s to Day 100 and hopefully many more. IWNDWYT!",71

So I was planning not to post anything here until I was at least a month or so sober, but this happened tonight and I guess it's worth sharing.
Beware, this will be small-essay levels of text.

So, this is my third day sobering up (fourth, if we look at the time [03:30 Mexico time]). My gf is out of city and my friends are having a small meeting. There'll be beer, but these are my childhood friends, and our free nights rarely converge, so I decided to go and just try to stay away from alcohol. All is good, we're having a good time, I tell them that I haven't been feeling well lately so I won't be drinking tonight. The mood is cool, but every now and then I get that urge to just go to the fridge and open up a cold one. Quick disclaimer: My alcoholism is pretty much me, ALONE, drinking at home until I pass out, every single night; I've never had a problem drinking a beer or two at parties, somehow I contain myself pretty well when I'm with others. So that's precisely what my brain is telling me: Oh come on, just one, you'll be fine, etc. Damn, brain, why you betray me like that? So, anyway, I'm having this debate with myself when my phone rings: it's a colleague from the clinic I work at (I'm a medic. I now, an alcoholic doctor, go figure). He tells me that he's at the emergency room all by himself, because his night shift partner called in sick (It's a small private clinic, we usually have two doctors handling ER), and that one of his patients just went into cardiac arrest, and he'll have to fully focus on him for a while. He says he remembered I don't work nights (I work afternoons as GP), and called me because there are still patients arriving to the ER and he needs a hand. Figuring I would find myself drinking if I stay with my friends, I tell him it's cool and I'll be there in a minute. It's a 15-20 minute drive to the clinic, so I arrive pretty soon. I pass through the waiting room and yeah it's kind of crowded in there. I get to work, a few wounds that require stitches, a few kids with respiratory infections, nothing really out of the ordinary. After an hour or so my collegue comes to the ER and tells me that he managed to stabilize his patient well enough so he can be transfered to a bigger, better equipped hospital; he'll be done in a couple minutes and I'll be free to do whatever I was doing with my night. As I said, there wasn't really nothing extraordinary in the ER so far, but I'm used to GP's work, wich is a lot more slow and methodical, and the inherent chaos that is an ER has got me stressed out a bit. So I message my friends asking if they are still drinking, to see if I'll join them. I tell myself that I've earned a beer or two after all the extra work. Still, my collegue is not returning, so I decide to check one more patient in the meantime, and this is were all this text becomes relevant, I promise. I ask one of the nurses if she can tell the next patient in queue to come in, and she comes back with this man who can barely breath. He has a yellowish tint in his skin; his face, his arms and legs, and most importantly, his abdomen are swollen to an extreme point. His breathing is fast and shallow. He cannot talk, for all of his strength is being directed to keep breathing. He's sweating profusely. His chart says he's 46, but no way, I tell myself, he looks 60. His wife briefs me: He's a long time alcoholic, began drinking in his teen years, non-stop. A couple months ago he was diagnosed with hepatic cirrhosis and all has gone downhill from there. As we hook him up to the monitors, I see he has acute ascites. I'll spare you the medical terms (mainly because, if my english sucks, my medical-english is way worse), but it means he has liquid accumulated in his abdominal cavity, wich opress his thoracic cavity and keeps his lungs from expanding and filling with air. This man can't breathe, it's what I'm saying. He also has fever and shows no clear signs of infection anywhere, wich probably means spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, in which case the liquid in his abdomen became infected out of nowhere. We decide to begin paracentesis to drain the fluids from his abdomen and started antibiotics, as we wait fot the specialist in internal medicine to come, for this is a condition that escapes the general practitioner's league. Paracentesis is a slow procedure, so my colleague finally shows up and takes up from there. Still, as I was the one that had first contact with the patient, I'm the one who writes is medical note. It was hard, knowing that me and many others are battling alcohol addiction, but when I got to the part where you write the diagnosis, I almost broke down:

Acute ascites + Presumable spontaneus bacterial peritonitis + Hepatic cirrhosis secondary to long term alcohol abuse.

Let that sink down for a minute.

His prognosis is not good.

I drove directly home. Now I'm in beed, my head racing trough all of this. We're dancing with the devil, my friends. I'm no religious man, but I prayed for that man. I prayed for you all. I kept thinking of this sub all the time when we were taking care of that patient. Of all of you who (like me) are taking baby steps into rehab; of the ones who are months in; the ones who have years under their belts. We are all in danger of relapsing, and, God help us, end up in a hospital bed fighting to stay alive.
And that's it. I'm really sorry for all this text. Eloquence has never been my strong, and I tend to get carried away. Thank you if you read up to this point. Keep strong, keep healthy, I'm here for you.
I will not drink with you today.

EDIT: Hello everyone! I had an eventful morning so I couldn't check reddit until now. This post got way more attention than I though it would, I appreciate the time you spent reading it and commenting on it. I'm also really glad that it helped some to find the strength to have one more clean day, as that was the whole point.
So, quick update, I went to the clinic about an hour ago. The man I talked about is still there, still putting up a fight. Sepsis was added to his diagnosis once the labs came back this morning, and they tell me around noon his blood pressure fell sharply and had the ICU team in alert for they thought he was going into shock, thankfully it responded to treatment and his prognosis got a little better. I mean, it's still very delicate, but no septic-shock-levels of delicate. He will be transfered to a bigger hospital in my state capital later this afternoon.
I'll probably not see this man again, and he will never have a clue, but he helped me so much last night. I wish him the best.

Oh, also, one last thing! Thanks for the gold and silver! I'll be honest here: I have no idea how those work, but to me they mean someone found this post useful for their own struggle, and I'm thankful for that.

I won't be drinking with you today. Stay safe!",1259

Sobriety still yields very clear results and life gets immeasurably better. Drinking still yields the same negative results only they keep getting worse with age.

It never gets better and it never ends. 

I always overthink the whole thing. For example, how can I tell whether my drinking is alcoholism, a bad habit, an unhealthy coping mechanism, or just immaturity. Does it matter? All involve alcohol and the solution is quitting. Right? I don't know. Give my brain 15 minutes to concoct an exception. 

Anyway, here I am. I've been awake since 4 AM I feel mildly hungover, bloated, tired, frustrated, dizzy, anything but good. This type of morning if more normal than not.

It's crazy how much energy I have and how much control I have over my emotions now. Before, when I was doing the moderation mambo (i.e., thinking 2-4 drinks every night or so was okay, but was wondering why I always felt like shit...😑), after a huge life-changing event like moving out of state with little to no help from anyone and with my little boy in tow the whole way, would've completely depleted me, emotionally, physically, and mentally. But no booze? No prob! Nothing but optimism, confidence, and patience with myself and my kiddo.

I'm exhausted, we were on the road all day and I was unpacking and cleaning up the new house all night, but I'm exhausted in the happiest, proudest way imaginable. I've earned this good night's sleep, and I'm already grateful because I know I won't be hungover tomorrow.

I also struggle with an eating disorder and borderline personality disorder.. tonight has been one of those I want to say fuck it and call up my dealer and end this whole sober thing but I won’t. I’ll put out a little bit of my back story of how I got to where I am today.. I started this year off with moving back in with my mother because my ex and I broke up after a four year relationship. I was drinking at my moms every night when I got off work (I’m a waitress) about almost a bottle of vodka every night to numb out. On nights I didn’t drink I would act out with my eating disorder.. meaning I would binge and purge or not eat at all. I finally called it quits and checked myself into rehab for a month and when I got out I stayed sober for 75 days total. I started hanging out with a bad crowd of people because I said fuck it and was tired of being the only one at my work who didn’t drink except my boss who’s also apart of the same AA group as me. This last relapse led me to try cocaine for the first time and I immediately fell in love. What turned into I will only do this every other month slowly turned into three times a week and finding myself at the casino at 7am. I finally got what was coming to me when I got in an accident and was arrested for a dui. Luckily I wasn’t caught with any drugs with me.. 

I went to rehab again for only ten days to detox and left AMA because I wanted to get right back into work to pay off all the fines. I know I’m white knuckling this whole sobriety thing. I often wonder if I just drank to forget all the awful shit that I’ve been through in the past and perhaps one day I can drink and be normal? I know that’s a common thought with all alcoholics probably. I guess if I have to question it then it’s probably not a good idea. I just don’t feel better being sober. I feel safe at home but I’m incredibly lonely. I miss people. Sorry if this triggers anyone but it’s how I feel..",4

It was glistening like it hadn’t glistened before. At the time I made a list of things I had been doing ... moisturizer, green tea, more sleep, humidifier, way less booze, vitamin C serum, etc. 

Fast forward to today. My skin ain’t looking so good. So I looked back at that list and low and behold... the one thing that’s changed... is booze. 

I’ve been actively trying to drink less, but I had a bit of a crazy week — drank about 3-4 drinks Tuesday night, 7-8 drinks on Wednesday night, 2 on Thursday, and one last night. Today my skin is dry, splotchy, and overall just not looking so good. 

I’m amazed at how fast alcohol can change your skin and complexion. Talk about a difference!

I am new to this community so please be patient. 
I have a friend who was about 6 months sober in November. He was extremely friendly, and we texted every day. I've only known him when he was sober (ie: I met him about 2 months ago, or 4 months into his sobriety).

He moved for work at the beginning of November. Things were fine for a couple days, but his mood shifted (he seemed less happy/enthusiastic) and by the end of the first week, he told me that he had started drinking again and was ""working on it"". 

I continued to text him for about 1.5 weeks, but I haven't gotten any word from him via text or email, and my phone calls go straight to voicemail (maybe his phone is off and that's why he doesn't respond to my texts?).

This isn't normal for my friend -- he's usually very friendly and happy, and he usually texts back if I text him. Is this behaviour normal or should I be somewhat concerned?

Thanks in advance.

I'm dealing with a bunch of depressed alcoholics that expect me to hold space for them and their moods swings (I'm the manager)  but what I really need is to hold space for myself this week.  Something is screaming at me to take a break,  it's the holiday season though so I can't.  I'm breathing as much as I can at work,  I'm snapping more though (I told a customer to stop mansplaining the remote to me when I was trying to find him a football game and he tried to take the remote from me)  it's also the time of the month,  so I'm sure I'm PMSing, but goddamn being sober has been a blessing and a curse this week.  Why am I not allowed to wallow in drunken/hungover self pity like all of my employees and expect others to fix my broken shit?? WHY? Because that's not how life works buttercup.

That being said, I made it through my second SEC football season, attending all of the home games and tailgates, without touching the devil’s juice. This incredible feet, coming from a guy with a fear of interstate travel, long lines, crowds, and even terrorism, is noteworthy imho. I made it. I sat and watched, for 14 Saturday’s, people drink way too damn much. I saw countless people completely passed out in public places from that firewater we used to put in our bodies. It was not easy. I eyed a lot of IPA’s a waitress would bring past my table. But I kept posting here and staying strong. 

So if you are reading this, have faith that if a late 30’s former IPA connoisseur with a pot belly and an anxiety disorder can make it two solid SEC football seasons without the sauce (or other drugs I might add), then you can make it through that wedding, upcoming Christmas party, work function, funeral (those may be harder), birthday party etc. life is bringing your way soon.

For a while I was making good progress after going a month sober, then I almost immediately slipped up after reaching my goal. From then on I've been drinking more and more frequently between bouts of being sober.

This past week I drank almost every day. It wasn't always my usual drink to black out every night, but I was still drinking before work and being hungover nearly every day of the week. 

I just wanted to say it feels so damn good to wake up not hungover. I just swapped schedules from an 8 hour shift to 12 hours all night. Being hungover while my body adjusts to this schedule has been brutal. 

I'm ready for a week of no hangovers. A week where I just take care of myself. To anyone else out there struggling I wish you the energy and power to take care of yourselves, too. You deserve it whether you think so or not.

The 4th paragraph is where I start talking about my drinking and the 8th paragraph is where I start talking about my recovery but I wanted to provide a little background so you can understand that this can happen to anyone...even someone like me who had a great childhood and family.  Growing up, I was an extremely active kid.  Nearly everyday I was outside playing pick up football, basketball, capture the flag, tag, paintball, whatever it may be. This gave me a great foundation of athleticism and cardiovascular stamina. Eventually, I ended up running track and field/cross country at a very high level collegiately...but after 4 years of college running I quit and ended up dropping out of college.

I had everything going for me...a great family that was paying for my college so I wouldn't have debt, outstanding physical fitness, and lots of friends around me. I threw all that away. Midway through school, my grades started tanking because I stopped going to some of classes and didn't do any of my assignments. I lied to everyone about this. I made everyone around me, including my parents, think everything was fine and that I was a semester away from graduating. Eventually, I nearly cut my family out of my life because I was so embarrassed and couldn't face talking to them.

I didn't start drinking until I was 21 years old and it only took a year for the heavy drinking to start.  This was about 5 years ago and where the drinking started. It was a slow progressing to out of control and I never even realized it was out of control until 3 months ago. I started off very casual, going out on the weekends and having a good time with my friends.  This led to adding in a beer or two after every shift at work and then driving home after. My tolerance slowly started to build and a beer or two wasn't enough. A beer or two turned into two to three which turned into four to five.  This is when I also started smoking weed.

I had never done drugs my entire life but I surrounded myself with people that normalized this behavior so I didn't think anything was wrong. A couple times a week, I'd have at least 10 drinks in a night...I'm ashamed to say this, but I would drive home after nights like this if I had my car on me. I'd get home, pass out, wake up the next day with a wicked hangover and start all over again the next night.  There was one specific occasion where I was driving home completely obliterated, pulled into a gas station and threw up all over the place outside my door. I got back in my car and drove home. I told myself that night, I would never drive drunk again in my entire life. That has held true to this day. However, my habits didn't change. I continued to excessively drink and smoke a ton of weed in a social environment almost every night.

About two years ago, I got a promotion at my restaurant job  and made the decision that I wouldn't drink around the people I was supposed to be managing.  This is when things started getting even worse. I would come home, buy myself a 6 pack of the highest abc beer I could find and drink it all that night alone. I did this everyday.  The best part was I no longer got hangovers.  Eventually, once 6 beers a night wasn't doing the trick, I started buying cases of light beer. This was convenient because I didn't have to go to the store everyday.  I started becoming a hermit...closed in my room every night drinking, smoking, and playing video games till 4am then waking up at 3pm (I worked nights at my job). Honestly, I was having a great time by myself. I started doing cocaine alone which made playing video games even more fun. I hid this from everyone.  I only did coke when my girlfriend was at work so she never found out about that. When she was home, I'd lock myself in the game room for 6+ hours doing coke and drinking a 8 or 9 beers. Every. Single. Day.

At my peek 3 months ago, I was killing nearly half a case of beer per night.  One night, about 3 months ago, I went to the emergency room because I literally thought I was dying. My heart rate was beating out of control, I was sweating my ass off, shaking, and forcing myself to throw up. I was so scared that I was going to die. This was when I made the decision that I was done drinking, smoking, and snorting cocaine. My girlfriend had been telling me for months that I had a drinking problem, but I always got very annoyed when she would tell me this. Even after that hospital visit I didn't think I had a problem.  It wasn't until I started having withdrawals that I realized I had a problem.

I quit cold turkey.  I had no idea that this could kill a person.  I highly advise against quitting cold turkey. Alcohol is POISON. Essentially, when your body starts flushing out alcohol, it also flushes out essential electrolytes that allow your brain and central nervous system to function correctly. The first five days of my recovery were horrible. I couldn't sleep, I was getting terrible headaches, my heart rate was fluctuating between 60bpm and 160bpm, I was constantly drenched in sweat, horrible body tremors at night, tingling sensations in my arms and legs, I went from 145lbs to 130lbs, and I was so unbelievable tired everyday. These symptoms peeked at day 5 of no drinking. By day 7, I started feeling normal again. Actually, the 2nd week, I could feel the benefits of not drinking. The best part, I started dreaming again. I hadn't had dreams while sleeping in years and it was a great feeling. My eyes were no longer heavy and droopy, I was gaining color back into my face and my physical withdrawal symptoms were slowly disappearing.

It became much more psychological from this point forward. By the end of the 2nd week, I started getting anxiety and panic attacks. I mistook these for heart attacks though. I went to the emergency room 3 times in the first month I quit drinking because I thought I was having heart attacks. I had chest pain, arm pain, aches in my back, my heart rate would spike to 130-140bpm and I was so tired all day everyday.  This was terrifying because I had no idea what was going on with me and have never had issues with panic or anxiety attacks so I didn't think of those at first. I had several EKGs, blood tests, and X-rays, all saying the same thing...there is nothing wrong with me. I didn't believe it though. These symptoms were happening on and off throughout the day, every day for about 10 days during weeks 3 and 4 of my recovery.  This forced me to take 12 days off from work because a normal life felt impossible.  I focused very hard these 12 days to refocus my mind and build good habits. I started eating healthy, going out on walks, listening to talks about anxiety, and doing a little meditation and stretching.  Finally, during week 5, these daily attacks subsided a bit. I was able to go back to work and start putting my routines into action. 

To this day, I still have bad anxiety and a bit of depression...the alcohol had been hiding those two mental illnesses all these years. I'm able to control it a little better but still from time to time, I get stabbing chest pain, arm pain, body aches, head rushes, a sense of dread and doom and whatnot. I have SIGNIFICANTLY improved though.  After ignoring my family for almost 2 years, I'm finally talking with them every day again and the relationship with my girlfriend has improved tremendously. I got very lucky that they were willing to stick with me during those times. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them. 

It's been almost 3 months and the only thing I've drank is water and decaffeinated tea. No alcohol, no caffeine, no weed, no coke, nothing.  Quit completely cold turkey because I needed to.  I was slowly killing myself with how much I was drinking.  I'm finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I do crave a drink from time to time but the recovery experience was so terrible that I told myself I will never put myself through that again.  It took a lot of willpower but ultimately, it's mind over matter and you have to want to change in order for that change to happen.  If you're still reading this, thank you and just know that the first week will be extremely difficult.  You have to think about the times when you were at rock bottom and tell yourself you don't want to be back there every again. That's how you will make it through that week. If you can make it through that, you can make it through the first month easily. Then, it just takes a bit of self control and determination which is NOTHING compared to what you have been through in the past.  Thank you for reading.",19

As I was waiting for my ride, I decided to buy a bottle of wine. 

On my ride home, I chat with the Uber driver. At one point he mentions he has never had a sip of alcohol because his wants to live his life to every bit and it deserves to not ever be fuzzy. And our bodies work so hard for us why hurt it. Etc etc. 

To say it was a sign would be an understatement. I could also even see me being annoyed about this convo at other times. But tonight. It was meant for me. Goodbye bottle of wine. Here’s to day 8. IWNDWYT",143

I haven't hit many meetings and definitely haven't read anything recently. So this evening I thought I would just open it up to a random page and read the chapter or whatever it was that I opened.

I ended up opening it up to he sold himself short, page 258 which was written by a man who went through 5 years trying to sober up. There are differences between us, he lived during the Great Depression, he's a man whereas I and a woman, AA appears to be different when he joined versus what it looks like now, Etc. But I found pieces of his story really relatable.

He didn't just give it one shot and succeed. He went through years of this misery. He describes basically doing everything he could to obtain alcohol after his spouse threw it out, this happened to me. And he described a major shift when he wanted to stop drinking versus trying to do it for other people.

Interestingly there were six steps at that time. One was complete deflation, two was dependence and guidance from a higher power, three was moral inventory,  four was confession,  five was restitution, and six was continued work with alcoholics. Not to diminish any of the 12 Steps but I really like the Simplicity of what has been helpful to me in terms of recovery.

I also appreciate this quote. In referring to his 18 years of sobriety, he stated

 "" This latest part of my life has had a purpose, not in great things accomplished but in daily living. Courage to face each day has replaced the fears and uncertainties of early years. Acceptance of things as they are has replaced the old impatient champing at the bit to conquer the world. I have stop tilting at windmills and instead have try to accomplish the little daily tasks, unimportant in themselves, but tasks that are an integral part of living fully.""

And it's undeniable, I am feeling so much better than I was when I first quit. I was in such a depressed hole in October. Within just a week of my last drink though, I was already feeling the volume turn down on my anxiety. I had so much more energy. I found myself staring out a car window, listening to some beautiful song, and I had this overwhelming sense of wellbeing. You know that feeling? It's just this honey-colored sensation of WOW LIFE IS AMAZING. Sobriety felt like a marvel. I felt like I had solved the deepest rooted problem in my life. 

But I'm not so sure now. This whole week I've backslid into some insomnia. Insomnia that I thought had been caused by the drinking. I am eating everything always all the time. Even when I know I shouldn't. I'll find myself eating a frosted donut... just like sometimes I'd find myself chugging out of a bottle of cheap champagne wondering: ""How did this happen??"" I am gaining weight. I am not sleeping. My skin is not glowing the way it did initially. And, worst of all, I am feeling every single social foible so intensely. I made a joke that fell flat yesterday to a colleague and I am STILL thinking about it and cringing. I thought the anxiety would be gone.... but it's like it was just waiting to lull me into a false sense of comfort. 

This is the type of feeling that I know is capable of tricking me into drinking again. Sort of a posture of, ""Well what's the use?"" If you are sad anyway with or without it, then you might as well drink, right? No. I can't go back there. I know intellectually it will be so much worse than I can possibly fathom right now. In any case. I could use some support. Can anyone relate? Is there a way to feel better and recover from this? Thanks in advance.",11

‘If I could go back in time, would I have ever started drinking?'

Let me explain...

I think people that have overcome addiction are some of the strongest people on the planet.

We literally pick ourselves up from the darkest places and start fixing our lives massively.

Before hitting rock bottom, I had put on weight, felt low energy all of the time, and was systematically destroying my confidence every time I reached for the drink.

But, like you guys, I picked myself up.

I dusted myself off, and started committing to MY OWN LIFE.

I started reading the books, going back to the gym and working on my business.

I now live in Asia, as you may or may not know, and this had been a dream of mine for 7 years.

(Btw Asia is an amazing place to live - great weather, amazing food and it’s cheap as chips!)

But...none of the good things would have happened if I hadn’t gotten sober first.

Getting sober was a miracle.

Would I change it?

Maybe - but it’s made me who I am today.

Overcoming addiction has definitely made me a stronger person.

I truly believe, we are some of the strongest people alive today 🤜🏻🤛🏻

There is a solution - no, not alcohol - come here to SD go on the irc chat, or see if there is a meeting you can go to.  AA often has back to back meetings - usually running all day - if nothing else it's a safe place to run away to.  Check with your local inter group for locations  (google AA and your county/city)  Smart may do the same thing - check with them...

You can do this.

Its harder for some others, that's why having an escape hatch is so important....",27

I have had the desire to stop or drastically limit my drinking many many times over the last several years. And there have been periods during which I was able to stop. Namely when I lived alone. 

Over the last couple years I’ve been living with recreational/social drinkers and I have a much harder time squashing the desire to drink. I already don’t keep any alcohol of mine in the house but theirs is here in the fridge, in the pantry, sometimes left out on the kitchen table. At least once a week I succumb to drinking with my housemates. I keep failing to stay accountable and it’s stressful because even if I don’t have more than a couple drinks (50% I have 1-2 drinks but 50% I drink more than 2 which for me is too much), I have a lot of shame over not successfully quitting drinking altogether. 

I’m also losing weight and drinking totally undoes the progress I’m making. Plus when I drink too much I end up eating again late at night as I did last night and I REALLY can’t stand when I do that. It also ignites the urges to partake in other recreational activities that in my sober hours I have no desire to do anymore. For me drinking is a gateway drug. 

I just feel like I keep undoing the work that is actually helping me to feel better again and I’m not in a position to move out of this household. We only moved in together a few months ago. 

I go to teas as an alternative and have several different kinds. But when the one roommate is drinking every single night, I might as well be walking into a bar every evening when she comes home. 

How do those of you who live with housemates who drink, maintain sobriety? I’ve long admired my sister’s 2+ years of sobriety and all she’s accomplished as a result. She lives with a sober boyfriend so it’s not an exposure/accessibility issue when they are home and I wish I had that support in my household. 

So far in this new situation, I have made it stick for maybe 5 days at a time.",5

Content warning: grief and loss

For as long as I can remember, I've struggled with having come from a dysfunctional family. Mental health and substance abuse run on both sides for me. I was shielded from the worst of it because my dad almost died (from drunk driving) when I was a toddler, which sent him to rehab. After that, he spent a decade being sober. My mom was wary because of her own family background, and she held the family together. But by the time I was 19, he'd relapsed, they'd divorced, my mom moved away and began drinking, and I was looking at my dad strapped to a gurney, completely green, fighting to hang on. That time he'd nearly overdosed on pain killers. I now know they've struggled with depression their whole lives and failed to accept/disclose this to me until well into my adulthood. 

Nevertheless, I worked and continued my education even after dropping out 3 times. I had friends who loved to go out, and through college I was more or less a social drinker and still ignorant of my real family history. I got lucky and met the right guy. We've been together ever since. By all accounts, I had everything going right for me- young, smart, healthy, and on the way up.

Sometime around then, I was having drinks with my husband when we got carried away. It resulted in an unplanned pregnancy. I was really busy finishing up my education so the timing was not great, but as the weeks rolled by we found ourselves getting more and more excited. But I'd started to develop pain and couldn't get seen for a prenatal appointment very quickly because of insurance coverage problems. Sadly, painfully, and horrifically, I lost the pregnancy about halfway through. I was so shocked I couldn't go to work or school, and I didn't even face my grief. What I did instead was drink.

The drinking progressed slowly with a lot of long breaks that allowed me to tell myself that everything was fine.  I can't pinpoint a day or time where it crossed a line.  That's the exact reason it's so hard for me to deal with. But the breaks  kept getting shorter and harder to initiate. After several more years and more dry springtimes that just turned into dry Januarys as the resolutions rolled by, I tried to just keep drinking to weekends, mostly with success, until very recently. I started keeping a log and realized I was not only drinking more than I realized, but more than I wanted to.

I now have healthy children. I still have my husband. I thought that I was okay. I really, really wanted to believe that.

But every time my old due date would roll around, I'd be in tears. The birth of my living children triggered bad memories. I went through severe PPD.  I've been in denial about all the rejection I feel from my parents, especially my dad, just not being interested in me (basically not showing up for visits and holidays). Nothing fixes this, but I finally realized that my drinking was an insincere attempt to address it. The truth is that it can't be fixed. I just have to accept it and try to make a better life for myself. I just have to ride the waves of grief and pain. They come and go. The suffering never lasts.

It all became crystal clear yesterday when my son went into recycling and picked up a wine bottle. ""You forgot to rinse this out."" It broke my heart, and it broke my paradigm.

I'm done. I'll just cry when I need to cry, and journal, and walk, and live- authentically.",3

I don’t have bubble-guts. These thoughts make me smile throughout the day.

A big reason that I kept drinking was to socialize with my friends and coworkers after work. I didn’t want that painful feeling of exclusion, the FOMO, from seeing all of them partying it up on my instagram stories the next day. I wanted to be in all the stories, even if it meant another Saturday spent quarantined from my family while I recovered in bed. 

Last Saturday I woke up sober. I went to the bathroom and opened up instagram and started watching my feed. All of my drinking buddies went out the night before. Everyone was dancing and having a good time. The FOMO started creeping in. 

I looked up at myself in the mirror. No double-vision, no bloated face from too many IPAs. No horrifying drunk texts waiting to be unearthed. No slouching over the sink. No kneeling at the toilet. I’m standing straight up. From here I can see my wife and baby sleeping in the bedroom next door. I get to be with them today.

I think I had fun. I did exactly what I planned and nothing more. I don’t think I’m going to rush out and buy more booze. I want to drink with my family over Thanksgiving—that had always been my plan. I don’t think I’ll drink again until Wednesday or Thursday, and I don’t think I’ll drink after the holiday weekend.

You all warned me about backsliding. About letting booze creep back into my life bit by bit. I understand the fear and I think I’ll be OK. This community helped me quit for the first time in years. I set a personal goal and a health goal and I met both of them. I never wanted to stop drinking forever. I’m going to reset my day counter after Thanksgiving and I’m going to stay part of the community. I really think I’ve made a lifestyle change that—with diligence—I will stick to.

I have felt great and during my waking hours feel solidly in the IWNDWYT camp. However, I have been having weird drinking dreams. Like, I make a complex cocktail, sit back and enjoy that shit. Then I feel ashamed. In my dream. Last night, for example, I was at my brother's wedding (his wedding was over a year ago). I decided, in my dream, that it was worth it to have a couple, special drinks, had a super unsatisfying (and hopefully not real) drink of scotch and orange. Then it spiralled into a drunken shitshow where his buddies made a scene, my best friend's mom (a recovering alcoholic) declared the whole thing a disaster, and I regretted ever taking a sip. I woke up with no true shame and regret, since I didn't drink, which is great - it actually kind of acts as a reinforcement that I will not drink IRL. It is not, however, fun to feel subconscious shame and regret, when I'm not doing anything wrong. Anyway, it's happened several times and I just wondered if anyone else has experienced this. Thanks!",5

Love seeing all these brave, smart souls take up the journey towards sobriety and a better life. Shit, I wanted to be y’all, still do. Can’t believe I’ve let these negative spirits take over my positive spirit and my life. 

Came down with a Stomach Bug right when times were getting really rough and things were all going down. Blessing in disguise one could say, now do I have enough strength and trust to continue this difficult journey like so many brave folks have shared here before. I have the hope that I can, I have trust in this community, I believe we are all here on this planet to help each other, and I am thankful there is this community to help us all in need. 

Thanks to all who are apart of this community, been around for years, and now really wanting to commit. Have a great weekend my brothers and sisters!",7

I don't think there is much I can say to help but I can say it's possible. As long as you are willing to try. This shit is some of the gnarliest stuff that people have to endure. It's an absolute mind-fuck. It took me several attempts over many years but it did happen for me. Somewhat related but not as severe as you, I went to the hospital. And that was the same year I quit. I was having weird, scary problems with my health. I was only 29 and I didn't want to die yet. And I didn't want to die that way. I talked to myself and I just kind of made the decision. I didn't announce it to my wife but I knew she was getting tired of my BS and she was scared for me too. But I took it slow. I suffered many nights of insomnia. I developed some GAD symptoms especially when I drank caffeine. Quitting cold turkey caused some weird shit to happen to me and I'm physically changed from it. I believe my system was just thrown off super hard and it's most likely still recovering. I'm over 27 months sober. But I took i took it slow. I just hydrated, ate whatever but tried not to eat junk all the time, I walked a lot because I was in college at the time, stopped drinking caffeine for months, I googled lots of information about alcoholism and read about what I was fighting, I began a daily journal and I still do it, I also started exercising after 3-4 months of being sober, and I have good friends that don't drink much and just care about me. I am very lucky. You can do this, dude. Just take it slow and keep reinforcing yourself with good habits and people that make you motivated to live. Live for yourself too. Become the person you want to be. And don't ever stop trying to succeed in yourself.",8

I posted a while back about being overwhelmed at work. I’m supposed to have a co teacher who shares the burden of teaching my 19 general education students and 10 special education students. He was out for six days a week and a half ago, and I was left as usual doing all of the planning and all of the teaching. 

He told me that his fiancé, who was not a very nice person who he got hired at my school, left him with his daughter. The way he phrased it was “my daughter has been missing since I was out two weeks ago” and waited for me to ask if his fiancé knew where she was before he told me the full story. The fiancé up and left the school without telling anyone anything. 

I know I seem like an unfeeling jerk but this doesn’t change the fact that I am still doing the job of two people. I’m still doing all of the work by myself. I’m still not sleeping well, not consistently exercising or eating well. 

I’m mentally exhausted and thank god that this job comes with so many breaks. I have to work a 13 hour day on Monday but then get to leave at 2:15 on Tuesday for a five and a half day thanksgiving weekend. 

I just have to push myself through until Tuesday afternoon and I am 95% sure these anxious feelings will go away. At this point, I’ve worked so hard every weekend since August that I am tired of it. I have a stack of notebooks and papers to go through so I’m really prepared to speak to these families next week. 

I will do my work. I will push through. After this week I will meal prep and exercise again. And I’m sure as hell asking for a raise once I prepare what I have to say to my principals.

Pros:

My stomache is stabilizing, I can finally sleep more than four hours per night. My head is getting a bit clearer. Ten kilos lost over the last month (I'm obese, so it's really not that noticable.)

Cons:

Loneliness. So utterly lonely. I miss my cat most of all. She stayed with my ex. The evenings are filled with restless anxiety. Taking a walk at night is out of the question in my area.

I boot up a video game, look at my character for five minutes before I shut it off. Same with my bass guitar. I play for a few minutes then put it down. I can't concentrate enough to learn new pieces. I feel too isolated and shy to take contact with people, even online.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This is my longest stint of sobriety since a trying to sober up after a drunken car crash 9 years ago. Made it one month then and went straight back to it and hard.

**This is gonna be a long post**, I’ve lurked for a while and it’s taken me 171 days to say what I’m going through, offer and seek support, tell you why it sucks and why it’s great. Maybe not all in this post but I plan on offering and seeking support in the future on this subreddit. I am very open and honest now about my issues that I have overcome in the past five and a half months, I am proud of myself and honestly rightfully so. Getting sober was the best decision I have made in my entire life….period. I can honestly say the second chapter in my life began when I stopped drinking. That chapter began with the verse “He awoke and he had no regrets about his misdeeds of the prior day and today was a new day to fight and do it again.”

I am an alcoholic and have been for the better part of my adult life. I caught my first buzz at the age of 14…but didn’t start chasing that real good drunk until I was around 19 or 20. I was raised in an upper middle class family in a suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana. My childhood was good, not many complaints. Always had a roof over my head, great birthdays, family vacations, good friends and the typical Midwestern upbringing. I was baptized and confirmed Catholic, but not heavily involved in the church. I went a private Catholic High School and was president of my class. Graduated college, albeit drunk the whole time, I was able to do it. Always held down a decent job, maintained friendships, good relationships with my family. I’ve been with my wife for seven years (married for 2) and have three beautiful children.

All sounds great, but I was a drunk the whole time. I’ll spare the historical drunk details, a decade of heavy drinking has some pretty funny, sad, terrifying and regrettable stories. I drank every day…morning to night until I stumbled to bed or more often than not to the couch in my basement I loved it all but really had it in for beer, vodka and my favorite whiskey or bourbon whatever…I really liked Jim Beam.

Over the past several years, I began to spiral out of control. I replaced my morning coffee with two 16oz Coors Lights, that would continue all day. Usually after dinner (which I rarely ever ate) I would make another run to the “store”. I didn’t say liquor store because I thought my kids may not think too much about it. I went to one of five different liquor stores daily, you gotta rotate or they will think you’re a drunk. Usually, I’d pick up my case of beer, 4-6 shooters (was on a huge fireball kick, that stuff was tasty) and a pack of smokes. On the way home, I’d drink those shooters as fast as I could get em down. I have been on a “zero-tolerance hard alcohol” policy with my wife for some time…long story not needed here. Did I still drink hard liquor…fuck yes I did. I just lied through my teeth and hid my bottles. \*\*I should mention at this point, I work from home in an upper management position. My team is located in Charlotte, I travel often. I got this promotion because believe it or not I excelled at my job even while drunk all the time. I hosted meetings drunk, talked to clients drunk the whole deal…empty cans on my desk and half drank bottles under my desk.

I could feel my health deteriorating daily over the past two years, I was gaining a lot of weight, sweating all the time, and just felt like shit. But it was easily cured with a case of beer and weeknight one-man party in my office in the basement. I also had an ongoing issue with my blood pressure that I had started taking medication for and got constant migraines. I took that medication for maybe two or three years and could never seem to get my blood pressure down. I could control the headaches but my doctors couldn’t figure it out. Yes, I was lying to my doctors about my drinking. It all came to head when my doctor wouldn’t refill my meds without me getting the blood work done that she had requested 6 months prior. I knew what it was going to show, and was scared to face it. I went and got the blood work done and she called me. There are two enzymes that your liver produces, each of mine were five times the normal levels. Over-achiever…I know. My doctor said if I didn’t quit drinking, I was going to be in full liver failure in 12 months and would be placed on the transplant list. No new liver…I would be dead. Oh and the heart problems, I was walking stroke or heart attack waiting to happen. At that moment, I couldn’t speak, my head became silent, my wife was crying and the doctor just stared at me. I walked to my car and contemplated on the drive home. My wife gave me an ultimatum, either quit or I’m leaving because I won’t stand by and watch you kill yourself in front of me.

That day, that moment, that silence in my head for the hours after that doctor’s visit was like the slow ride to the to top of the hill on a roller coaster.

I quit drinking cold turkey that day, not because of my wife’s ultimatum, not because of my sister’s crying on the phone, not because of my mom’s tears in her eyes as I told her the news on the patio…I quit because I had had enough of my lying, my bullshit excuses, my shitty health…this was my fight.

The first couple weeks sucked, I hallucinated, I cried every morning, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep, concentrate, be around people but I was sober. After that I went into the honeymoon high, and it was fucking great, felt like I had came out of a coma. My head was clear, my skin cleared up, lost 15lbs in 3 weeks. But then the depression sets in and you find yourself trying to deal with things sober that you used to just drink away. This was the hardest part and continues to be the hardest part. But I take it one day at time and sometimes one minute at a time. Fake it ‘til you make it or don’t fake it at all and talk to someone.

I could go on and on, but it’s 3AM and I'm finally getting tired. Sleep isn’t easy some weeks, others it’s great, is that part of recovery?  Probably not it’s probably just part of life.   A life that I now choose to live sober.  I’ll end with something I wrote when I was really down emotionally at about 70 days. It’s a little part of why I drank…

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*no time to think…Drink*

*that tick was nibling every hour…every day*

*it wasn’t the liquid I needed, it was time to think*

*days…weeks and years pass by with the fog thick on everything my mind has to say*

*deep in it with no handle to hold, headlights were flickering for years on end*

*early mornings…later nights…conscience fading…drop dead who cares*

*reality hits with an iron fist, too many issues to keep a list*

*can’t start it without step one, never meant to hurt anyone*

*In the end, it was me who cheated death, thought I’d drink to my last breath.*

*My mind was liquid, all drink…no time to think.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I’ll always be an alcoholic and today I choose not to drink. Tomorrow I will try to do the same. Good luck to all of you.

TL:DR - I drank too much, almost caused liver failure and death, quit drinking, some days its great…some day are just ok…and some days are really hard. One second, minute, hour and day at a time. Sobriety is great and awful at the same time.",10

I've never once referred to myself as an alcoholic, because the idea of an alcoholic, to me, was someone drinking every day as maintenance, but from reading so many experiences here, I've realized, that's just a particular type of alcoholic.

I've drank since I was 13, never had an issue with drinking multiple days in a row, I would always take 3 or 4 day breaks between every session, but I am realizing as I type this, I am indeed an alcoholic, but in my own way, that I always jokingly referred to as ""Freight Train Brain"".

That is, knowing once I have a single drink, I will not stop until my body forces me to by passing out. People loved this at parties, people thought it was so funny that they'd be waking up at 10am and I'd still be drinking from the night before. I have always been the unstoppable engine of fun among all of my friends, and the positive feedback loop of this fueled the drinking even more, I would always drink a whole 5th then see how far it could get into the next one.

I didn't get to bed until 1pm earlier today, from when I started drinking Thursday, Freight Train Brain just kept pushing me and pushing me to drink more like something amazing would finally happen at the end....and all that happened was I drank a 5th and a half

Instead here I am, crashed again, an entire day gone, xanax for the horrific anxiety I woke up with, and laying in my bed in the dark, and I used to tell myself, well I'll go another 4 days without drinking, so obviously I'm not an alcoholic, I'm just having fun, it's just letting off steam. 

But now thanks to so much reading here, I know what I'm doing is a form of alcoholism, and I've been doing it 15 years, and today is the first day in my entire life I've ever acknowledged it.

If anyone reads, that's great! If not it's nice to get it out there anyway.

I'm 28 so luckily still young, but struggled  with alcohol for a few years. I started drinking socially at 18, and never really stopped until now. My drinking evolved from social drinking to what a normie would describe as problem drinking during my years at uni. Classes not until later in the afternoon would spark a day drinking session because why not, nothing else to do besides play video games and get drunk. This steadily progressed in to drinking everyday or night regardless of the situation. Soon I needed to drink just to get to sleep or kill the hangover.

25 rolls around and that's when my drinking becomes what even an alcoholic would call bad. Drinking before and during work. Wasting all my money on drinking, pawning my stuff to get pissed, stealing to get booze money. Getting in to fights (mostly getting my ass kicked). On my 28th birthday I decided I've almost hit bottom. My partner was still with me, shes pregnant, my family havent completely abandoned me yet. I still have a home (no job). This is it, I need to do something, and with my partner pregnant it's now or never.

13 September (sober date), me and my partner go to the doctors and I begin my climb. I start counseling, taking antabuse, or disulfiram, and have been sober since. 30 september my partner gives birth to a healthy, beautiful baby girl, and I've been sober since 13. My head is clear, im losing weight, I'm saving money, I'm not having any panic attacks or guilt, and the people around me dont think I'm a complete piece of shit. But most importantly I can be the best version of my self I can be for my daughter, and my partner and I'm proud to be sober. My goal isnt to be sober forever. I'd like to be a social drinker again, such as drinking a little bit at barbeques or friends house or dinner night out, things like that. It maybe be a few months or even years before I can achieve that, and I know everyone has different goals, but that is my goal. 

Anyway that's my small version of the events that led me to being sober, and I'm glad I started it. Thanks to anyone who reads this!

I’m 2 months sober on Sunday and I’ve been going to AA the entire time. I joined a home group last month and have a service commitment. I was hoping the topic of sponsorship just never came up... but tonight... it did. 

See, I’m not new to recovery. I mean... I AM, but my mom was an addict, my ex is an addict, my uncle died of alcoholism and my current boyfriend has 5 years sober from heroin. I’ve seen the big book, I’ve been to meetings, I know the steps, I know the traditions... but this time it’s about me. 

I think knowing is what has kept me from fully committing to my recovery and working the steps with a sponsor. I’m terrified of letting someone in and being so vulnerable. 

I’ve been putting it off and putting it off and tonight at my home group meeting, the speaker chose the topic of sponsorship. In this meeting you break up into small groups and everyone shares on the topic. I knew it was time to let the cat out of the bag..... all of the other home group members were in my group and they didn’t know either. I honestly thought about lying and making some shit up when it came around to me...but then I remembered that I’m in fucking AA. These people aren’t here to judge me. I can be honest. 

And so I was. 

A woman (yes, I’m female despite my username) in my home group came up to me afterwards. Honestly I had my eye on her and had planned on asking her eventually but I’m super socially awkward so I hadn’t. I’m grateful... but I’m scared. I call her tomorrow for the first time, then everyday after that. 

You know, as scared as I am. I’m grateful. How cool is AA? I showed up tonight and got put in the exact position with the exact people that I needed right now. Wish me luck guys. 

Advise is welcome!

My name is George, I've been drinking since I was 16. I'm 22 now. When i was 21 i joined up with the us army. Before that, I used to do lots of other drugs and drink. Now I just drink because doing drugs will get me kicked out of the army. I dont think I became a habitual drinker until my father died last year and I started getting hammered every night to cope with it.

I'm the new guy at my unit. I get fucked with a lot, smoked a lot. Alcohol is part of the army culture and I struggle to get away from it. After each hard day of new-guy hazing I just have the urge to drink. I drink almost every day. A light day will be 1 or 2 8% malt liquor tallboys. A heavy day will be a 6 pack and a fifth of liquor. That's usually reserved for the weekend. 

I really need to stop because its fucking with my performance at work. I'm always sucking at PT training because I'm always hung over on 5 hours of sleep. Cant keep up with the other guys because I'm not as fit as them. Whenever I run I feel like I cant breathe and that I'm dying.

I have not gone 4 days without drinking sine I was pregnant with my Son, he is 7. I partied hard at a big SEC party school and then bartended for 10 years while figuring out what to do with my life. So, yeah, I am pretty well saturated. I decided to quit because I got a new position at work that I have wanted for a while and it is challenging and having “stupid head” every day is not going to lead to success. Also, I would like to live to see my son get married, etc.. My husband quit also. He has never drank to the point I did (1.5 to 2 bottles of wine a night). He is not struggling. He is so freaking happy and cheerful, and he feels GREAT. I kinda want to slap him. In the 4 days I have not been drinking, he has suggested going to a casino, going to dinner at a place with an amazing wine list, and called me lazy pants for not wanting to pick up the take out order last night. I didn’t want to pick it up because waiting by the bar for my order would have been pure hell. He just doesn’t get it. At all. I texted him earlier to tell him I was struggling and he said he was busy, no encouraging words, nothing. He is not a bad guy at all. He just doesn’t get it. I am floating aimlessly, frantically searching for anything to relieve the pressure and he wants me to dance in the kitchen with him. I am not sure how this journey is going to impact my marriage and family. So, I have been crying non-stop all day. Not just because of my husband, but because of quitting drinking after nearly 15 years of drinking daily (except pregnancy, but that is just different). I expected the sadness. I mourned my “life” while I was pregnant, but that was temporary. I can’t even seem to find a simple sliver of peace for one freaking minute, let alone a day. Exercising doesn’t help. Reading doesn’t help. I can’t focus. I can’t focus on any of the things I used to love. I like taking hot baths, but our hot water heater is on the fritz, so those are few and far between. Physically, I feel ok. The night sweats started to wane last night, but I feel like I am spinning out of control.

* Thinking of all the nice things I can do instead that I usually don't have time for

I did that for a long time. 

I’m curious though, has anyone quit for 2+ years, then gone back with the intention of using alcohol in moderation, and actually stuck to whatever their plan was?  I’m assuming the answer is no, but just wanted to ask. 

I’ve been sober since July 21, 2017, but I often wonder about going back. I’m very thankful I was able to quit drinking, but alcohol was one of the few things that helped me relax and feel at ease. I took it way too far, and was drinking 6-8 units every night, so the cons far, far outweighed the pros. It went from making me happy to making me miserable, as I was hungover every single day. 

It’s temping to think I could pick one night each week and allow myself 2-3 units, which is enough to feel a buzz and some euphoria, but not enough to take me to an early grave. 

Now that I’ve written this out, I think I know what the answer is. I feel a little sheepish even posting this, and thought about using a throwaway account, but we’re all honest here, and I know this is a safe space.

And yet this is a different kind of ""1st"" for me. My first birthday without alcohol in what feels like forever. My first IRL birthday as version 2.0 of myself (as I like to think of the new, sober me).

The countless hours lost to alcohol in past years loom as an ever-present reminder to me of the reason for my metamorphosis.

Since joining this subreddit and applying my Version 2.0 patch 136 days ago, I've been tempted occasionally (especially in the early days) but the stories and people in the SD community have helped me to stay strong throughout.

With my newfound time and energy, I've begun eating better, riding to work more often, giving more time to weekend hobbies, weight training, cooking new and exciting food including lots of vegetarian meals and even baking cakes, pies, tarts and more. My physical and mental health is fantastic, I've dropped a lot of body fat (15-20kg!), and when I have a tough day at work my impulse to drink has all but vanished.

I have a wonderful wife who supports me and appreciates that I'm not pushing my new lifestyle on her. People still occasionally give me grief for quitting (Australian's love a drink!) but it doesn't bother me anymore.

Without this community, I'm not sure I would have been so successful so thank you all from the bottom of my heart for helping me to make such a resoundingly positive change in my life.

If you made it this far through my verbose rantings, then know that the biggest takeaway from this whole experience has been: I do not need alcohol to have fun, I can still meet brand new people and make them laugh and feel comfortable without it. Alcohol as a social lubricant is a total fallacy and crutch that I leaned on far too long. Be yourself. Be undeniably yourself and look for ways to connect with people and make them happy without sacrificing what makes you the person you are.

Thanks again everybody, spread love and happiness and look after one another.

I’ve tried telling her even just to hide it so I don’t know she’s drinking and she just puts them in a black bag in the beer crisper. She claims not to have a problem but gets ANGRY that she can’t have beer in the house openly, when I said she could hide it but I just can’t have the temptation for the first few weeks.  She’s the breadwinner and it’s her house, but she keeps demanding all this change from me and enabling my habits to such a degree that I suspect it’s subconsciously intentional. 

I thought about drinking ALL DAY yesterday. I ate a bunch I chugged soda I forgot I decided to quit every ten minutes and thought “time to go to the shop!” before remembering I was done and I didn’t want to live like that anymore.  I was definitely having craving but I was actually proud, excited, hopeful to think I was finally battling this demon and really giving it my all!

  Then she comes home with two tall boys, gets mad I opened one, said she’s going to get another and comes back with a 12 pack. 

  I can’t resist my favorite beer sitting in my fridge on day one. 

  She doesn’t want to even acknowledge she has a problem. 

  I don’t want to live like this. I don’t want to live with her like this. 

My head hurts.

Thank you for listening.

*Edit* - I can see how this post looks like shifting responsibility to my wife, but my issue is more being in a home with a fellow alcoholic that repeatedly denies either of us has an issue - to the point of belittling me when I discuss the topic and downplaying how hard it is to resist a beer in the fridge.  I’m realizing / acknowledging that my wife is not going to be a support during this, and that she has a problem with me not drinking. This is hurtful and painful but important to realize.  

Also, just because it’s easy for some of you to have beer in your home from day one doesn’t make me wrong or weak-willed for acknowledging that I need a few days to dry out before I can resist accessible temptations. There’s bars within a few blocks of me, I won’t go out, but my wife drinking our favorite beer less than 72 hours in during our standard wind down “schedule” is too much for me. I will be going camping alone to get the first week out without booze in my face or enabling myself via other’s lack of concern for my well being. To each their own. Thank you everyone.",17

I am a professional with a stressful and high visibility job, loving partner, and....I’m pretty sure a drinking problem. 

I started drinking as a teenager with my friends and didn’t immediately notice any red flags. When I went to college at a Big-10 school my drinking ramped up— but so did everyone around me! Drinking was the center of our social world- bars, football games, boozy vacations. I always succeeded in school, held a job, and left with a 4.0 GPA and admission to graduate school. I completed grad school and have a high stress job where in interact with hundreds of people a year professionally.

My problem is my drinking has shifted from fun, partying to a way to manage my stress and anxiety. After a busy day, I crave a bottle of wine (or more) to manage my stress and just relax. Recently, my partner has noticed that I have been secretly drinking and lying to him. Lying is very uncharacteristic of me and our relationship. I am so fearful that I have a drinking problem, but also feel like the change is so hard and I have a VERY big stubborn streak.

I’ve driven drunk, lied to my partner, rotate gas stations to avoid looking like an alcoholic. I’m scared and alone, and because of my job too nervous to go to meetings. There is also a part of me that doesn’t want to stop and still enjoys drinking (especially the times out with friends).

I have known this for the last few weeks but sort of didn't want to admit it to myself. The years of drinking left my life rather lackluster and empty. I have no friends, and am struggling against the realities of middle age and all that entails, including the difficulty of creating a social network from scratch. 

I think the time change and all the darkness has added to the trouble, but I seem at a loss for why I am waking up in the morning. If I were to die I would have unpaid student loan debts and leave the few people around me with a pile of junk they had to figure out how to get rid of. So I am paying debts, and getting rid of things so I am not such a burden. Hobbies have no interest and seem pointless, 'career' is a dead end, blah blah blah. 

Enough about me, I want to hear about the struggles of others and hopefully hear some stories with happy endings, since a happy ending is what I am having trouble imagining.

First of all AA is amazing and helps so may people, please don't take this as a knock against it.  

I am around 2.5 years sober and I have a unique way of staying sober that works for me.  I never went to AA or did the steps, I got out of treatment for the first time and have been sober since.  I try to be humble every day and I am not going to give myself any kind of a pat on the back until 5 years sober as I know this is a lifelong journey.

When I was in treatment and out of treatment, I found the hardest thing was just not thinking about alcohol.  It was every where and it was very difficult to not think about.  Over time, the thoughts went away and now I just don't think about alcohol.

My question:  I would think being in AA would make that process of getting alcohol out of your brain a lot tougher, it may never get out of your mind as you are constantly talking about it.  Also, when going to AA and hearing of people falling off the wagon, I feel like that would make it seem like it happens to everyone, so I could maybe rationalize falling off the wagon myself.   

Are these real concerns personally to anyone who goes to AA, or can someone help me understand more?  

People reach out to me when they want to quit drinking, I usually try to help get them into treatment and let them decide for themselves about their road to recovery.  Maybe I should be advising for them to go to some AA meetings first before going straight to treatment?

Well another Friday has arrived, and as the new norm, I'll not be drinking tonight. 

I'm coming up on four years of sobriety.   At times, it can be a grind, other times, when i wake up, I still can't believe I've made it this far.

Fridays are still a struggle, but nothing compared to what it was like in the beginning.   Having a plan, especially in the beginning was crucial to my success.  I still have a plan.  It's a bit more flexible now, but still a plan.

Life is still difficult at times.   I'm not where I wanted to be.  I'm feeling quite anxious about not really working and having doubts about the direction I chose to take.   

Basically, I can't find a job and I'm feeling discouraged about it.  I'm just trying to stay positive, and be optimistic.   

One thing though is that drinking will definitely not make things better.

Tonight, I'm going to take my daughter to her mom's for the weekend.  Then going to the grocery store and that's about it.  But that's enough.

Sleep mood bank account is better.

I will definitely drink again but I don't know when. And I'm in no rush. I've basically dropped all real desire I've done everything I like to do drunk sober and had just as much fun. I've improved my coping skills without chemical crutches.

I would highly suggest every person over 21 take an extended period of sobriety to learn about themselves. 

150 days is my minimum suggestion. And if your like me you may find that a lot of your personal relationship with alcohol and substances is romanticized.

It's no secret Americans are prone to over consumption. We generally eat too much fat too much carbs too much nutritionally void food. Too much media too much social media (✋guilty).

And too much alcohol. And it's hardly our fault we are bombarded by it from mega corporations who don't give a fuck about you support the destruction of the environment and the exploitation of people.

Everytime I cut something out that I pay for with money or my data / attention it benefits me hugely. But societal (capitalist?) Pressure makes it hard to continue indefinitely. Wether it's being passed on for promotions cause I won't get drunk with my boss. Or working so late I'm too exhausted to cook so I opt for the easy option of take out or delivery.

I learned in this journey that moving across the country  away from a lot of my friends working a lot and not seeing my LA friends as much as I should I associated alcohol with fun times with friends and it's not and I'm very happy to have identified and broken that association. And I still have work to do to be better about making time for the things that make me happy and spending time with the people I love.

This year I advanced my career my fitness my bank account my art my communication and my compassion in ways I'm not sure I would have if I was drinking to blow off steam every few weeks.",18

I've been ""sober"" 5 months today.  I say it in quotes because I technically was sober from alcohol for 4 months before I intentionally relapsed one day to see if I could handle it.  I of course went overboard and said ""okay, that was bad"" and held off for a week.  Then I tried to drink casually at dinner and was fine but as soon as I got home I was looking for more.  Long story short I realized I can't moderate.  So I am now 20ish days alcohol-free.

But I also used ""sober"" in quotes because the whole time I wasn't drinking alcohol I was still smoking weed.  I am now 12ish days completely alcohol/marijuana free.  And I am ANGRY.

I am a very easy going person who rarely shows anything other than a positive demeanor, probably to a fault, but this week I feel like I'm going to burst.  I was playing a video game that upsets me from time to time but I was screaming my head off, cursing life and my very existence!  I was so embarrassed to show this side of me.

Nah - you really do have to deal with real life as a sober person at some point.

Fortunately being sober has given me the opportunity to be present with myself. It helps to recall that anger is a non-permanent human emotion, that I became angry as opposed to something making me angry, and that this isn't a life-changing event. While I wish I wasn't angry, my experience as a substance abuser has taught me booze does not cure anger. Drinking on account of being angry would basically amount to throwing a temper tantrum.

Now, I don’t know if my ultimate goal is complete sobriety forever, or complete sobriety for some time, or moderation forever or for some time, or what, so I figured it would be ok to do a little field research. It was a low key night at home, I didn’t go to the store for more, I didn’t get drunk, nothing wild or “bad” happened - hell, I had more beer in the fridge and didn’t reach for any more (though more often than not, I do). I went to bed normally and fell asleep no issues. 

Here’s where the issues began. Even that low quantity ruined my sleep in comparison to going to bed stone cold sober. I woke up at 5 am with my stomach screaming at me. When my alarm went off, I snoozed it for an hour because I didn’t feel rested like I had every other day this week. I must have cramped up in my sleep or something because now I’ve got a mean stomachache that is sticking around.

2019-11-22 10:50:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e02sgf/fomo/,FOMO,"Prior to stopping my consumption of alcohol, I had a huge obstacle in front of me in the shape of a dark cloud which I was convinced would rain on every social interaction. I call it a cloud because the shape was undefined. It seemed to encompass things like: a fear of being socially isolated, a fear of “not being trusted” by people still quaffing whisky and wine, a fear of being “too stiff” and cold when engaging with people under the influence, a fear of loneliness, and in short…a fear of missing out.

A lot of people have experienced and commented on this type of sensation in this group. 

At first this FOMO haunted me when being around drinking while maintaining my clear head. They just seemed to be having so much fun. It was frustrating to watch them switch off and disengage with the world with the simple tipping of a cup. Everything just seemed more entertaining for the people drinking around me. Netflix was more interesting, Card Against Humanity was more brazen, back and forth banter was more hilarious- or at least that’s how it felt. It was like I lost my secret decoder ring on how to have social communications.
As time passed it became clear that this was actually only half true. 

I won’t lie, drunk people really do have their own world of entertainment. I even miss it. Although I was not a “loud” drunk or sloppy happy drunk, I still felt the booze helped me engage socially on a level I didn’t have without it. With that being said, remember that I mentioned it was only half of the truth.

The other half can only be viewed through clear eyes. I’ve been drinking since my teen years so there was really no context for me to see this side of the world. This past year has been fascinating and heartbreaking all at once.

Drunk talk gets boring to me pretty fast. Boozy breath trying to articulate big points makes me feel like Brainiac. I’m usually about 10 thoughts ahead of my sloshed counterparts as I wait (sometimes impatiently) for them to get to the damn point without all the sing-songy drama. I’ve never seen so many people try to make the same point over and over because they think I’m not hearing them. I can assure you that I am, I just don’t feel the need to have huge reactions-mostly because I’m not drunk. 

Drunk behavior is shallow and blunt. I’m 100% confident mine was as well. The people I love will often turn into a mouthy Id after a few drinks go into their blood. My internal sober raging condescension has to be kept in check and I’ve gotten very good at just nodding and waiting for them to finish a point. Yep, this all sounds pretty self-centered, and I fully welcome that critique. I’ve learned a lot about patience during my sobriety. I can see this lesson is going to keep me busy for a long time. 

All that being said, there is another sober territory that I have acquainted myself with over time. I have clarity and vision to commit to things now. Instead of “never having the time,” I have much more freedom to engage the world from a subtle and finely detailed vantage point. The achingly beautiful world strikes me on mornings when I wake up and photograph the sunrise without even a whisper of mental pain from boozy nights. It touches me when I can fully explain myself with carefully chosen words that haven’t been slurred or stumbled over. The beauty moves me when I can devote uninterrupted attention to the astonishing wonder of my children. I always knew these things, but they were subterranean. I could see them before but never hold them in sharp focus for more than a few moments. Now I have the time and now I have the focus. I so appreciate the gift of life and the vehicle that carries that life. Not to get too snobbish, but Shakespeare said it best (through Hamlet):

“What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a god!”

So yeah – there may be some FOMO, but you know what I’m not missing out on? Hangovers, bad behavior, risky driving, moody outbursts, shallow conversations, people I barely know claiming they have some deep insight into me because they shared a beer, lack of attention to my family, and a lack of insight into my plight and position in the world. Nope. I don’t miss that.",15

So, after 13 long years of abuse, I threw out the rest of the beer in the fridge, and began a journey.  A journey that has included great emotional turmoil, and uncertainty.  How do you change something you've been doing for so long?  How will I ever be the same person I was before?  My daily life was wracked with anxiety, panic, agoraphobia, and a foreboding sense that the most important part of me had been taken away.

It took me a long time to realize that this journey was actually about \*not\* being the same person anymore.  That was the goal.  Because who I am now had been buried for so long, watching as an alcoholic zombie shuffled about this daily life, stealing moments from who I really was.  Missing opportunities, creating regrets, wronging those I loved, all while my real self cried out, unheard in the deep recesses of my mind, constantly treading water in a lonely ocean of alcohol.

Some days have been very difficult.  But once I found my footing, I tried to face each day with a renewed sense of gratitude.  I told myself that for 13 years, I woke up almost daily thinking ""I can't wait for this day to be over.""  And I reminded myself how tragic it must be, to be given the gift of another day, and only wish for it to be gone.

I have met some truly remarkable people on this journey.  People who are selfless, almost reckless, in their capacity to love and support.  People who very well may be angels placed on this earth.  Without them, there is no new me.  So to the folks on this sub, and in the IRC Chat, I say Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.  Every person I've met in this weird and wonderful support community is a small part now of the new me that I have had to build up on top of a foundation of rock bottom.  And I will continue building, and continue fighting, because there is only one choice now.  There is only one truly important decision for me to make each day, and it is that \*I will not drink with you today.\*

I woke up so thankful that it was just a dream! I’m actually going to be with my mom and sister this weekend so I’m sure it was some anxiety manifesting in the form of a dream.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I’ve got pretty much the whole gamut of shit going wrong: legal troubles in two states, a car repair that insurance probably won’t cover because I made a false claim and they’ll likely drop me, a relationship that’s barely hanging on by a thread, permanent damage to my relationships with my family, a well-intentioned father who basically said he’s going to kidnap me so I don’t just sit in my hotel room and drink for 5 days straight...which I know I probably would, a job that’s barely hanging on...you name it. 

I have a support network. I have a prescription for naltrexone (when I take it). I’m in an intensive outpatient program that I legitimately like - I had a great first week last week. So why the fuck can’t I stop?! I keep thinking I’m stronger and every damn time I just fall flat. 

My dad stopped drinking 4 years ago and said he doesn’t miss it. He’s still at the bar every week to see his friends and drink his Diet Pepsi. I know it can be done and even with someone with my genetics. So I have hope.

But right now I just feel like my stepmom’s nickname for my dad when he was drinking: Captain Moron",9

This is a place I frequent a lot and would often leave around 1.30am on a Thursday night, absolutely leathered, having spent around £45 quid on frankly sweet FA (using the excuse of a FREE gig to spend MORE money on booze like an idiot). I would then spend the next day... nay TWO days feeling horrendous after 5 hours sleep and undoubtedly achieve nothing at work and spend the weekend in isolation due to spending too much and feeling like I'd need to punish myself. On one particularly bad outing at this venue I stepped off the train to pretty much faceplant the asphalt on arrival at my stop. Conductors asking if I'm okay. Awoke to find I'd lost an expensive pair of Ray Bans bought for me by my ex-partner as a gift. Classic stuff really.

&#x200B;

Anyway, last night I thought 'screw it- gotta get out sometime'. This is my longest uninterrupted period of sobriety yet. I got there, the place was quiet. Straight to the bar to order a 0% Becks topped with lemonade. Got my vape charged to avoid buying cigs. To go over the minimum card limit I had to get 2- that's £5 and that's my night sorted. (It's funny how I'd down a beer but not a pint of lemonade...) Have a nice time and head off before the last band as I've got work at 6am this morning (currently writing this during a quiet moment). Wasn't tempted to drink at all and I felt pretty elated as I finally get out the sodding rain and into bed at 12.30am after the 40 minute tram ride back. Only had 4.5 hours sleep but I feel pretty dang good.

&#x200B;

Now here's what I realised on the way back- previously I would have had 2 choices: either go to the gig, aim for 'a couple of drinks', end up having about 7 and throwing all caution to the wind- causing today to be absolute hell for my body and mind, and me to regret ever leaving the house. OR be so worried about overdoing-it that I'd just not even bother- choosing instead to sulk inside and tell myself I don't deserve to do anything ever because I always fuck it up.

But instead, I chose to go and experience the event- not the drinking associated with it. And that meant I could eat my cake AND have it too. And I realised- I can actually go out MORE now. Not less. Because I won't have to turn things down for fear of not being able to stop at 1- because that 1 doesn't even exist. Early morning? No problem- I can deal with being slightly tired. And shit- I spent £5 last night on an evening that would usually set me back nearly £50. I could do it 8 times over and still be under my usual spending amount. I could go out for a classy meal this evening and still be under. It's crazy!

&#x200B;

So that's just a thought I had. It seems to me this is opening more doors, not closing them. I won't lie- conversation doesn't come as easy, but once the initial anxiety passes you can ease into it. So for anyone worrying if going sober will mean the death of doing anything ever- it's not always the case. IWNDWYT. (sorry if this is ineloquent- I've had 4.5 hours sleep after all hahah)",8

I miss not feeling alone in bed, while he is out drinking or at a strip club or as he calls it “on an adventure.” I miss not feeling scared he’ll do or say something embarrassing in front of my friends and family. I miss spending the day with him, being in the sunshine with him. I miss not feeling anxious when I get home from work, worried he’s already started drinking too much. I miss days when beer wasn’t the first thing he reached for. I miss being able to look at him in the eyes without feeling sad. I miss being able to look at him without being sad. I miss when he stood tall, and not swaying in a drunken stupor. I miss him caring about hygiene and taking regular showers. I miss not crying every day. I miss not feeling dread when I get home, prolonging as long as I can by idling the car in the driveway. I miss him driving without an interlock device in the car. I miss when he wasn’t a stranger.

Then the thought occurred to me that I’ve never drank like that, even in the beginning, and that I’ve never wanted to drink like that. I drank to black out, I drank to forget, I drank because I wanted to have even more fun. I’ve never wanted to just have a couple of drinks and go home. I want to pregame, go to the bar, and then finish off the bottle at home after. I always have. Could I moderate occasionally? Sure. But if I was truly honest with myself all I ever really wanted was to drink as much as possible without everyone else thinking it was an issue. When I stopped worrying about how to do that it was like the first time I was free in a long time. I went out, I didn’t take the first drink, and I didn’t worry about any of that old bullshit. I’m an all or nothing kind of person, and if I take one shot I want all the shots, so now I don’t take any. It’s so simple it amazes me it took so long to realize it, but when I was in the height of my alcoholism the thought never occurred to me. Maybe some people enjoy having **A** beer or **A** glass of wine, but not me, not ever. So the idea that somehow I will magically change into one of those people is absurd. Beating myself up over the fact that I couldn’t for so many years is what kept me drinking. So if you’re trying to moderate and finding that it’s not working, stop fighting it. It’s just not who we are. And that’s totally okay.",22

Its was really tempting hanging out with people and having a bottles of beer always in front of you . I always drank so i could enjoy music more never knew i could enjoy it just as well without it . I invested some of the money i saved by starting going to the gym . I didn't know how far i have fallen when i couldn't even lift 5-10kg of dumbbell i used to lift a lot more when I was younger I never felt so bad in my life cause i used to be  an active kid who loved playing football and practice karate I have quit all my hobbies for this lifestyle which has made me so weak . I could not even run a mile now without puking all over . my first week was just workout puke i felt so disgusted at myself for it . I used to be so out of life . Its seems like a little bit if interest have come back . I feel like i want to start doing some things i loved again . Its a like a new flame of life .At this point  I don't really know if life is really worth it to not waste away on such pleasures  . But i sure would like to try again and enjoy it.,3

So, yesterday, in the middle of alcohol haze I made a post here. I didn't read the community rules and didn't know that drunk posting is not allowed. My bad, it was a mistake and I apologize to you all.
But I'm sober now. This is my first day; the first day of my new life, if we want to add a dramatic feeling to it, haha. In all seriousness, though, it does feel like a different life. I've been drinking almost on a daily basis this last year. By this hour, usually, I'd be stumbling around my house, smoking and listening to music my drunk mind can't even comprehend. Today I came home from work, after passing, on my daily commute, 13 (I counted) convenience stores where I usually bought booze from. You see, yesterday, before my post was removed by a mod (and rightfully so), a few users replied with kind words of encouragement. I cherish those words and clung to them as I drove by my usual alcohol-grabbing spots. I came home and set to clean the mess my drunk self makes. Vodka, whiskey, tequila, beer bottles, cigarette buts, you name it. Now I'm sitting here in the living room (a nice, clean, living room, mind you, haha), feeling both hopeful and terrified at the same time. But I'll be fine, because everyday I read your posts and they keep me encouraged. I've been lurking for weeks now, trying to find the strength to put an end to this miserable lifestyle. 
I thank God for having found this sub.
We'll be reading each other a lot from now on, I asure you.
So, now I write the words I wanted to write yesterday: I will not be drinking with you today.
May we all stay strong. Thank your for the help.",16

 Warning, this will be long. I have to use this as a reference if I ever get the urge to drink again. Hopefully this will help someone else who may be struggling. 

Hold on to your seats, you're in for a ride. Here's how the conversation went. 

Me=SoberingReality

Beast=alcoholic brain

EM=Paramedics

After shaking, sweating, dry heaving, dark oily stools, and not eating for two days...

Me: I need to go to the hospital because this kindling is getting worse. I can't drive because who knows what my B. A. C. is and I'm shaking far too much.

Beast: Well, you can't call 911 because your house is a mess and they won't be able to get a stretcher in there. Plus, I you don't want the EMS staff to see you in that squalor.

Let me paint the picture: I just moved so there are boxes all over the place and I was laying on my couch with an overturned bag of chips, some socks, a bra, a towel I used to clean up some wine, an unhooked printer in the middle of the floor, and other junk. Wish I had taken a picture. 

Back to the story... 

Me: Yea, that makes sense. I will be okay in a couple of hours. I will just read about withdrawal online and see what other people did - take vitamins, drink Gatorade, take a cool bath.  But I don't want to take a bath because I don't want to drown in the bath. 

Beast: More wine will help alleviate the shakes. See if you have any left over from the 8 or 9 you drank. If not, see if Uber Eats, DoorDash, or one of the others will deliver. Push come to shove, just drive. The store is only a block away, what are the chances you'll get a DUI. Drive slow, you got this.

Me: No, if I get a DUI, I will definitely lose my job. Not to mention the cost. I will just give it a few more hours.

15 minutes went by, it felt like 3 hours though.

Beast: See, now you've let the stores close. Do you have any mouthwash? Scratch that, you use alcohol free because you had many months sober. Guess we'll just sit here until the stores reopen.

Me: Nope, I'm calling 911. I will pick up the bra and socks. Call 911 and can't give the dispatcher the address because 1. I'm too drunk and 2. I literally just moved in Wednesday. Dispatcher finally figures it out and sends EMS on their way. I stay on the phone with her until they get there.

EM: Hey we're here to help. Do you want to go to the hospital for help? There's a stretcher downstairs. Can you get some pants on? (oops). Let us check your kitchen to make sure your stove isn't on. Do you have any lit candles or cigarettes? Let us get your keys to lock up. Where's your remote so we can turn off your TV.  

They literally expressed no judgment. 

All of that to say, don't be afraid, embarrassed, or too proud. There are genuinely people willing to help.

I stayed in the hospital for 3 days. Being discharged today I came home to a wreck. Not just the items from the move in, I threw out 9 empty magnums plus I spilled wine behind my TV, dunno how. My TV is no where near where I was lying.

Now to pick up the pieces, clean the spilled wine from the TV and the carpet, clean the toilet, and most importantly get back into therapy and recovery meetings.

Don't have a TLDR.

-If you stayed on this roller coaster with me, thank you. 

-If this helps you, my pleasure. 

-If you have any questions, send me a message.

-If you're sober today, congratulations.",57

It took me several years to understand alcohol is addictive, I was addicted, and my life would be much better not drunk or hungover.

I found SIX 1.14L empty bottles and one 750mL bottle, both of vodka. 

For context:
1) I live a lone. So this does not account for what I also drink at home, which I don't have to hide
2) most of these are no more than a month or so old, and there are many more I managed to sneakily throw out while being a VISITOR in my own mother's home. Disgusting of me.

Some of the places i hid them were my usual spots so they were easy to find. Others.... Hiding places I have no memory of. I am not confident I found them all.

I am now on day four. I have only made it past day 5 once in the past... 5 years (I'm 27)

I refuse to do this anymore. I won't.

2019-11-21 23:09:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dzvndp/the_source_of_my_anxiety/,The source of my anxiety,"Tomorrow is two months for me and I’m comfortable in bed reflecting on the time that has passed. I started by telling myself that I’ve done a great job so far and I have myself and my surroundings to prove it. My home is looking complete (I’ve been renovating hardcore since my start date), my skin is better, my workout routine is better, I’m calmer... I’m calmer. I said it a few times and then reflected on the fact that my anxiety has been 90% eliminated. I say 90% because there have been two nights in the past month where situational factors elevated it, but it was gone by morning. But what I’m talking about is the nightly heart palpitations, pounding so deep sometimes I thought it would stop altogether. Terrified of dying in general. Night terrors. Sitting straight up and gasping after an hour of writhing trying to sleep. And all of this was the result of binge drinking once a week. All of that, gone. 

And so then I got to thinking even deeper about the anxiety. I’m a person who likes to accomplish things. I need to keep my hands busy. I need to create and I need to look upon my creation thereafter. Maybe that’s an illustration, maybe that’s replacing the closet door. I just need accomplishments. The hangovers, the days of lethargy and nausea that followed a binge and kept me locked under the covers, prevented me from doing things. And that gave me anxiety. I’ve realized I have issues with allowing myself a break, and I practice telling myself it’s ok to listen to my body (believe me, it’s definitely a practice because that is NOT second nature to me) but now I don’t feel anxiety when I do relax because it is MY CHOICE. I do not feel like I physically can’t. I do not feel limited, chained. I am consciously giving myself the chance to recharge, knowing full well I can tackle the world in the morning. 

None of this would be possible if I didn’t make a very real, very committed effort to give up binging (even just once a week) alcohol and vaping two months ago. 

I’m also grateful for this group of warriors, because reading your stories empowers me.

I want to introduce myself to the group. It’s been years since I’ve recognized I have a problem. I started drinking heavily in college, as many do, and just got worse after I graduated. 

I finally started looking up treatment options in 2016. I started the Sinclair method shortly thereafter and actually was very successful at moderating my drinking for about a year. 

However this past year has been bad. I haven’t drank today but still feel terrible coming off a weekend of heavy drinking and a two day bender Monday and Tuesday. 

Recently my GF of about a year seems to be slipping away. She knows I have an issue and she’s offered her support whole heartedly before. But she’s a drinker too (not a heavy one though) and I feel like all we’ve done recently is drink, and it’s causing cracks. She’s texting less, she’s doing more with her friends and rarely if ever includes me. 

What hurts the most though is that I’m trying. I voluntarily signed up to see a psychiatrist and a psychologist. I try and plan sober activities. Last week I wanted to go ice skating in Rockefeller center. She said she wanted to wait until they lit the tree and yet sure enough tonight she’s ice skating with her friends. 

I just want to be myself again. I want to do fun things with my girlfriend. I want to be involved in her life and know her friends. Most of all I want to stop feeling like a hot mess. 

I love reading everyone’s posts and I’m excited to contribute to this group and share in everyone’s journey.",8

At a certain point today, it hit me just how on top of things I was, even in all the craziness, and how I was handling everything calmly. I have had times in the past two weeks when my mind has wandered and romanticized what it would be like to drink. After my awareness of how great I was handling things at work, how confident I felt, how I was looking forward to the challenges coming up, I had a flash of thinking about drinking and nearly laughed. Why the *hell* would I want to change what is taking place??? Things are improving and will become even better still, I’m sure of it, with more days and months of sobriety. I’m going to blow that for booze??? I don’t think so.

Drinking will not do me any favours or improve a single thing. I am really starting to like myself, which I haven’t been able to say... well, I don’t think ever before, honestly. So, no thanks alcohol. Not anymore.

The first time you go to a movie without them, the first time they don’t call when they normally do, sleeping alone, the first holiday.    You can’t imagine these things without that person, you don’t know if you can survive it, and then with each one, you grieve, you muddle through and you get to the other side of the situation.

I literally live my dream life. I moved from England to Thailand...

When I was in the grip of it all, I used to wake up in a messy bedroom with empty bottles and dirty laundry everywhere…

Sometimes, I wouldn’t even bother having a shower before work because I was either in a rush or too hungover.

I was afraid to look at my phone because of the girls I had sent drunken messages too.

In fact, if I really think about how messed up things were, the list just goes on and on…

The good news is, I now wake up free.

Free from hangovers

Free from feeling like a disappointment

Free from despair

Free from the guilt.

I now wake up every day with energy, clarity and real joy.

Sure, I can look at my life and feel like it’s not 100% perfect. There are always things I want to improve. But, if I compare it to what life was like just a year and a half ago, I’m living the fucking dream. It’s night and day for crying out loud!

You know, even if you are just a few days sober, you are moving toward a better life!

If you are a few weeks sober, you are moving toward a better life!

If you are a few months sober, you are moving toward a better life!

With alcohol, our lives go to complete shit. I’ve been there, you’ve been there.

Living sober means our life keeps getting better. We go forwards instead of backwards…

If you’re having a tough day today, it will get better. Look at the many shining examples in this Reddit group.

Coming off those events I figured i didn’t have to hone in on how many drinks I was having and last night let loose while on a work trip. I spent the morning throwing up and sitting through meetings trying to not vomit.

Is there any way to actually achieve moderate drinking or will I just constantly have these moments of implosion until I decide to give it up entirely?",12

2019-11-21 18:48:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dzsc6c/hi_beautiful_people/,Hi beautiful people.,"Damn. What a year it’s been. Since last December, I realized that I definitely had a terrible relationship with weed and since then, I’ve been trying to stop smoking. I’m proud to say that today is my 58th day without weed. Hate to say that I’ve been on the fence in regard to alcohol all year. I did, however, stop drinking for 65 days earlier this year and felt amazing. I started drinking again a lot recently because I justified it by quitting weed. I wouldn’t say I hit a rock bottom on Saturday but it was definitely a huge realization that I needed to cut out the sauce for good. I drank so much and basically blacked out and I don’t remember much. One of the last things I remember is being upset on the Uber drive home with friends because one of them made a racist remark and the Uber driver continued laughing about it. Sad thing is, I can’t fully remember what the context was. All I know is that it upset me and when I’m drunk I show that shit. Well anyway, I didn’t say much but when we got to our stop, the driver tried shaking my hand to say bye but I ignored him all pissed off. When I’m under the influence I have no control over any of my emotions. I lost a friend because I had no control over my emotions one night and we haven’t been the same ever since. That night should’ve been a lesson but it wasn’t. I’m worried that I will have to learn the hard way. I mean I guess I’m so many ways I already have because I have the memory of nights I can’t remember and I get chills like an acid flashback. I guess my punishment is never knowing what I did. That’s enough to wake me up though. Coming to this realization has me feeling so low but at the same time so fucking free. My addictions and habits to my vices (combined with a bit of ptsd from childhood trauma)  were the reason I was always so depressed and anxious. Even tho I still feel shame and guilt from my drunken behavior, i also feel free as fuck. I’m finally free. I’m done with everything. Thanks for reading.",1

I've been worried about not drinking killing my social life, but over these last two months I've realized that my friends who drink are the least reliable ones. It's confusing to me, because on some days an alcoholic friend seems to care deeply about the relationship. But then one week later you can't seem to get ahold of them, or illicit any kind of genuine response when contact is made.

I think when an alcoholic tries to ""moderate"" their drinking, they just turn into binge drinkers. And when binge drinkers finally allow themselves to drink, they forget about everything else.

Making this realization is helping me not drink today. I don't want to be that kind of friend who cares more about booze than the relationship. What a shitty way to live and treat other people!

I remember years ago that I had a half full glass of wine I left out from the night before and a though crossed my mind “hmm, I could drink that before work. It’ll probably help with the stress.” It only happened once or twice over a year or so and it was always just a small portion.

I started REALLY drinking at work when I worked for a startup that had booze all over the office. It was normal for us to have a beer or two at lunch and have drinks during the afternoon. It was so accessible and easy to just grab a beer and continue working. It was also accepted by my co workers and bosses as normal. 

After I left that job, the desire to drink during the day didn’t go away. I was a full blown alcoholic by then and probably have for many years but now it started effecting my life and I started lying about it. 

Cut to a month ago. I got a new job. It’s another very high stress job and I was excited but SUPER nervous about it. I have major anxiety and depression and thought that by drinking before I went to work was a good way to calm my nerves and help with my social anxiety about meeting new people. But it only made it worse.

I would drink on my way to work and all during the day. And last week I got pretty drunk at work and fucked up few things. Like super easy things that shouldn’t be that hard. My bosses have called me out and understand that I’m still new but don’t understand why I’m making these easy mistakes so often. They basically said my attention to detail and overall work performance is just shitty. They put me on probation and will be having a meeting with me after thanksgiving. 

I stopped drinking last Friday. So almost a week. I have so much guilt and shame for my behavior and feel like such a terrible person. Who thinks that drinking during or before work is normal?! Like I get so mad at myself for being this way. I’m actively trying to make a change for the better and be a better person. 

I haven’t told anyone this before but it feels good to get it out. Thanks to the support of this community I do feel like I’m on a good path forward. IWNDWYT.",7

Mostly a lurker on here, but I wanted to share this with everyone. Today is day 70 for me. I also happened to complete IOP today as well. It was my third time in treatment in a little over 3 years. But this time was different. 

While I was in IOP, I experienced the most unbelievable two days of my life.  First, my beloved Pappa passed away. This was coming for a long time, as he was 93 and had hospice care. It was still a huge loss for my family. The following day my only remaining grandparent, my grandma on the other side of my family, suddenly passed away. This means both of my parents lost their only parent back to back days.  The final blow: that night my ex-boyfriend that I was still loved and had a complicated relationship with OD’d for the third time in his life.  But this time he couldn’t be revived. He was 33 years old. 

The following two weeks were the hardest of my life. Not only the pain of the loss and attending the funerals, but also during which I had to interact with my estranged sister that I hadn’t seen in two years due to her anger at my drinking. Needless to say it was emotional, painful, and confusing.  Still I didn’t drink. 

Today, upon completing I heard many words of encouragement at the changes they saw in me throughout this process. What touched me most though was that one after one they all named me their inspiration going forward because if I could stay sober through that, they felt they could do it too. Suddenly, I’m a role model. I never would have believed that 10 weeks ago. 

I appreciate all of you sharing your stories so much. It has helped keep ME sober during this surreal chain of events. Now that I have less accountability of being in treatment all week, the real work starts. IWNDWYT... ODAT.",20

Just a bunch of people trying not to drink today and trying to help others.  It's seems like such a simple thing, just make a post every day in that thread.  How could such a simple thing help me deal with something as deadly as alcoholism?  

Well I don't know - all I know is that I found it a great comfort to wake up and see a new thread and think, ""Ok now take a moment to make a post.  Talk about the weather and be sure to include the IWNDWYT (I Will Not Drink With You Today) tag.  

Simply typing it out forced me to say the words in my head and as I did, I rededicated myself to not drinking.  I would also often think about that commitment as my day unfolded because sometimes this newly sober life sucks ass.  It's hard sometimes.  Emotions are on a roller coaster, there seems so much to do and never enough time to do it, there's also a lot of ""wreckage of my past"" that's still present is my life that is demanding attention and to be cleaned up and so much more.  Ugh....it can be exhausting but also demoralizing.

So I'd pop into /r/stopdrinking and read threads from others who were going through this life sober, or trying too and it helps.  It really does.  To know we're not alone is a great comfort and to see so many people doing it is an inspiration.

So thanks to everyone for what you do here.  Even the simplest things can help. 

Here's to many more months of sobriety. :)

The thing is that my (27M) father (63) is a really heavy functional drinker and it's quite hard for me not to drink with him, since when we drink together it's the only time we communicate and are able to share. If we are not drinking he's a really hard person to be with, but right after the first scotch or few beers he turns into a person likeable to be around.

I don't see him much, so drinking those few occasions means a good time, but since i've started the cut, the last times i wake up destroyed as i someway unconsciusly try to keep up with him.

I'm 6 months sober. It's been something I'm very proud of not from a point of self-righteousness. But from a place where I've proven to myself I can do it, for a second time. I've saved an incredible amount of money, my mental breakdowns have decreased by 300%, and if I do something stupid it's from a mentally conscious one. 


But I'm starting to wane. Drinking is still very social and I'm now going without that social aspect. Parties are completely blocked off for me. All the alcohol, the smell, the people having fun and being relaxed...it just hurts, to be honest. I'm outgoing normally, but in big groups I need something to help. I need courage to talk to people, to hop from group to group (or even slide into one at all). To be able to talk to that girl and flirt because I have a least a little more courage to be relaxed and conversational. I went to my first party a few weeks ago and I was shaking. I had to leave abruptly and I spent the rest of the night crying. 


Speaking of big groups, I'm now finding that even big discord chats are hard. I used to be able to jump into voice chat or keep up with the ever scrolling text channels, and just be in the moment. But now, I can barely even do that. 


I know part of it is learning how to do some things again but sober. I don't miss being an alcoholic. I don't miss being crumpled on the floor crying my eyes out. I don't miss making completely dumb choices that I wake up regretting. But I'm so painfully watching from the sidelines all these fun moments, all this socializing that i just can't bring myself to be a part of yet. 


I'm stressed out of my mind from life, I'm having dreams of drinking, and I just keep having this lingering thought that I'm going to relapse.

There was a big annual social event in our town that a lot of people go to (and drink at ). I asked her if she wanted to go, and she said ""Not really. I don't like going to parties where the adults drink a lot and then get loud and do stupid things. Sometimes it's scary.""

Turns out that at the same event in a previous year, my daughter was supposed to spend the night at a friend's after the event, but the friend's dad was too drunk to drive them home. Her friend was crying, refusing to get in the car, and had to call an older sibling to come drive them home. (I had already left, after giving my daughter permission to spend the night, and I didn't find this out until later. I'm glad she didn't get in the car with the drunk dad but I'm sad that they had to deal with that.)",3

We recently celebrated our 10 year anniversary by taking a trip to Europe (Copenhangen and Holland) to see a few of our favorite bands (Of Monsters and Men, Might Oaks, Lumineers, and Noah Khan). 

I quit drinking Sept. 1st of this year (just as an experiment, which persisted through October and now November), and wasn't sure if I'd feel triggered by this vacation. When we fly, we use miles/points to fly business class, which means access to the lounge and all the free drinks one could wish for. When we travel, we often will pin Craft beer places to try out and dinner out always includes beverages. Sometimes when we go on trips, we'd even bring a few of our favorite beers to enjoy at sunset. When we go to concerts, we always drink beer.

I wasn't sure what to expect heading into this trip as there were so many ""things"" that we'd do where I normally would have been drinking...but I didn't drink at all and I can say that it was by far one of the top 3 vacations I've ever taken. I didn't miss drinking for a second, in fact I was very aware that if I were drinking, I'd be missing out on the experience of it all and chasing after that next beer. I felt great the entire time and I really enjoyed the concerts/music, though I did get a bit annoyed by some inconsiderate drinkers who felt the need to talk during the show. I ate what I wanted and drank lots of hot chocolate (instead of Glogg) to warm up while walking the streets of Copenhagen. My husband had a few drinks each evening and it didn't bother me at all. I know he drank less on this trip than if I were drinking too!

My husband asked if I was ever going to drink again, to which I said ""I don't know, but I feel so good without drinking that I have no desire to right now."" I asked him if me not drinking was a problem for him, to which he answered ""no"" (thank goodness). We met in college and drinking together has been a part of our relationship since day 1. Neither of us are/were heavy drinkers, but I definitely questioned what our relationship would look like if I wasn't drinking since that was like a hobby/habit for us.

I feel that the longer I distance myself from drinking and the more places I go/things I do without drinking, that I used to do while drinking, the less scary or weird it feels to imagine life without drinking and the more exciting and adventurous the future feels. 

I wish that I wouldn't have been so scared about what life, relationships, concerts, etc. would be without drinking for so long and tried this sober-life sooner.

It doesn't make me ""feel great,"" it doesn't make me ""charismatic,"" and it destroys my productivity, self confidence, sense of purpose, and leaves me depressed and withdrawn. This is all after two weeks now of not drinking, after 15 years of hard boozing. 

So anyway, Tuesday night I met up with a group of friends, grabbed a craft root beer, for like $5 including the tip, and had the most incredible time just hanging out and riding the good vibes in the room. I was engaged on a level I never could be when I was drinking (since I was usually trashed) and ended up meeting cool people, making fun holiday plans, and best of all, I had my ass in bed and sound asleep by 10:30!

Last night, I was walking out of yoga and I passed a bar where I recognized a girl hanging out in front that I had run into a few days earlier at the local PCC (overpriced yuppy groceries, but damn good salad bar). She told me to join her and her friends for a drink and I did, but I got a seltzer with lime, and just hung out. A few weeks earlier, and I would have been a wreck within a few hours, but this time, I chatted for a bit, got her number and peaced out. Same thing, in bed by 10:30 and I'm feeling rested on a flight to Idaho for work. 

My point here is that everything I thought I was getting from alcohol, I actually attained sober, and I could enjoy the memory the next morning! 

I've heard lots of other people mention it but the key (at least for me) wasn't focusing on all the negative effects of alcohol on my life (of which there are plenty), but instead realizing alcohol itself sucks. It doesn't taste any better than the root beer, it doesn't make me feel any better (honestly, it makes my wits slow, and I turn into a moron), and it doesn't boost my confidence. Being sharp and sober does...

For those of you that made it this far, thanks for letting me get this off my chest, and best of luck to all of you living lives that are full of meaning and awesome memories that we can actually remember!",12

I haven't told him about my own inner struggles but I need to admit it to myself and them him. We have always been a family of self medicators, our dad being an alcoholic who hasn't had a drink in over 20 years after several DUIs and getting his license taken away for most of my life. 

I don't drink often but when I do, I cannot drink in moderation and the next day I am usually reminded by my boyfriend about things I don't remember despite how I well kept I was. I need to stay away from alcohol. My boyfriend tells me I am so different when I drink. He isn't wrong and I get defensive since he used the word ""ratchet"". It's not worth it to put him through what I went through with a past partner and even with my dad. 

I definitely get depressive and anxious a few hours after going to bed after drinking and it's not worth it anymore. I feel bad for what he witnesses even if I don't know what that is. I need to gain control of the rollercoaster and the only way to do that is not to drink.

2019-11-21 12:21:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dzmjna/about_addiction/,About addiction,"Forgive me for posting twice in one day, just wanted to share some personal observations about addiction. 

All addictions are deceptive by nature.  The mind must both lie to itself to protect itself from the harsh truth in the midst of addiction,  and to others to sustain the addiction. Alcohol is the most deceptive of them.  Addiction to other substances is pretty straightforward. You use it, it rewards you immensely,  you use it again until you can't feel good without it. While the same is true of alcohol, it's so much easier to lead a semi productive life or at least skate by. Even if it takes a heavier toll on the body than most substances do, it's a pattern that develops slowly and in good company.  Blame it on society maybe. American culture is soaked in booze. I can obliterate my mind for 4 dollars if I really want to. I can go to a nice store and deal with orderly, lawful, friendly people to get it. I can get fucked up at parties and use recklessly with 100 percent encouragement from peers. The media normalizes even glorifies it as a foundation of suave coolness. Classism creates a stereotype of the staggering homeless buffoon brown bagging a bottle and tells you as long as you're not that, you  are ok. 


If you're single like me it's pretty normal to always be drinking after 5. I live in a posh, gentrified neighborhood and  it's pretty common to see yuppies gathered at a pub drinking at brunch, sometimes the crack of dawn. 

I've never had a substance ruin my life like alcohol. Coke made me broke, speed made me crazy, but they were so much easier to quit.  Alcohol put me on a one way train to the morgue and I hopped out st the last stop. It robbed me of my ambition, my sanity, my safe/y and autonomy, my dignity,  my self esteem and the esteem of my peers, my integrity, my competence at work, my hobbies, my love life, my devilish handsomeness . And every time I relapsed....knowing this..... knowing the agony of withdrawal, knowing that I hate the feeling of just one beer worse than sobriety, it did it anyway, having fooled myself.  Actually believing and intending to have just one.  I wish we could all be this honest about alcohol. Nobody is expected to smoke crack responsibly. Just sayin.",5

I'm sure there a million worse horror addiction stories here, but I write as I realized that my drinking dependency/ made me uncomfortable. I stopped drinking every alternate day a year ago. At my most uncontrolled, 2 years ago I was having a 180 ml around (5-6 drinks) of whisky or rum or gin every 3 days, didn't think i had any problem due to a sense of attempted macho stupidity. I'd drink alone after work, and any opportunity with friends would not be turned down. 

Last year I began to feel uncomfortable at how much I was drinking so I ""cut down"" my drinking to once a week, and in that week only 2 beers  or 2-3 drinks. which I patted my self on the back that I've successfully averted any potential of life ruining alcoholism. But about some months later I realized that I was desperately looking forward to that once a week fix. I couldn't imagine going ahead without having that. So I missed a week of it to try and decrease further, ended up drinking more the next week as if I made up for the missed one.

Last week, I never felt more nauseated at my scared ness to break the routine and stop drinking. It's been 10 days, and time has never felt longer and I've never felt more useless and like I'll go crazy...but I haven't drank....so, that's it, I'm hoping to keep on staying sober and just wanted to let it out.",13
2019-11-21 10:23:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dzksr3/dh_funeral_triggers/,DH Funeral Triggers,"Firstly, I don't really like the al-anon community and I too am trying to stay sober, so I'm posting this here...

DH has FLD (Fatty Liver Disease) and has not been able to stay completely sober since diagnosed. He has however been able to cut back quite significantly. He used to drink 3-8 beers every single night for years and now he has 2-5 drinks, two nights a week. So far I've been able to stay sober for 18 days, ever since I  decided for the first time to quit completely. 

Today he got a phone call that his estranged aunt died. No one in his family liked her or saw her very often. Anytime they did talk about her it was negatively. I'm worried that this is a reason for DH to drink. I think this because, his family drinks heavily and encourages each other to drink more and I know that DH won't tell them he has FLD because I think that deep down he doesn't actually want to stop drinking. I asked him if he wanted my 100% honest opinion and he said yes, so I gave it. He didn't like that I said this would ""..be a huge excuse to go drink with your family."" He says he wants to be there for his dad so I basically said, ""Go. If you feel like you need to be there for your dad then go. I am not making demands just giving my opinion.""

Pretty sure he's pissed off because he said something like, ""...not for me. it'd be about seeing my dad on a difficult time. Fuck it. Forget it.""

I made it clear that if it's about supporting his dad he should go but I have a feeling that he's going to carry this around, secretly resenting me, and blaming me for him not being able to go even though I made it clear it's his choice. I believe he might carry this around and secretly resent me because he's done it before. He's been angry at me before because I didn't like one of his friends. This friend made lude sexual comments about me, to my face and in front of my DH. DH then ended the friendship (After me explaining for hours why I didn't like the guy...). Months later, DH confessed that he actually resents me for not getting to be friends with the guy anymore even though it was his decision to terminate the friendship. 

tl;dr I told him to do what he wants so why does he keep blaming me for giving my opinion? Anybody ever dealt with something similar? Might you think this is an excuse to drink, too? I know this isn't where I should ask about friends and family but this is seriously the only community that gives me actual sincere opinions. 

(Sorry for the shitty sentence structure I have a teething/crying 4 mo. in my ear, haha!)


EDIT: Things just got way worse....

I'll just post the conversation because I can't re-explain this through my own filter if I want honest opinions...

ME: I'm not going to apologize for thinking 10 steps ahead, that's just who I am, but I am sorry if this is overwhelming for you. Even though your family only had negative things to say about her and you guys never really visited her or invited her over, you did grow up with her around so I get why it might be upsetting for you.

DH: you just always think ""BOOZE"" when its a kind loving family situation

ME: I don't always but I do now. I am trying to be a new, sober version of myself, so yeah, abstaining from alcohol is at the front of my mind most of the time. I won't feel bad about that. But I do think I should've been more sensitive to the fact that your aunt died. 
I think it would be a sign of denial if we pretended drinking wasn't going to happen and that your FLD doesn't matter.

DH: if thats the case, abstain from all friends and events because there may be booze there
i mean come on at some point you have to realize thats your thing and not everyone elses
if you want to not go cool
but pushing that on everyone else
like wtf

ME: I am not telling your family not to drink, I am worried you will. Are you trying to pretend that I shouldn't be concerned whether you drink or not?

DH: i'm saying hey someone significant died and you jump right to BOOZE
just forget it

ME: Plus, you're not being very supportive because I am only 18 days sober.


DH: yeah make a death about you
forget it
i havent said a goddamn thing about you or your sobriety this whole conversation i'm not being not supportive

From my perspective, if anything, I was making the death of someone his family didn't even like, about HIM not drinking. Not me. I feel like saying, ""Fine, then tell your family you have FLD when you get there and I'll believe that this isn't an excuse to get drunk."" Also, I have decided to post this in al-anon too even though I usually don't like their heavily lensed responses. I am so angry that he said I was making it about me that I am shaking.",2

I understand that, and I’m here for you, just like the rest of this community. 

This community never ceases to amaze me with the amount of support offered and the strength in our midst. Groups like this ought to be celebrated if you ask me, so here’s to all of you!! 🎉 IWNDWYT",2

It’s a hangover free day. And I think I’m on day 32 booze free.  It feels great. Thank you to the wonderful community here for the great support.  


My challenge. I wake up each morning totally dehydrated feeling like a raisin.  Feel tired and lethargic for the first 30 minutes till I chug water and coffee.  I guess I may not be drinking enough H2O? I try to get 2 litres a day.  But that’s not much compared to 6 or 8 500ml tall boys of beer I used to consume.  

Any tips for staying hydrated more efficiently or is it just forming a new habit to drink more water ?",3

I realized all the things drinking and smoking took from me, and that they offered NOTHING positive except feeding my addiction (which is still not positive but to an addict it's what HAS to be done). 

I have had horrible mood swings, brain fog, stress, denial, fear and depression. I have had joy, deep moments with my kids, sober and meaningful conversations with my husband, alot of sleep, more energy, changed vision, easier breathing, increased ability to function,  decreased yelling in the house, and a form of peace I haven't felt in years. 

Thank you everyone who has shared their hope, downfalls and successes. I have been here daily and it helps to know I'm not alone. This has attributed to my success and I hope to help someone else on this difficult but Rewarding sober journey.

I have been a drunk for 27 years. Drink owns me. 

All I do is go to work then drink from 11:30am. I’ve taken the week off work to ‘clean up’ and all I do is drink. I tell my wife I’m going to the gym and I sit alone in the bar across the street from the gym drinking in silence 

I look tired and empty. I feel tired and empty. I look like a drunk and a creep

What I realize is that I won’t stop drinking despite all the help on offer. Despite waking each day saying I MUST stop. 

Drinking fills the loneliness and emptiness of my life. As much as I don’t want to be, and I really have tried not to be, I accept I will always be lonely and without purpose. Drinking numbs those feelings. It  has me 100%. I am drinks bitch and it will kill me.",2

Especially the last 2-3 months before quitting. I would easily wake up at 2am in the morning, still drunk from the previous day and start drinking again until I went to bed that evening. I would day drink regularly. When I had to work I would start drinking as soon as I could and would only stop when I almost passed out. I only had two modes: drunk or hungover.

A week ago I called it quits. When I quit I spoke to a professional just ensure I knew what was coming. She said I was a top-up alcoholic, which I took to mean that I drink to stay drunk. I suppose that is an accurate description.

The first 2 days after quitting were the worst - a combination of a hangover and withdrawals I suppose. After that everything has been a breeze. I have switched to alcohol free beer, and now drink that when I go out or feel like beer at home. I can still be out, socialize and have a beer without getting drunk or dealing with a hangover.

I have no intention to start again, as I have proven to myself I can't drink responsibly, but has anyone else had that experience? I am not having any cravings and it is just a really smooth transition for me. I feel great. I have no more hangovers. I am functioning better during the day. It has just been a positive experience overall and I am very glad I made this change in my life.",4

1: Cravings pass. I don’t know if this is the case for everyone, but I’ve found that if I start craving alcohol, all I have to do is make it to bed without drinking. Sometimes I won’t allow myself to leave the house, sometimes I treat myself instead of drinking, sometimes I do something to distract myself. Whatever it takes to make it through the rest of the day. Then the next morning, I’m glad I didn’t drink and the cravings are no longer there.

2: Sobriety delivers what alcohol promises. I’ve heard this phrase a lot on this subreddit and although it’s kinda cliche it’s 100% true. I’ve been enjoying life so much more since stopping drinking. I always *thought* alcohol would make me feel good. In reality, it made me completely miserable, bitter, distant, and angry. Without it, I am much happier overall. 

3: I don’t actually hate myself (or at least not as much as I thought I did). It sounds weird, but the last few years I haven’t really been myself. My biggest concern has been getting drunk and hiding the fact that I was getting drunk. It often caused me to act in a way that I never would sober. It kept me from enjoying my hobbies or developing healthy relationships. Now that I’m sober it’s like I’m rediscovering who I am. I thought I was a useless piece of shit, but it turns out I’m just an addict lmao. I’m blown away by the cheerful, patient, caring, creative guy I see in the mirror these days. 

4: Everyone has feelings, it’s okay to have feelings, and if you try to hold in your feelings they will only get worse. I have heard this since I was a literal child. I should’ve known this. Idk why but it never stuck until very recently. You’ve got to actually face your feelings. It turns out you can’t actually drink them away. Again, as I’m typing this out I feel like this should’ve been really obvious but it wasn’t until I stopped drinking.

5: Drinking is, like, really bad for you. It’s poison. I looked like shit when I was still drinking heavily. I was underweight to the point where people would comment that I looked sick. I had these dark circles under my eyes. I was always visibly shaking unless I had been drinking. I was usually extremely dehydrated. I feel much healthier since stopping drinking. And I don’t look like I’m about to keel over and die.",163
2019-11-21 02:36:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dzfuj2/day_49/,Day 49,"Hello, So I haven't had a drink in 49 days. I just wanted to share it with you all. 

I've been having cravings over the last few days, i won't lie. But I can't go back to a life of binge drinking twice a week, and being hungover, depressed and anxious craving a drink the rest of the time virtually. Maybe i get two days per week of feeling ok-ish. 

I can't moderate, i hate moderation in fact. I only drink to get drunk and dumb my brain and thoughts. Then the hangovers the following day(s) 

Which eventually leads me back to smoking weed morning until night, day after day, just for some relief so i don't feel like killing myself. 

It's a cycle of relapse and quit I've been doing for about ten, yes TEN years now. I've been a binge problem drinker for most of my life, since I was in my early teens. I'm 41 year's old now and still live at home with my mum and only work part time.

My life is a complete mess. Or to put it another way; I've never really had a life behond drink and drugs.

2019-11-21 00:44:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dzes2t/starting_the_path/,Starting the path,"Hello everyone,

I've been an off and on heavy drinker for over a decade. I was very clean cut growing up, didn't smoke or drink, and then I hit 21. At that point, I tried alcohol, I liked the flavored drinks, rasmatazz (raspberry smirnoff?) and whatnot. It wasn't a flurry all at once, but there was an event a few months later that I feel spurred patterns.

My very best friend to this date, a brother if you will, passed away. We met in middle school and just connected immediately. His passing was untimely right after I turned 21, and I was the one to break during the eulogy. Just typing it makes me feel confident it had a strong impact on my habits. I longed to not feel the pain.

It's become a definite coping mechanism. I had one job that got stressful, and felt myself slipping for a long time. Within the past couple years I received a godsend, a job in my passion field. At first it was blissful, every day was joyful. Like all jobs, serious projects come into play. Don't get me wrong, I'm still expanding on my passion, just the stress also came, with timelines and results being requested, albeit soft expectations to be honest.

Side projects went beta, and production environments became our tests. It was known that we were shooting in the dark, and we got bit. The environment became unstable, and we had put a lot into it already. To this day I am forever grateful that I landed THIS particular job. My boss could not have been more understanding, knew things were rushed, and worked WITH me until we stabilized everything. Currently, we realized the follies, are moving forward redesigning elsewhere, and striving to improve. I digress.

It's not professionally diagnosed, but I have long witnessed social anxiety symptoms in myself. e.g. I often clutch onto what I think could be a negative perception of myself from interactions with strangers, and hold onto it far too long. Even with non-strangers, this same pattern often haunts me.

Due to this, the bad days spur a yearning to cull my emotions. Loss of time processing thoughts became easier than thinking them. Even among my circle, the stress put all self-deprecating thoughts into a grandiose limelight.

I'm not young anymore. I was once underweight, and now overweight. I played soccer, skateboarding, and ran, now I do my job and often slept the weekend away recently. Now, I'm starting to fight back. I make a point to cook breakfast on every Sunday I can wake up (6/8 so far). I fight the urge to stop at a gas station for cigarettes. The hardest of all, I took the hobby I have come to love, billiards, something I have entered a higher level in-between ""binges"", and cut back on my league/tournament involvement, because I know that my area doesn't have pool halls and only dive bars, and if I go I'm almost guaranteed to drink. I actually stopped running a (somehow) highly successful team, hoping to make a difference.

Tonight has become one of the bigger steps for me. I showed up just in time for pool league to start, not an hour before. I did not immediately order a drink, and instead wait around 2 hours. I did not order a shot with every beer. I did not order a beer every time I finished one. I did not leave the ""away location"" and join my team in our ""home location"" once our match was complete.

I haven't completely stopped. I have before, for short periods, and am aware of the withdrawal symptoms. I have dealt with the insomnia, the shakes, and the increased anxiety before. However... I fought for control tonight, and actually feel like I made a solid, serious step. It's the first time I felt in a long time like I could stop by that grave, and say something happened today. I'm happy to stop lurking today, say I feel like I will wake and not be affected tomorrow, AFTER facing the world the night before. My first step is done. I hope to report on 3 days, my first small goal, soon.",3

This is the longest I’ve stayed sober in my entire adult life.  It was hard at first as i was very focused on the fact that I was, indeed, no matter what, not drinking.  It was always at the forefront of my mind. 

Recently not as much.  My last post on here was kind of a self pity rant on how much my life sucks.  It took me a few days to come out of it and thank God relatively unscathed. I have a very kind and understanding wife and loyal forgiving children.  

My return from melancholia came with a new perspective.  I eagerly returned to meetings and put more emphasis on what matters in my life like spending time with my family and self growth. I even tried something new:  reading a piece of my own writing in front of a group.  I almost feel reborn in a weird way.  Is this a glimpse into who I really am?

It's scary, it's awkward and sometimes it's shitty but it's also learning to deal with the inevitability of existing. Existence can be pain, but it can also be rewarding and beautiful. When I drank I didn't feel anything, sure the pain exited my awareness briefly but the good in life utterly escaped me. I did not care for myself.

I know me. These are areas I start to slip in, and they can easily lead to slipping in other areas, especially since my work life is getting really busy now. I don’t need to be perfect, but I need to give more of myself to the things that truly give me health and vitality, otherwise, I will fall into unhealthy, lethargic and then who knows what?

It just went from there and now I can't stop. I never get blackout drunk, or don't remember ""last night"" but I sustain. I plan my life around the availability of liquor. I want to visit family but I'm terrified of what happens if I can't get a shot every few hours or more.

2019-11-20 18:35:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dzabox/notes_from_the_overground/,Notes From The Overground,"Hi everyone!

Just doing a general check-in. Work is slow today, and I realized that I haven’t done a personal post in a while.

I’m still chairing the same Tuesday night AA meeting at my local Alano club. I’ve been chairing it for over a year now. I actually tried to get someone to take it over at the beginning of October but I got voted in for another three months.

I love the meeting and I’m so grateful for the opportunity to chair it, but I’m uncomfortable with it becoming “my” meeting. Rotation in service commitments is a basic principle of how AA works. It doesn’t seem appropriate for me to chair the meeting indefinitely. 

It’s not my meeting, it’s the group’s meeting, and other people should also have the opportunity to chair it. I am not the leader. The meeting existed before I came along, and it would no doubt continue existing if I stopped going. I don’t want my ego to get involved, and I don’t want to have an inappropriate sense of ownership.

So, I will be giving it up starting in January. At my sponsor’s suggestion I’m going to say to the group that my sponsor says that I can’t continue doing it, and I won’t be there the next week to keep doing it if someone else doesn’t step up.

I love the meeting though, which makes it hard. It’s turned into a bit of a Young People in AA meeting, so it’s my only meeting where I’m not the only person showing up in band t-shirts. And I like the group. It feels like such a privilege to be a part of other people’s recovery. 

In other news, my boss is drinking on the job fairly often. I used to barely ever see her, but she’s becoming more active in her management (because things are falling apart) so her drinking is becoming much more apparent. And things are still falling apart, which makes a lot more sense now.

It’s painful to see, partly because it reminds me so much of my own drinking. When she hasn’t been drinking she’s an irritable control freak obsessing about the wrong things. When she drinks, her mood instantly improves. She’s loose and jokes around and laughs loudly. Sometimes she gets a little sloppy, and I’m not the only one who’s noticed what’s going on. But I try to avoid discussing it with my coworkers, it’s just not my place, and it’s not going to fix anything.

Seeing her reminds me of how I used to feel. Before I drank the weight of the world was so heavy. I felt so much pressure, and I couldn’t even see how to be happy. It didn’t even seem like an option for me. And then I’d drink, and I’d get a sense of elation and ease. It made life bearable. It wasn’t fixing anything, but I couldn’t see how to fix anything, I just needed to get through the night.

I’m so grateful that I don’t have to live like that now. It makes work uncomfortable being around someone who’s deep in it, but I know that I have other options. I don’t have to work here forever, and I don’t have to drink to feel comfortable in my own skin and in my life. I don’t have to drink to deal with anything. I have my serenity. I have my recovery. I have support.

Anyway, that’s me these days, sobernauts. I hope that life is treating you all well. Wherever you are in your journey, I hope that you keep going. Sobriety may not always bring what we want, but it is always worth it.

Thanks to those who read.,"25 year old male. I was never big on getting fucked up in high school. I was a baseball player all four years and that was basically my identity. I had drank a beer once in 8th grade lol but yeah obviously it was gross. I was the popular kid in high school looking back even though I never felt like I was. I just felt like I was me? Never really trying to impress anyone and I guess I was likes for that. Maybe I was a bit douchey here and there and a bit arrogant but I felt a bit pure besides having a subtle porn habit. I smoked weed a few times in high school but it never became a daily thing or even something I chased. Like I said, I was okay with being me. Senior year of high school came and I threw a party at my folks house. To my surprise, everyone came out. That shit was crazy lit. I had no idea I was that popular. Well anyway, I got absolutely shit faced, threw up on myself and decided never to drink *that much* again. At the end of my senior year, I got recruited to play baseball in college. I want to say that’s where I began my baseball career. But it’s really where I began my career of getting fucked up. I was a starter all 4 years but I never really seemed to advance much. I started smoking pot daily as a sophomore in college and started experimenting with psychedelics and adderall. To get to the root of my desire to get fucked up, I guess I always felt like there was a piece of me missing. I felt empty and I used alcohol to help me with those feelings of emptiness. I didn’t realize what it was did to me in college. I started having a really fucked up mindset and just blaming other people when at the end of the day it was simple; i just didn’t love myself. I graduated with mediocre grades. Came back home to live with the folks and been here ever since graduating at 21. 22-23 was basically me just getting fucked up and continuing to blame others for my shitty job situation. At age 24 I began to realize that I had a serious problem and my addiction to weed has kept me at a low vibration. I was also still drinking/binging every weekend so that didn’t help either. I also realized that I still carry a lot of shame from my time at college. I cringe every time I look back at my shameful behavior. At 24 I’ve also realized that I’ve been trying to heal from that trauma that I inflicted on myself from my years of alcohol abuse in college. However since graduating, it’s been tough for me to remain sober so that my brain can heal itself. I’m here at age 25 now. Ready to heal. IWNDWYT",8

In fact, I could never have done this workout while I was drinking but I've been lifting pretty hard for nearly a year and at 46 feel like I'm in the best shape I've been in since college. It feels so good to feel so sore in this way!!

It IS possible friends. And, it IS better.",4

I have been drinking steadily daily for some years now. Functioning alcoholic. 6-8 beers a night on weekdays and probably 12-15 on weekends.  Up until about a month ago I’ve had no issues. Then I started noticing mild withdrawal symptoms. I am extremely nervous about these escalating so I went to the doctor yesterday for an evaluation. Was given some Serax and told to take thiamine and folic acid. Wish me luck. Really hoping the withdrawals aren’t too bad.,3

Instead I made sure to eat plenty and plan out that instead if I was bored, or anxious I would get a soda which is exactly what I did. At a couple of points I thought about how a cold pint of beer would have been delicious at the time but replaying in my mind what happens when I do drink gave the me the strength to push the thought out of my mind.

I probably saved close to 100$ last night as well as being able to make it home without a hefty cab fare. This morning while I was tired, I caught up on sleep and still was NOT hungover which made work this afternoon something that could be done. I wouldn't have been able to do that a week ago.

She was trying to comfort me.

Just now I saw a post in AITA asking if they were an asshole for walking out of an intervention. I saw several comments to the effect of ""Give the guy a break, he's 23, I drank heavily all through college and I was fine, it's totally normal to get blackout drunk every weekend in college, an intervention at that age is laughable...""

I couldn't figure out how to phrase any comments there, and it seemed pointless. I'm just feeling really bummed out about it. I quit when I was 23 (almost three years ago!! holy shit) and my entire life started on that day. Everything I have, all the things I'm proud of, all of it would be impossible if I hadn't quit.

It is true that a lot of people that are heavy drinkers in college dry up in their later twenties. But it's also true that a lot of them don't.

I saw a lot of comments justifying it - like I did - by saying they are ""very social"" and ""like to have fun"". I didn't learn how to have actual fun until I sobered up. I made almost all the friends I have now AFTER I quit drinking. 

I'm sorry, I don't really know what I'm getting at. I have the flu so my brain isn't really pulling through for me today, but I was feeling some stuff and wanted to mention it.

This is obviously meant to be a positive thing, but they had someone who was sober for 70 years there. While I was happy for that person it brought me to tears and made me feel shame. It made me feel that there was no escape from the life that I was living; that the choice I had to make was to live the rest of my life as an alcoholic or spend the rest of my life going to meetings/therapy/fighting. I did not want that I did not want to have alcohol contribute to a singular thought during my daily life. I wanted to be totally free.

I was coming home late from game night after work and the temptation to get something to drink was creeping into my brain. I thought about what I wanted to do with my evening and the thought of ""gosh, wouldnt that all be better with something to drink"" rose to the surface of my thoughts.
This got me thinking...why? I supposedly enjoy reading, playing video games, prepping my D&D adventures without drinking as a prerequisite...so why is it that I dont seem excited to do those things without it.
I think sometime after college I did those things as long as I had liquid left in the bottle. I stayed motivated to write or game or whatever until I couldn't think straight and really it became a hobby that just came with the drink. 
I feel cheated, somewhat, that I let myself lose the love i have for those things for their own merit and I think im slowly beginning to take that back. 
Thanks for indulging me, maybe this will resonate with someone else. It felt eye opening for me. Take back your love for the things you do and dont let drinking be the necessary requirement to do them.

I know many might not consider this a success, but for me just changing my mindset and getting to a point where I have zero drink days, and more of them than drinking days, is huge. Last night, my husband was putting the baby down for bed, and I was prepping dinner for us both. The open bottle of Riesling was on my mind, and although I didn't feel I wanted a drink, I found myself thinking I should have one, if only to stop thinking if/when I should have a glass. But I remembered all of you on here who have posted about choosing seltzer/juice/tea, and I was relieved to think that I don't have to choose wine.

In the past couple of weeks, I've visited two bars/restaurants with friends.

At the first establishment, we sat at the bar.  My friend ordered a drink, I ordered soda.   The bartender promptly brought our beverages.  When they laid down my glass, they looked at the glass of soda, then me, and said 'So, do you not drink, or ....... ?' and stood there waiting for an answer. I simply said, 'I'm taking a break from alcohol'.  There was no further conversation on the subject.

Second, similar scenario.  My friend and I went into a bar.  The friend ordered a beer, again I ordered a soda.  The bartender promptly brought the drinks and went on working.  When they came back to check on us, the bartender looked at my glass, then at me, and said 'I guess you must be driving'.  When I replied that we had walked there, they looked at me and said, 'Then why are you drinking coke?'.  I was sort of taken aback at the bluntness, and recall mumbling something about taking a break from drinking.

It wasn't really until it happened the second time in such a short period that I took the time to think about this.  I don't hold any ill will towards either of those bar staff, but it certainly made an impression.  I know I was at a 'bar', but I did make a purchase, as did my friend.  Why should I be made to feel awkward or uncomfortable by a stranger because I didn't order alcohol?

I guess this just enforces the reality of how much alcohol 'culture' is engrained in our society.    Somewhat sad, but true.",55

This alcohol journey and everything that led me here. Here, the fits and starts of the last year...the tentative baby steps, the overwhelming fear, the paralyzing anxiety and worst of all the parasitic nature of shame and self loathing that fed on every damn stumble.

Today I am only 5 days in and yet something feels different. I feel a sense of freedom and finality I have never felt before. There can't be any wavering, any uncertainty...I can no longer try to manage a life that has space for alcohol. I'm throwing in the towel and surrendering to the one truth I've been turning my back on for years...the simple fact that I have zero control over alcohol.

The past year, I've come up with all sorts of rules and restraints to convince myself that I had control. All lies. Do people need to create charts and rules and frameworks to harness their drinking if they don't have a problem? The time when alcohol isn't allowed is spent obsessing, counting down and rearranging everything around the need to drink all the drinks when it is time.

This week I realized that I couldn't come up with one positive thing alcohol brings to my life anymore...absolutely every drop of it is negative. Was there ever anything positive? The list of dangerously stupid crap I have done because of alcohol is exhaustive. I have proven for years that destructive things happen when I drink. It’s only a matter of time before something truly devastating occurs. I can consciously refuse to let that happen but with alcohol...all alcohol...there is no guarantee. I owe this to my husband, my children...my self.

I know I’m just rambling but I felt compelled to share today and put this out in the world. I suspect this sub is going to be a large part of this journey in realizing I’m not alone. Thank you for that.",13

""Those of us with strong addictions know that working with habitual patterns begins with the willingness to fully acknowledge our urge, and then the willingness not to act on it. This business of not acting out is called *refraining*. Traditionally it’s called *renunciation*. What we renounce or refrain from isn’t food, sex, work or relationships per se. We renounce and refrain from the *shenpa \[the being hooked\]*. When we talk about refraining from the *shenpa*, we’re not talking about trying to cast it out; we’re talking about trying to see the *shenpa* clearly and experiencing it. If we can see *shenpa* just as we’re starting to close down, when we feel the tightening, there’s the possibility of catching the urge to do the habitual thing, and not doing it.""",14

Ok basically I woke up this morning with the kind of headache I have not had in a long time.  I got sober a year and 2 months ago. Ive been drinking socially since I was 18 years old, with increasing dependency each passing year.  (I’m 34 now) The last 5 years prior to becoming sober, I became a very heavy drinker, it was so bad to the point that I couldn’t sleep through the night without waking up sweating and shaking.   

So back to the headache, in the following months of becoming sober, my body was really out of whack, as to be expected. I worked through it and kept getting better.  I guess I thought I was past the stage where my physical body finally recovered.. but as of this morning, (1 yr, 2 mth) I feel hungover, its a really bizarre felling.  Then it reminded me of some kind of information I read somewhere online about the length of physical recovery depending on the history of the individual’s abuse of alcohol.  Do I make sense? 

Just a vague recollection of reading something and a person who described his drinking habits and it was pretty much the same as mine, he said it took him three years to feeling back 100% physically.

Dreaming me then went to the bar next door (where I met my fiancé three years ago) and, suddenly remembering I'm supposed to not drink alcohol, asked for a NA cider. 

I woke up feeling simultaneously crushed and proud, because this dream started with something I'm not cool with anymore and dreaming me shifted to something I would maybe actually do. I initially felt crushed because I relapsed though, and it took a while for me to realise that I was safe in bed and still sober.

2. I’m having weird memory lapses and attacks of brain fog.  They pass pretty quickly, guess that’s my brain starting to adjust to no booze.

3. Temper, temper - I am finding myself getting intensely and irrationally angry about random things at random times.  The feelings have been passing pretty quickly, but that’s not like me at all, normally.

4. My sleep is deeper and more restful.

5. Not being hungover is awesome.

This is my first post here, but I’ve been reading almost every day for about two years. Today is day 569. 

I want to give a little background information to frame my current problem. I just turned 26. I started drinking in high school and definitely drank too much, but everything went fine (always social, rarely depressed etc) until I turned 21 and could purchase for myself. Things started to get worse then and there were some very dark times in college and the few years after. I eventually got a job I really enjoyed, but still kept drinking for about a year. Finally I realized that if I wanted to do anything with my life I had to stop. I was drinking about 2 fifths every 3 nights, often alone, and barely hanging on. 

It took a few tries but eventually it stuck. Since then everything has changed. I’ve made leaps and bounds in my career, moved cities, anxiety has completely disappeared. The big thing really is that I can trust myself now. I know when I make a plan for myself say, two weeks from now, that I’ll be in a reasonably similar state of mind when that time comes, so I’ll be able to follow through. I think that’s the change that’s made all the other changes possible. 

Anyway, that’s where I’m at now. The one problem is that, for the last few months, I can’t shake the desire to have a drink on a first date. Lots of people here say they don’t actually want one drink, they want 10, etc. That’s not the case for me. The thought of ten drinks disgusts me. I’ve deeply considered this and what I actually want is one, maybe two glasses of wine as an ice breaking activity this winter. Something to sip on while we chat. I’m really used to socializing and even dating sober. So I don’t even want to get drunk. I would want to sip really slowly in order to feel as sober as possible. Strange, I know, but there’s a certain intimacy with sharing a drink in a dark room that I just haven’t been able to find in other settings. Especially in the winter, when sitting outside, walking in the park and such aren’t possible, nursing a drink and stopping there is the one experience I miss the most. The only experience I miss, really. 

Now I know exactly what the danger is: yes right now 10 drinks is disgusting, but after getting used to 2 for a while 10 might not seem so bad any more. I’ve read naked mind and read this sub daily. I know that the likely outcome is becoming addicted to alcohol again. 

My problem is that I know there is also a small chance that I could control it, and I can’t shake the desire to find out one way or the other. The feeling of: I’m young, and I’m just not sure if this is forever, or if I just needed a long break to get my life on track, and a healthy respect for the dangers alcohol holds. I’m afraid I will always be questioning this, but if I went back out and things went south again, it would be easy to say: now I know what happens, I’m never drinking again. Saying never is very difficult now. 

Has anyone battled this urge and made the decision to stay sober? And of course, stories of people who decided to have that one drink would be helpful to, even though I know how they go. 

Mostly, I just wanted to share this because I don’t think it’s doing me much good going over and over it in my head. Thanks for reading. 

Ps. I should say since I’m posting... my life is great and I have this sub to thank for that. Thank you.",8

But for the last week, I've been struggling with my sleep.  


A little background:  I've had sleep problems literally for as long as I can remember - starting back when I was a young child.  I've managed it in many ways, some helpful and healthy (being physically active, meditation, sleep study as an adult) and some very unhealthy (alcohol to knock me out).  


For the first 3 weeks of not drinking, while my sleep hasn't been fantastic due to this endless cold I've been dealing with, this last week has been really distressing.  Like I said, my sleep has always been crap - lots of waking up, lots of nightmares, terrible insomnia - and while a lot of that has been greatly improved by NOT drinking, now that I'm not 'knocked out' by booze, I'm experiencing and remembering all the times I wake up at night, all the nightmares, all the discomfort.  


I know, absolutely, that even the 5-6 hours of sleep I'm getting now is infinitely better than the 8-9 hours of drunk sleep I was getting before.  I'm just having a really hard time with it this week for some reason - I wake up sober, not hung over, not with baggy eyes and puffy face and filled with guilt and remorse.  And I LOVE THAT.  But I'm also waking up pretty exhausted still, and emotionally drained from an un-restful night's sleep.

I had a work lunch with my colleagues and my bosses. The restaurant gave free shots to us. I have told my team many times I don't drink, I have not in 8 months. I never told them about my mental health struggles and what lead me to sobriety...but I'm pretty sure you don't have to be a genius to figure out that if someone DECIDES to not drink for months, they have to be deadly set on not drinking, right? And that the reasons must be kinda ugly right?  
They tried to push me to accept the shot. At least 4 times in 5 minutes. Said ""it's just a shooter, come on"" or ""it helps with the digestion"". I kept refusing. I don't care if it's ""just a tiny shot"", it's alcohol. I told you I don't drink alcohol. Do you really think I have not drank a drop in 8 months and I'm about to casually down a shooter? What is your logic here?  
Are you one of those lame governement ads where a creep peer pressures you or what? Why do you have such a burning need to make me drink? Why do you care? I stayed strong and firm and don't regret it. But I'm angry. It's been two weeks and I'm still angry about it. Angry about their attitude. And the fact that they made me feel weird and excluded just because I did not want to take a shot of rhum a goddamn monday at noon.  
I know they don't understand. Not everyone has issues with substances. But I wish people would stop trying to push me to break my sobriety. It does not happen that often thank god, but everytime I'm just as angry. It's lame.   
I'm also tired of people asking me why. My answer is always the same: ""If someone tells you they are sober, don't ask them. You don't want to hear about it."". Most times, people respect it or don't even ask. But I can't wrap my head around how someone could be so invasive and rude and push the questions, the glasses of alcohol and try to debate my sobriety.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Nine times out of ten I can have a bottle of wine on each of my days off work and maybe one midweek and that’s it but other times I simply can’t stop once I start.

I’ve done some incredibly stupid things that I wouldn’t do normally but 13 days ago I did something that scared me, I drank two bottles of wine, most of a bottle of vodka, four beers then I decided to try and drive to the nearest town, about 40 minutes away.

Luckily my husband caught me after I had only gone up the street and back but it could have been much worse.

After this I decided to take a bath and while I was in the bath I used a razor and attempted to cut off all my body hair (I’m male) which didn’t work out so well, I now have long deep cuts around my wrist and on my ankles and I have to try and wear long sleeves to hide all the marks.

I’ve taken the car out once before a few years ago and drove around for a long time before somehow managing back home but this time it really scared me because in between my black outs I remember thinking that I would probably die if I tried to drive anywhere and I decided that was fine.

I’m really scared that if I keep drinking this way I will kill myself in one way or another. I’ve had this feeling before and justified drinking by saying I’ll only have one bottle of wine but before long I end up in this exact same position again, regretting everything I’ve done while drunk.

I really hope this time I can stop, I’m off work after tonight and that’s when it starts to get really difficult. I’m sorry for the rant but I needed to get it out there somewhere. Wish me luck!",7

Last year I stopped drinking for an experiment and lasted 241(ish) days, I need to get back in that frame of mind, but this time I’m finding it so very hard, much harder than it was before.

I would normally say I don’t drink much but it was Monday yesterday, I was on track to having a good day, I had my lunch; veggies with rice and managed to convince a work colleague to accompany me to the gym after work. After the gym however, I bumped in to another colleague and there it went all wrong, 1830 to 1130 I was in the pub downing pint after pint, roughly around 6-7 pints, I feel awful.

When I gave up before and when I give up anything I usually start writing the ‘why’, so here it goes again.

1. if I continue this behaviour it will become harder to stop (self evident)
2. I will not be saving to buy a property but pissing that life down a drain
3. My relationships will be shallow at the pub, gathered around us all ‘not dealing’ with the world 
4. If I’m in the pub I’m not learning, cooking, doing my admin, giving myself time to rest and recover mentally and physically 
5. If something bad happens in life, which it always does I wouldn’t of been investing in an emotional buffer, the tools to deal with these events 
6. My health will deteriorate fast, I’m a type 1 diabetic and al hole is basically sugar 
7. My performance at work will deteriorate as I’m hungover and tired 
8. I make stupid mistakes every time I drinks 
9. Again, I make incredibly stupid mistakes when drunk 

Today, I will go to the gym, home and sleep.",6

I'm now remembering really stupid, embarrassing, and insensitive things that I used to do and I'm feeling really guilty. I know that if I were to be following the steps I'd be reaching out to people and making amends... but what if it wasn't really anything I did that wronged them and it was just something dumb? For instance, when I was going through a particularly rough time after someone I used to be very close to died in a really horrible way, I got wasted often and sloppily wrote out some horrible things I've gone through and sent it to one of my friends. It was probably mind numbing trying to read through it and I just feel embarrassed. I can't afford therapy and I'm somewhat stuck at home with an infant so meetings can't be a regular thing.

2019-11-20 01:08:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dyxvki/3_weeks/,3 weeks,"3 weeks! They have flown by - I feel SO much better. Some notes below for others setting out on the path.

Blood pressure - back to normal

Weight - lost maybe 3kg?

Moods - Calm, stable, serene, happy, content

Skin - clear

Face - not puffy

Eyes - clearing up, starting to sparkle a little

Psoriasis - cleared up a lot

Sleep patterns - going to bed much later, midnight or later, but it is good to see that next day roll over sober. I think this is transitory while my body systems rebalance after removing the daily depressant dose of alcohol. I do work from home so I am grateful that I can adjust my working hours to suit.

Work - up to date, motivated

Savings - saved $300-400

Cravings - Minimal - only real mental issue is thinking about future events as being less fun as I won't be drinking but I know this is false - moment to moment its fine

Replacement drink - Drinking sparkling water at the moment. I did go through a NA beer and a tonic and soda stage but I'll save them for fancy occasions I think. Hard to feel guilty about drinking sparkling water too much or often.

Food - I've loosened my food restrictions to include a little more snack and junk food, it feels kinda good to just relax my guard and eat something unhealthy.

Relationship - Still good but I would hope I am being a better person otherwise whats the point? My SO drinks nightly in moderation (1-2 mid beers), but has decided to not drink tonight so thats cool - I haven't pressured her not to drink and am fine with her drinking if she wants, it is not problematic.

Family - What to say. I've realised on how much I've missed out on by not really being present. I can't take that back but I can keep the experience as a reminder. My kids are growing up so quickly. I've given them a LOT more hugs.

Overall - WOW. It's so good yet so subtle. A fragile success at this stage. I am nurturing it, but there are literally no drawbacks.

Surprises/Other Notes - I am MUCH better at Xbox with my mates in the evening, I used to just think I was getting old. It is also great to be able to drive at any time in the evening/morning/noon/afternoon (thinking back, I've had to not drive on all of these occasions due to alcohol).

A massive thank you to everyone here for being yourself, this sub is great. I haven't used any other tools except read the few usual books that are suggested here (alcohol explained I liked the most, followed by the naked mind and then easy way).

Off to get my fasting blood work done tomorrow morning! Wish me luck :)

I miss wine so, so much. I went to the grocery store and even seeing all of the cheese triggered me. I thought it was a non-wine selling grocery but I was wrong and found out while inside. I finished shopping and went home. 

I feel silly to say that 3 days is a lot to go without alcohol but if you drink, you know. It can feel endless.

Things seem less easy now. Before it was: to drink or not to drink, that is the question! 

Now, there are so many questions about what to eat, do, think about, etc. And also a lot of difficult feelings. Ones that wine always take away.

A good thing from today? My husband made a bad joke and i laughed, for real. Not fake or dirisive laughter but the real stuff. I realized that i haven't laughed that way in at least 6 months.

**The Good:** I am rediscovering my old love of thrift shopping. It’s so great to find a treasure among the junk—just the other day I found a beautiful cashmere sweater for under ten dollars. Plus, I always manage to connect with someone while I’m in my local store—either someone who works there or a fellow shopper. It makes me feel like I’m once again becoming part of the community (after I hid myself away for so many years).

**The Bad:** Now that I’m back in the city, it’s always me hauling heavy bags onto the bus—either taking clothes to the laundromat or going home laden with groceries. 

**The Ridiculous:** The other day, I was in my favorite thrift store and I saw a pair of shoes I liked—low-heeled pumps with ankle straps. I thought, *Hey, those are just my style.* I took them down off the shelf, looked at the label and thought, *Well, Liz Claiborne is a good make.* Then I checked the size and thought, *Perfect. I’m a size eight, too.* Then I thought—*Wait a minute. I DONATED THESE!*",31

Was home 3 hours before I realized my pattern of shop, general check-out, wine box, check-out again and head home was broken. 

So I'm sitting here munching Chicken in a Biskit crackers and M&Ms, sipping cidar ... I guess I was just so focused on what I was craving and forgot about what I wasn't.

I called in sick to work but even little things like taking a shower already felt like an effort this morning.

I have also had a few thoughts of drinking simply cos I feel so low. 

I’ve looked up withdrawals from this med briefly and it sounds like what I’m going through but I just wasn’t expecting it to hit so soon. Even my gut bacteria feels off already.

Anyway, I’m heading in to get a refill and am going to head STRAIGHT back home before I am tempted.

Sunday I got super wasted and fell on my chin. This is the third time I’ve been so drunk that I’ve just fell on my chin. I woke up not in my apartment but at my cousins with a gnarly hangover. Then on the way home I bought 2 tall cans and started to get drunk again. I went to a bar after an advising appointment and had two more drinks. Then I got one more tall can when I got home. I just can’t stop when I get going. 

So today I had the cumulative hangover. I had to leave work early because I was so nauseous. I just sat around and nursed some NA beer and recovered. I feel so lazy and shitty.

I also need to quit so I can be there for my girlfriend. She found out some pretty bad news and I just want to be there for her and not be drunk all the time. I also want to be healthy for her and for myself.

I hit a breaking point.","I haven’t had anything to drink since Saturday night, and I’m relieved to say that so far it’s been sort of easy to not want a drink (even though I’ve been drinking nightly for almost four years, now...).

Saturday night I got wasted, and aggressively tried picking a fight with my roommate. I’m only a 5’2 F (22) but I wouldn’t let up, and we got into it when he’d had enough. By the end of it, my teeth had been punched through my lower lip, my right right cheek was swollen, my  right eye was bruising, I had three bumps on my head and blood was running down my chin all over my clothes. After drunkenly trying to stop the bleeding on my own for far too long, I stumbled into the shower to rinse the excess blood off before calling a Lyft to the ER.

I had a concussion, needed seven stitches, and my lower and upper front teeth are roughly chipped in an only-noticeable-when-I-run-my-tongue-over-them way from sliding against each other when they went through my lip. Had they connected head-on the chipping would’ve been something I wouldn’t be able to (hopefully eventually) ignore. Then again the four years of drinking has had me puking daily for about two and a half of those years so at this point my teeth are probably screwed anyway. They already look like a bulimic’s.

How? How did I let it get that bad? I’m making major changes from here on out...

I’ve worked on my drinking since then, I’m about to turn 27 on December and it’s been a long ass road. I went from blacking out nearly every time I drink and calling out of work because I was grossly hungover, to drinking once or twice a month and usually keeping it to just drunk not blackout combative like I used to be. 

My friends birthday party is what sparked this in me, I drank a ton of beer when we were having her birthday party (along with everyone else) then I proceeded to drink mimosas ALL day the next day with everyone, I called out of work Monday AND Tuesday because I was so hungover, sad, anxious, and disappointed. While I didn’t black out, I did lose control. That was the last straw in my mind. Now here I am almost a month sober and it feels great. While I want to be sober for now I do want to get to a place where I might be able to have a beer or two on a night out but no more. I know that might never be the case for me and it is something I will have to accept. Tonight I’m going out to dinner with my sister and I will be getting a nice cold Diet Coke.

I use alcohol to help me through my emotions. I don’t like the way I feel and I don’t really like myself, so I use alcohol to change that feeling. Sometimes it’s anxiety, sometimes it’s boredom. My body likes the endorphins that get released after consuming. 

I’ve been trying to break this habit and abstain, earlier this week I was sober for 4 days. This past weekend I drank.  During this whirlwind/tornado that I put myself into, I pushed my drinking to the limits and feel the worst I’ve felt.

I have researched what I can about it but no one really talked about the changes in attitude and perceptions of life. I personally drank for 15 plus years insanely heavy and the only thing that stopped me was an ER trip because my body’s organs had gone into complete shut down mode. That was 4 plus months ago and I haven’t had a sip. I started my journey of not drinking 2 years ago and this is the longest I ever made it. I’m proud of myself and feel comfortable in the decision I have made but here is the kicker. Life has gotten worst. Since quitting drinking I have been layed off of 2 jobs, asked to leave my rental and I got into a fist fight. I’ve never lost jobs like this ,been evicted and I hadn’t been in a fight in over 8 years. My truck is falling apart she was a show truck but in a week someone has hit the taillight out and my muffler just randomly falls of yesterday. I’m not here to complain don’t get me wrong. I’m just sitting here like WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F!!! Anything and everything has gone wrong. No exaggeration it’s just too much to post. It’s to the point now it’s become humorous but not all. No one tells you about this crap!! Or am I just a special case. Idk in the air of transparency when I left the hospital docs put me on Paxil a anti depressant. I took that until last week and with the approval and supervision of my doctor I weaned off the Paxil and have began to take 5-Htp and nootropics instead. I felt almost numb and zombie like on it.",3

Wow! I've been in and out of the rooms (12-step and other) and treatment since 1995 with 10 years then 8 years of continuous sobriety but have been just stringing together a few months here and there for the past 2 years. I need a new paradigm and think I've found it here.

In Chapter 1, Grace clearly and eloquently explains how my desires are driven by my unconscious mind and how my conscious beliefs about reality are constructed by assumptions and beliefs I have developed to make sense of my lived experience. I am keenly aware that my drinking habit is rooted in a deeply held belief that I am not lovable so this makes sense to me. It plays out in isolated drinking but also in a habit to 'perform' in all areas of my life. That way of life - blackout drinking and the shame that follows vs. high-performance, approval-seeking, goal-driven behavior - fragments my sense of self. When I receive positive feedback my mind says ""If you only knew (that I was passed out on the floor last night, etc."") and I feel like a sham. So I drink to escape the shame and anxiety - to numb out. Why am I so afraid of living?

I believe the way to answer that question (or to heal from the unloving beliefs I have about myself) DOES lie in rewiring my unconscious beliefs. So on to Chapter 2!

Would love to hear other' experience with the book!

Offering some perspective.,"The question mark in the title has to do with the fact that I took a quarter shot of vodka yesterday morning... And proceed to feel physically terrible for the rest of the day.

The night before that, the world looked sharp; I went for a walk and everything looked beautiful and in-perspective, ornamental street lights looked dazzling, their lights scattered on the tree leaves nearby and the lighted windows of people's houses looked right out of a painting.

The irony in that is that about a month ago, I got really drunk to the point where everything looked just as beautiful, probably from all the dopamine swimming around in my brain after a heavy session of drinking-- Then, stumbling around the streets on the way home, I thought to myself ""man, this is really pretty... When was the last time I see things this way again?""

The answer: 10 years ago, before I started drinking alcohol freely.

Now back to yesterday. After taking the quarter shot of vodka, the world became hazy and dull. On my way to classes, my surroundings is just that: dull and boring. My lunch was also just that: dull and boring. My day was pretty much ruined.

Come evening, as I was sitting at my work desk, I felt as if my face was swelling up, the skin was tightly pressed against my jawline. But this isn't the first time I felt this way, I have tried quitting alcohol numerous times before and when I picked up drinking again, my face always feel bloated. I suspect it is my immune system waking up during the break and reacting to me picking up drinking once more.

This morning I feel fine again, fortunately it doesn't seem to have set me back that far, but I don't think I will be drinking with you today or for many days after. Good luck.",8

I go to a lot of social events for work, and it has always been the lubricant that gets me through events, not unlike a lot of people. It has started to affect my life, and I decided to give it a break for a while, one day at a time. I confided in a good friend, who has been my ""drinking buddy"" that I was going to take a hiatus. They mentioned they were as well, as their drinking had caused a break up with their significant other, but after a few days, they worked it out and got back together. 

So now the holidays are approaching and we all meet up the day before Thanksgiving to have a ""Friendsgiving"" event. My ""drinking buddy"" called yesterday and mentioned they would be bringing an arsenal of booze to my house for the party. I mentioned that a lot of the guests aren't big drinkers, they mostly BYOB as people have different tastes, and that I too was trying to refrain from drinking. They said ""Oh, me too, but it's the holidays, I'm sure you can have a few drinks, it'll be fine.""

That statement made me very sad. This person knows I struggle with drinking. I don't start because I find it very hard to stop once I've begun, and I have been doing really well for a month now, and honestly, my life has been much better for it. I just felt that my friend was being inconsiderate of my situation. If it were me, I would have offered to bring some non alcoholic beverages as well. Like a ""Ok, no problem, I'll bring some (enter name of any non alcoholic beverage) as well. Am I overreacting because this is all so new to me ? I'm not banning anyone from drinking around me, or even bringing alcohol to my home, as I have at least that level of self control, but the way they mentioned "" It's ok, you can drink, it's the holidays!"" As if I need their permission or blessing ? I found that weird and I felt it was slightly disrespectful knowing my situation. Am I being too sensitive ?",1

I got blackout drunk at a wedding and my husband had to drag me back to the hotel while I threw up in the hallway. We had a 5 hour drive home the next day and I threw up 9 times. I thought I was dying. After trying to moderate and develop a normal relationship with alcohol for 10 years, I finally decided to just stop. I promised myself and my husband that I would take a break at least until the end of the year, but I told him I wanted to be done for good. I was tired of drinking wine to fall asleep, tired of waking up hungover and shaky, tired of feeling on edge all the time. Moderation took so much brain power and once I had a glass of wine, I couldn't sleep until I finished the bottle.

30 days later, I am so grateful and happy to be done with alcohol.  I don't throw up in the morning while brushing my teeth. I don't shake while driving into work. My anxiety has lessened considerably and so has my heart rate. 

Life is still hard sometimes. My oldest child was diagnosed with autism and it's been a slice of hell trying to get my insurance to cover his treatments. A month ago, I would have been drinking wine every night because of it. Now I'm sober and better able to be the mom I want to be, not the mom who is counting down the minutes to rush the kids into bed so she can have her wine. 

My husband told me he was proud of me and that I should keep going. I agree. IWNDWYT!",14

Not my first time of lengthy no drinking, although this time I seem to be having sleeping twitches/body jerks??

My brain fog is strongest when I wake after said episodes, but clears when I start my exercise. Have had really vivid dreams of past parties/drinking binges and woke with phantom hangovers nothing too new there, again subsides with exercise.

My main worry is the twitching and body jerks especially when it feels like its ripping me out of my sleep and I am wide awake.

I realized also that life is not always about being highly stimulated and having a good time. Sometimes we just need to be content with just being alive, healthy enough, and moving in the right direction. Sometimes we need naps and Netflix binges too.

I have been struggling for nearly two decades and I finally came to my own conclusion that this was no longer going to work for me.  Being sober and clear-headed has given me the opportunity to reflect on why I lived the way I did and I think one of those reasons is my inability to let go of the past.

The heaviest point of my drinking and drug use occurred, probably like most people, during my 20's.  When I turned 21 is when it really began to escalate.  Being able to go out and buy my own booze whenever I wanted was a real game-changer.  At the time, I lived down the block from a convenience store that sold beer and I also worked two doors down from a liquor store.  When I was at home, I could walk down the street to pick up a 6 or 12 pack whenever I felt like it and could afford it (I always felt like it).  When I was at work, if it was slow, I would go grab a pint of Jim Beam and mix it into a bottle of Coke and chill out.  I worked mostly night shifts at a video store (that really ages me, huh?) during the week, so let's just say it was slow pretty often.  Aside from my home and work life, I lived a pretty active social life.  I knew a lot of drunks and potheads like myself, so most nights were spent getting hammered-ass drunk and high.  This pretty much continued steadily throughout the years and led to some good times and some bad times.

When I was in my mid-20's.  My mother passed away from cancer.  It was devastating, but I managed to hold it together, at least for a while.  About a year after she passed, I had this urge to just obliterate myself.  I moved in with someone who I knew to be toxic, but that was the idea.  For the entire year we lived together, we drank and smoked every single day.  We got to a point where splitting a 30-pack in an evening was a normal part of our routine.  We also delved into psychedelics and did coke together from time to time (when we could afford it).  At the time, I thought this was therapeutic.  I felt that I was coming to terms with life and death and the best way to do it was to straddle that line and ride it into the fucking cosmos.  This went on until our lease ran out and we parted ways.  A few months later, I met my wife and she helped me to slow down and try to put all that stuff behind me, but here I am nearly a decade later and I'm still dealing with the after-effects.

Fast-forward to the present... I am now a family man and have still been acting like I'm a fucking twenty year old.  I realize now that this is what I was doing.  I refused to let go of who I was.  I still wanted to be that person that I spent so many years growing into and became, but I'm not that person anymore.  People are fluid.  Everyone changes and the only way for us to evolve is to let go of who we were and embrace who we are meant to become.  I don't know who I'm going to become, but I know for damn sure that person isn't going to be destroying himself.  That person is going to have a clear mind and a strong body.  That person will be a loving husband and father.  That person will live a long and fulfilling life...

That person will not drink.",13

It didn’t feel that way at the time but now looking back it seemed to go by quickly. Over the past few years I’ve tried many times to get to 30 days. The closest I ever got was 27 and I never felt as defeated as I did when I failed on that attempt. To get so close and not be able to go 3 more days.

It was almost 2 years ago and I remember that time pretty well. The excuse I used on myself was that it was a holiday, I’m not even sure which one it was. All I needed to do was accept that the day was special enough for a drink and I gave in. Just 3 days away from the goal I had set out on, yet it took very little thought on my part to cave in.

The intent of the 30 days was just to test the brakes, verify I wasn’t an addict before I go back to drinking. Failing at that you’d think the alarm bells would go off. Instead I ignored the obvious and just kept drinking.  After several more failed attempts and the addition of high blood pressure and pains in my chest, I eventually got to where I was 30 days ago. 

This time I have given up on arbitrary goals. I’m past the point of testing myself, I can’t drink and I know it. I lost the gift of moderation years (maybe a decade) ago. Now my goal is one day at a time. Even if I have to spend a few hours each day reading through a book on addiction or coming on here to read posts to stay motivated, I’m still better off doing so then drinking.

I feel my health declining and I keep gaining weight. For me alcohol isn't even a social thing it's just my coping mechanism to shut down my brain because I hate being alone with my thoughts at most I'll go a few weeks without drinking and eventually shutting my own head up becomes more important. I know I should probably address my issues with a professional but that scares me too. It's just most of the time I do care but then I stop caring long enough to fall back into the habit which is where I am comfortable. I'm super socially awkward and don't interact with strangers all that well so the thought of AA terrifies me not to mention knowing my problems would probably be a joke compared to what others go through or have been through. I want to be a different person but I don't see how possible. When the weekend rolls around it's nothing but loneliness and depression and alcohol is the only way I've ever known to deal with that and facing that sober scares me.,4

I mean, this weekend I didn't drink any liquor which is a plus, but I was drunk all the same. I didn't wake up with any shaking, vomiting hangovers. But I'm still sitting here wishing it could be better, and knowing I couldve been sober and felt 100 times better right now. I just dont know.

I wandered down the streets of my city, still drunk from the night before, toward my doctor’s office and then told her the same thing. At the time, it felt like an impossible situation. I was killing myself, but there was no way that I could stop. Now here I am, 365 days later, clean and sober and happy.

What worked for me?

-This community! This sub was an amazing source of support for me in my early days of sobriety when I felt I had no one to talk to.

-Exercise. Both running and yoga kept me grounded and helped me process my feelings and experiences as an alcoholic.

-Journaling. For most of the year I’ve journaled every night and it’s been a great way of getting my thoughts out.

-THERAPY. This has helped more than anything else. My therapist gave me the tools to stay sober.

-Acupuncture. I was a skeptic, and I don’t know how it works, but it made me feel so calm and at peace.

-Alcoholic memoirs. I read a lot of these. My favorites are Lit by Mary Karr and Drinking: A Love Story by Caroline Knapp.

-Podcasts. I like Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard and WTF with Marc Maron. Both talk about their sobriety.

-Club sodas with limes when I’m out, all the flavored seltzers when I’m home. I like La Croix and Polar the best but I’ll drink any and all seltzers.

-Hot drinks I can sip. Give me all the coffee, tea, hot cider, and hot chocolate with marshmallows.

-TV. I like picking a short series and watching all the way through. Recent favorites are Barry and The Crown.

-Allowing myself to say no. It’s okay to be a shut-in for a while if you need to. It’s okay to be less social. Give yourself all the space you need. Your sobriety comes before everything else.

Above all, what has worked best is being kind to myself and to others. I am not perfect. I have made many mistakes that I’m ashamed of. But I try to forgive myself and love myself and be patient with myself. And I try to do the same with others, because I never know what someone else might be struggling with.

To all of you just starting out, you can do this. It feels impossible, but you can do it. Focus on each day as it comes. Reach out to trusted friends and family and this sub. Find a hobby, drink a bunch of seltzer, get yourself to a therapist if you have the means to. Be kind to yourself. I believe in you. Life can be fucked up but also so beautiful. Sobriety is worth fighting for.

Is everyone ready for the holiday season? I know it is still too soon for the Christmas music and decor since it's not even Thanksgiving! But it’s not too soon to start preparing for how to not only stay sober through the holidays, but how to also actually enjoy the holidays sober. 

I was thinking about this and recalled *The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober* by Catherine Gray where she described a sober work holiday party experience versus a drunk work holiday party experience. In the sober one she eats a lot of treats, dances, and doesn’t have to be concerned with how long the lines are at the bars. In the drunk one, she ends up nude in a hot tub full of coworkers (who had stripped only to underwear). In the end, the unexpected joy she finds here is the ability to trust herself to know she won’t do anything job-threatening or offensive. She describes in a way I could well relate to how each big social gathering in her drinking life had gotten to the point of her starting the evening with a strategy of how to drink more than everyone else but not to get too drunk and ended with a morning in tears trying to piece together what had happened and figure out to whom she owed apologies. ""Fun"" huh?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

US—Night/Early Morning

Europe—Morning

Asia and Australia—Evening/Night

When your head hits the pillow tonight, remind yourself you’ve done a good job. Be patient with yourself, and remember that big things are achieved not all at once, but one day at a time.

Honestly, it seems a lot longer. I've done much more with my life in the past 200 days than I have in any other 200 days. My quality of life has improved just from having the extra cash not spent on alcohol. Just little mundane things like buying better veggies makes a huge difference, you know? And a big part of it is simply better and longer sleep. Less stress overall, things are pretty chill. There's no need to stress - I know exactly how much time I need to do something at work. In fact, I know myself better, in general. Extra time devoted to loved ones and hobbies is such a boon to mental health, too. 

But it's been tough. It's maybe still tough, in a different kind of way, as I have to keep myself under control, to not let go, to be a bit monkish and not be a hedonist in general, to keep in mind that I've messed up some wiring in my brain and that the mechanisms behind addiction are never truly gone. 

But when I just quit, it was hard, hard hard. I had nightmares about alcohol, about relapse. Woke up crying from eerily lucid dreams about going out and getting hammered, woke up like that several times a week. I avoided social events for a while, to keep out of harms way, which made me lonely and timid, made me learn to live with myself and relearn self-confidence. But, that's just the price I had to pay for what I brought upon myself. Nobody can pay my debts but me. And a lot of folks have it worse than I, dug deeper holes. Well, who knows how deep others' holes go. I'm just glad mine wasn't any deeper. I wish I never had to learn what the word ""recovery"" really means. But at least I know what it takes, and respect those recovering and those recovered, be it from addiction or injury, trauma and loss.

Just about to go to bed after 2 days of no alcohol! (Yay). While I feel like the worst of it is over I just wanted to get your guys’ insight as to what you did to continue keeping yourself sober as far as physically and mentally as well in the first week+. 

I ask this because I’ve been a heavy drinker for about 6 months now and I’ve usually only gone a few days (2-3) without a drink when I have tried quitting but I’ve always fallen back into that cycle of going on a binge again. I feel different this time as the last few days of drinking were very bad. I’m pretty sure I had alcohol poisoning that morning I quit. 

That 1st day (yesterday) was HELL as I’m sure you guys know.  Puking after just a sip of water, dry heaving, anxiety out the roof etc. I literally almost called 911. I was able to pull it together and can now say I’ve made past those first dreaded days that I see a lot of people talk about on here. 

I’m obviously still not 100% and don’t expect to be for the next few days. My anxiety has gotten much better, my sleep is a little better (taking sleep aid tablet)  and I’m eating more. I’m just curious to hear what you guys have experienced and what you were able to continue doing that was good for your body and mind. I’ll quit rambling. Thanks in advance!",2

Browsing reddit, as one does, I just came across the Robert Downey Jr thread about his recovery story.  In it, someone mentioned Shia  LaBeouf was staying on track and OP linked an episode of ""Hot Ones,"" which I watched.  He looks like he's been taking good care of himself from a physical standpoint... and it got me thinking.  I've piddled with exercise in the past, but honestly it was just easier to get drunk.  I know I can't do that anymore and I need to do something with myself.  The fear that I face is that I'm in no way athletic, so the fear of failure has me avoiding taking that step.    


I'm just looking for something positive to replace alcohol with in my life.  Video games isn't cutting it for me anymore.

Tonight was our weekly company driving range outing (at Top Golf). There is a lot of pressure to party and drink. My group usually buys beers by the buckets. I had a very hard time saying 'no' the first time they asked. And the second. And the third.

But, what steeled my resolve was my coworkers regaling stories of me from this past Friday that I do not remember at all. It was terrifying hearing these stories while sober. I was rude, obnoxious, annoying...just awful. I was dangerous to myself and others. And all that to pass out at home (miraculously) and be hungover through Sunday. It was not worth it. 

Friday was definitely not the first night I behaved that way, but it will be the last.

Last week I think something finally clicked in my sobriety journey and I’m starting to fully feel that drunk is far less appealing than sober, so I didn’t drink on Sunday night, which meant a hangover-free, recovery-free Monday. Here’s what I pulled off tonight in the span of 5 hours without really realizing I was doing it:
Made two dinners for my family, accommodating one person’s dietary preferences (okay, they were mine, but still)
Pulled together a box and two garbage bags of clothes for charity pick up
Put away everyone’s clean laundry
Made a lasagna for tomorrow night’s supper
Sat on a conference call for an hour for volunteer commitment
Did some follow up work after the conference call
Started coordinating the potluck for a Christmas party we’re hosting in a couple of weeks
Cleaned out the fridge and took out the garbage and recycling
Finished up the dishes and tidied the kitchen

It’s amazing how much alcohol truly takes out of you. I never understood how people had the energy to do things in the evenings like crafts or knitting or crocheting or baking and assumed that it was because they didn’t have kids or the responsibilities that I did, but how mistaken I was. Clearly alcohol wasn’t giving me the “energy” I needed to get done what I needed to do; it was taking it!

I quit alcohol earlier this year with the support of my wife. She quit too after realizing she was had a bad relationship with alcohol as well. We drank differently but daily. I was rarely hung over but had poor sleep, hypertension, and the post drinking stimulation and irritability common in some. She was more of the type to have 1-2 drinks a night but was indulging more frequently as had more of a tendency to get hungover or drink too much and get amnestic or pass out/go to sleep. I was the one who hit the bottom first and prompted change. I never thought she was that bad. She was kind of take it or leave it about quitting and stopped with seemingly less strife and self doubt than me. She read Alcohol Explained and This Naked Mind too. 

Well 2 weekends ago we were at the beach at a family condo. We would usually drink mightily there. There is a stocked bar with lots of whiskey and vodka, cold beer in the fridge and there was an open bottle of wine as well.  We talked about how the place triggered both of us, but we’re going to ignore it and do our best.   I took the kids down to the beach and she was going to finish up a few things in the condo and meet. She arrived about 30 minutes later and all seemed fine. Then I looked over at her and she is tearful and won’t meet my eye. Without me asking she “confessed” to drinking the wine in a moment of weakness. She then felt so guilty she tried to hide all evidence from me in a number of elaborate ways I won’t describe. She never hid her drinking before, and the act of sneaking and hiding it bothered her so much. She did not drink the rest of the day or trip and is back on track. 

I am writing this horrible wall of text, to validate how easy it is to mess up and relapse, to say how proud I am of her to be honest and open even when she messed up (I told her this), and to say how much I love and appreciate her ( I told her that as well).

My anxiety is almost non existentence. I do still have moments but not like as the begaining when I would have constant panic attacks. I sleep way better. I even dream every night now. I still have cravings but they are managed. I'm starting a new chapter in my soberity. Starting to love myself and teaching myself how a loving parent would love me. Since that is the reason I became an addicted. I was numbing my pain from childhood. I am starting to work on my cognitive dissonance. I still do this with food. I'm excited as fuck to start school In January. I'll have my associate's complete this summer and will next get a bachelor's in psychology. My advice is to take one day at a time. Find yourself. Study everything. Learn and think about things outside the box and look at the whole picture. I love yall and I am so grateful I was able to find this group on reddit. And annie Grace's book.

I have recently cut out drinking behaviors from my norm. I was drinking on average AT LEAST 4-5 days a week. I have been sober for just a mere 10 days now, but it has been so rewarding. I am slowly seeing my mental clarity come back in all areas of my life. I have shifted my focus from escaping life with drinks to embracing life with other things that I am passionate about. (Painting, photography, skiing, cooking, writing, etc.) These ten days have already been so rewarding and simply saying “no” to alcohol has been really empowering. I’m excited to see what is to come. ♥️ IWNDWYT",30

I was dumped by the guy I thought I was gonna marry (my fault) and this month I was let go of my stressful job. I drank every single day to cope with the heartache of my first break up and also from the stress of my job. If I wasn’t drinking, then I was nursing a hangover. I can’t remember any of the concerts I went to this year. I once came out of a black out, in an Uber, in another city, with strangers in the car, and then I started freaking out. I went to visit a friend in Seattle recently and don’t remember any of it, but I do remember almost getting arrested for being drunk in a Hilton. 


During this year, I would switch between 3 stores to buy beer because I didn’t want to be seen as a regular. I would hide bottles in my room because I didn’t want my roommate to see how much I was drinking. On weekdays, I wouldn’t eat dinner so I could get fucked up faster. When my tolerance for that became too high I started starving myself AND smoking cigarettes to get drunker. On weekends, I would pregame by myself while putting on makeup, before going to a pregame with friends, even before going out to bars. I couldn’t imagine why anyone would refuse a drink, and I would get angry when people didn’t want to do another shot with me.


ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. After getting let go, I immediately lost my urge to drink. I don’t want to numb my stress and my anxiety and my depression. I’m so fucking over it, I’m so tired of running from my problems. I want to be out of my head haze and I want to be good. Alcoholism is a side effect from deeper issues. Predisposition to addiction from my genes doesn’t help either. I just lost an entire year of my life to alcohol. My entire 22nd year of life which I will never get back.. let alone the years of college where I thought I had the excuse to drink because I was a college kid. 


I drank the weekend that I lost my job because my friends wanted to “cheer me up”. However, all it did was make me feel worse aside from spending on drinks which I shouldn’t be doing. Anyway, that’s my rant. I am very happy I found this sub months ago and now had something to snap out of my complacency.

Edit: I keep finding grammar mistakes. Oh and also my ex now has a new girlfriend which I found out about this month so that’s awesome lol fml, but at least I’m on day 2 of sobriety right?",50

So, needless to say, I inevitably lost my job in a pathetically spectacular fashion, will not be showing my face in that industry again anytime soon, lost my insurance and therefore my lovely therapist, and since we're on the subject, I also then drank myself out of my beautiful home, awful marriage and very nice car. Yep. I'm one of those: a diabolical alcoholic right up to the bitter end. 

Anywho, so here I am (well over a year later) sat down at my sober table, in my sober apartment, perusing my sober 'must try and get my life back' to do list when it suddenly hits me: I went to my first therapy appointment yesterday and never once thought about having a drink.

Once or so a month I end up hosting friends at my place for dinner or end up at a friend or colleague's house for dinner. It's quite standard for the guest to bring a bottle of wine when I host, and me to bring one when being hosted. I think this is genuinely good etiquette and a nice way to say thanks for hosting! It always seems that the host opens the bottle of wine to enjoy with everyone.

How have you dealt with this or do you recommend dealing with this after giving up drinking? It seems like poor form to not open it when someone brings a bottle over, but I also could see it being uncomfortable for me to open it and pour glasses for the guest then refuse myself. Same goes for going somewhere else -- the host opens it to share and then I decline a glass.

This is the first time in years that I can honestly say I have exercised regularly for over six weeks, and I am proud of that.

I have a lot I would like to accomplish still but I am taking things slowly. I have a tendency to take on more than I can handle and then just give up, so I am contenting myself with firmly establishing the regular habits I have set up. Perhaps after the holidays I will take a more serious look at some other goals, but for now staying sober and maintaining healthy eating and regular exercise through the Christmas season seems like a very big, but accomplishable goal.

Now I can't imagine picking up a drink and sacrificing all the gifts sobriety has blessed me with.

My life has improved dramatically since that decision. It wasn’t until I was heading to the airport on Saturday that I realized what I’d gotten myself into. I was in Vegas last year for a bachelor party and was wasted the entire time.

The temptations in Vegas are truly something else. Half the people here have a drink in their hand. I smelled weed every hour or so. Ads for women are always in your field of view.

But I persevered. I was fortunate to be with friends who didn’t pressure me to drink at all, and never asked why I was abstaining. So I’m sitting in the airport with my 49 days intact.

I’m also a bit sad. Sad that I can no longer let loose for a weekend with friends. But it’s better this way. Unlike my friends, a weekend of drinking would lead to downward spiral that puts me exactly where I was 49 days ago. I have the experience to prove it.

As a final note, I want to thank the folks that continue to fill this sub with positive messages. I’ve lurked here for quite a while and you’ve all been a crucial to my sobriety and overall self improvement.

Now it is different partially because I am wheening off of caffeine, have absolutely no porn, almost always only do sexual things with my w (so I do not have a quick way to get a dopamine hit), and I am working out and eating a lot to build muscle.

This is all for the best as people have commented that I am a good person recently (they have in the past yet more ao now) and I am getting better. Yet, hell, this is a lot harder this time. I am doing so much to better myself and I am in the best shape of my life... though it is hard right now. It is the right thing to do but challenging.

It does not help that I am a perfectionist to top this all off. I am getting better with that too to give myself a break. I am not going to make any more edits than I already have with this post...

Anyway, thanks for reading my mostly stream of consciousness (edirs) here.

Found myself sitting at dinners with conversations happening all around me and me just feeling extremely uncomfortable and awkward as I sipped my water and said nothing. Cried in multiple bathrooms at restaurants. I wish so badly I was outgoing but I felt like I had literally nothing to say, really made me sad (this has been my biggest “loss” from stopping, feeling boring and awkward) - alcohol made it easy to chat and connect with people. Plus I’m single and lonely so weddings kind of bum me out anyway. Really glad it’s over. Proud of myself but I know getting home and back to normal life is going to be hard too, hoping my depression will improve. I have another wedding to go to in three weeks. Sending you all love and strength 🧡",24

Everytime i had a can in my hand i saw them look at it to see if it was alcoholic. 

It wasnt it was just soda water - i am back at home today but i am sure i am a topic of discussion again but this time because i didnt drink. Lol",30

When I woke up on the 16th, I felt like shit as usual, but my mind was clear. A strange clarity. I sat up and immediately said to myself, I have to stop drinking.

I dont have the desire anymore. Havent smoked since that night either. I feel fine. However, I now have a chest cold, lol. Is that normal?

I havent taken any CBD since then either.

2019-11-18 15:59:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dy9en7/regarding_reducing_total_amounts/,Regarding reducing total amounts,"So first off I know that this sub is like 99% people who are trying to stop drinking. As in, completely. No alcohol whatsoever. Most of the sub who is working towards this are alcoholics, or people with an alcohol abuse disorder if you prefer that terminology better.

I myself am an alcoholic. I'm of the binge drinking variety. 4-6 sessions a week. Always drink to get drunk.  Often times drink alone. Hide my drinking. Lie about my drinking. Had alcohol destroy relationships. Child of an alcoholic parent. Got a DWI. Called in to work hungover fairly often. My drinking checked a lot of boxes. 

This all being said... I am interested specifically in anyone who has gone from a similar situation with their drinking to ""moderation"" if you will. Moderation can be like a lot of thing with alcohol abuse, it's a spectrum. What's moderate to some is heavy for others, even if it really is relatively moderate. (ie. 4 beers at a football game once a week, etc...)

I have over the past 10 months or so reduced my drinking a great deal. I now drink maybe once every 3 weeks on average. I've also noticed that my tolerance steadily has gone down. A lot. I physically don't even want to drink as much as I used to, I get far drunker at lower amounts. So now if I sit down to drink and have maybe 6 16oz. beers Im good after that. I dont keep going. Before it would be 10+. So not only have I cut the frequency WAYYYYY down... I've also cut the amount during each session in almost half.

Now I'm not saying this isn't still a dangerous approach for many people on this sub, as alcohol can have that way about it where it can start to uptick. I'm also not really looking for anyone to tell me what I'm doing is wrong (or right for that matter). I'm just looking to see if anyone had similar experiences and whether it worked out in a longer run (say several years)  to the point they ended up slowly just weaning off the amount and frequency of the drinking until it no longer became a binge every time they drink.

I have been struggling with drinking too much wine for awhile now.  I went to AA about a year ago and stayed sober for about 3 weeks and the cycle just seems endless for me.

I have a tough relationship with my partner and THAT makes me anxious (last night he told me again I shouldn't tell anyone about our March wedding date -- after he has already delayed 3 times).  

He is angry a lot and I drink wine to calm myself.  Not pretty.

So recently I pulled off a few days of not drinking and then got back to drinking about a bottle and a half a day...  starting with one or 2 glasses at lunch.  So I was never really just blitzed....but all day...had some wine.

I recently started reading up about the health issues associated with it -- you know, the ones I have kindly been ignoring and now I have myself convinced that I probably have screwed up my liver.  And that I'm not going to be okay....etc etc.

I went to an AA meeting today and I am just feeling stressed out.  Big time.  I want to drink to calm myself...but then I realize I would only be poisoning myself more.  The AA meeting was all about how awful this disease is....and how someone just recently died from the group.   It has me feeling very upset.  

How do you deal with this type of anxiety and not drink?",6

I'm 37 and I've been drinking daily since I was 22. I made it 4 months about 7 years ago, largely fueled by my then (now ex) wife threatening to leave me. During that 4 months, I transformed myself mentally and physically. I changed jobs and had wine with a business dinner with new colleagues. Didn't get sloppy drunk, just had a few glasses. My ex-wife berated me hard when she found out. That was the day the marriage broke for me. I left her a few weeks later and went back to old habits. I know I put her through a lot leading up to that point, and we've since reconciled how we'd handle that differently if we could.

I'm remarried and have 4 kids. My wife and I are daily drinkers. I'm the instigator and heavier drinker of the two. I go through a handle of vodka myself in 3 days (only drinking in the evenings), sometimes drink beer on top of it. I've wanted to try to stop for a long time, and have had the ""just stop for today"" talk many times with myself, and usually failed at it. I don't want her to do anything differently if she doesn't want to. I'm not getting rid of the alcohol in the house. I'm not going to stop taking her out to dinner when we can get away from the kids. I'm not asking her to stop. The world isn't going to change for me. I need to be able to live in a world that has alcohol in it, and control myself.

My mother died last year at 59, caused by failing kidneys from chronic alcohol abuse. She hardly ate and wasted away FAST in her final year once advanced kidney disease set in. She would also go through a handle every 3 days or more. She'd wake up and hit the bottle and never stop. I was there when she died, and I don't want this to be my future. 

My goal right now is simply to fight it. Make the count go as high as I can. If I fail, pick myself back up and go again. 

The difference this time is that I am choosing it for myself - no one is asking me to stop, reduce, control, or do anything about it. Every single day I am successful is a day I am giving back to my wife, my kids, future grandkids, and myself. I've never even tried to find a support network in any form, so even literally just the act of writing this post is also a first.

Wish me luck, new friends.",8

Basically I have significantly reduced the amount that I drink in the past year. I graduated college last year. In college I drank an INSANE amount and would blackout every time I went out, sometimes I would even blackout from Thursday night through Sunday morning. Super scary, but since it was college blacking out was somewhat the norm so I didn’t realize how dangerous it really was. A few months after I graduated and started my career, I started to realize that alcohol sucks and didn’t do anything positive for me. Now that I’ve started my career and am in a serious relationship I also have less desire to go out, which makes it way easier not to binge drink. So I don’t binge drink anymore which is great. But here’s the problem - I’ve said that I’m completely stopping drinking maybe 30 times in the last year, but I can never seem to stop completely. I drink once or twice a month now, and it’s definitely no longer a problem, but I’ve noticed that even just ONE drink makes me feel shitty the next day and spikes my anxiety for a few days. I want to stop completely, but since I am able to just have one or two drinks it’s hard to stop completely. Has anyone else had this problem? How can I stop myself from saying “oh it’s just one beer”?

TLDR: stopped binge drinking a year ago but can’t seem to stop having the occasional drink. I want to stop completely.",5

I had been doing so well for a while ... i woke up on my birthday early and sober & had a great day with my boyfriend. I felt so good and confident! Then i started feeling really anxious and nervous about my birthday party (i have social anxiety) and i started to drink to ""calm my nerves"". I told myself -  only one beer. 1 beer turned into 6 beers, sjots, wine..... and i blacked out, got out of control, took off my clothes so i was naked at the party, threatened to kill myself by taking all my pills, and scared the shit out of my boyfriend by using my body to block the door. He was really afraid i had taken all my pills, so he used all his weight to open the door and my body went flying. 

Other people from thr party heard and immediately thought he was being abusive.  He tried telling them, ""no shes black out and threatened suicide"" but no one believed him because i present as very coherent when i am black out. Everyone thinks im having a good time when actually i am blacking out and getting out of control and turning to a different person. 

I feel so terrible for what i put my partner thru. I became toxic and hurtful. He told me that moving forward, i have to commit to being sober because he isnt doing this anymore.

My life is falling apart.","Some context: A few months ago, I moved from my home town in Utah to California. I moved with my high school sweetheart, whom I love so much. We’re both thirty now. We moved for her job, but I got one not long after we were settled. 

After awhile, the loneliness started getting to me. SO is a doctor and works some super long shifts. I started drinking while she was doing night shifts. Before long, I was drinking earlier and earlier in the day. 

Unrelated to my drinking, about two weeks ago, my boss brought me into her office and told me that there was a problem transferring my credential across state lines. (I’m a teacher).  Now I’m waiting for the teacher credentialing office to meet next month and approve my transfer. Meanwhile, my students, about 100 9th grade kids, are being taught by substitutes and wondering if I’m ever coming back. I’m on unpaid leave until mid December and we definitely can’t afford next month’s rent without my paycheck.

Happened quickly, with no work to go to, nothing to do, and no one to talk to, my drinking became an all day thing. 

My lady is so patient and supportive of my emotional well being, but she’s is at a breaking point. I’m pretty open with her about what’s going on, and I just know that if I keep going on this path, I’m going to lose her and everything else that’s important in my life.

When I drink, I  procrastinate everything I need to do for myself. Now we have bills piling up, my credit is taking a hit, my career is in limbo, and I need to check in with my boss. I’d rather not do any of that shit. I’d rather get drunk and watch YouTube all damn day. I’m having major withdrawals right now. I feel like I gotta get physically better before I can even think about confronting my To Do list. Maybe I’m wrong.

I’m not drinking today, but I want to so badly. I would love some encouragement or advice if you folks got it. My anxiety is through the roof today, while I’m writing you all rather than emailing my students or my boss. Jeez Lois.",8

From Friday to Sunday night, he went through nearly two 750s and one half-pint of Jim Beam. A few weeks ago, I would have split those with him. Now I'm working on two weeks (c'mon Friday!), and seeing him plow through all that liquor in a few days is....sobering (insert drum beat here). 

Trying to be kind, but it was hard to see how quickly he started to glaze over, slur, and get more rambunctious with the kids. He spent so much time hiding in our basement office 'working' while slurping them down. Each time he cracked ice it was a trigger. Every time I heard him fill up another I inwardly cringed (and craved). Saturday & Sunday, I essentially went to bed alone and we didn't talk after the kids were in bed. When he eventually stumbled up after passing out on the couch or watching cartoons till god knows when he was...fragrant. 

Full disclosure, he's somewhat supportive that I'm not drinking, and insists he's 'weaning off his own way'. And I'm trying not to be judgmental like a born again teetotaler. I know I have to just do me, and he has to figure himself out But holy shit, guys. It's like a veil has been lifted and now I see him rationalizing and measuring and whatnot, and it is kind of painful, and difficult not to feel resentment.

People who are going sober alone, how do you deal with a partner who hasn't made it to the realization point yet? I'm already mindfully trying to work through my anger/resentment within our relationship, and I admit I'm feeling alone and like he doesn't value our family enough to make a real effort. I don't really want to transition from co-dependent to nondrinking enabler. 

I have an appt. with a local outpatient alcohol center on 11/26, but that's feeling like miles away this week. Thanks for any ideas!",66

This weekend I chose to end that streak. At my 8 year old's birthday party with nearly my entire family in tow.

It started in the morning sipping out of a fifth of vodka. I cooked, cleaned, shopped, watched a football game, etc. All as I was sipping out of that damned bottle. In one way I am thankful. I got to learn another lesson without jail time or any truly serious consequences (I think my wife will forgive me anyway...). On the other, I am beyond disappointed with myself. My poor daughter didn't know what to think. I don't remember almost anything. A couple of blips here and there... I disappeared for awhile to sober up. Once I got back out of bed, though, I thought another drink would help me get my feet back under me. The next thing I knew was this morning. My house was clean, my wife was mad, and my head was pounding.

I've proven, once again, that alcohol has no place in my life. I even played it forward when I was getting ready to take that first drink. I just didn't see it ending so poorly. At some point I'm going to have to recognize that I don't have any power over alcohol. It wins every time.

With all that said, I'll pick up the pieces and try again. I hope this time is the last time. I'm afraid of myself when alcohol is involved and I need to put it down permanently. It just doesn't work for me and it's high time I recognize that.",37

It feels like for every time I’ve picked a fight with my significant other while drunk, there’s been just as many times the feelings of being miserable, paranoid, and being unable to control my thoughts and emotions carried over into the next day or two. Yesterday I yet again got into a big fight with my significant other over nothing, being SO shitty to him over nothing really, because I drank the night before and felt crazy and paranoid and couldn’t control my thoughts. I felt fine while I was drinking this time, feeling like shit mentally was delayed until the next day. I know it’s putting a strain on our relationship because he puts up with shit from me that he doesn’t deserve. I’ve cut back majorly on the drinking but every time I tell myself I can do moderation, this kind of thing happens all over again.

He’s going back in today for 30 day treatment. My weekend with Dr Jeckle and Mr Hyde was ridiculous, not sure I can do this again, but I have and I will and I still love Dr Jeckle, married 37 years. Keep telling myself it’s his disease, his brain is pickled. He’s been sober before and can do this. 

I did go to a great alanon meeting at a park Sunday morning, ironically Mr Hyde spent the entire day in our local park with his bicycle drunk like a homeless person. I picked him up before the ranger got ahold of him. Then he called the rehab shit faced and did his intake, then took off on his bicycle (because I took all the car keys, putting my foot down, no more driving while drunk, that is the last thing we need) to go buy more booze in the dark. Mr Hyde trying to get his last drink on. Mr Jeckle will be embarrassed and remorseful I’m sure this morning. Yes he will spend thanksgiving in rehab and maybe Xmas. He spent my bday, our anniversary and his bday earlier this year in rehab, so whatever, that’s life. 

In the past I would drink or smoke pot to deal with his nonsense, but that just covers my feelings up. I really want to buy some pot while he’s gone, but am trying not to for at least 30 days, day 18 so far, it’s been too much of a crutch for me. I can now actually read, have a clear head and work my steps. I can do this, I am strong. I need to get back into my gardening and play with my cactus and succulents which I love, ☮️❤️🌵i will keep to the plants in pots so that  I can take that with me if we have to move.

I don’t know how much longer we can stay in this house, he hasn’t worked since April, disability is coming to an end and our mortgage deference also. My mom has a granny flat that she is giving notice to her tenant, so we may end up there in a few months. Lived in this house 32 years, it’s sad. 

I’m on step 3 in Alanon, so I’m still a raging bitch at times and then I have moments of clarity. I also have 3 daily readers and many other alanon books to keep me occupied. I have found 4 great alanon meetings to attend each week, each different in their own way. I’m making lots of new alanon friends also. I’m hoping this time will be different at least for me, I’ve got my program in line when he goes in, I just don’t want to get lackadaisical with it, by not having him around me to remind me that I’m still crazy! Must keep at it, because having him out of the picture is only temporary, they’ll be back! So I need to keep coming back! Thanks for listening ❤️",8

It's so good to feel like I'm not alone and somewhere out there are people, who get how I feel and have been there. 

Rant ahead:

I've been sober for 32 days and thought I was doing well until it hit me today: I'm still the same person I was when I binged on the regular!

Still the same person who burned so many bridges and hurt so many people and couldn't deal with the guilt of that. I started having nightmares of the people I hurt and rejected. It's haunting me!
These thoughts are literally choking me and having me on the verge of tears multiple times a day. Having nightmares and waking up in a cold sweat about all the times I had upset people. I can't do this and nothing I do will make up for what I've done.

I never thought or cared about those things when I was drunk and I don't want this to be my life. Picking up a bottle seems like the easiest way out of this and it would be so fucking easy to pick up a bottle and just be done with everything and everybody.

I've always been the strong one, but I never truly was. That was just a mask I wore to get me through the day and I made myself believe that I was strong enough to do anything. Even swearing to myself that I would stop drinking. I don't know if I can do this anymore. 

I feel like the best thing is to completely isolate myself and just curl up in a ball in my bed, but I'm terribly lonely at the same time. I never was lonely when I was drinking, I always had people
 around me, I was the life of the party.",17

I celebrated a friend’s birthday with all of my co-workers from the restaurant I work at. All heavy drinkers. We’re a very very tight knit group. More like family than teammates. I came armed to the party with a sixer of Heineken 0.0 Non alcoholic beer. My first time trying NA beer, and it was nice. I noticed that I was drinking it extremely fast. I went through 3 within an hour. I did not notice this until I was almost finished with the 3rd one. It hit me right then that I was drinking this so mindlessly and that’s how I’ve always drank. It was a race to get to that feeling I was looking for, and I wouldn’t stop once I got there. I’d keep going until I ran out of money or inevitably got so sleepy and anti-social that I couldn’t function and wanted to be alone. Now that I have a clear head I understand how dangerous and pointless it all was. I feel incredibly stupid for living my life like that and not really feeling that there was anything wrong with it because, of course, everybody else was doing it around me! You know what else became clear to me? I’m the oldest one in the group. Well, I did know that I was older than them, but if you’re 36 and convincing yourself that you’re fine since everyone else is doing it...and you’re about 10 years older than 80% of the group...yeah I realized a lot of things tonight. Very valuable self reflection. Don’t be 36, acting exactly like the 22 year olds you hang out with. I’m actually embarrassed for my past self. On the bright side- I was awesome tonight. I had a great time, had great conversations with everyone and without trying, I just naturally moved around to every person and asked them how things are going with their life. I found it easy to listen, give valuable responses, and not talk about myself and interrupt the entire time. Everyone is super proud of me and tonight I even opened up to a few people about the real reasons I quit drinking. I’m not successful with sobriety because of willpower. I’m successful because I’ve learned to love myself. I’ve lifted my own self inflicted curse off of me.",109

I've also been very lucky to land a nice salaried position next summary with a guaranteed position after. Even after using some very conservative estimates, this is how much a bender stands to cost me, and that's not even accounting for family, friends, relationships, etc.

That gives me a bit of hope, and a bit of confidence that I can do something well. 

This isn't the only time I've felt shitty about life. I've managed to pull through, and hopefully I will this time also. Getting sober doesn't mean life magically becomes good, however for me it means that I learned to give myself credit for little bits of progress along the way, and life has gotten a little better than it was 5 years ago. My job and residence history have stabilized, my credit has improved tremendously, and although at the moment I'm not feeling very happy, there must be some rational voice in the back of my head telling me that I can find contentment in life. I can identify the causes of my unhappiness, and I know that I'm the one that has to change those things. Some of the issues I have are not my doing, they're from my upbringing, and it's hard for me to accept that. It's hard for me to accept that I have to do the work of someone else's mistake, but it's either that or find a spot to end it all.

2019-11-18 01:51:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dxzmxc/acts_of_kindness_aok_monday_appreciation/,Acts of Kindness (AoK) Monday: Appreciation,"Hi everyone!

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK which have touched us this past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about secondhand or through the media. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

My AoK this week is one that I was on the receiving end of. My usual Sunday night AA meeting has not had a phone list since I’ve been attending. There is a part in the meeting format where it says “A phone list is available for whoever wants one.” Whoever happens to be chairing the meeting will usually either say something about how there will be a phone list in the future, or they’ll just ad lib a crack about their being no phone list. 

I took it upon myself to get a phone list together. I passed around a sheet for people to add their name and number if they wanted to be on the list, and when I passed it around the second week for people who were gone, it became the joke at that part of the meeting format that a phone list would be available *someday*.

It is a meeting that many of the regulars have been attending for many years, and there’s a couple of places during the meeting where people invariably make jokes. It is a church basement meeting, and part of the meeting format has the chairperson reminding people not to gather outside of the church after the meeting. We all pretty much end up standing right outside the church talking anyway, so after that part of the meeting format is read there’ll usually be a handful of people calling out other people’s names. 

So, this has become another joke, because it’s been, oh, six weeks or so I started this, and the phone list has yet to materialize. This week I actually did show up with a typed copy to pass around so that people could proofread their number before I printed out fifty copies of it. There’s an astounding variety in individual handwriting fonts, particularly when it comes to writing numbers, and I was not totally sure that I got everyone’s number correct.

I was a little miffed when the joke was made this week, and I started to get defensive in my head. I’ve had a lot on my plate recently, and *I’m* the one who’s actually doing it. 

I am learning in recovery not to personalize everything, that mostly what other people are doing is not about me at all, it’s about them. And I know that it was meant in a spirit of inclusion - I’m one of the gang now. But it still sorta rubbed me the wrong way.

Anyway, long story short, one of the other regulars at the meeting came up to me afterwards and thanked me for my service in doing the phone list and told me that he really appreciated me stepping up and doing it. I don’t know if he could see it on my face or if he just has empathy through doing a ton of service work himself. 

Anyway, I really appreciated his thoughtfulness. It was exactly what I needed to turn it back around into a positive thing for me again. And I guess my AoK for the week is typing up the phone list. It might be a thing that comes in handy for someone at some point in time. How about everyone else, anything that you’d like to share?",16

Theres a very real stigma around people who cant handle their alcohol, and an even bigger stigma after you quit. People refer to it as a “problem”. Well no one wants to have a “problem” now do they? I think words like “problem” and “disease”, keep some people, like myself from seeking help, or even trying to give up the booze. Who wants to be abnormal? No one. Ive come to realize (with my newfound clarity), that alcohol is a problem in and of its self. Not people. Its addicting and its bad for you. Its an awful drug. The most brilliant leaders of our time dont drink. Its a trap to dumb down our higher level of consciousness. 
Since I quit drinking I dont feel happier. My lawyer makes me feel like a criminal, even though the charges against me were dropped. I have court on Tuesday and Im scared shitless. Our justice system just makes people who feel bad, feel worse with thier labels. I try to be open and honest with my boss about what was going on. That was a mistake. It doesn’t pay to be honest. I should have lied and said I had something else going on. He said, “this is why I dont hire people with a criminal background.” I said I dont have a criminal background. The last thing I want is to be judged right now, when Im trying to get back on my feet again. I’m tired of having to defend myself. I spent 24 hours in jail with the charges dropped, but still im being treated like a criminal. In my head im still doing time, I dont need anyone to make me feel worse about myself then I already do.
I know nowadays people like to refer to alcoholics as having a disease, but I think our society has a disease.  Every occasion, social gathering, holiday, drinking is “normal”.  I dont see anything abnormal about people having consumption issues and people needing to stop. Our society needs to see alcohol for what it really is, a fucking scary drug that kills people every day and is bad for your health. I believe the future will produce more people who dont drink then who do.",21

I had a get together with coworkers for a game night and of course alcohol was involved. Before I went I set out to not drink and sure enough I was the only one who had made that decision. I had 4 or 5 diet Cokes throughout the night (let me tell you, the caffeine high was something else lol), and more or less I enjoyed myself. It was interesting to see the other folks slowly get drunker and drunker until they really didn't give a shit about the game anymore and obviously was not having much fun.


on Saturday that got me thinking: nothing is fun while drinking. You physically can't have fun with your emotions so dulled. I was craving a drink pretty bad so I got some beer and wanted to do a little experiment. I was going to drink and try to consciously monitor myself to see if I was having fun.  After the the first 3 beers I had an endorphin rush and I was feeling ""good"". That lasted for about 30 minutes and I spent the rest of the night chasing that rush and never got it. So I was feeling good for about 30 minutes.


I feel like an idiot for doing this. Chasing a 30 minute high that causes so much more pain rather then enjoyment. Every few days my brain takes over and says ""tonight's the night where it's going to be fun"" and it never is. Yet I always try. I feel like acknowledging this is the first step to getting over it. But I'm so God damn tired of trying and failing over again.


Of course I'm not drinking tonight because its moronic and I have better things to do. Now if only I believed that tomorrow, or the next day, or the next day. ",20

I’ve been sober since June after abusing alcohol for most of my life and Xanax for like a year. Getting clean was great and for the first month or so I felt amazing about it. Now everyday I just wanna go back to it. It’s a nonstop struggle and I’m constantly exposed to alcohol. Every advertisement on YouTube is for booze and I wait tables so I have to handle it all the time. I was with a woman for 6 years who I will always consider the love of my life but she bailed on me, most likely because of my alcohol and drug abuse paired with my overbearing anxiety and depression. And when I was intoxicated and upset I was such an asshole.  I never hit her but verbally, I was horrible and one time, years ago, I cheated on her because I was blacked out and this girl came onto me. That was probably the beginning of the end for us because I know how bad that hurt her and how she constantly thought about it. She stuck with me after that, but over the summer I think she just got tired of dealing with me being a miserable, pill popping drunk. She doesn’t want anything to do with me at all, won’t even forgive me, even though she knows I will always love her and that I’m sober and trying to be a better man and it breaks my heart. I’m not very close to my family so when I lost her I lost her family too, and with the holidays coming up, I’m gonna be working on Christmas and all alone afterwards. It’s all just so overwhelming and every second of the day it’s like my whole heart and soul has been shattered and left in a million pieces. I had a panic attack in July and slit my wrist 6 times and had to stay at a psychiatric hospital. Lost some of the feeling in my hand so now I can barely play music which was my biggest passion. Everyday when I see my wrist it’s just a reminder of all the pain I’ve gone through in my life and I just wish my room mate hadn’t walked in and called an ambulance. I don’t have any sober friends so I’m often super isolated and alone with my thoughts and it just destroys me. I will stay strong and keep working on bettering myself, today is just way worse than usual. I know going back to drugs and alcohol isn’t going to help anything and I’ll just end up dying or in prison, but I’m honestly at the lowest points in my life. I’ve had a fixation on suicide since I was 13 years old because my dad hung himself and I’m 26 now and I’m over it! I just want to be a normal human being, I don’t want to have depression and anxiety and I don’t wanna be an addict. It’s just not fair because I wanted so much more from life and I’m sick of forcing happiness. I want to have a genuine smile but I don’t think it’s physically possible at this point. I made a promise to myself to not kill myself because that’s just putting my pain on everyone else in my life. But everyday when I wake up it’s the first thing I think of and it keeps me awake all night. I know it’s not healthy, but I cant stand my therapist and no one in my life seems to give a damn. I’m sorry for putting all this negativity out there I just needed to let this out. I’m going to be okay, I’m never going to give up. Any advice or words of encouragement would be great. I know I’m not the only one on here that’s gone through this and feels this way.  I’m very grateful to have this platform and community. I will not drink with you today.",4

Usually I would have 2-3 of his latest home-brew lagers but at the time I just said I was cutting back during the semester (Full time school for career change).

He wasn't there for the weekend so took the 6-pack home with me. My concern is that this was the first time since February that somebody has bought me alcohol as a gift since stopping. Now I have for the first time an awareness of telling people I don't drink but now I need to decide - do I not drink at all - ever, or is moderation possible.

My current drinking habits involve 1-2 zero 0.0 abv Heineken's when I cook up some burgers a few times a month. I don't feel like I have an alcohol dependence, I like the taste of beer and whiskey but drink too much when I do drink. Not too difficult when a 4pk of IPA's could have 10+ standard drinks. 

Having the zero ABV beers hasn't been an issue, I like the taste, goes well with food, haven't had any issues with restaurants or seeing friends socially since stopping. All of those situations however involved me ordering, this is the first time I was just given alcohol without asking.

It's the longest I've gone in 20 years. I've been thinking about that period a lot lately, and am drawing strength from it.

The biggest things were a clear mind and a sense of well-being. When I started drinking again, my thinking became muddled, and I wondered how I had been functioning this way all that time. Right now, after two weeks, the cobwebs are slowly clearing, but I'm still not back at that level of clarity (yet). I remember how it felt, though, and that inspires me.

The wisdom gained is still within me, and I look at this previous period of sobriety not as a failure, but as a source of strength and a guidepost in this journey.

It's too soon to say if this period of sobriety will stick, but I'm not drinking today at least.",23

Not drinking is starting to feel less of like a punishment and more of like a good life investment. I’m not doing anything fantastical right now. I’m kind of trying to work towards being a better “adult”. I feel like drinking messed up my flow and made me very scattered. I still am scattered but drinking made it more difficult. I am feeling ready to build a more healthy life, mentally and physically. 

I’ve been so much more mellow lately. Less bothered by little things that would piss me off immensely in the past. Less anxious. These things are nice. I still have to fight that demon that wants to get numb with booze. I still feel left out and kind of lonely when I see people drinking and having fun. But these feelings are less intense than they were.

I still can’t believe how much drinking affected my life so negatively. I guess I never thought like that when I was drinking a few days out of the week. But I got it twisted. Drinking was fucking up so many things. My time. My memory. My emotions. My dignity. The list goes on. 

I still have a lot to improve on with my life outside of drinking, but I don’t think it would be possible going the way I was. So I’ve been giving myself some time to heal and relax. To not feel so rushed to accomplish the world. I’m trusting this process and it feels good to be aware and sober. Iwndwyt",11

I end up regretting it - and mind you, I've never done things that incredibly life-ruining while drinking (like physically hurt someone or be arrested or whatever) but I have killed a few friendships and relationships because of dumb things I've said. I've also just humiliated myself, time and time and time again. All the bad experiences in my life (my adult years) have been under the umbrella of drinking. (As well, alcoholism runs in my family,.)

I was given a chance to start again when I moved to my current city. And I was doing well and trying to be clean, but I had one friend, and she of course wanted to drink. So me, being spineless, went along with it. I'm not someone who can easily order soda at a bar, I feel an awkwardness. Well now flash forward nearly a decade and all my friends do here is drink. It's constant. It's never, ""Let's go to a museum. Let's to go to a concert."" It's always ""Let's meet up and have a drink."" I know that's common for being in your 40s/30s/20s but damn it gets tiresome. 

So, when I stay dry, I find myself alone. A lot. Loneliness is very triggering for me. It's something I've dealt with my whole life and it's gotten worse as I've grown older (I live alone, I have a not-great dating life, my family is no where around me.) But when I'm alone I'm healthy. When I go out, I make dumb choices, but at least I'm not lonely.

The point of this post is I need to stop. I'm afraid of losing my friends ... but the reality is few of them are actually quality friends. So going to ""brave the wilderness"" and do the sober thing for a while. I know there's something great for me on the other side (better friends? a romance that lasts?) and I really want to see what that is.",261

Today is day 30. Mostly lurked here for that time, but thought I would post to see my story in words in front of myself, hold myself accountable, and stay the course.  I have been drinking regularly for about 30 years. First time drunk at 15 and it took ahold at 19.

I was freakishly shy and quiet as a youngster which manifested itself as clinical depression that was diagnosed about seven years ago. I found out alcohol took care of that. I could talk to people now. I could finally talk to girls! My early 20s were a trainwreck. Woke up in parking lots, strange houses, crashed cars, DUI. Its a miracle I only managed one. 

Things smoothed out a bit with my late 20s and marriage. Daily drinking, but was a big runner (four marathons) and that kept things manageable. Children arrived, career drama, moves, and ended up doing a six pack and bottle of wine nightly up until now. I was not out of control behaviorally, but was not happy with not remembering things I said the previous night (never bad stuff thankfully) and waking up at 3am and struggling to get back to sleep If I was lucky. The messed up sleep and anxiety was wrecking me. 

This Naked Mind was a game changer for me. I read it in three days and decided to  stop drinking right then after the first three chapters instead of my planned quit date was actually going to be shortly after New year's day. I got my first test right away. That night my teenage daughter texted me from a get together saying my wife was drunk, slurring her words, cursing, and hanging all over another guy and to come pick her and my younger daughter up before my wife could try and drive them home.

The benefits so far: Sleep is so much better.  Not perfect, but so great compared to before. Overall clarity- I'm so much more acutely aware in all of my senses. My work is much higher quality without even putting forth any extra effort. Anxiety has dropped dramatically along with my blood pressure. I have read six books courtesy of not passing out on the couch every night. No weight loss, but the fact I have not gained any with all of the extra eating is impressive. My Cymbalta seems to be finally working the way it was meant to. 

Anyhow, sorry for the ramble and thank you if you read this all the way through. I'm never going back to drinking. There are way too many positives to do that. I wish the best to everyone out there and hope you get to where you want to be. Have a great week.",30

The day before i felt the same way buying a candy bar at the gas station. So here's the weird bit, i would go to that same gas station and walk to the counter with 4, 24 oz twisted tea and ask for a bottle of rum behind the counter sometimes twice a day with almost a sense of pride. No shame or looking around. After work cars would drive by me drinking in the parking garage before I went home and again, no shame. I could tell whenever I moved I would alter the buying habits of that gas station. I would buy them out after afew days , have to drink something else, new shipment came in. Buy them out again. And after that they would no joke up the order and wouldn't run out anymore. And that had no effect on me. But I still feel weird about buying a snickers or ice cream cone.

When I realized that weed probably wasn’t the problem, I quit drinking and took up smoking again. I quit drinking for 65 days and I felt fantastic. Around summer time is when I started drinking again and haven’t really stopped (mostly on the weekends/every now and then I’ll binge) For awhile I wasn’t really drinking and doing stupid shit. Then I quit smoking weed again because I realized that it was hindering my growth. I’m 54 days clean of weed (something I’m very proud of). However, I find myself wanting to drink more now or indulge in other substances. I drank a lot last night and feel awful about the way I allow my emotions to get the best of me when I’m under the influence. I’m a pretty chill, laid back guy but alcohol brings out the worst in me. Today is my day 1. I’m seeing this through this time. I can’t drink anymore. Just doesn’t add up to who I want to be in this life. Thanks for reading.",8

I’ve been feeling really good, healthy, and in control. I had a great day at work, despite it being hard. It was a Saturday night. Normally, I’d say “Yeah, I earned this time to sit down, have a few drinks, and relax.”  It’s hard, I work across the street from my favorite bar. I have to walk passed it, plus three other bars to go home. 

But instead I called some friends who know about my sobriety, who I’ve been calling when I need to go for a walk to stave off cravings. I also shared my location with a few people who are supporting me. I’m not an at home drinker, I’m a bar drinker. So they know what spots to look for. 

Overall I made it home, albeit some heavy white knuckling. 

The physical response to strong cravings is throwing me for a loop. Despite it being a bit chilly, I was hot and sweating. My hands started shaking quite a lot. I think I’m passed a lot of the withdrawals and detoxing, so it was mostly in my head. 

But another day under my belt, none the less. 

I used to think I earned a drink (or 6, and four hours alone at the bar) after a tough day at work. But truly, I earned being sober last night. I earned being clear minded this morning. 

I will not drink with you today.

Sorry for posting a lot, I have no one to talk to in my life. 
Anyone have experience drinking while on antidepressants, particularly Prozac? I know you are not supposed to,  and I am a prime example of all the side effects of doing so.  It's like after 2 drinks it's as if I had been drugged. I'm absolutely not myself, have no control,  lose my goddamned  mind. At first ppl love it,  I'm the life of the party,  but then the night always ends with me crying hysterically, being in extremely  dangerous situations, and the day after is the worst of all.  I am in so much pain. Not just regular hangover pain.  I've had those,  this is different.  I literally cannot function for at least 24 hours. Cannot eat, drink, talk or walk.  I was supposed to be sight seeing today but instead I was practically dead in bed the entire day. Wasted a whole day on a trip I've waited years for.  But none of this is the worst part. I am severely  depressed and my anxiety  is so so bad. I am suicidal. I feel like I can't leave the house/hotel be everyone knows what I did -except me.  The extreme emotional pain lasts DAYS.  literally days.  
Last night some girl yelled at me for talking to her boyfriend -I had no idea it was her boyfriend. No clue. And I wasn't even flirting because I have a girlfriend.  She yelled at me, I got defensive  and left the group,  only to be walking alone in the city, absolutely ducking smashed,  crying.  Luckily some nice women helped me.
I can't do this anymore.

Last night I was out drinking and on a fair amount of cocaine + weed.  I picked fights and made an ass out of myself.  At 5 am I smashed my car window with a rock because I thought I locked my keys inside but they were actually right in front of me.  I showed up an hour late to work and felt like an irresponsible piece of shit... I'm really ashamed of it all now.  I used to talk about my party life with pride, like being a fuck-up was something to be proud of... smh.

I'm 18 years old.  In college.  Probably drug addicted and an alcoholic.

Why?

I had so much goddamn potential.  I was/am fucking gifted.  I excelled in all my classes in highschool but just wasn't happy with my social life.  I started drugs and alcohol... and look!  I've got a ""social life""... but what's the fucking point anyways.  People are superficial and sometimes things aren't as great as they're made out to be... being everyone's ""friend"" is definitely one of them.

And even in spite of all my self awareness, I like substances too much, I know it.  I like the dopamine, I like the variety, I like the excitement, I like the confidence.  I don't really get any pleasure from hobbies anymore.  I really miss the days as a kid where I could play video games for days straight and have a smile on my face the whole time.

I just want to be happy.  I don't know how.  I wish I truly trusted the process, but I'm so fucking depressed it hurts.  I'm not sure where to go from here, I kind of want to attend some sort of AA meetings or find some sort of support (hence why I reached out to this sub).

On mobile and such so please excuse typos and weird English. I was hospitalized on October 8 for a med check because I had entered a manic stage that I was unfamiliar with.

So what does that mean? Manic stage? Well while I was in the hospital I was diagnosed as bipolar one where is previously everyone only thought I had an anxiety and depression. I don’t know what the difference is I’m not a doctor. But they switched up my meds and I attended a three week inpatient program learning to deal with my new diagnosis and through all of this I have remained sober. Not just because I was hospitalized either I could’ve drank they let me go home on weekends but I didn’t want to drink. I didn’t want to use other substances. 

Had I still been drinking I may have never gotten this new diagnosis and finally started to drill down into some of the core issues that made drinking and substance use dominate my life for so long.  So I am grateful that it happened. Perhaps this wasn’t the best way to reach this realization or awakening but it had to happen one way or another. I’m still dealing with a lot of stuff. My current wife and I are still separated. I am still not back to work. Tomorrow I start an eight week intensive outpatient program that meets for three hours a day Monday through Thursday. It is grouping format with individual therapy for two hours each week one hour with a therapist and one hour with a psychiatrist to manage meds. I am hopeful that this program will continue to guide me on my journey to maintain my sobriety and understand my brain a bit better. 

Thank you for all the kind words on my last post I’m sorry I didn’t get to respond to most of them. I’m still only working off a smart phone as my computer is dead as well, something something windows update and battery not working.

Been watching a friends dog for over two weeks on top of our two dogs. He’s really excitable and whines and barks at any sudden noise and it gets the puppy worked up and they all get started and I can’t stand it. I got a small quiet dog because I hate loud barking. I got a young dog because I didn’t want the work of a puppy. I opposed getting a puppy because I know I don’t have the patience for them. They’re cute but I don’t have the energy for them for more than a couple of hours. Boyfriend wanted his own dog and went ahead and got him when I was half hearted about it. He’s a great dog but whenever he gets worked up I can’t handle it and my boyfriend always reminds me he’s a puppy- like I forgot and helps. 

Anyway the friends dog is finally leaving. Ready for him to go away. I only agreed to take him because my friend is going through the stress of a baby and trying to sell her house. I knew it would mean a lot to help out and it’s important to me to be a good friend since she is one of the few friends I can count on.

I wanted to go get a nice lunch today after working out but the friend I texted to go with me never texted back so I tried to make a nice lunch at home and that’s where the last few weeks of stress hit it’s peak. I am not a good cook and I used to live in an area with a lot of good food within delivery distance- there is nothing to order carry out near me since I moved in with boyfriend. I do most of the cooking even though I don’t enjoy it because my boyfriend doesn’t know how to make a proper well balanced meal. I mean he does but I don’t have the energy to deal with him whining about not knowing what he’s doing or his side commentary about how I should do better at cleaning while I cook when I do like he does. So I just try to do it myself. Today’s lunch turned out like shit and my stress just collapsed on me and I didn’t have my usual bottle of wine to cushion the blow.


So I cried in the bathroom. Thankful for the noisy vent and that I usually do take really long dumps normally so the amount of time I needed to get the crying out of my system and recover wasn’t suspicious. I know he knows I’m upset. I’ve been really crabby and short with him the last few weeks. I’m just so tired and I wish I could have a drink.",2

Apart from the shame. So, the shame does fade. I know this because I've always bounced back from the feeling of shame and back into drinking. Hesitantly at first of course but eventually the increase happens  and I end up black out drunk again and so the cycle continues. Drunk. Shame. Vows to curtail it. Moderation. Binge. Bad behaviour. Crushing shame.... etc.
So, my question is : what do ppl do to stop that shame fading so much that drinking seems ok again. How do I hold the seriousness of my drinking so that I don't slip.

And I drank very heavily on a daily basis. Every once in a while I stopped for a day or two but it never stuck. On Thursday I was not feeling very well at all- dizzy, weak,  tired, light headed, nauseated- all the things that a hangover brings, right? 

Somehow I managed to make it through the work day.   But I began to feel progressively worse. As I was driving home it felt hard to focus. As I soon as I got home I put on pajamas and laid down while slowly drinking water. I tried to sleep but my stomach and dizziness wouldn’t allow me to. I thought maybe it was because I did not eat all day.

I made it to the bathroom just in time to throw up the water I drank at all at once.... and then....three mouthfuls of blood. I thought at that point I was going to faint. I crawled back to bed and threw up about another 5 times throughout the night- all red blood. 

In the morning, I was still feeling nauseous, weak, dizzy, and absolutely tired. The next time I threw it up it was BLACK. Along with this I had BLACK stools. I was driven to the hospital by my beautiful girlfriend and have been here for 3 days. I had an active upper GI tear. After an endoscopy, doctors discovered a Mallory-Weiss tear. Look it up if you don’t know what it is. I was mortified and embarrassed. They were able to clip it, and, after shitting blood a few more times I am feeling much better. 

This experience was scary as hell and something my girlfriend warned me about. Trust me, folks. This shit isn’t worth it. If I didn’t go to the emergency room I could have died. This has opened my eyes. Life isn’t so bad after all. I’ve been able to detox here and I’m sure all the IVs and antibiotics I’m getting have helped with that. I have no choice but to quit drinking, and honestly, I don’t want to ever drink again.

i'm on day 5 today. i'm having strong cravings and am sending myself down a ""I can have one drink today, I don't actually have a problem or need to quit"" spiral. 

this is usual for me, i forget why i decided to take a break (i'm very afraid to commit to quitting forever, i'm trying to start small and build it up) and i convince myself that i don't need to quit. thinking about all the times i felt terrible because of drinking doesn't help, i have a.. delusion that it somehow won't happen this time around, unlike the past half a dozen years or so. 

however i just now realised how.. illogical and inconsistent this is. if i didn't have a problem of any kind, i would not be having this situation where i'm laying on my bed, anxious and frantic, dreaming about white wine. i'm literally imagining it in my mouth, going down my throat all cold, and i'm somehow only now realising that it's the same part of me that craves alcohol this sickly that convinces me that i don't have a problem. if i did not have a problem, i would not be in this state regardless of how many days i've been sober.

this may sound like me rediscovering the Americas because it's really obvious, but it's the first time i'm facing the reality of what i'm going through on the evening of my 5th day dry. putting this in writing restrenghtened my resolve and i think i'm a little bit more honest with myself now.

2019-11-17 11:30:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dxomnp/regarding_shame/,Regarding shame,"Just been thinking a lot lately about stuff, mainly, the shame spiral I experienced while drinking. The shame would consume my thoughts all morning after a night binging, like a broken record, repeating over and over what I had done and said. I hated the torture. Often times I would reach for the bottle again in the morning, just to make it stop. Sometimes I could make it through the day and forget on my own, then be reminded again in the evening. And then I’d drink, because hey, it’s been a long day, last night was rough, and I need to relax. 

Funny how shame exists to let us know when we’ve done something wrong and to prevent us from doing that thing again. All of our emotions have a purpose. And yet, I didn’t listen, instead I would do the exact thing that made me feel shameful in the first place. What kind of logic is that?

I was taking out my smoke alarm instead of stopping the fire in kitchen. And I am so grateful now to recognize my emotions for what they are, and to feel confident that I have the tools and ability to address them. My mind and body is actually quite capable without any outside help, as it turns out. Although—I rarely feel ashamed of things I’ve done the night before anymore.

I won’t drink will you all tonight!",18

2019-11-17 08:01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dxm9qi/one_year_sober/,One Year Sober,"Today marks 365 days alcohol-free for me! For years I lurked on this sub, wanting to be sitting where I am right now and wondering how on earth I could do it, since stringing a few days was all I was capable of. Eventually I did a few weeks, then months at a time -- multiple times -- until November 17, 2018.

The previous night was a Friday, and I spent it as usual, downing wine while my kids watched a movie.  This was my lame  routine: drinking mindlessly while scrolling through my phone. On the weekends (and sometimes during the week) I'd easily drink a whole bottle to myself.  The night of November 16, though, I came across an article in USA Today about the  damage that alcohol wreaks on women in particular (here's a link to that article: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/16/alcohol-deaths-emergency-room-increase-middle-aged-women-addiction-opioids/1593347002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/16/alcohol-deaths-emergency-room-increase-middle-aged-women-addiction-opioids/1593347002/)). Even half blitzed, I was profoundly disturbed by what I read. I went to bed sickened with myself both for drinking like I was and not having the strength to stop when I knew that it was killing me.

On Saturday morning I woke up like I normally did on the weekends: feeling fuzzy in my head, irritated with myself and the world around me. I went through the motions of the day, feeling like crap, thinking about the article I read while depressingly realizing that I'd probably start drinking again once 5:00 rolled around. After all, it was Saturday. Maybe I'd try on Monday.

Late in the afternoon, though, a friend unexpectedly dropped by for a visit. My beautiful friend was there to tell me she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. This young mother was facing chemo and a mastectomy -- months of treatment and an uncertain outcome. For some reason this news, which wasn't even mine, was what I needed to finally put the wine down. I haven't touched a drop since. (Happily I can share that my friend is doing well; not 100% cancer-free but on her way.)

In the early days, like for the first 3-4 months at least, I checked in here every morning. I looked for reasons why not drinking was the right choice, and they were increasingly easy to find: better sleep, better mood throughout the day, anxiety almost completely gone, always able to drive / handle kid emergencies, lost pudginess, etc. I took inspiration from posts describing long-term sobriety and imagined how I wanted my life to change. Also, and this is still true, I loved to read Day 1 posts. Never forgetting that day and what it meant to me has been the driving force behind the other 364 days.

My sober life isn't perfect but it's so much better. I've read about 40 books this year, a passion that went by the wayside when I was too drunk to read anything longer than a web article. My body is stronger and healthier, lifting heavier than ever and learning new skills I never thought I would. The relationship with my kids is unbelievably better, as I have patience to deal with the bad and the well-being to cultivate the good. Incidentally, my daughter learned all about alcohol in school last year, and it has been a relief to be able to be a parent who doesn't drink. I'm praying she doesn't remember much about what kind of mom I really was in previous years.

Although some people ask why I don't drink, especially friends I used to drink with, almost no one really cares, which has meant a fairly easy time doing all the things I used to. In this past year I've done all the holidays, parties, a wedding, many meetings, and other social occasions without drinking. The really weird thing is how my social anxiety -- a huge reason why I had deemed alcohol necessary for such events -- is totally gone. Alcohol was literally causing it.

I wish I'd done this years ago, when I first started to question my drinking, but regardless I'm so glad to be where I am. For anyone hoping to stop, you can definitely do it. Just take it one day, one choice, one breath at a time.

2019-11-17 07:08:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dxlsyw/its_been_half_a_year_since_drinking_the_last_time/,It's been half a year since drinking the last time and yesterday evening I had my first sober club night that I sincerely enjoyed although life is harsh the last weeks. (success story),"Hey guys,

I'm so freaking proud of myself - I just have to tell you my experience from the last months and last night:

Since about 1 month I'm making great progress by participating in social events that revolve around alcohol. I no longer feel as the special outstanding person that has a problem. I can relax now without drinking alcohol or doing other drugs. I can sit my sober ass down and just talk/interact with people. I sometimes need about 30 minutes to an hour in order to warm myself up. People that know my story built up a lot of respect for my decisions and dedication and tell me how massively impressed they are for me sticking to this whole no-alcohol-lifestyle and I notice that I started a process in their mind although I stopped talking about my lifestyle changes as I noticed that people don't like to hear about it. I no longer have a problem with people joking about me living a ""saints-life"" - I just ignore or start joking with them.

Exactly 2 weeks ago my girlfriend broke up with me as we both developed into different directions. I constantly improve my life and I have great success doing that. I never expected the same from her but she kinda expects it from herself. She wasn't happy for my lifestyle changes and kinda got jealous when she saw that I make progress while she wasn't able to. Her inner frustration transfered into the relationship combined with to much physical distance (because she was traveling a lot) led to her canceling the relationship. At first I was like super depressed mostly because I lost my best friend that helped me going through the hardest time back in May 2018. I went through withdrawal from weed, amphetamines, alcohol, cigarettes, video games and masturbation/porn back then and basically did a 180 degree turn in life. In this harsh time she was guiding me back to life and basically saving my life with her love. Thus she will always have a place in my heart but I'm also kinda disappointed from her leaving this relationship/friendship one day to the other. But I kinda find my peace with her decision but sometimes it really hurts deep down. 

Last night a buddy of mine celebrated his birthday and I saw lot of my friends. I love everyone of them but many of them are still trapped in a wheel of addictions. But most of them got their shit together and live a forward pointed life. Before we went to downtown partying everyone got heated up with alcohol. Some did coke other smoked weed. At first I felt really comfortable but then I got this insane urge to consume something. I didn't care whether it was alcohol, weed, coke or a cigarette. My brain craved the dopamine. I was so sad about my girlfriend and current life situation. I watched those urges and it felt like they wouldn't leave and I had a hard time imagining myself going to the club right now. At some point I won the battle against my urges, took some deep breathes and got involved into conversations. Then we went to the club. They had nice electronic music and a really nice atmosphere. I managed to dance without feeling awkward. I even enjoyed it as hell, just moving my body in a pleasant way. I had 2 sweet drinks which contained Coffein as I felt a little tired - that was all. I only felt a little amount of anxiety in the first 10 minutes and then was anxiety free for the rest of the evening. At some point I got involved with a cute girl and we danced a little and she suddenly started kissing with me. At first I felt a little bit awkward making out sober with a girl that seemed to be slightly tipsy. I enjoyed it a couple of minutes and politely returned to my friends. I kinda felt a bit childish as I didn't do that in a long time (I'm 25 btw) but there was also a moment of realization: I'm past alcohol and drugs. I'm past using stimulants to hide my pain. I found my inner balance to resist any temptation. I didn't searched for a girl this evening that I could take home as I did back in the days. The girl approached me while I was enjoying my evening. As I noticed that this isn't the right thing to do - I consciously left. I don't wanna chase the next woman just to forget my girlfriend. But I still felt better about the whole situation with her. I think I'm able to move on now. I didn't drank away the pain over the last weeks and managed to feel every emotion that went through my body. I realized that I grew a lot and thus I'm really proud of myself. At some point I went home had a warm shower, went to bed and waked up refreshed and ready to go about my day. 

To bring this to an end. It was a really long path to reach this point in life but I'm so happy I did and I can only encourage others to start their own journey of recovery or to STAY on that path. I sometimes wondered if all of this struggle is worth it and I can tell you YES IT IS! It's a slow process which contains a lot of dark and cloudy days but for me it's the only viable option to live a happy life. 

I'm sorry if this text got a little bit long but I just had to get this off my chest and manifest my thoughts into words. I come from a really dark place and I'm finally seeing the light again. As someone once told me: ""it's the darkest before dawn"". 

Stay strong everybody.

I went to a house party last night and was really nervous going in. Normally, I'd be pounding beers, but when two people offered, I just said I needed to do some things later that night. No big deal.

Maybe I'm an enabler or just was focused on my own drinking, but I noticed that people weren't really drinking that much, even my buddies who I usually slam 'em back with. Most people weren't drinking at all. It wasn't that kind of party. Before, I thought there was only one kind of party.

I could actually talk with people rather than getting rowdy. I made some subtle jokes rather than making an ass out myself. The only tough moment of the night was when someone opened the fridge and I saw all those beers in there. But the fridge closed and I was fine again.

I got up early this morning and let my wife sleep in.

This is my first weekend during this streak where I'm not hungover at all and I was looking forward to being super productive, but the reality has been different.

I'm wondering if this is typical of quitting drinking cold turkey (i.e. normal withdrawal symptoms, PAWS) or are these just my natural emotions, and perhaps the reason why I drank in the first place? Or is it too early to tell? Admittedly, my diet hasn't been the best (although, once again, it has been *slightly* better) and any kind of exercise regime is non-existent, so I guess they could be contributing factors.

Your thoughts would be appreciated.

I watched my best friend get drunk at a get together last night and he said “I don’t know how you can be straight, and I just can’t relate to you anymore”. I know it’s more his problem than mine and he was obviously inebriated to mean it but it still sucked that I was sober and had to hear that. He probably won’t remember he said that to me and for me, I’ve already let go of it. 

I’m trying to do all these things, like meditating, being more grateful and being more present with family and friends. But still I just wake up feeling quite sad most mornings. I still get moments of pure joy like seeing really blue skies or holding my baby nephew and I soak that shit in. But mostly i just feel bleh. IWNDWYT",11

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I have made several attempts to quit in the past with no success, but I’m really tired of how I feel when I drink. I also got myself arrested for a DUI a year and a half ago. I was fortunately able to get a reduced charge and really learned a lot about myself and drinking/alcohol all together. I was very disappointed with myself and still am to a degree. It’s over with and I never want it to happen again. 

Overall, I live a good, productive, happy life with my wife (just married this August) and my family. I have good positive people in my life. I don’t feel like I need alcohol, but I’m a very routine person, and one of my favorite things to do after a long busy day at work is sit back, play some video games, and drink some beer. It helps me unwind. My problem is a binge drink. Once I start, I don’t stop.

I need to stop this, it doesn’t make me feel good physically or emotionally. Not happy with my weight that I know is heavily impacted by alcohol.  I also have a big promotion coming up, and I want to be my best self when I enter that role. 

I just wanted to post this to put my thoughts into the world and to help hold myself accountable. I’m open to any advice to keep the ball rolling. 

Have a great night!",7

Like the title says, a lot of firsts. The trip actually started in Vegas with a bunch of friends who still like to party pretty hard. I did not drink in Vegas and what a trip Vegas is when you’re not drinking, not sure I’d recommend it unless you like gambling (I do). The only time I really felt the itch to drink was when we went out for a fancy dinner, but I made it through. I watched all my friends get fucked up and made sure to dip out if I got too uncomfortable. I was smoking weed on that portion of the trip but more on that later. When everyone went home I went off to CPH by myself, I have no idea how I would have been able to handle a long flight like that from Vegas in the past, I probably would have been shaking until I could get some wine for dinner service. 

Once I got to CPH and started exploring, I was so happy to not be drinking. I didn’t end up making any new friends at bars or have crazy nights out, but I saw a lot of museums, drank a lot of coffee and enjoyed the architecture. I even took a bike architecture tour! It was cold! If I had tried to do that hungover I would have died. The weirdest things ever really felt was a restaurants or at the casinos when waiters/waitresses would ask you if you wanted drinks and I just said I’m good with water. 

It wasn’t the most mind blowing trip of all time, I didn’t have any romanticized moments of catharsis, but I remember everything and I feel great. On my last night in CPH I walked around Christiania, the place famous for just selling pot everywhere and I didn’t buy any, completing a truly sober trip. I know this isn’t a stop smoking sub, but it was important to me that I didn’t rely on any substances while I was by myself, with loneliness and boredom being two big triggers for me. Today marks a nice even 200 days since my last drink as well. Just wanted to share this here and let you all know you’re doing great, don’t beat yourself up, and IWNDWYT.",21

Simple caloric math of adding 7 hours of exercise per week and subtracting the calories from the 120 weekly beers does equals weight loss (although somewhat offset by increase in ice cream).

Wish I had some pictures so I could share the before and after, but I refused to have my picture taken. Heck I can’t even imagine the before and after as I also avoided mirrors for months and years.

(At least today) Being  able to look at myself, both figuratively and literally, is quite the beautiful thing.  

Hope others have (or will have) similar experiences, not so much the superficial results but the more profound ones.

Not big advice guy but, perhaps do it for the superficial reason (weight loss) and enjoy the deeper benefits.

I don’t need it. My husband through it the basement fridge for the next event with guests. We’ve had the same 8 bottles of wine and some bottles of liquor in the house since I quit. I could have asked that they be removed, and my husband would have respected it, but I knew it wouldn’t make much difference. If I ever choose to drink again, I will find a way, even if there is no booze in the house. 

Also had a serious conversation with our teen. I think it went really well, but now I am worried there may be a conflict - or at least a heavy difference of opinion - between my husband and I about where it goes from here and it may not be easy to get through. Drama involving one of his friend’s kids and I’m not sure we’ll see eye to eye on it. No fun, but we will see what tomorrow brings and I will deal with it sober.

Eleven kids and nine adults; all adults but myself drinking. Several hours of feeling fairly strong even as I opened beers for the guests, and poured wine. Four and a half hours later, folks had trickled out and my wife headed upstairs to get the kids to bed as I washed and cleaned up. This used to be MY time, when I’d slip in a couple-few more drinks, trying to open the fridge or the liquor cabinet silently, or cough loudly as I cracked open a beer so that I’d cover the sound (god knows if that ever worked). Or I’d down a lot of liquor, but figure out a way to rotate out bottles so it never looked like I was finishing the Jameson’s or Espolon, and then silently run empties out to the recycling and dump the rest of the recycling on top of it. (I was a very efficient taker-out of trash and recycling...)

Tonight, mid-cleanup, I stopped and stared at my wife’s half-finished wine very hard. I even brought it up to my nose and smelled it—it made me feel the way I used to feel at the first sip of beer after a long day. 

And then I poured it down the drain and, you know, logged on to tell you all about it. Three months in it’s not easy but I feel like I have the self-discipline I never had when I drank. Nowadays the bad decisions don’t snowball, and the good days keep me even.",34

The girl on the left was homeless, broken, drinking a 5th of Russian ballsweat vodka a day and had totally given up- on her appearance, on life, on pretty much everything. Her daughter won't even speak to her. She is suicidal, not taking any of her meds, bloated, eating like shit and had blood pressure in the 200/100 range. An hour after that picture was taken she was caught with alcohol in her room amd kicked out of the domestic violence shelter with no money, no car, and no place left to go except rehab or an overflow shelter notorious for drugs and violence. She chose rehab.

The girl on the right is 15 lbs lighter, sober, and takes care of herself. She's no longer homeless, she takes her meds, her mental health is stable and her depression is gone. She has hope for the future. Her daughter is proud of her and their relationship is growing stronger every day.

Ok enough talking about myself in the 3rd person lol. I was amazed when I found that picture today. I was so lost, and I was on the verge of drinking myself to death. I'm lucky I didn't stroke out with my blood pressure being as high as it was. I don't even recognize myself in the before picture. 

Rehab saved my life. And in these 50 days I not only improved myself physically, I discovered drawing- a talent I didn't even know I had!

It's amazing how much can change in such a short amount of time. If you are out there reading this and thinking it's too late to change, or that things are too far gone, just know I was about as rock bottom as it gets and I didn't think there was any hope for me.  It took what I consider an act of God to get me through the doors, and I was still stubborn and tried to talk my way out of it for about a week. But the moment I finally accepted I was powerless over alcohol and my life was unmanageable, I found a sense of peace that was unlike anything I had ever experienced. And then everything started to fall into place.

 I'm not going to glamorize the process- it's been emotionally draining and at times overwhelming dealing with the shit that led me to drink in the first place. I worked through a lot of past trauma and had to feel all the things I was trying to numb and forget. I'm grateful that my rehab had a trauma centered program that allowed me to do so in a safe environment, and that I was with a group where I felt comfortable and supported as I did so. I know not everyone has access to rehab or the ability to do it, but please don't let that stop you. A better life is possible. I'm grateful and proud to say I will not drink with you today!",189

Right now at this moment I find myself really missing my old life, but I knew when I decided to get sober that I was also signing up for nights exactly like this; sad and living in the lie that alcohol was great and the solution to all my fun and the only way to spend time with friends. 
I quit my job as a server without notice 50 days ago after it becoming such a toxic workplace and full of stressors that helped speed up my drinking consumption. My life since then has changed drastically, I do not see the people I use to work with anymore, the people I associated as good friends. My life did a 180. 

I have tried AA a few times and I did enjoy it. Some days are so much more positive than the ones like today, and I have one on one therapy once a week as well as a group therapy I just started that I really love. 

I keep looking back though, wondering if I could have controlled that night I had a mental breakdown a little better. But I know it was inevitable. 

Anyway, this is all VERY new. I’ve scanned this sub for so long and in some of my darkest nights before sobriety these stories always tied me back to my truth somehow. 

If anyone has any tips on how they began to fill their time after drinking please let me know! What new activities did you take up? What drastic changes did you make that feel better now that you have?

I lost a lot of the things and people that motivated me earlier this year. I spent a large portion of the summer wasted. I've cut back and even stopped for extended periods since then, but the area I'm in makes drinking acceptable and even encouraged. I'm moving soon and when I do I would like to really restrict or totally stop any alcohol consumption. I've seen a significant decline in my health and mood in the past couple months, but I believe I could fix it with enough time.

Do any of you have tips on starting over somewhere new, or approaches that help with cutting down? Usually the biggest problem I have is that when I'm sober, time feels likes its passing really slowly. Another factor is that I usually don't have anyone to talk to in that sort of void space.

Any and all advice is appreciated.",4

I didn't get into much detail about my addiction and trauma, but I'm glad I could be vulnerable in front of someone I love. I hate the term ""high functioning alcoholic"", but I'm really one of those people who drinks alone almost every single day and no one knows how severe my habit is. But I'm changing that.  It's been a while since I've been able to be vulnerable like this.  It's a little uncomfortable, but I think it's a step in the right direction. How did y'all tell your family about your addiction? If you're keeping it to yourself (like I have for a month) why aren't you telling them?

Basically I’m a 31 year old guy I have a partner of 9 years and 2 beautiful boys aged 2 and 3 there my world. My situation may be different to a few people on here. My drinking doesn’t effect what I do day by day. I never miss anything I’m meant to do and I’m never effected in my duties as a partner or father. I don’t drink everyday or in excess most of the time. And I Guess I’m one of the lucky ones and no matter what I drink I genuinely don’t get hangovers. So where’s the issue? Well my health and my mind. A lot of people believe alcoholics are people who drink everyday or get wasted every time etc. But it’s on a person by person basis. I can go several days without drink but usually have a drink a couple of times a week. I can stop for a little longer but when I think about it i completely fail. My attitude and personality turns short fused and annoyed. I can have a sip of a drink and all of a sudden I’m cured for the next 7 or so days. This is where I can’t break the cycle. As I said it effects nothing in my life on a day to day basis but I want to be able to quit to live longer and get in better shape for my boys. I’m hoping writing this here and hearing some positive things can push me on. Thanks for your time day one starts when I wake.,4

15 days off the sauce, 10 days off of weed. This is the longest I’ve been totally sober in many years. 

Things have turned around immensely. Got back together with my girlfriend in the wake of my sobriety. I’m addressing my depression like the actual illness that it is for the first time in my life. I’ve started anti-depressants and they’ve been fantastic. I’m up early and clear minded every single day. I’m productive, eating healthy, kicking ass at work. 

It all feels good. I feel strong and in control. So I’m dying to go drink after work. I feel like it could just be tonight. Like I wouldn’t have to tell anyone, no one would know at all. I could pretend tomorrow is Day 16. 

I’m off work in about an hour and I can’t imagine going straight home without stopping at my favorite bar. I feel sick thinking about going to bed without a drink. 

I can’t ruin this. It won’t be one drink, it won’t be just tonight. If I go, it will start all over again. I know it. It’ll turn into every day. Plus, I really can’t because alcohol plus my meds are a very bad combo. 

It’s killing me to say it, but I will not drink with you today.

It was a prideful experience for me. The conversation was cause for reflection on so many of the things that have changed for the better since quitting. My lowered anxiety. My 25-lbs of lost weight. My mindfulness and meditation practice. My increased awareness of migraine and stress triggers. My lessened armpit perspiration. And most of all, although we didn't talk about this, the absence of shame.

I know this must have been my excuse since I started my career and have really enjoyed myself differences of flavor with so many varieties of Japanese SAKE for so long.

I've had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol since my very first sip as a teenager, many moons ago. I've been able to hold it together - for the most part - until maybe the past year or so, then things kind of went off the rails. Missing work, drinking in the morning, you know the drill. I had attempted to quit many times before, but with no success.

So, I decided to give it yet another try. But first, I had to get through a semi-long vacation in a part of the world where culture revolves around heavy drinking. I decided that there was no point in trying to quit in the couple of weeks between The Decision and vacation, so I'd start the day after my return. That was 39 days ago.

And here's where things get interesting. It's been easy. Like, really, really easy. It's like a switch has been flipped in my brain. I really just have no interest in drinking. I barely even think about. I've been in social situations where others are drinking, and I just contentedly sip my iced tea as if that's what I'd always done in the company of drinkers. I don't make a conscious decision not to drink. I don't miss it, I don't crave it, I don't feel socially awkward without it. I should note here that around the time of my vacation I was diagnosed with and medicated for a mood disorder. I understand that mood disorders and substance abuse often go hand in hand, so maybe now that I'm properly medicated, things just feel different. I really don't know.

Now, let me be clear about something here: I'm under no delusion that things will always be this easy, or that I'm ""cured"", or that the monster isn't lurking right below the surface and waiting to strike when I have my guard down. That is a very real possibility. But I guess what I'd like to know: has anyone had a similar experience to this? Did the switch eventually flip back? What did you do to manage your addiction when not drinking just feels so, so easy?",6

There were waiters brining booze constantly.  My husband and I showed up a little late and most of our buddies were already feeling pretty good.  After one cup of coffee and a ginger ale, I started to feel really uncomfortable, a little too close to ordering alcohol.  I also felt like I wanted to cry because this disease can grab ahold of us at any moment.  Instead of drinking, I told everyone I had to leave because I was wanting a drink but I cannot drink.  I’m so thankful for my friends because they didn’t say one word about getting me to try to stay.  Everyone said “I get it, thanks for coming.”   On the way home, I called my mom who was super proud of me.   I made the right choice.   IWNDWYT",177

It was after a couple of nights where I needed to apologize to my wife for things I couldn’t remember and other nonsense. So I decided to re-evaluate my relationship with alcohol, which currently was an equivalent to 8-10 drinks a night, on most nights. 

I felt I could cut back to just Friday and Saturdays. About 10 years ago I was drinking heavily, but stopped for a few years. I started back gradually. Also, I could go without drinking for at least a week every few months while on-call for work, so I thought it would be easy.

Over the past month of failing to cut back, I realized how hard it would be if I allowed alcohol to have even a small influence. I took a good hard look at my behavior and, on Nov. 14, I decided to stop all together.

Through internal reflection I discovered that I’ve always had a problem with alcohol. My dad was a functional alcoholic. I started in college, and after a few bad decisions, flunked out. Alcohol was always present in everything. When I would take a week off for on-call work, I always looked forward to that first drink. 

I found this community and can see myself in a lot of posts. I find a lot of encouragement reading them, and look forward to spending my evenings doing more productive things. 

I turn 46 on the 17th and I’m going to roll into that age 3 days sober.

Could anyone who has also had it share their experience?,"Last Friday, I had to go to the ER and then stay in the hospital because I had gone on an alcoholic binge and I also did not eat for days. Turns out, I had acute pancreatitis. I stayed in the hospital for a week, and I was discharged yesterday. I was extremely dehydrated when I got there. The staff needed a urine sample and I couldn’t give it to them until I had been on an IV for several hours. The doctor’s plan for me was that I needed to work myself back up to real food. They didn’t let me eat or drink anything the first day that I was there. I was only allowed to snack on ice chips. Even that upset my stomach. Then they let me have clear liquids, then “full” liquids, then actual food. No matter what phase I was on, however, either my stomach would hurt really badly or I would feel really nauseous. I am pretty sure the nurses had to give me something for pain at least one or two times a day. Well, the doctor decided I was good to go yesterday and that I could be discharged. He asked if I needed anything, and I asked him about pain medicine because my stomach still hurts extremely badly most times that I eat. He said it would go away with time. 

Today, I ate a greek yogurt in the morning, but I took a nausea pill that the doctor had prescribed right before as a preventative measure. I don’t think I felt that bad after eating. I slept right after, so if I was feeling pain, it was not bad enough to wake me up. After I woke up, I had a bottle of ensure and my stomach is in so much pain right now. I hate this feeling so much. I just wanted to know about other people’s experiences with pancreatitis. Mainly how long did it take for you to be able eat without your stomach hurting. Any advice is also appreciated.

I have fought a long battle with substance abuse addiction for over a decade. It is no exaggeration that I have blown, smoked, snorted, freebased, tripped, rolled, but primarily **drank** my youth and young manhood away. I am so deeply ashamed of that. I just turned 30 a couple months ago and it hit me hard. I wanted to be free of all substances by that particular milestone. I wanted to, idk, have my shit together. I'm not and I don't. I hate my life. I hate myself. I fear that I've done permanent damage to my body and my brain. I'm days away from getting evicted, which I have a plan to barely scrape up the money I'll need to make rent.   


That being said, I feel physically better and mentally than I have in a very long time thanks to getting some REM sleep that I've been putting off for weeks and abstaining from booze. Like I said, beginning this time, or should I say AT this time is kind of an accident. I had quit in the middle of September following my birthday and I was flying high. Working out, eating right, reading books, while avoiding anything that got in my way (porn, video games, laziness in general, etc.). It was going great even after I relapsed. I told myself I don't have to stop doing bad stuff, just doing more stuff. That took me straight down the path to degeneracy as it always ever does. My physical dependence grew fast. Last week I was crushing 2 6-packs of 16oz cans a night, plus a couple 24's if I'm tolerating somebody's company.  In the course of maybe 3 or 4 hours. I don't particularly enjoy the feeling of being drunk when being reintroduced to it after a long period of sobriety. Why, then, does it become something I feel like I absolutely have to do?   


What got me on the wagon again was both chance and will. My last day of real hardcore drunkenness was, tbh, I can't even remember. Tuesday or Wednesday. But I blacked out hard. Woke up and had a couple tall boys. Then laid off for a day or two. Thursday I had 2 tall cans. Yesterday, I walked into the supermarket with absolute intention of spending my last 4 dollars on 3 tall cans of some strong malt liquor, but I couldn't find my ID all day and my buddy wasn't behind the counter. So no go. I went and got some water and fruit instead. I rang it up at the self checkout and when the transaction was finished and the receipt printed, I felt my ID in my front pocket. In a place I thought I had searched a million times in my frantic frenzy to get booze. Only after I blew the 4 bucks did I find it. You know damn well I was searching HARD for that ID. And there it was, after the choice to get alcohol was gone. That kinda blew me away, and my life has a history of freaky serendipitous warnings to quit drinking, so I cut my losses. Hm. I guess that's it for now. IWNDWYT.",4

So, rant over and a day later after working out our communication is wonky he has agreed to support me if I am clear about how and I have said I will tell him how.

That said the biggest issue I am noticing is holy hell I am entirely unable to sleep in when I am not hungover.

During the work week  usually go to bed around 12 and get up at 730. On the weekends however I tend to stay up considerably later (3/4/5) hanging out with friends, playing games, watching shows, or writing music. 

Previously I had done this somewhere between pretty tipsy and “what even did I do last night” levels of drunk, leading me to sleep in till around 11. While the drunk sleep was not exactly the best health wise, it was at very least sleep.

Sober now however, I can not sleep in past 830, much as I try. Before I started drinking I used to be well known among my friends for sleeping in till 1+ in the afternoon on weekends, but now it’s like my brain has forgotten how to.

I never set out to quit drinking for good.  But now I’m thinking at the end of my 30 days do I really want to drink?  It’s kinda crazy but I’m not sure I do.  Anyway, this is an unexpected side effect of quitting drinking I suppose.  The more days I wake up without a hangover, the more in control I feel of my life and emotions, the more I enjoy going to bed clear headed, I wonder...could this perhaps last more than 30 days? 

Anyway, I’m happy that I’ve done this challenge.  I’m getting through it.   It’s fun.   It’s enjoyable.

Since the start of 2019, approximately 5 of those months have been spent completely sober, no drinking at all, which Im proud of! However, drinking is a huge part of social culture, especially when meeting new people. Anyways, I was on a 2 month streak of not drinking, which was pretty easy since I live alone and dont go out much, but I met a girl in my apartment complex and we went put for a few drinks. I eally paced myself, only having 1 whiskey and coke and a 20 oz beer. Was barely buzzed, drank over the span of a few hours, and had a great time. My biggest fear from this was that allowing myself to drink at all would cause me to want to drink heavily the following weeks since I had broken the streak i was on, but I was wrong. I havent had any alcohol since then, and am still feeling good about it, no regrets about last weekend. Is allowing myself to drink lightly in these social settings, maybe once a weekend an okay plan so long as I tell myself I wont drink alone or on weeknights?

Went to our local HS playoff football game completely alcohol free - was amazed at the amount of alcohol I smelled on people and my buddies - I was right there with them before - was kind of embarrassed knowing people have probably smelt the liquor on me before or could tell I was buzzing - found out last night how noticeable it is from a sober view.

This is the first time i have come across this page and would really like some help 😣.
I suffer with depression and anxiety, last year i had the worst panic attack id ever experienced and as a result decided to take steps to better my health. I started meditation, more exercise and trying to fix my diet which included abstaining from alcohol, as my Hangxiety was nothing short of horrendous. I dont know if its normal but i would truly feel like i was going to die. I would get pins and needles throughout my body for up to 48 hours afterwards, had several blood tests done and nothing of any significance would flag up .Anyway i stopped for about 8 months and then have slowly brought it back into my life on occasion and have been very good at having one or two and calling it a night. However last night was a celebration for my 30th birthday. I promised myself i wouldnt drink but that went out of the window and i ended up consuming the most amount of alcohol ive had in years. Got in at 3:30 am and have been in a horrible state since. Panic attacks, shaking etc and just feeling generally scared that ive done some lasting damage or theres some underlying issue. 

I guess id like some help in gaining some structure to finally kick this habit for good as the days that follow just simply arent worth it. Tomorrow seems so far away and i just want to feel better 😣",4
2019-11-16 12:00:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dx9el8/i_lost_my_aunt_and_uncle_this_week/,I lost my aunt and uncle this week.,"I got a call a couple of days ago that my uncle had passed and my aunt was about to go too. He had fallen down drunk at home while she was in the hospital. Normally, when one of them fell the other would call the ambulance to get them into detox. Because my aunt was already in the hospital there was nobody there to help him. He was already on blood thinners, so when he bled out he was dead within minutes. He was not found until the next day. 

My aunt was in the hospital for the god knows how many time this year. What was different this time was it was discovered her liver and kidneys had shut down and her brain was liquefied from the alcohol. We didn't know she was dying until her son called the hospital to find out since he hadn't heard from her husband. She has lost her ability to speak and now cannot wake up. She is surrounded by family as I write this.

My entire life they had been heavy drinkers. My aunt's first marriage could not survive her drinking, so she found another husband with whom she could indulge. They were rich, respected, and successful in their fields of work. They had a massive house and fine wares. Holiday's spent at their house were a treat as they spared no expense. It was always a good time until they got too drunk. It wasn't until the last 7-8 years that things really started falling apart. They both lost their jobs, got DUI's, lost their licenses, and were pretty much isolated in their home. They still had money so they just ordered in all their groceries and liquor. They went from well dressed, healthy looking rich folks to bloated, matted haired, shadows of their former selves. It was hard to see them when they came around at Christmas. 

Now my uncle has finally taken his last drink and my aunt is hours from going herself. Looking at her distorted, yellow, yet frail body has been horrible, but I feel so much sorrow that they were not able to make the changes they needed in life. I chose last week that I was done with alcohol forever, but this is what really makes it clear for me going forward. I will never drink again. I love you auntie and uncle. 

TL:DR- Aunt and uncle drank themselves to death this week.",20

I watched some TV. I wasn't even into it, which I usually am. Then I played video games while I was drunk and it stunk. The games were way more fun when I was sober. 

Funnily enough, eventually I thought, ""I'm bored!"" Wait, I was supposedly 'bored' when I wasn't drinking. I thought drinking eliminated my boredom. How can I bored WITH a drink?! Exactly.

I'm not beating myself up too badly today. It was...experience, I guess? Not necessarily valuable experience, but it told me something about why I enjoyed being sober much more.

I'm drinking Diet Dr. Pepper today. Much tastier than stinky booze.

I haven’t even been tempted. I luckily still vividly remember my 3 day hangover from my last binge on October 14th.

I decided to quit for a month initially and had no intention to quit completely at the time. Just a break. Now I am going to just keep going as I really don’t miss it. I have been in situations where people are drinking and I had no interest in having a drink. 👍

The good...

- I am down 15lbs from not drinking 6-24 beers every day.
- I am going to bed earlier and get lots of solid sleep. No waking up having a panic attack, to pee or for aspirin or water.
- having normal and solid craps for the first time in years.
- I haven’t slept in for over 3 weeks. I am up earlier than I have been in years... every day.
- I haven’t got in a argument with my wife or kids worth remembering in weeks.
- I have saved over $400 in booze purchases. God knows how much more I would have spent on my usual 2-3 drinks every time we have lunch or dinner out.
- I am more active and actually look forward to doing things that I used to avoid like walking the dog. I have done 10-13k steps every day for over 3 weeks. Just by getting off my ass.
- I am getting things done around the house. Cleaning, painting, changing lights, etc. I no longer procrastinate.
- my stress and anxiety are almost non existent now.
- I am enjoying revisiting old hobbies.
- I haven’t fell or hurt myself.
- I haven’t done coke or had any desire. 
- I haven’t texted or called anyone blackout drunk.
- I look and feel 100% better.

The bad...

- Nothing to report. 🙂",21

2019-11-16 11:33:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dx926j/my_experience_being_three_months_sober_at_a_bar/,My Experience Being Three Months Sober at a Bar,"My friend's birthday was yesterday and he'd invited me out. We hadn't seen much of each other lately so it was a good opportunity to catch up. We started the night with happy hour at his favorite bar, then we drove downtown to barhop a little and grab some food.

I didn't talk about being sober at first; I just didn't order or accept any drinks. My friend told me after a few hours that he'd just decided to not make a big deal of it. This resulted in at least one time that someone ordered a round of shots and someone had to do two or basically give one to a stranger.

I had decided going in that I was going to have a three strikes rule: If I felt pressured to drink three times, I would leave. Thankfully, there wasn't even one strike. There was mostly just confusion--some people thought I had never drank, I think some thought I was just staying sober so I can DD, and one girl actually just didn't get it by the time she was three sheets to the wind and offered to buy me a drink for driving her.

My friend stayed pretty tolerable while he was drinking. I paid for his drinks from happy hour and he only paid for a couple of his own drinks all night, so I imagine he was pretty far gone by the time he went home. The only person who got a bit obnoxious was the aforementioned girl. She's apparently a bit of a kleptomaniac when she drinks, and I think she managed to steal something from every bar we went to. She forgot a couple items in my car. I'm keeping the glass. It's a nice glass.

At some point, someone decided to insist on getting birthday boy to do karaoke. This resulted in us finding the shittiest bar I have ever been in. It was a tiny, square building. Four brick walls and a small little corner reserved for the bathroom. As soon as we showed up, I was like, okay, clearly we're not staying here. I think I even heard them say they'd just get one drink and then go somewhere else, especially since there were 20 songs reserved already so it would take like an hour and a half to get to any song requests.

By the time that ""just one drink"" came around the third time, it was nearly midnight. I decided then that I was no longer having fun. It was loud and I was in a shitty bar that I'm pretty sure mainly stayed in business because they turn a blind eye to underage drinking. I wasn't going to be a wet blanket and tell my friend that I would prefer to go to another bar, so I told my friend happy birthday and left.

Overall, not a bad experience. When I was drinking, people usually couldn't tell when I was drunk anyway, so I wasn't much different from usual. I was just a little less outgoing because I cared more what people thought... like when they decided to sing happy birthday at *every* bar we went to. I probably looked so embarrassed that people might have thought I was the birthday boy. But when you're around that kind of energy, it can rub off on you a little without touching a drop, so for most of the night, while I was with my friends, I felt pretty good and was able to party along with them. I imagine that bar would have been much more tolerable if I'd been drinking, but I can't say that I wouldn't have felt trapped there against my will. Just glad I decided to drive so I had an easy way out.

I didn't feel tempted all night. If I'd had a stressful week at work, I might have cancelled going out. Like I told my friend, I would have loved to have a beer, but I also didn't feel like I had to. I also spent maybe a third of what I would have if I'd been drinking. Probably less. Not drinking has honestly affected my bank account more than anything else.",13
2019-11-16 11:32:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dx91r6/12_through_nobender_november/,1/2 through no-bender November,"My last drink was Halloween evening. I had decided almost a week prior that I was going to dry out for the entire month of November. I didn't decide to ""try"", I decided I was going to do it.

I've been a daily drinker for at least a decade with few exceptions here and there. The evenings and weekends have been the most challenging but it's the 16th and I'm halfway through my goal. Not a drop.

I feel good and I've gotten a lot of small projects accomplished that otherwise would have lingered on whilst I drank myself into a fuzzy stupor, but I've also discovered that sober me can also be a lazy lay-on-the-couch and watch-TV-all-day bloke on a day off work, which kind of disappointed me. I had a false notion that getting off the bottle would turn me into super-me. Turns out I'm still me, still impatient sometimes, I still lose my temper, still lazy sometimes. But I do *feel* better. Every single morning I used to deal with a hangover. Now I'm clear eyed and coherent every morning. My headspace is much clearer and I'm sleeping much better. My confidence level is way higher because I'm not constantly managing my addiction and the effects of daily drinking.

I've been thinking alot about what's going to happen Dec 1st. Will I fall back into my old routine? A part of me is just counting the days until I can have that first drink again. Another part wants to abandon that lifestyle forever. I have goals I want to accomplish and the drinking is impeding me reaching those goals. Bottom line is I don't want to live life as a drunk. It's a pointless, stupid, waste. But these things are easier said than done..

Just needed to reflect and emote. This sub has been a constant companion these 16 days. Thank you all for sharing your own struggles and successful milestones. Happy Saturday! IWNDWYT!",6

Drinking completely took my hobbies away from me. The obvious effect is that I would go out drinking for the night instead of reading, playing music, weightlifting. But then the next day I would be hungover. I'd stay late in bed and spend all day trying to get rid of the headache or getting my stomach back in line. Even if I was home the whole day over the weekend, I'd be nursing the hangover instead of pursuing my passions. 

I found also that the days I didn't drink, I didn't even have the energy or motivation to read or play music. Drinking also seems to enhance my ADHD. It was much easier to stare at my phone, scroll through reddit, or sit around doing nothing than seek out my hobbies. I didn't have the energy or focus to do anything more.

The days seem so much longer now that I wake up early with a clear head! Today I've already read, played music, and I'm off to the gym now to lift. It's only 9:30AM too. This is wonderful.

Last night I went out to Happy Hour with friends at work. I told the waitress that I was just fine with water. My friends were visibly/audibly disappointed in my decision for some reason. I stuck around for an hour or so and then went to the gym to climb. I doubt they even remember or care that I didn't drink and I'm way better off today for it.

Lately it seems like my choices are to stay home and have a fun night in by myself or go out and be the only sober one. I know the feeling is a good thing to lean into because it will drive me toward change but it’s hard.

Also, I’m so frustrated by the amount of people who have suggested I start smoking weed when I tell them I don’t drink. I have no problem if others indulge but I don’t do it and I don’t like it and it’s so invasive/dismissive for someone to suggest it like that. Totally makes me feel like they don’t get it.

I've been thinking about this post for a long time -hoping and believing I'd get there, thinking I'd have something profound to say when I did. Well, I got here, but I don't have anything magical to say. One thing about getting sober has been trying to accept I'm not nearly as magical or profound as I'd like to think. 

Instead, here are some general highlights and musings from the past year:

&#x200B;

* Ran a half marathon a couple weeks ago! It was hardly my fastest half marathon, but I'm most proud of it. I've always found running easier when it's to burn off negative energy and thoughts. Being sober, I don't have as many of those, so I had to use a different approach for my long runs when training for this one. 
* Handled triggers at work like giving lengthy presentations, talking to coworkers, etc. One nice thing is that the physical stomach symptoms and intense fear I've felt ahead of presentations since 5th grade has finally dulled, now it's just somewhat unpleasant rather than brutal.
* Handled triggers in social situations, including holiday parties, getting a cup of beer spilled on me at a baseball game, in-laws, etc. I slipped up and probably snapped at my in-laws a couple times, something I'm usually pretty good at not doing, but overall a pretty solid performance. 
* Ate lots of food. And chocolate. And sparkling water. And trail mix. So much of all of those things.
* Went through a miscarriage with my wife. The pregnancy wasn't far along, but man did it affect me. I've never gone from so happy to so sad in such a short amount of time.
* Conceived again, and baby is due in January! It's been a lot of work getting ready, and my wife says she's never seen me so happy. 
* Listened to Tyler Childers ""Purgatory"" album. If you're at least okay with country / bluegrass, definitely check it out - themes of dealing with addiction throughout.
* Threw away various alcohol-themed possessions, like beer fridge magnets, beer snob books, etc. They mean nothing to me now. 
* Bought a new car and dealt with the mean car salesmen and finance department!
* Stayed within myself. Didn't try to be there for everyone in every situation, especially people who are just coworkers - not family. Embraced my introspective nature. I did get a lot of ""what's wrongs"" early on when I went into hermit mode, but I've slowly un-thawed over time, and it was definitely necessary. 
* Cried and laughed more than I ever have, sometimes about things that deserved cries and laughs, but often about things that didn't. I was an emotional roller coaster. So much feels. F\*\*k. 
* Went to the doctor to make sure I was okay. I am!
* Didn't worry about taking over the counter medications because I no longer consume 3+ drinks a day! 
* Went through physical withdrawal for a couple of the first few weeks, this weird haziness that felt like it could only be lifted with alcohol. It was not good. I never, ever want to go back to that again. Chocolate and sleep helped so much. 
* Continued to learn guitar, which is a lot easier to practice and get better at when playing sober. 
* Embraced uncertainty as best I can. Not trying to control things. Especially with a baby on the way, a little human whose personality I have no idea about, this has been very important.
* Thought about the road I had been going down, and how I was much more addicted than I realized. I have compulsive thoughts anyway, so it wasn't hard for me to naturally embrace my addictive thoughts, but stepping back now I realize how much of my life was consumed with thinking about alcohol or drinking. I was really lucky that my wife found my empties, realized what was going on, and that it was enough pressure for me to stop, because it wasn't going to be much longer before things fell apart. The cracks were forming big time. 
* Remembered all the TV and sports I watched. 
* Got through brutal acne at the beginning. I've never had great skin, and I tend to pick at my face constantly which doesn't help things, but man this was another level. Anyways, it got better! My wife remarked about 6 weeks in that my skin looked like it was glowing one morning with the sun peeking through the window. The bags under my eyes faded too.
* Told a few people I knew that I was an alcoholic. I didn't necessarily get the support I was hoping for, but my expectations were probably too much. It was still good to tell them. Planning on telling my parents finally in a couple weeks when they come out for the baby shower. 
* Tried various support systems - online AA meetings through the In the Rooms app, This Naked Mind (not my favorite, but worth trying), ""Blackout"" by Sarah Hepola. I tried one in-person AA meeting, but it was just too intense for me. When people and public speaking are two of your big triggers, man, I just don't know. I think it's about trying a bunch of things and taking a little bit from everything, whatever works for you on your journey. 
* Make functional use of the space where I used to hide my alcohol. Baby is on the way, need to make every square inch of that closet count!

Thank you everyone, you've been an integral part of my recovery and I look forward to celebrating many milestones with you in the future. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I must go for a run to partially compensate for the bloomin' onion I'm going to demolish at Outback Steakhouse tonight.

*What we really have is a daily reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition.*

— ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 85

Maintaining my spiritual condition is like working out every day, planning for the marathon, swimming laps, jogging. It's staying in good shape spiritually, and that requires prayer and meditation. The single most important way for me to improve my conscious contact with a Higher Power is to pray and meditate. I am as powerless over alcohol as I am to turn back the waves of the sea; no human force had the power to overcome my alcoholism. Now I am able to breathe the air of joy, happiness and wisdom. I have the power to love and react to events around me with the eyes of a faith in things that are not readily apparent. My daily reprieve means that, no matter how difficult or painful things appear today, I can draw on the power of the program to stay liberated from my cunning, baffling and powerful illness.",2

I felt horrible yesterday after drinking a 26er of whiskey to myself. The heart burn was relentless and didn’t stop until 2:00am. It was not a good day. I know I need to stop drinking right away. I can’t afford it, I’m starting a new job on Monday, I am beginning to worry about my health(I’m still well but that won’t last), I’m trying to get into better shape and whiskey is preventing that. It is just empty calories, so no matter how much I diet and work out, whiskey is always going to keep my weight loss low. Also I think it is causing my hair line to recede a bit. It’s not good for hormone levels either. In general, the reasons to quit have stacked up. The only reason I have been drinking was to satisfy one stupid part of my brain. That ass hole can deal with it though because the rest of my brain and body say stop.

I researched the mechanism of addiction (drug discovery for opioid addiction) for my PhD and have been diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder (benzodiazepines/cannabis) in my youth, but it took me until this year to realize that ALCOHOL was my drug of choice. Also it took me until this year to realize I should do something about it. 

I have a difficult time modifying my behavior, so my wife and I came up with a reinforcement plan (she's a behaviorist) and I started tracking my drinking ([for the data nerds like me out there, here's a graph](https://imgur.com/a/hrXVQQP)).

I'm roughly on schedule but getting really frustrated with myself, because this is so hard. Basically I keep ""outgrowing"" my reinforcement schedule because the desire to drink keeps growing and growing. First I was paying myself not to drink by writing down all the money I would have spent on it and then buying myself something nice at the end of the week/two weeks. It made the initial reduction in my drinking very easy, because it was a powerful reward. But this stopped feeling rewarding after I completely stopped drinking last month. Since then, it's only gotten harder and harder... and I feel like I'm going to cave; I'm doubting my own resolve even when I know I need to buckle down and be even more stringent right now.

I'm just sad that this is such a struggle. I'm also sad that it makes me not want to be social. I've gone to two weddings this past month and they were both incredibly difficult. I was basically fighting myself not to go to the open bar at both the entire time. I'm really dreading some of my future obligations that will involve drinking (bachelorette parties/weddings). It seems too easy to break in a society where I have to stare at my deepest temptation literally every 15 minutes when I'm out. Even going to the store to buy food involves testing my willpower. Ugh. okay end rant. Anyways, thank you for listening.",75

Since then I’ve watched my 20yr drinking addiction drop from a bottle of Russian Standard a day, to 2 bottles of wine, to one bottle of wine, to just a half a bottle of wine a couple months ago when I started following this sub.

I really haven’t felt any physical issues during this 95% taper down so when I decided to take a few days off, a few weeks ago, I wasn’t expecting any physical issues...I was wrong. The first week I thought I was fighting off a cold (one of the kids had an ear infection) b/c I had a slight fever 🤒 and severe night sweats. However the sweats were lessening each day so I thought I was good to drink on Halloween so I had a bottle of wine. Had another low grade fever the next day and night sweats the next 4 days.

After the second week of feeling sick with night sweats I thought ‘this is a virus’...still not considering it was withdrawals. Next I went on vacation and drank for 3 straight days like an idiot, came home and had a fever then the same pattern of night sweats. So I went to the walk-in clinic the next morning and was told by a MD that I have an acute disease and need to see my primary care physician asap. So I scheduled an appointment w/ my primary care and continue to have the night sweats..except this time after 3 days I woke up w/ hives. I was itching all day and at the end of the day 4 my feet felt like they were on fire and I wasn’t able to scratch them enough. I experienced the same pattern of itching and night sweats on day 5 as well, but thankfully my throat no longer hurts on day 6, which was the only thing I could tell my primary care that “hurt” when I saw him the day before. My primary care told me there is no way this is withdrawals, ordered blood work, and ordered my 3rd CT scan in 6mths. Praise the higher power for Reddit where I could research and see that yes..my symptoms were in fact from withdrawals so I’ll pass on the unneeded scan.

So my itching on day 6 is subsiding and I was able to go out w/ two alcoholic friends for lunch and preach how CBD has allowed me to lose 60#, heal my anxiety, get in the best shape of my (post college) life, and cure my alcoholism w/o me even really trying. This is the morning of day 7 and I’ve never felt better (zero anxiety)..no seriously. I’ll keep sweating the bed, scratching like a crack fiend, having MDs tell me I’m “high risk for cancer and not going through withdrawals”, but I will not drink with you today!",4

I was/am feeling really conflicted. Everyone seems to have had a blast. But I know I had three choices:

1. Don't drink and feel like a fraud on the periphery and probably have to pretend to be having an awesome time whilst people screeched and babbled incoherently at me all night.

2. Drink. Get shit faced. Outpace everyone and fail to stay composed. Embarrass myself and not even remember much of the night. Wake up feeling hideous and barely be able to look after my child and waste an entire day.

3. Go and pick my child up feeling a tinge of sadness and severe FOMO, help her post her letter to Santa. Order a takeaway. Catch up on the phone with one of my best friends who is having a tough time and get some online Christmas shopping done. Wake up and enjoy my day with energy and a clear head.

Why did I choose Option 2 for so long?

I feel blessed today that I've finally got the hang of choosing (and enjoying) Option 3.

I especially like to hear about someone with a lot of time and wonder what it will be like for me when I get there.  They seem so wise to me.  Are they serene all the time?  Have they figured out the secret of life?   Did all their problems work themselves out?

At 90 days I am feeling pretty well.  My physical health is where I see the most noted improvement as I have lost some weight, I sleep better and have some more energy.  Mentally I have improved too. My thoughts are clearer and my temper has cooled a little bit.  The urge to drink is pretty much gone.  Before a party or somewhere I used to get drunk I just have to do a little mental prep work. It’s easy now and I like everything better without drinking.  

There are some what I call negatives. Meaning they’re hard feelings I’m having to deal with as a result of not having alcohol in my system.  

I was a drinker for about 19 years prior to this current attempt at getting clean. I’m feeling that where I am in life is a result of clouded judgment from boozing days.  In other words, I’m getting to know my real self better now that I’m not numbed by alcohol and the major choices I made back then were highly influenced by my drinking.  I also feel like I have known this for a while and kept drinking to feel ok about it. 

Things like career choice, spouse, place to live etc. it worked when I was drinking and numbing.  I’m feeling like they are not compatible with my true character. I’m feeling trapped and burdened by these long term commitments I have made. If I decided to leave or change one of them there would likely be a severe reaction.  

I have this overwhelming desire to be alone. Completely alone.  And the choices I’ve made have put me in a place where I’m always surrounded by people.  People that annoy me and let me down.  

In high school and college I wanted to move away from where I live now. Generally the people here suck and the politics and cost of living are suffocating. Yet I chose a career that is fixed here and have my wife and three kids.   We’re probably not going anywhere for a long time. 

As I’m writing this I feel like I just need an escape.  My escape used to be in liquid form.  Now I need something more.  My old dreams and desires for life are coming back to my consciousness.  Why did I cheat myself out of my own life all these years?   Why did I drink to be ok with things I didn’t ever want to do and had the choice?  How can I still pursue what I need while preserving the family I have made?  Is compromise a possibility or do sacrifices need to be made?

Thing is I still don’t know what I exactly want.  Will I regret these new choices I make?   I’m stuck.  I need direction, somewhere to aim my life.  I don’t know where to go from here.  I’m just as confused and lost as when I was 15 just now with so much more to lose.  

Getting sober is just the beginning.  I’m starting to understand what led me to drink in the first place.  One day at a time for now.  IWNDWYT.",88

2019-11-16 05:41:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dx5d0d/the_toxic_best_friend/,The Toxic 'Best Friend',"I remember many years ago a friend's mum gave me some advice about smoking that I think applies perfectly to alcohol, and I hope may be of some use to even just one person who reads this. Below is as I have substituted cigarettes for alcohol:

Alcohol is like your best friend. When you're down and feeling low, it's always there to share the bad times. When you're up and on high, it's there to share the good times. When you're bored and lonely it's there to keep you company. When you're proud of yourself for an achievement it's there to congratulate you and to celebrate with you. When you're out socialising it's always there. When you're exhausted and drained, it's there with you. It will never abandon you. When there's nobody else to turn to and all hope seems lost, it's the only one still there for you.

The problem is, it's not your best friend at all. It pretends to be, and seduces you into thinking that it is, but it's nothing more than a toxic parasite. A true friend wouldn't try to slowly kill you. A true friend wouldn't take all of your money. A true friend wouldn't make you look a fool so often. A true friend wouldn't hurt you repeatedly then refuse to take any responsibility. A true friend wouldn't force away everything else in your life and make you dependent on them. A true friend is somebody you can trust to not work against you and pretend they're only looking out for you.

Maybe this rings some bells with some of you, maybe not, but it's something I've finally come to accept and found helpful, so I hope it helps some of you too.

I'm 26, I'm a professional, married, work 50 hours a week, exercise almost daily, own a home, pets and definitely drink daily.

I never used to drink- I had a few on my 18th, I had a mouthful here and there since but never noticed much benefit and just saw it as empty calories. I had my first glass of wine at 21, with a friend, and the AMAZING feeling of relaxation and happiness I got was the start of a slippery slope.

I started working full-time in a very high stress, often unpleasant, often demoralising or disheartening environment. Drinking culture was a huge part of that workplace. It's a huge part of my current workplace too (same career, different place). After a year or so, I was drinking most nights- one to two glasses of wine. Then my then-BF went overseas for a few weeks, leaving me home alone in a scary neighbourhood with memories of a past sexual assault post-break in.

So I started drinking every night, at least 3 glasses, mixed with sleeping tablets, just so I could sleep. When he came back, I stayed drinking. Things got more stressful at work, accompanied with family stress and then we started planning a wedding, studying again and building a house. I kept drinking. Leading up to and after the wedding, I kept drinking to deal with family stress.

I then started antidepressants last year, adding a second one a few months ago.

It's to a point where I just drink out of habit. I like the pretty gold liquid in the elegant glass. I like the WHOOSH of relaxation (though that doesn't happen much now). But I HATE the headache, the hangxiety, the grouchiness, the nightmares, the FAT AROUND MY BELLY. I KNOW I'm killing myself. I've never missed a day of work from it but I've had many sore heads, toilet spews and a broken rib, possibly from violent vomiting. And so much shame.

I did Dry July this year. I did it! It was so hard the first week, then it was easy... ish. But July ended and I was so sad at the thought of never being able to drink and relax again.

I know I'll be happier without it. I just need to find another way to relax, and think about the benefits. Less cancer risk, better sex, no relationship strain, no shame, no worrying about driving, no headaches, better mental health. I want to prep my body for babies, I don't want to have to struggle through pregnancy wanting to drink.

I am just struggling with the idea that I'll be the weirdo that doesn't drink. I'm not an ""in-moderation"" kind of person. I once stopped eating chocolate for 2 years because I couldn't have just one Freddo Frog, I had to have 10. So I'm not sure I can be the ""I'll just have a glass then I'll go to water"" person. My country is well-known for it's drinking culture, and my family are all high functioning alcoholics. It's gonna be hard.",13

Where dis he go? How long was he gone?
I don't say anything because when my brain is in ""reaction"" mode I lose the ability to be soft and to reflectively listen. 

My ex cheated on me, a lot, and was all sorts of abusive, so this sets off all of my alarm bells. I *know* that my husband is kind, honest, and dedicated, yet he's also bipolar and hypomania + alcohol is a bad mix. 

It's complicated because I'm the asshole who was drunkenly unfaithful when I made out with someone last year. (Big reason as to why I'm done drinking)

All this to say that alcohol is a nefarious son of a bitch. I'm laying here awake like a live wire, and yet I know alcohol only ever makes things worse. 
This would be the perfect excuse to drink, but my cravings can go screw themselves.

For reasons both related and not to drinking...but I came out of it entirely sure of what needed to happen next, entirely sure of how to do it, and incredibly awake to my sober mind.

I didn’t feel any urge to drink. To the contrary, I found myself repeatedly chastising my old ways. Disgusted by how I’ve been living my life, embarrassed by my decisions, but....more than anything else, hopeful. Because every urge I had, was gone. I thought it had clicked. I thought it was over.

It hit me all at once. Within an hour, I had a bottle delivered to my door. The convenience of that...I didn’t have time to second guess it. It was in my hands. I spent five hours in a state of burning internal conflict...it’s a war my sober mind has never won. Not one battle. I’ve never in my life had a drink at night and stopped until I was blitzed into unconsciousness. I’ve never won that fight.

It looked like my drunken mind had won that fight tonight, by the way. My big glass of Coke to chase all my drinks was poured...I was resigned to defeat. And then I just...went and I looked in the mirror. And I knew what I needed to do. There’s no easy way out. There are no shortcuts. 

Rock bottom last weekend for me was real. I did find the answers. They aren’t in drinking. I learned that lesson again tonight, symbolically enough, at the bottom of a bottle. Its contents washed away, along with any potential harm it could do to me, and most importantly, along with that voice in my head that tried to get me to go there.

In an instant, that voice went from invincible....overpowering...to nothing. It’s weakness...and my weakness inside it, exposed. And then pushed back. Tonight, my weakness lost. And I’m stronger for it. And I can feel it.

Next time, that weak part of me will understand a little bit better. Don’t waste your money. This guy will not drink with you tonight.",13

I am an 18 year old male. I never felt (and still don't) that I had a problem or anything but would drink a moderately high amount (not sure, maybe 12 standard drinks) about once every 3 weeks in a club environment and moderately high amount (1 bottle of wine plus maybe 2 other drinks) about once month at home with dinner (I live alone).

I had my last drink on 26th of October, 2019, a very enjoyable occasion with almost no hangover at all despite a moderate amount of alcohol. I decided to stop just because I saw no positive benefit in my life. I am wanting to keep my mind sharp and always felt a bit slow for up to 3 days after drinking. Saving money and physical fitness were my other main motivations and the chronic long term damage was always in the back of my mind. Have been going really well since and combined with NoFap (masturbation being another artifical form of pleasure) my confidence and social skills have improved and I have been smashing heaps of fitness goals.

&#x200B;

I have always been a little bit socially awkward (much better in the last 2 years) but often needed alcohol to become more sociable. Now however, I feel as though I would be able to negotiate more chill party type functions with people I know perfectly fine sober. I am just worried though because my friends like going to clubs as stated and I am really not sure I can fit in that environment sober. I would be self concious while dancing, have a harder time talking to people I don't know, and be worried my friends and other people could tell I'm sober and feel I'm bringing down the mood. The obvious answer is to just not go but I do enjoy the social aspect and it is the only time I see some of my older friends I don't see regularly anymore. I would just feel as though I'm missing out on important experiences.

My friends don't really understand why I've decided to stop and are trying to encourage me that drinking in moderation occasionally is alright but I just don't really want to.

&#x200B;

Do you guys have any advice on how to deal with high intensity club environment where drinking is almost mandatory?",6

I bought myself a booklet of ""Easy Piano"" Christmas music in plans for brushing up a bit in time to surprise my family members over the holidays. My parents put me through lessons as a kid and I absolutely hated it- but it will mean a lot to them to see me reading (well, stumbling) through sheet music again. We also have an elderly family friend who has a piano in her house but one plays, and she loves to hear me tinker on whenever we visit. I thought it'd be a wholesome surprise to whip out my book and ask which Christmas songs anybody wants to hear.

I stopped indulging in *any* creative activities even back when my drinking could have been considered ""normal"". It's so humbling to sit here on a Friday night with a clear head and genuine hope for what tomorrow's going to be. I'm not going to be Mozart by Thanksgiving or Christmas, but I can feel myself getting a little bit better with each practice session. Stopping drinking has been like that too: getting a little bit better each day with continued practice. It's so nice giving myself the chance to actually get better at whatever I please.

2019-11-15 22:43:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dx1qea/my_goodbye_letter_to_alcohol/,My goodbye letter to alcohol,"Dear Alcohol, 

I know we’ve been pretty tight for a long time, but it’s time to finally let you go. I can’t remember the first time I tasted you, though I do remember it was Bud Light and tasted like carbonated sweat to my unrefined palate. I vividly remember - at least initially - the first time I got drunk with you, and that actually was a pretty good indicator of how the next 12 years would look with you in my life: a hot fucking mess. 

Alcohol, I love you. You are always readily available, and you never turn down a party. I love those things about you. But what I love the most about you is the way you make me feel.

I especially love that period between the second and third drink when you make me feel warm and fuzzy inside, like everything else in the world doesn’t matter because I have the present and this wonderful feeling. That feeling is *so* good, all I can think about is maintaining it for as long as humanly possible. 

Feelings are fleeting little bastards, and we as humans need to hold on to any semblance of a good feeling when we see it, you know? Life is full of suffering, and in those moments, I'm not anymore. I start planning my third drink far before my second one is close to done. 

That third drink is usually the tipping point for me. This is when you turn into a real asshole, Alcohol. You see, I hear that other people have some sort of shutoff valve in their brains that tells them to stop drinking when they are either:   
1) drunk or 2) done for the night. How practical.

My creator conveniently omitted this self-preserving setting from my switchboard, and over years of experimentation and running trials, I have come to realize that I simply can’t become “better” at drinking. 

I did not arrive at this conclusion hastily. No, no, no. As you can see in the appendix of embarrassing moments to this letter, I’ve tried *tirelessly* to self-program, hardwire and reboot this functionality into my brain. And if someone out there has the codes, you better hand that shit over immediately. 

But as I write this, I’m emerging from a post-drinking anxiety and depression cycle, and I have once again come to the conclusion that my life would be a lot better overall without you. 

You’ve been the North Star of my social life for over a decade, and it seems a little overwhelming right now. At the same time, I know it’s what I need to do. These post-binger depressive days are too unbearable to deal with anymore, and I’m tired of hating myself. I’m choosing me over you this time. 

Sincerely,

Me",7
2019-11-15 22:40:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dx1p6k/sober_rehearsal_dinner/,Sober Rehearsal Dinner,"Had the grooms dinner for my wife’s cousin tonight and stayed sober. In fact people probably thought I should be hammered since I kept going back to the bar to refill with club soda and lime. 

The whole time was a mental test. I walked in and started saying hi to all my wife’s extended family. Conversation rolled off the tongue. Enjoyed a good couple hours but finally I was done. A few people were getting beyond the tipsy point and there is only so much that can be talked about in a night. 

So the mental test I realized I had no problem talking to anyone. (Ok so don’t need booze you can talk to people). 

The same people that were hard to talk to when I’m buzzed or drunk still hard to talk to sober (ok so it’s them not you. Don’t need booze). 

The end of the night was tough since being sober I had the realization the night “ended” about 45 minutes before anyone left. Due to the drinkers rehashing the same stories and others having fomo, I realized drinking people can make a dead party carry on past it’s time. 

This boredom is where I used to thrive as a drinker and get that extra drink or two. Not this time. 

The awareness of the dead energy in the room was astonishing. If I wouldn’t have carpooled I would have bounced that 45 minutes earlier. 

Happy to be home sober. Everytime I thought about alcohol today I just thought; what am I feeling that is still going to be there after that first drink? 

I realized I can have that same positive, fun, happy energy without booze and the side effects the next day. I can also be deadass bored at a party because it’s run it’s course, and not be trying to squeeze in a couple more drinks or chugging waters.  

I also came to find I do enjoy the taste of beer or soda and lime and the alcohol doesn’t enhance me at all.  As in I would enjoy an ipa but not for the buzz I prefer the taste. So if there is a NA ipa someone let me know! In fact holding my soda and lime cup all night gave me the same relaxing comfort I used to get when actually drinking. My confidence was great. 

Wedding tomorrow. Going to dance my ass off. As I proved to myself tonight I can do the same stuff sober and not have to worry about the after affects the next day.",4

Everyone says that the things you drank to avoid will come back to haunt you. Poppycock, I thought smugly, sliding easily into day 90.  Then, wham. There it was. The thing.  The thing from 7 years ago that made me think ""That hurts. Alcohol makes me forget.""  It took me by surprise because I really thought it was not an issue anymore simply because I hadn't thought about it in more than a passing way in years. (Most of the time I was too drunk to do so.) But I got walloped, suddenly and unexpectedly.  

So I've been sad for the last week or so as I attempt to begin facing it. 

Today my Husband and I went grocery shopping.  I knew I was sad. I knew I was hungry. I figured I could hold out until the shopping was done and we were home again. Up and down the aisles we went until we got to the end of the booze aisle. He wanted to keep walking, as we've done every time for the last 97 days, but me.. I walked down.  So he followed.  And I walked to the vodka section, and I stopped and stared. And there it was. My brand. Same cheerful red label. Same choice of glass or plastic bottle. The sound and feel of that seal breaking as familiar as the back of my hand. CRRACK. And as I stood there staring at it, I started to cry. I turned to my Husband and I choked out...  

""I want to drink. I want to drink because I'm sad. And here's the sadness escape hatch. Why can't I open it?"" 

The logical part of me knows good and well it's hardly an escape hatch, but there's nothing logical about addiction. 

He didn't try to talk me out of my feelings, he simply put his arm around me and gently nudged me to keep walking.  But man, that impulse to put the bottle in my cart was powerful. If he hadn't been there, I'm sure I'd be blotto by now. It was a very close call.

We quickly finished our shopping, me fighting tears on and off the entire time. Just as we were about to check out I stopped and turned back to where the sweets are. ""If I can't have booze, I'm having pie,"" I declared. So tonight I'm sober with pie and a rude awakening about the stuff I haven't dealt with. 

Does it get better? That un-dealt with stuff?  The fact that it's still there is fooling me into thinking that it always will be, just because it should've been gone long ago. If that makes sense.  Cuz it hurts. It really hurts. 

But I'm ending day 97 sober.",105

AlecASaurus back again. I just wanted to share today, partially as a reminder to future self and partially because I know reading others’ stories certainly has helped me. 

Yesterday I had a final pre-op appointment for surgery. A major surgery that will make my life much better. But which I’m anxious about, as to be expected. I’d worked late the night before and decided to drink, you know, to let down. I promised myself I wouldn’t get shitty because tomorrow was a big day (I’d cancelled previous consults for such surgery because I was too hungover) and I wanted to be alert for this appointment. 

Well, said promises were pretty quickly broken, seeing as one was amazing so why not another, and another, and another. Suddenly all that adrenaline dumping into my system got me anxious and so I couldn’t fathom sleeping and so I didn’t until I was blackout. And that was 330a and I had to be up in 3.5hrs with little actual, restful sleep. 

So I ran to meet with my friend who was coming with me as support. I got in her car and said something about being tired. She asked why. I said that I didn’t get much sleep, couldn’t get to bed. Then she said something like “and drinking heavily.” I lied and said I’d just had a few. She turned and looked me dead in the eye and said, “more than just a few. You reek, I can smell you from here.” Wow, bam. 

Don’t let anyone tell you that vodka is stealth and doesn’t make you smell like booze. It’s bullshit. She thought I’d been drinking beer since I smelled so much, but I said it was vodka, and she said that was even more alarming, must’ve drank a lot. Well, it was like half a small shitty vodka bottle, so yeah. 

I was embarrassed. Guilty. Ashamed. Mad at myself. Many things. And now worried about how I’ll smell at the Drs office and if everyone would know. What effect would that have for me having this surgery. Adding anxiety to anxiety. Damn. 

But I made it through.

Anyways, thanks for reading this far if you have. I just wanted to share and etch this into my brain. Tonight is my second night sober, and I’m going to stay strong. IWNDWYT",11

That even though you've successfully met (supportive) friends and coworkers out at bars and restaurants without feeling the urge to drink, something feels different tonight. Like if you were to go out you just might cave and order a drink.  Telling yourself that it's just one. You can handle one. It's been going so well.

Being a military member, people even applaud it when we’re out and buy me drinks and what not because I wash them down so fast.

I have been sober for nearly 3 months. There are so many reasons I am happy I stopped and it took around 6 or 7 attempts to get to this point. I've never made it this far before. I also started antidepressants around the same time which has been great. 

However, recently I've found myself struggling again. This is especially hard because I was under the impression it would only get easier as time went on. I've read about PAWS and not sure if this is it because I felt like I already went through it about a month ago. Maybe its just the pink cloud coming to an end?

Main struggles:
I have very few people to celebrate my success with because everyone I know still drinks. 
I feel like my social life has been really non existent since quitting. I still go out from time to time but get tired easily without the booze to keep me awake until 2am. 
No one really hits me up anymore. Going out definitely doesn't feel as fun as it used to. It makes me feel like I'm boring. (It is also winter where I live and this may be part of it).
I know it won't be as fun anymore to go out and have serious FOMO at the same time.

I've rediscovered old hobbies and keep myself as busy as I can with those but its starting to feel lonesome.
I've read this Naked Mind which helped me SO much in the beginning and I go back to it but can't shake this feeling. 
I'm started to wonder if I should go back to moderation even though deep down I know it isn't a good option for me. 

Those who have reached this point, is this feeling normal? Does it actually get easier? Any advice? I went from feeling awesome almost everyday to being really grumpy all of the sudden.",9

2019-11-15 13:24:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dwuqaf/first_time_posting_seeking_help/,"First time posting, seeking help.","Hey all. I'm not entirely sure where to start with this, so I guess I'll begin with the problem. I think I'm possibly a functioning alcoholic. I don't want to drink as much as I do, and it's getting harder and harder to stop.

Currently, I'm 31, and I have a relatively stable job doing basic IT work for a local company. The bosses like me, nobody's shy about getting together at the nearby bars, or occasionally even having a small drink at work on a special occasion. I have a loyal and kind-hearted circle of friends, most of whom drink, but they never judge those who don't.

The trouble is, I've missed some days of work this year because I was too hung-over to go in. I've hid that from my bosses and my fiancee. There's been more than one occasion this year where I've had too much from socially drinking with friends, and have almost fallen over trying to just get up from the couch. When this happens, my fiancee always feels embarrassed -- in her words, she feels like she has to babysit me when I get like that. In addition to drinking socially, I'll drink heavily at home as well, since I tend to just do all my errands between work and home, so I keep myself out of my car. In college I had one or two close calls with driving when I shouldn't have been. On weeks where I'm drinking regularly, I don't have trouble going through six beers a night, every night. Twelve if I'm feeling bad. Normally I tell myself ""this will last through the week"" when I buy two six-packs, but I'll be lucky if they last two nights.

The big reason I'm bothering to write here now is because for years, I've been telling myself I've been drinking because I self-medicate for anxiety. And that's partly true. But recently, it's occurred to me that I'm very happy on a pretty frequent basis. I have a good job, I'm in a relationship I wouldn't trade for anything, and I have great friends. But I still drink to excess almost every night, unless I make a deliberate effort not to. It's not normal, and it concerns me. What bothers me even more is my fiancee's dad, who passed away last month. He was a heavy drinker himself, and seeing his mind and body just go within the span of a couple years has really shaken me.

Currently, it's 1:20 PM on Friday, and I haven't had a drink since Tuesday night. I can go for stretches like this sometimes, but something always pulls me back. I always feel like I can't \*truly\* have fun with people or my hobbies unless I drink, or that I'm boring when I'm sober, because my anxieties start to creep up more easily around others. What can I do to get myself back to enjoying myself as a sober person, so I don't feel like I \*need\* to have a drink to just enjoy life?",3

I’m 20 days sober and today was the first day I have really struggled since making the decision to quit drinking. The Christmas markets have opened in the town where I live, and all my friends were in the alpine bars drinking and having loads of fun. I stopped by and said but I knew I couldn’t stay. I felt really upset and so angry at myself that I can’t handle my alcohol. Why can’t I just be normal when I drink like most other people? Why does it affect me so badly yet others (minus the hangover) just fine? 
It took all my strength to force myself to walk out of there and not join them like I desperately wanted to. I stayed strong, got in my car and drove home. I did feel extremely agitated because I felt like I was really missing out, but then I reflected back on all the reasons why I have made the decision to stop drinking. I know I could have stayed with them and ordered a coffee or something but it was far too dangerous territory for me to be around heavy drinking just yet. 
Im dreading Christmas and New Year and all the parties coming up. I really need to find a way to stay strong because I don’t want to keep missing out and become completely unsociable because at the moment I feel like I can’t go anywhere or be a part of anything where drinking is involved.

When did you feel ready to face ‘heavy drinking’ situations with friends? And what helped you in these times at the beginning of your sobriety? Thank you in advance.",4

2019-11-15 12:32:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dwu0ul/knowing_why_i_drink_doesnt_help/,Knowing why I drink doesn't help.,"I've been giving this some thought the last couple weeks.

Its obvious why I drink really. Its self medication and an extremely unhealthy coping mechanism.

Regardless of whether I drink or not I feel like a worthless piece of shit,

I'll never have a career

I will never find someone

I will never amount to anything in life.

And there's more but these thoughts run through my head on a daily basis, and the truth is I don't know if any of that is true but a large part of me believes it,

But when I drink, I get a moment to breath figuratively speaking, the thoughts they leave me alone.

And the fucked up part is, that since I feel like those things I mention above are true. A large part of me doesn't see the point in sobriety, 

Why be miserable, lonely, and worthless sober when you can be lonely and worthless while drunk as a skunk and not feel so miserable.

I think its why I have a hard time with sobriety,

 because on some level I just don't see the point

Edit. I ended up drinking, in the end it will just make my death come quicker and with it peace",5

I take Thursdays off from work (self-employed) and go all out - starting with chugging vodka at 8 am and a shower beer and continuing with drink buddies through the day until I black out.

I didn't do any of that yesterday. Today I usually start the same but ""stabilize""(slow down to a lull of a buzz) by noon and reduce my intake to a swig of vodka every hour until I cam get out of work. I'd continue through the weekend at work doing the same. Justifying it by saying I will reset on Monday.

Anxiety was excruciating in the middle of the night and this morning. I woke up, went downstairs and leaned over the kitchen sink that I've leaned over so many times and I had a glass of water.  Nothing else.  I did not drink anything - and here I am at nearly noon.  This is nearly the exact time I open a new bottle hidden in my desk to ""get me through the day"".

I've decided today I won't open that bottle at my desk.  It feels weird already and anxiety is really spiking. IWNDWYT",6

2019-11-15 10:41:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dwsh3f/292_days_sober_alcoholic/,"292 days sober, alcoholic?","Hi. I stumbled upon this online looking for a forum. I'm not sure if I was or am an alcoholic. My mom was a drunk, she caused chaos in my early life and she unfortunately was murdered 9 years ago in the midst of a relapse. Regardless of her addiction, she was an amazing woman that held a lot of demons. 

I spent the better part of the last 9 years asking myself if I was an alcoholic, always rationalizing my  choices with ""well I'm young and I'm stressed."" At my worst, I drank 6 out of 7 days. I'd get off work, go to the bar, sleep for a couple hours and go back to work. I definitely had a problem then. I cut down to 3 days a week, but in those days I could get drunk or close and still rationalize it. I was working 80 hours a week and I was super depressed. 

I was always afraid of being an alcoholic. Everyone always told me I couldnt drink because it was in my genes and I think I was trying to prove everyone wrong. Everyone always said I'd just turn out like my mom. My brothers are alcoholics. One night I drank too much, got belligerent, almost got kicked out of a bar and evidently told my wife I wanted a divorce and that I didnt love her. None of that is true and I dont remember or understand why I would have said it. I woke up the next day, decided to get sober and get therapy and a new job. I've been sober ever since. 

It's been almost a year and I'm still asking myself ""what makes an alcoholic an alcoholic? Am I one? Was it just a bad time or do I actually have a problem and will I ever be able to drink again like a normal person?"" I dont want to break sobriety just to find out that I'll never be able to drink again because I cant control myself. I always said this sobriety was a ""I'm gonna quit until I feel like i have control over my life and I can hold myself accountable"" 

This is probably jumping all over the place and I'm sorry, but I thought maybe someone could give me some examples of their own experiences to help me. Also I've never gone to AA or been a part of any support group. 

Thanks for listening.",10

In that time I've lost 43 pounds, got accepted to a university to pursue a teaching credential in special education, found a job substitute teaching that I love, made some amazing friends who support me in my life and in my recovery, repaired relationships with my family and starting with some friends I disconnected with while drinking, started bringing parts of myself back online that had lain dormant for years and generally have improved on most aspects of my life.

I was a pretty hopeless case. Once I took a drink I couldn't stop and when I would relapse it would be for a year or two not a day or two. This time I'm staying deeply connected to a program of recovery and a community of people in the same boat and its made things much easier. I've only even thought briefly about drinking once in the last two months.

If you read this and you're new and struggling just know you can do it too, and things will get better. Just stay strong, have faith in yourself and stay connected to this community and a local community of people in recovery if one is available.

I spent eight nights in a row drinking. I have old college friends in town and I work in a field that is alcohol-heavy (academia). I always come back from these trips exhausted and say that travel is inherently bad for me. That I *have* to drink because it's what we do in our field. Except I treat every single drinking night like it's the only night out drinking. 

I go for the highest ABV beers. I tend to have 1, 2, 3 more than the average person by the end of the night. I'll go back to my AirBnB and rip through cigarettes, but only if I'm staying alone, due to the shame of smoking. I'm the healthy one—I weightlift, I trail run, I am fit. I am productive, I do great work in the field. Why would I want them to see that I go all in on every substance that I touch? That I used to be an amphetamine addict. 

I was prescribed 4x the amount of Adderall in college I should have been. I'd snort lines of it to party; I'd snort lines of it just to do my homework at night. I would wake up and pound black coffee and smoke a cigarette to ""calm down"" and then vomit due to the stress on my empty stomach. I'd spend all day craving weed and would skip class and leave my research job early to go home and scrape up the crumbs of ash and green and smoke them through my shitty plastic bottle rig. I'd drink to get a buzz going because I was too calm from the weed. I'd snort a line of Adderall because I wasn't tuned in. I'd smoke a cigarette to calm down those jitters. I'd smoke some more weed to level out. Rinse and repeat. Day in, day out.

I'm three and a half years removed from that nightmare. I went cold turkey on everything and started a relationship in my new town where it was much easier to be sober. We broke up almost two years ago now and I've been cycling through various phases of addiction ever since. This year in particular was a blur of binge and purge. I tackled my weed addiction over the past year or so—it gives me crippling anxiety every time I consume it.  I haven't abused amphetamines since I graduated college. But this was the year of alcohol and nicotine abuse. The demon came back to haunt me. Since I started recording in March 2019, I have drank alcohol 60% of the days. Assuming this was the case back to January 1, I have drank some amount of alcohol 192 days this year. And it's normalized in this stage of my life. There are happy hours and concerts and dinners nearly every night of the week and weekend amongst my friends and colleagues. But most of them have their one or two dinner beers and go home and don't drink anymore. I have my 3-4 dinner beers, go home and drink 2 more alone, and then maybe take a shot or two of vodka before bed to really sleep well. I've spent the year buying packs of cigarettes, smoking 1/3 to 1/2 of the pack, and then throwing them away. I'll either dig the pack out of the trash later to smoke more or go buy a new pack, wasting so much money. Wasting away my lungs.

Drinking and smoking has taken my focus. I'm too strung out from it or tired to do my real hobbies. I love to read fiction. I play folk and bluegrass music. I love to go to the gym. But I don't have the energy for *any* of these things when I drink or smoke in any amount. I stay up late staring at my phone or playing video games. I wake up the next day exhausted, my stomach aching from acid reflux. I am out of it all day at work, barely getting anything done. I feel guilty, shameful, insecure. I probably said some stupid things the night before to friends and colleagues. I'm unreliable. I don't remember intimate conversations with friends. I don't feel authentic. I've been called the ""smartest dumb person"" my friends know, in a loving way. I'm getting my PhD, but I'll do a keg stand, shotgun a beer, and do anything to put on a show. I'm tired of being that person and it's time for a change.

When I got home from that work trip last Sunday I decided I was done. I don't know for how long yet. But I haven't gone 2-3 weeks without drinking since August 2012. I'm going to make it to 4 weeks first and then move on from there. Right now it's about getting through the day, the weekend, the week. I'm looking ahead to my social events for the week and planning how to avoid drinking. Last night I was over at a friends that hosted a group for pizza. I watched everyone have 4 or so beers and smoke a lot of weed. I was offered beer throughout the night and I just said I drank every day last week and needed a break. Nobody cared. I still had a blast. They're still great people to be around. I went to bed early last night, woke up at 6:30am today, and was in my office by 7:00am. I will never regret not drinking, smoking cigarettes, or smoking weed.

Thanks for reading. I've been needing to write this for a long time. I know this is a more general addiction post, but alcohol abuse has been a companion of mine since the beginning, so I hope this post is welcome here. I'm all or nothing with everything I do. If I have one beer, I might as well have eight. If I take one key bump of cocaine, I will fiend all night. If I take one hit of a joint, I might as well smoke the whole thing. But this mentality has worked so well for my research, my fitness, my music. It's time to invest that energy back in the healthy direction, and maybe without the distraction of these drugs I'll learn some moderation of the healthy stuff along the way too. :)

Of course, that is not an option. First of all, I don't drink just a little bit. Ever.

And if I can get these thoughts out and share with you, my partner, and other supporters, I typically feel better.

I have an appointment this morning until 11 a.m. and then I'm off. Basically, I don't have a full day off for 2 weeks and I'm halfway through. I have changed this in the future because I notice it's a major trigger, so every second weekend I'm taking off of work. At least until the end of December and then I'm doing every third weekend.

All I need to do is go to my appointment and go home and have a nap and I'm going to be just fine.

I noticed the early inklings last night on my way home when my addicted brain said to pick up booze on the way home. I said no way brain and went straight home. But I had this weird salivation Sensation that I associate with urges to drink.

What I'm looking forward to at home when I'm done this morning is preparing an interesting dinner. My partner has started changing his eating and has asked me not to buy pop or make pasta. So I can probably make something creative like chickpea soup which isn't everyone's Jam but I had it the other day and it really tasted like chicken noodle soup, but it wasn't. I'm a vegan by the way.

So I'm going to focus on looking up new recipes, and if the urge doesn't decrease, I'm going to hit a meeting when I'm done the appointment.",18

I've put liquers in some desserts, but usually, I just use non-alcohol based flavorings as they tend to be more potent anyway.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

2019-11-15 03:47:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dwo0t6/to_all_selfmedicators_out_here/,To all self-medicators out here,"I stopped drinking on the 15th of September. I have been a heavy drinker for almost thirty years, although not so heavy as some people on this sub. I never drank before 5 or 5.30pm, and I could (and sometimes did) go without a drink for days on end. However, whenever I had a drink (at least 6 days a week) I had difficulty stopping. One drink lead to another, and I would get to 8-10 units a night, sometimes for weeks on end. So yeah, a heavy drinker, but I still managed to more or less function.

Then, on that night of the 15th, after my fourth beer, I just lost interest in drinking. I poured out the rest of the can and went to sleep.

It took me some time to make the connection, but I realize this has a lot to do with the fact that I had quit my very stressful and lonely job some weeks earlier and moved into something that I liked more. Alcohol was true self medication for me, and I know there are loads of people out here who, like me, drink to counter stress and unhappiness.

I am writing this to tell everyone how much better life is without alcohol and I would urge everyone to give quitting a shot. Find out what causes you to drink. See if you can get out of that situation. But even if you can't, quit anyway. You'll discover that much of the stress and unhappiness is caused and exacerbated by the drinking itself, the very thing you do to fight it.

In the last two months I have lost weight, my relationship with my wife has improved (we used to fight at least two to three times a week, now we haven't had a fight yet). I also have loads of energy to spare, so I've cleaned up the entire house. My daughter visibly loves me more, I have more time for her, I'm not hungover during breakfast so I'm not short tempered to her. Also I'm so much calmer and more relaxed than I've been in years. Not to mention my organs do not feel painful anymore and the fear of dying early is slowly starting to subside...

DON'T WAIT. Don't drink with me tonight.

EDIT: Don't mind my flair, it's from an earlier quitting attempt that failed because I didn't get rid of the cause of my drinking.

 (I know this doesn't work for everyone, but I hope to reach a few people who drink for the same reasons as I did.)",71

All of the pain and self loathing and feeling of being so very lost has come rushing back and I feel overwhelmed.

Part of me wants to grab a bottle and drown it but I’m certain that if I did that I’d end up jumping in front of a train. God knows a part of me wants to do it enough right now as it is.

I just have to get through the day and get myself to a meeting, but I’ve never felt so weak.

I was more or less demoted at work. This happened while we were making new drinks for the restaurant. I’ve been in the industry for a while and have run a bar for two years and have also not drank for two years and I don’t really think about it much but today showed me that I’m so used to not drinking that I just...don’t. 

This perfect storm of factors had formed between free booze and feeling angry, ashamed, and depressed and still I did not drink. 

It made me thankful that I rarely ever consider it and even on my roughest days (apparently) I dismiss it as not a possibility.

I don’t mean to diminish the feat of choosing not to drink and ultimately it still is me choosing another day without alcohol but it’s just nice that it’s an easier choice now than it once was.

To top it off, I closed the bar and the last guy there was having a bit of a hard night. He wasn’t wasted or anything but he was pretty distraught, spending most of his time at the bar on the phone. Before I closed up he asked me where to go if he wanted to check in to a hospital. He seemed desperate. I told him about the nearest hospital, how I myself have checked in there a few times. He seemed nervous so I told him it’s okay to go and just be honest and say you’re having a rough time and they’ll be there to help. I was happy to be of service to him but man did it break my heart to see him like that and also know that I was in that exact spot before.

I'm coming up on day 15.
        Now a huge issue I'm struggling with is that all my friends (2ppl) are huge alcoholics. Barely passing the functioning alcoholic standard, and they're pushers too. So long as you're drinking they don't have a problem. They're both so deep in denial they have an excuse for everything. It's maddening I can't stand to be around them sober, especially when they're sober. It's either oh I wish I was drinking right now or boohoo my life is so hard. And before you say just get new friends I work at my dream job with both of them. 
       I would never throw my sobriety and their face because no active drinker would appreciate such honesty, so I've just been playing along. But I can't take it anymore! I'm not saying I'm any better then them, but I've moved on from the lies I used to tell myself. And now hearing that crap sends me over the edge.

I went hunting and was in the woods for 5 days. I didn't take any alcohol with me, and honestly was so preoccupied with what I was doing that I didn't think about it at all.

Yesterday kind of sucked though. I returned to work, and when I finished my day - I drove home. I could feel every gas station, grocery store, and liquor store beckoning me as I passed.

When I got home I was jonesing hard. I made some coffee to have a liquid in my hands... but it wasn't much help. I ended up eating a bunch of snacks and blowing past my calorie goals for the day. I figure I'm still on the good side though, because the liquor or beer I would have consumed would have put me even further out.

Anyway - yesterday sucked!

Other news: 

* My partner agreed to stop drinking as well. So that is great and makes it a lot easier since we don't have any liquor in the house now.
* I start therapy in December. The holidays and our schedules kept it from aligning sooner.
* I had got into a workout routine, and then promptly lost it due to the going hunting.
* I have given up on Naltrexone, again. It makes me angry, irritatable, nauseated, depressed, and increases my suicidal ideation.
* Now that I am back from hunting I'll start posting more regularly.

I've set some new goals for activities I've always wanted to do, but have been too drunk to participate in:

* Look for a guitar instructor.
* Look for a BBJ instructor.

Today I woke up without a hangover for the 10th time in a row though. So that was awesome. Also - IWNDWYT!",12

It's so cult like and I'm tired of hearing doing the program is the only way to sobriety. I miss drinking. I resent not drinking. I feel like a whiney teenager and I'm 34. Stayed in bed all day today. It's the only place I feel comfortable. Yesterday I went to my boyfriend's parents house for a get together and I made it 5 minutes. His sister said I seemed down and I just started crying. I have no idea what I'm doing right now. I've never felt so out of place in my own skin and in life. I told myself I'd make it to 90 days and I know I shouldn't drink again ... I don't know what to do. Much love for all you guys here.,9

I got my 30 day chip and felt things start to get wobbly. I postponed my weekly meetings with him and started drinking again. The weekly drinking cycles I started got progressively worse and worse until yesterday my boss took me aside to ask if I was okay and to ask abut my drinking which I had previously been open about when I got clean before. I messaged my previous sponsor yesterday and we just got done meeting 1 on 1 tonight. It went well and we have a plan for things I can do throughout the weekend, and especially on Sunday when I would use football as an excuse to drink all day. I'm glad to start this journey again and know it won't always be easy. I won't drink with you today.",14

It only made things worse. 

Now I'm back in the cycle of ""tomorrow will be Day 1 again"" but of course the excuses keep coming and I keep trying to make a ritual out of my last beer as though the act of quitting is more important than being sober.  

I need to take care of myself but I'm spread so thin between family, work, volunteering and friends I just can't find the time. I've found some solace in the book Refuge Recovery but there are no groups in my area. I just need to not drink, again, like I've done successfully 90 percent of 2019.

That’s embarrassing to admit: people who can’t control themselves are weak, in my book, even though not being able to control our human nature is, well, human. And it’s annoying because I wish to hell I was someone who could drink like a normal person.


That’s the subtle and invidious side of booze: the constant whisper in my ear that I both should be able to drink normally and that I can drink normally if I’m careful enough. It’s a damned lie. 


Addition is so cunning and baffling, as the Big Book of AA says. It’s beyond human understanding how we cannot control something we want to control so badly, and yet, at the same time, we want NOT to control it even more. And the only way to fight the pull of the substance is to abstain entirely – to flee self-destruction like it’s the only thing keeping us alive, and most of the time, that’s the case. 
I both never want another drink ever again, because it will ruin my life, and I want to do nothing but drink. It’s a constant pull, and the only way to live in peace is give it up entirely, mourn it, and move on. I’m currently off the wagon, and I’ve told myself that if I manage to free myself once again, I will never, ever put myself in the position where I willingly go back to the chains of addiction.

But it's hard, guys. And I've failed so many times, I can barely get up again.",6

Today I got offered my dream job. The one I've spent 2 months working and interviewing and studying for. I am in shock. My work and belief in my sober self paid off. In addition I bought a moped, went to therapy, repaired relations with friends and family and have gotten a better handle on my physical and mental health. I just want to say here, the place I wrote desperate messages in when I had nothing left to hold on to and no else to speak to, that if you put in the work and believe fiercely that you are worth something and challenge the universe to say otherwise, it will back down and you will triumph.

I was just recommended a post on another sub and there were many upsetting comments on the post including the most up voted comment being about how life sucks and they hate themselves so they are relapsing. I get that it was one person's despair in a hard situation and there were some people trying to help but the amount of up votes and negative comments behind it were a touch triggering to me, not gonna lie.

I'm so grateful that this sub is full of supportive people who are trying to better their own lives, as well as other peoples. I know I wouldn't have 7 months without this sub's support. Sobriety can be challenging and I'm not immune to negative and hopeless thoughts but I'm just glad that this is such a safe and warm place to come to when such thoughts, feelings and cravings occur where people aren't gonna up vote self-destructive things.

I am a very efficient and functional 50 year old alcoholic. My wife is great. My job is great. My home is great. The only thing that I would change is losing weight (no shit, I know what the predominant contribution is) and not giving myself a death sentence from drinking a fifth of vodka every fucking day.

The efficient alcoholic will be functional and will always find an excuse to keep drinking. I used this sub-reddit to stop and then continue drinking, because discouragement is another excuse to keep drinking.

Discouragement #1: Anyone under 50 days- ""Since I've stopped drinking I feel great, and my life is going so much better, and I've lost weight, and I've made new friends, and I've been doing better at work, and sex with my partner is great, and now I'm happy(ier)""

I still felt dead after 50 days of sobriety. This is because I am an efficient and functional alcoholic.  I assume that my rock bottom is simply death by cirrhosis. At this point, I know that I'm not going to lose my wife or job (but aware that I am torturing my wife with witness to my own disintegration). I've been doing this for more than 35 years and reading how great it is to be sober doesn't work for me anymore.

Discouragement #2: Putting the amount of days that you are sober on a pedestal.  When I quit smoking, I tracked the time, but when I did smoke, I didn't reset everything. My ambition was stronger not to be a smoker than it was to never have a cigarette again.

These are my hang-ups and obviously stopdrinking is nothing other than wonderful and supportive. I know that if I were to quit drinking, eventually my life would be better, even if it takes several years, and I also know how counter productive accepting relapses can be to quitting something.

I (perhaps foolishly) aspire to stop drinking out of reason and will.

I am going to take another shot, but with more emphasis on not being a drinker rather than quitting or stopping drinking. I know this a similar approach to ""one day at a time"", but since AA or a therapist didn't work out (the last few rounds), I'm going to take the same approach that I did with quitting smoking.

I know this is ""bla bla bla"" to those who have succeeded in being sober, but the more I share, the better chance I have at success.

Exactly 10 years to the day that I stopped being a smoker I plan on stop being a drinker. 

The convenient gimmick is to make start your conviction on December 1st. Then you can track your progress just by looking at the date and remembering the introductory year of your aspired discipline. Yes, I'm that lazy.

So I will taper off and IWNDWY on December 1st.

Here is my (slightly modified) manifesto from a previous post:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stop! Here's why.  


Let's get this over with.  


You've been moving in the wrong direction.  


You are an alcoholic.  
You must dissociate the guilt and shame you have from this ailment.  
Your constitution is simply susceptible to indulgent patterns which are not sustainable.  
You are ill with want.  
Your subconscious desire and thirst are misleading compulsions that can never be satisfied or quenched.  
Now, you are sick of the lies and taking back control of your life.  


Not accepting an institution or having trouble accepting the many approaches and interpretations of attribution, procedure, terminology, higher power, will power, faith, acceptance and forgiveness does not change the inevitability of your situation.  
A resource is just a resource. There is no appropriate rule book or Bible for alcoholism. There is no existing approach or interpretation where abstinence is not the irrefutable solution, and there are no judgements, grades, rewards and/or punishments for attempting to abstain incorrectly.  
There will be no test at the end of this chapter.  
In fact, there is no end to this chapter.  


Here are some good justifications for drying up. Mental health, physical health, your wife, freedom, job and money.   
What else is there you dumb fuck?  


Look at what you've become. You no longer drink because you want to. Your wife is going to bed early again and sleeping in the other room.  
She says she does this because you snore and she needs to get up early.  
She's really going to bed early because you've become a vacant dull witted lump of clay, absent, forgetful, confused and frustrated from a self induced coma. She's sleeping in the other room because you will cough, choke, spatter up stomach acid and moan with despair in your sleep.  
And she still loves you.  


Here's what we're looking at.  
At most, 10 days to flush it out.  
A couple of weeks to make or break most patterns.  
One month to observe change and start feeling the results of it.  
You are only 30 fucking days away from starting to heal.  
But mark the calendar because it will take a couple years to feel contentment.  


First and foremost, don't panic.  
Your brain is lying to you.  
There is nothing to miss.   
Alcohol has not made you happy in 15 years.  
There is nothing to fear.   
Alcohol has never protected you.  
There is nothing to lose.  
Alcohol abandoned you long ago leaving you exhausted with helplessness.   


Remember how terrible and pathetic it felt to truly NEED a drink or else have a panic attack with the shakes.  
A physical dependence with psychological and physiological ramifications.  
Your addiction will suppress memories of the withdrawal,  
the panic attacks,  
and the shakes.  
Your addiction will try to convince you that you are only a few days away from being sober without significant consequences.  
You are sick of the lies and taking back control of your life.  


You are so fucking lucky NOT to enter sobriety beneath the weight of damaging circumstances and adversity.  
Imagine how much harder it would be to recover and abstain if you had.  
It's time to cash in your chips and quit while you're ahead.  
That fear you get when you think about never drinking again is not real, but rather a deceitfully malicious lie from your addiction. Despite your condition, you have managed to spend the majority of hours sober without any problem at all, oblivious of your own addiction for years.  
You are allowed to be sad, but remember you have it easy when the self-pity kicks in.   


Eventually, sobriety will bring you a greater euphoria than you had when you started drinking.  
You are not the scared 12 year old riding on the school bus.  
You are not the insecure 18 through 35 year old, slowly gaining confidence and associating that confidence with alcohol. Then making an emotional deduction that you want and need that alcohol in order to make friends, get laid, have fun, relieve stress and relax.  
You are sick of the lies and taking back control of your life.  


You are a confident and successful 50 year old who has NO REAL REASON AT ALL to keep drinking. The confidence that you have is something that you acquired swimming AGAINST the flow of alcohol. Ironically, had you worn a life preserver, you would be dead by now. You were in the wrong stream.  
Now that you are finally and truly aware that you simply don't need it, the water is clear, calm and placid.  


There is absolutely positively no interaction or aspect of your life that requires you to, or benefits you by, chemically lowering your inhibitions and sedating yourself with poison.  


Without a doubt, every person who has gotten to know you likes you a great deal, and not a single one of them likes you more when you drink. Even the ones who drank with you did it for your company and not the drunk. In reality we were drunks drinking together, getting more drunk so we could tolerate each other's drunkenness.  
You are sick of the lies and taking back control of your life.  


Not drinking might be difficult but it will never be a difficult decision. You will not be making a decision. You simply don't drink anymore.  
Deal with it and move on. You would never cheat on your wife, so don't cheat on this decision.  


If it's daytime;  
walk it off,   
get some exercise,   
do some chores,   
go for a drive,   
get some coffee,   
call a friend,   
go to a meeting,   
walk it off.  


If it's night time;   
walk it off,   
go to bed,   
work on a puzzle,   
have some tea,   
go to the cinema,   
eat some junk food,   
call a friend,   
go to a meeting,   
walk it off.  


Use the monkey to burn fat.  


As you browse through life, your addiction will distract you with the occasional pop up:  
Limited time offer! New and improved non-addictive alcohol consumption! Risk free, 24 hour trial period! Cancel at anytime!  
You can relax and stop trying to find a nicotine patch for the moderation of alcohol. You are now aware that a strong conviction is more effective and less stressful in the long run.   


The water will be clear, calm and placid as you confront and overcome common misconceptions that addiction is the result of lacking will power or weakness of character. You will celebrate your choice to abstain and discover that it takes the smartest, strongest and bravest of mother fuckers to recognize addiction for what it really is, and then to differentiate and predict the consequences between making a spontaneous decision and achieving a long term goal. Instead of dwelling on the hopelessness that there is no cure or way to control this affliction, you will embrace that the solution is remarkably simple.  


Today, you will give yourself the opportunity to enjoy the rest of your life. The insightfulness, determination, defiance and sense of self preservation that steered you into alcoholism are the same characteristics that will help you abstain. You will not feel depraved and there will be no triggers as you allow yourself to embrace, engage and interact with every situation without being sedated. You will no longer get through each day. Now you will experience them. One day at a time.  


You are ill with want.  
Your subconscious desire and thirst are misleading compulsions that can never be satisfied or quenched.  
Now, you are sick of the lies and taking back control of your life.   


You will be sober and it will feel normal.",101

I don’t need alcohol on a daily basis, so I’ve always thought I couldn’t be an alcoholic. I figured if I can go weeks without drinking, there’s no way I have a problem. 

But when I drink, I binge drink. I don’t know why. I don’t know why I can’t stop at 1 or 2 drinks. I black out nearly every time I drink these days. I want to be able to moderate and control myself but it never, ever happens. 

I’m so deeply ashamed of myself. Scared that I could have hurt someone. Upset that I act so poorly and set such a bad example for my younger sister. I’m just miserable.

I called out of work because I can’t handle my anxiety right now. I want to crawl out of my own skin and not be me anymore. I’m so sad and angry and disappointed and ashamed.

Always ""Monday starts again!"" and it never worked. I've been there, I feel your pain.

I just want to share this in hopes of motivating others. I didn't see a way out, I was 100% focused on alcohol and that was all I cared about. Everything was going to shit. Every thing. It was horrible. I was going to die.

Life did a completely 360. My marriage is great, my job is going much better, I got a raise, we bought a house, we are planning on starting our family. My relationships have improved tremendously with everyone. My mind is so much clearer and my personality has come back. I'm me again. Not that disgusting monster. Never again.

I can't emphasize the difference enough. Every tiny aspect of life is better. No more fighting, embarrassment, guilt, back pain, headaches, sleep problems, stomach issues, vomiting weekly... the list goes on and on. You all know. That was no way to live. Face your demons and become a stronger person. That's what I had to do.

I am a terribly disorganized person. I am 40 next week and just a few months ago got an ADD diagnosis, which made perfect sense to me and everyone who knows me well. (I imagine part of my drinking has been self medicating for trouble with attention/focus...)

I am ALWAYS losing my keys. It's a lifelong problem. Late to things because I can't find my keys. Which coat are they in?!? Did I take them into the bathroom for some strange reason (often, yes)? Left on the actual seat of the car because I was wriggling out of the car while juggling groceries, laptop, and kid stuff? Are they in the fridge, also weird (surprisingly often, yes)? How about just dropped on the bed in a pile of blankets and jammies and cat? -- plenty of times!

A few years ago I bought a very pretty little shelf-y thing with a few hooks at the bottom. I thought, I'll put my keys there on the hook every time and I will always know where they are!

Drinking, I never did it. Supposedly simple, but they were never there.

I had spiraled out of control and was getting drunk most every night at home, downing handles of vodka like they were going out of style. Hangovers were awful and my wife had seen enough. She said get help or else. I'm so glad she did. 7 months of outpatient treatment, countless AA meetings, getting a sponsor and working the steps and I finally was feeling better. It really took about 2 years for my brain fog to clear up and that's when I realized the joy of being sober. Mornings are awesome, and so is coffee and last but not least my marriage which couldn't be better. I've had to lose drinking buddies but have found new friends who don't revolve their lives around alcohol. It has made me realize how foolish and narrow minded I was to let alcohol run my life. I come from a long line of drunks and it stops here. To anyone thinking about it, you can stop and improve your life 1000%. Reach out and you will find plenty of help. AA is wonderful (and free) but I should mention I no longer attend regular meetings. AA has a saying ""take what you need and leave the rest"" and that's what I did. I learned a lifetime of lessons from the hundreds of meetings and use what I learned every day. Drinking has just become not an option for me and I'm so my happier without it.

My brain was telling me that it was fine, my wife wasn't home, just get a small bottle, down it, and then drink a bunch of water, brush your teeth to hide the smell for when she comes home for her lunch break.

I eventually was able to regain control, put my keys down, and call my mom to tell her about what had happened. She was proud I didn't give in, but I feel horrible. I felt like even though I didn't drink, I still failed because I so desperately *wanted* to drink after 70 days of sobriety.

Better keep my eyes focused on the ground directly in front of me though —which lately involves daily maintenance and thought redirection to keep my brain a place I like occupying. More and more I am seeing the fruits of hard won daily sobriety: yesterday a job offer and big step up in my career. Sobriety also allows me to see clearly that the entire ballgame when it comes to relationships is sharing our true inner self, warts and all, with those we trust. And the shame and wounds we all carry, and that drove many of us to drink, somehow fade into the background when someone else sees us for exactly who we are and still embraces us. Their vision also helps us grow, forcing us to directly face parts of ourselves that previously had been allowed to fester in little hidden crevices. Sobriety doesn’t do all of this for us, but it is definitely a precondition that sets the stage, casts aside the outer deflective armor, and allows us to embark on an incredible journey inward and outward.

AA definitely helped to keep me sober in the beginning and for that I will always be very grateful. But now I feel happy and comfortable as a sober living person. I feel like this was an empowering decision that has helped me to feel genuinely more joyful, healthier, and better able to engage with the things I truly enjoy doing like reading, yoga and cooking. 

Anyhow, I have an incredible sponsor and have been working the steps but I can't get my mind around the idea that my life was miserable or 'unmanageable' (it wasn't - I have great relationships, a good career, etc. but I wanted to improve my relationship with *myself*, which is what was suffering when I drank) and that I have 'character defects' that must be removed (I mean, who doesn't?) I still want to strive and work to be a better person but I don't think I want to do it in the program. 

The idea that I will *always* want a drink but never be able to have one not only terrifies me, but increasingly just doesn't feel true for me. I quit because **I wanted to stop** and my life is legitimately better. I ordered Allen Carr's book (his stop smoking book worked for me when I smoked) and I suspect his stop drinking one will help remove any lingering deep seeded doubts.

Curious to hear from anyone else who quit AA and stayed sober? Or got sober without AA! Or thinks everything I said is ridiculous and that AA is the only way haha.

Day 24 alcohol-free here.  So many of us make amazing posts about the physical/mental/emotional benefits of not drinking- all of which are positive and amazing, and reasons that are well worth not drinking on their own.

Here are a couple of tangible benefits.

When I decided to stop drinking 24 days ago,  I created a (very) simple spreadsheet that tallies two things;  the amount of money I am not spending, and the number of empty calories I am not pouring into my body.

I assumed an extremely low average of 4 pints a day (3 months ago it could have easily been 6+/day, but I had been cutting down, and this doesn't even consider binging), with an average of about 200 calories per pint;

By not drinking over a 24 day period I have saved about $456.  I have and reduced my caloric intake by about 19,200 calories (equal to about 5.5 lbs of weight).

So, in addition to the general improvement in my overall feeling of wellbeing,  better sleep,  clearer head, etc., I also have more money in my bank account, and my pants fit better!

Just two more reasons not to drink today!

I remember when I quit, so many others were sharing their stories and saying the same thing: enough. I’m proud that so many of my cohort made the journey with me, and so many kept trying along the way. For context, I used to drink a bottle of wine a night, often more, sometimes less, and then binged with friends on the weekend.

For the first 3 months I thought about my sobriety a lot. Did it mean I was an alcoholic? Would I ever drink again? What do I tell people? At 6 months I considered drinking again “on occasion.” I read many people’s stories about relapse, asked questions, pondered. But that 6 month mark came and went and I still hadn’t drank. I had begun to realize that all of the mental energy I spent trying on labels or predicting the future was wasted energy. The reality is so much simpler for me. I wake up every day and I decide not to drink. No labels, no worry about tomorrow. 

It’s easier now, there are fewer social situations where I’d rather be drinking. I see old friends sometimes at boozy brunches, deeply hungover from the night before and trying to rally for another day of drinking and I just feel relief. I don’t feel sick anymore. I don’t waste days in bed feeling guilty and sick. 

How has my life changed? Honestly, not as much as I thought, but maybe more than I realize. I don’t take power naps in my car during the workday. My bowel movements don’t have that sickly sweet smell. I still enjoy trash TV and video games. But I read a lot more than I used to. And I have a hobby for the first time in my life. All those plans of going to the gym? Still a struggle, but I go regularly 2 days a week and I try for more. Nothing feels radically different and yet… I can’t think of anything that would be worth drinking for.

My first attempt happened back in April, and I managed two weeks. I even set myself up on this sub, saw my doctor about detoxing and counselling, and read a couple books about addiction. I quit sobriety because I wasn’t ready to cry.

I’m an addict who uses substance to replace emotion. I have a lot of problems with being openly emotional, which I won’t go into. I loved alcohol because it numbed me like nothing else could. I’ve been addicted to food, and to starving myself. I’ve tried every drug. But I picked my poison in alcohol.

I only confronted the fact I had a problem in September, when I had my latest anxiety attack after a history of many, except it was my first one that I had drunk. I felt dread. My one coping mechanism that numbed my brain and stopped me thinking and feeling wasn’t working anymore. My emotions were still breaking through.

I ended up at the hospital after trying to take my own life. In my drunken state, I wanted to be dead rather than feel what I’d pushed down into the deepest recesses of my brain. After sobering up, I knew I had a chance to be reborn. I told my parents what had happened and explained my addiction, and the process of healing began.

I like to say I’m 60 days into healing rather than 60 days sober. Sobriety is not something I want to see as a chore or achievement. I want to reframe my thinking and see it as a way of life. I started AA recently and felt a great connection with my local members, and it reminded me of this sub, and how the same support is offered virtually here.

Today, 60 days into my healing, I cried to my mom. Fully sobbing, no shame, and just explained why without feeling like I was weak or strange, and my mom was so relieved and happy. It wasn’t over a particularly traumatic event. Just a bit of a cry. It felt good.

I raise my coffee to another day.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I just couldn’t see through the haze that my life could be any different. 

The first week without alcohol was hell, I’m never going through that again. About 60 days in I started to come good mentally, I could laugh again, my sleep routine was normal, I felt physically good every day. 

My relationship with my wife has improved greatly, she has stood by my side with unconditional love. I have so much to relearn about love and I am giving her my all. I couldn’t see that before.

Tonight I’m on a work trip with one of my coworkers. This is my third trip I’ve been on since I’ve decided to stop drinking. 88 days sober (looking forward to those triple digits!).  My precious two trips it’s just been me, this is the first time I’ve gone with a coworker. 

My drinking/party attitude has always been a little infamous among my coworkers. Always up for a drink and always ready to drink the most. When I decided to stop drinking I didn’t tell any of my coworkers or friends. Most people assume I “cut back” on alcohol due to dieting. None of their business  

My coworker (John) is pretty cool, and we get along great. We’ve never gone out drinking together or been on a trip together. But he knows I drink, right? Our first night out I met up with the group a little late because I went to the gym first, and when I showed up he had a nice, beautiful, delicious vodka tonic waiting for me. He’s just a really nice guy. 

So super awkward moment as I told him I’m not drinking but lots of thank yous. His face was pure shock and he said “so you’re not drinking at all?” I very uncomfortably tried to blow it off that yeah I’m good just need some water. So he asked again and I said hey I’m still fun sober. 

John made a face sarcastically said something like “yeah, okay!”  And man that really kind of hurt. I laughed it off and said well I kind of quit drinking so sober me is all you get. Our group went out to dinner and called it a night. 

The next day John apologized to me and said he realized it was an insensitive comment and that he knows I’m still fun sober. I honestly think his reaction was just from surprise and not intentionally meant to pressure me to drink. I just told him that I’m sure it was a surprise and that I’m abstaining from drinking. 

Tonight we went out again and I hung out with him after the rest of our group was gone while he had some beers and I had water. He asked me again about why I’m not drinking and I opened up a little bit more. I don’t owe anyone any explanation for my decision to stop drinking but he really is a good person who I consider a friend so I was not as uncomfortable telling him that alcohol has caused too many problems in my life and it’s just something I’ve given up. He wasn’t pressuring me to drink at all.  We talked and laughed and I drank my water and didn’t even think of ordering a drink. 

In the end I’m here because it just makes me  sad. I wish I could get some drinks and get drunk and have fun with my coworkers like I used to. I genuinely feel bad I couldn’t drink with him. Its a blow from reality how much drinking was part of my identity. I foresee a lot more nights like this in my future and it scares me the sadness and loneliness I feel not being able to partake an activity I excelled at. I know tonight is a success but it still feels pretty sad. I won’t be sad without a hangover tomorrow though. IWNDWYT",38

There have been times that I've thought I never wanted to drink again, and other times where I thought I would give in. But i've persisted. I have a job interview next week, I'm finally almost fully recovered from a serious injury suffered back in February (big reason I decided now was the time to try the sober thing), and the weight is starting to fall off me now that I've been more active and eating better. I'm having just as much fun as I was when I would go out drinking, if not more fun. Plus I remember it all and wake up without a hangover which is a blessing. My original goal was to go at least a year sober. No booze, no weed. And until I move out of my parents house and lose another 35ish pounds I wouldn't consider picking either of those back up. I never felt like an alcoholic or addicted to weed, I just knew that I was using both of them to hide from my problems and not face the things I need to do to get better. Going out drinking on the weekends, whether I had one too many or just a beer or two, felt wrong. I felt stuck in life and felt like I was celebrating for nothing. And I knew I needed to make a change. So when I got hurt, it gave me the perfect reason to quit cold turkey and try to get my life back on track. Even though the physical therapy has been hell, it's truly been a blessing in disguise. I still found plenty of ways to procrastinate and put things off. Which only showed me that weed and booze weren't the problem, they were a shitty solution to my problems. Sobriety has given me the clarity and self awareness to dig deep to the root cause of my problems and find what is holding my back from achieving the things I want to achieve. I still have some ways to go until I accomplish my goals. But not having to worry about drinking or smoking has made focusing on my goals a lot easier. And who knows, even when I meet those goals, I still might just stay sober. Even if I do get back on the sauce or start smoking again, I feel like I have a much better relationship with weed and booze being off it for so long and a whole new perspective and awareness of how I treat them. And if i feel like things are slipping and I just am better off staying away from them completely, I am totally okay with that. Being sober aint that bad anyway. But hey, i'll cross that bridge when I get there, for now IWNDWYT.

I did quit once (twice technically, but the second time was only for 30 something hours without sleep so I don't really count it), and that lasted about 40 days until I caved due to stress. Both times I never really did anything when I couldn't sleep, and while it (sleeping) wasn't an issue the first time, it was the second. If there's anything I've learned about addiction from beating an addiction to cigarettes about 2.5 years ago, its that you need to replace it with something else to increase the chances of not going back to bad habits (I didn't do this the first or second attempt with alcohol, and have been using meditation to deal with stress so this will hopefully be the last attempt).

Since quitting smoking, I've been exercising regularly and started meditating about a year ago. Having said that, I'm not sure what to do within the first 2-3 weeks or so until my sleep patterns go back to normal when I run into the inevitable of not being able to sleep. I would just read until I get sleepy but since I love reading it'll just keep me awake usually unless I do it for 6+ hours. I'd also prefer to avoid medication at any cost because to me it doesn't make much sense to replace one sleeping aid with another, even if you can wane off of it after some time. Would much rather just get it done and over with in one go and not have to worry about it again. 

Any other advice in general would be appreciated as well, thank you.",2

Since that last Genny Light at 3 am after my younger sibling's graduation I have done so many things I never would have expected. I started exercising again, I started reading again, my house is clean (ish), I've been having better conversations with my friends, I lost 25 pounds, I started working at 8 am instead of 10 so I could get home to take my dog on a long walk at 4, I learned how to do basic bike maintenance, I'm getting close to a promotion at work. 

I know this is just a list of random hobbies and brags but literally none of this was possible when I was stuck in the grasp of alcohol. It controlled my life, it was a factor in all of my decisions. Right now I'm on the couch with my dog reading a book and waiting for my partner to call me so I can give her a ride home from a concert. I'm not drinking a 6 pack of beer hoping she won't notice when she gets home or worse hoping she won't notice when I go pick her up anyway.

I joined Reddit for this sub.  No lie.  I was struggling with how to quit.  Hypnotherapy, books, cold turkey....  I read an article that mentioned it and it turns out that This sub was the one thing that stuck.  I don’t know what it was about being able to open up to internet strangers with the same issue as me, that worked so well, but here we are.  

I’ve said things in posts and comments on this thread that I never would have in a therapy session or in a meeting.  I think that’s what made visiting here, end up so successful for me. I was able to be completely and utterly vulnerable thanks to the anonymity.  I feel safe posting here.  I don’t feel judged or looked down on.  Its really helped me to see all of you get so raw and honest.  It’s been a game changer for me.  It only made it easier for me to come out of my shell when I saw someone else pouring their heart out about something I related to, and/or did.  

I’m so happy.  My life is better in every metric.  I’ve gotten control of my finances once again.  I sleep so well. My SO and I don’t fight about drinking.  I can be there at any time of the day or night for my family because I’m sober.  I’ve started new hobbies.  I’m working on making new friends.  My outlook on life is now super positive.  I remember my evenings the next day.  I don’t have to sneak and drink or buy extra beer.  I’d list a negative impact, but if im honest with myself, there isn’t one.  I’ve been to tap houses and breweries with friends and didn’t feel like I was missing out on anything.  If anything, I feel like sobriety enhanced my experience, because I was present and focused on what my friends were talking about.  

All of you are an inspiration.  No matter what phase of not drinking you are in.  This is my longest sober streak since my teens.  (Early 40s now) Thank you all for sharing and being real when you comment and post here.  I’ve felt nothing but love and respect, and that’s what I want to give back to you all.  Much love and respect to all my fellow SD-ers. 

I love you all.  Thank you so much.

In the last 500 days I've started a recovery subreddit for women r/women_in_recovery, learned how to knit, gotten back into pottery, made a whole new group of sober friends, started to eat and enjoy food (and have lost weight), saved a boat load of money, strengthened my relationships with all my family (they are thrilled I'm sober), started organizing my house, binge watched Netflix more than I care to admit, finally got a raise at work that I didn't ask for and found a higher power.

Best of all is how my relationship with my teenager has grown. She respects me and can trust and rely on me.

In the last 500 days I haven't woken up with a hangover, obsessed all day about getting home so I could drink, isolated myself to hide my drinking, looked for excuses to drink, hid how much I was drinking, worried about getting a DUI, or bailed on commitments so I could drink.

The reddit recovery community and AA have made all the difference in my recovery.  We are not alone and we don't have to drink today!

I have never lasted longer than three weeks, and that happens maximum once a year. Besides those half-assed stints I've been drinking practically daily since I was 16, and I had a binge drinking problem before that.

It's now the 14th of November where I am and I realised that yesterday, the 13th (or the night between the 12th and 13th, when I made my sobriety decision) was my friend Seb's birthday. He commited suicide when he was 21 and I was 17, four years ago. He had a very hard, traumatizing life and struggled with substance abuse and alcoholism all his life. He was trying to get sober when he died, and I think that's one of the things that struck me so much, I wanted him to survive another attempt and have one more chance. I think as those who remain, though, that chance is ours and I want to take it now.

I'm older than he ever got to be, and I think he was giving me a sign last night. This time I wanna last more than I ever did and feel better, I know alcohol is a problem for me (I've known for a while) and it's ruined a lot for me - my physical health, finances, mental health, social life. Eventually I want to quit cigarettes too and get my weed use under control, but I feel overwhelmed by the idea of doing it all at once. I'm determined to stay away from alcohol though, cannot wait for my stomach issues to get better, at least.

Thanks for reading, and I will not drink with you today!",8

Slightly lethargic. Cold weather doesn't help, it makes me want to drink to feel warm when outdoors. Also feeling irritable, and it doesn't help that my neighbor's child keeps stomping around in their apartment for fuck all reason all the time (I suspect the parents encourage it to burn off their kid's excess energy), but for fuck's sake give the kid a coloring book or some shit.

I have stopped drinking on-and-off for periods of time before, and enjoyed some improvement in productivity and creativity-- Although I was also rather miserable as well in that period of time. 

Today, it's not that I drink until I am completely incoherent, but more so that I am dependent on alcohol for one ~~reason~~ excuse or another. However, now that things are starting to look up in my life, I feel as if I need to change my drinking habits to keep up with life itself-- I have reached a ceiling not because I am inadequate, but because I have been impairing myself with alcohol.

2019-11-13 17:44:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dvzssm/what_does_having_a_plan_look_like/,"What does ""having a plan"" look like?","As of late, I've been moderating, which we all know sucks. I went from getting smashed 5-6 days a week to ~2 days a week. Improvement, yes, but I'm still miserable. I considered it fine as long as I kept it to weekends.

Anyway, cue yesterday (Tuesday) and I had an emotionally taxing therapy session, I had to drive 3.5 hours, and I was ill-prepared for a rehearsal. So I had a rough day and figured I ""deserved"" a drink when I got home, which wouldn't even be until after 11. By the time I got home I didn't even want to drink THAT badly, but I did anyway cause why not?

I'll tell you why not. I was up until 3:30 a.m. My whole day today is wasted. I awoke from horrendous nightmares (common for me when I drink, idk about you guys) and that dreaded anxiety that is paralyzing and all-consuming. And I'm tired of it. I feel like I'm running in circles, drinking is great, it's the devil, I want to quit, I want to moderate. 

I'm a lurker here and I've noticed those with long periods of sobriety always ask newbies, ""What's your plan? How are you going to stay sober?"" And it just occured to my slow ass that maybe I could get more than a week under my belt if I had even the tiniest of plans.

So what do your plans look like? How do you prepare for the inevitable ""I deserve a drink"" thoughts? How do you deal with the sheer amount of *boredom*? The anxiety? How do you plan when you KNOW these thoughts will occur, and sometimes without warning? 

I've realized having no actionable plan has allowed me to argue myself into drinking, no matter what. I find constant justifications to drink. *Even as I type this*, a thought in the back of my mind says, ""Would it really be the end of the world if you drank tonight? Or maybe just hold out until Friday, THEN you can go ham"".

It's not enough to want to stop. It doesn't work. So I'm asking, what do your plans look like? What concrete things do you do to prepare? (For reference, I've never been a day drinker. I always wait until an ""acceptable"" time to start drinking so even just NIGHT time is a fucking trigger.)",2

Ughh at 1 point last year, I had over 7 months sobriety.  Lately, maybe 5 days, then I pick up.  

So here is my new plan for next 3 1/2 months.   Most likely I will need to borrow money (using credit cards).   I am going slow down my work load so I can focus on getting healthy.   I think I am burnt out from work, suffer from constant stress & anxiety.    I  am overweight, high cholesterol and continue to binge drink wine.  The shame & disappointment in myself is unbearable. 

#1 spend money only on stuff that will improve my life, healthy food, exercise classes/gym, massages if I need it.   
#2  Actually workout and try my best, stretching, walking, yoga, tennis, lift weights.  
#3  Read & listen to self help books regarding getting sober   
#4   Love myself & others,  being mindful and present. 
#5   Self care, Hair, nails, massage etc..   whatever is going to make me feel better 
#6.  Learn  how to design in 3D 
#7.   Get my shit organized. 

Money is an issue & I can’t completely stop working. I will finish the work for my current clients and try to make time to focus on getting healthy.  
We all know, it is more than just stopping drinking.  It is dealing with life, that is why I want to reduce my stress. 
Wish me luck, I need all the support to stay the course and say No to my husband & kids.   I need this time to get my health, body & mind.    Also I am 50 & out of shape.  😱",4

I've wanted to post something here for the last month.

I pretty much know what i should do.

I should get professional help. But i just can't.

I am 18 years old, and i started consuming alcohol when i was about 14 years old. It really wasn't much back then. I drank every few months with a few friends... it wasn't something i did often, but when i drank, i drank A LOT. Aight, a few months passed, and i drank more regulary, like once a month. ""Still not a big deal"", i guessed. ""Once every few weeks is okay, right?"" I consumed more over time... i started drinking weekly after i turned 16, like every saturday... ""huh.. that's what all of my friends do.. so it can't be that big of a deal right?"" That quickly increased to two times a week, fridays and saturdays, and stayed like that for a LONG time( about 2 years \~), which is fine.

Fast forward to today ( i'm 18 right now, almost 19 )  I can't really control my drinking ""habit"".

I usually drink half a bottle of vodka (probably more) even if a have school the next day. My parents ( i live with them ) don't really have a clue, because i drink late at night.

I've tried to stop drinking , and it's fine throughout the day, but i just get a bad urge at night, and i can't control it.

I really want to reduce my alcohol intake.

I just don't want to deal with those daily headaches anymore. 

I don't really want to get professional help because my parents would notice, and my mother was an alcohol addict for a long time. That would just destroy them. I am 100% sure about that.

Do you guys have any tips for me?

I'm a single 33 y/o female with a flexible mostly WFH job and ADHD. Translation: it's easy to drink and not deal with life-altering consequences and when my ADHD meds wear off at the end of the day, booze is the best quick fix to deal with that comedown. Alcohol has always been a part of my family, so when my parents gave me my first drink at 16, it sort of lit the green light of ""well this is just what you do!"". I didn't really drink much until college, but ever since then I've been in a familiar relationship with it. I've taken a couple weeks breaks here and there, quit for 1 month a while back while a friend was forced to be sober while on some meds and I wanted to show support, but for some reason after a big blow up with my family on July 4th, I've been drinking almost every night since, and it's at least a bottle of wine and then some.

I've never had a DUI, never did any physical damage to myself or others, never did anything worse than just making an ass out of myself occasionally, and possibly getting into some relationships that I really didn't want. But now that I'm older, I feel the effects of it more. I've packed on a bit of weight and I just feel disgusted with myself. I suck at holding myself accountable which is my biggest fear in failing to quit alcohol. I'm tired of being unable to hold on to the motivation to stay sober. But I'm also tired of looking at myself in the mirror and being ashamed and I think it's causing some massive depression.

No matter what inspires me to stop, I eventually loose the motivation for sobriety  - especially between 5PM and 8PM. I get so restless. I've been consistently meditating, hell I even teach aerial yoga... but grabbing a glass of wine or bourbon immediately quells my brain more so than both of those things seem to do.

That being said, previous motivating factors in which I've actually stuck with a healthy decision have been vanity based. Don't hate me - we're all vain in some way. And I'm desperate to find anything that will just stick with me to keep me going. So I'd love to hear or see what you guys have experienced with the fruits of your self-discipline, especially if it has to do with your hair or skin :). I appreciate the inspiration this community already brings to the table... hopefully I'll find my inner strength and one day be one of the many success stories I read about here.",6

Drinking to avoid responsibility is no way to life my dream life

I am almost to 6 months sober and I am proud of that. 



Some part of me has been pondering the idea of reintroducing alcohol to my life causally and socially.

And it helped me to know that it was normal, I wasn’t alone, and that these went away. So here are some things that are normal to experience when you first stop drinking. 

-Sleeplessness  
-Shaking  
-Intense Anxiety  
-Drinking Dreams  
-Mood Swings  
-Fogginess  
-Memory Problems  
-Intense Feelings of Deja Vu (Even if the event had never happened)

These are just a few that are top of mind for me. Some go away faster than others. I had to restrain myself how to sleep without alcohol. I went from 3 hours a night to about 6, now. Anxiety is almost nonexistent, with some help from Prozac as well. Shaking is still there, but much better. Mental sharpness and acuity is almost completely back. Drinking dreams are few and far between. 

You’re not alone. It does get better. IWNDWYT",24

Infinity ♾,"“The infinity symbol holds a deep meaning for spirituality, love, beauty, and power. ... In a world filled with distraction and complications, the infinity symbol represents a sense of simplicity and balance. It reminds us to be conscious of where we are and the endless possibilities we have before us.”

I try to assign meaning to milestones to my sobriety. I’ve done the whole treat myself thing, gotten a tattoo, for on my soapbox and told everyone I was never drinking again, and silently wallowed in my own self pity because of my stupidity. 

So for 8 years sober, I decided to focus on the unknown. And falling and failing, because that is still my life, even post alcohol. And when an 8 falls, it looks like an infinity ♾ symbol. So I did a quick google (s/o) search and presto, bango, found the above quote. 

I hope that this random stream of consciousness maybe helps someone. I",29

I feel great this morning. Like the world is my effin' oyster. That drinking spot is a metaphor for my life with alcohol and without.

This is me and this is my problem.,"Having a difficult time writing this now but I feel like it will help...me at least. This isn't my main account and I ramble a lot(sorry) - I don't want to my colleagues reading about my struggles just yet.

My name is Rick. I'm 32 years old and I have a serious drinking problem. I've drank myself to sleep almost every night for the last 8 years...really only sobering up when sick with the flu or cold.

I'm ""lucky"" to be able to say I am not an abusive or violent drunk. I just jam as much of the poison down my throat as I need to pass out...escape reality. And I am ""lucky"" to be able to acknowledge that I have a problem before it goes any further. That is the first step - isn't it?

Like many people it progressed from half a bottle of wine to nod off to an entire bottle of wine to a pint of vodka etc. Waking up at 3am to swig from the vodka bottle in the kitchen....you name it.

I stopped once for 28 days - February 3 years ago. Of course I had to reward myself for making the 28 days so I went drinking and we all know how that turns out.

This past October 11th my wife(who is an amazing and extremely supportive person) called me out on it. With the help of this community and reading your posts daily I made it 14 days before I fell again and now I'm worse than ever.  Waking up at 8:30 am and starting my day hitting that bottle and not stopping until I pass out at 9pm.

Read that again.  Rick - you're in such bad shape you are slugging back vodka before you even brush your teeth in the morning!  Holy shit. Holy fucking shit!

I didn't, however, touch that bottle this morning. It's still there and I know where I can get plenty more.  But I can't. I know where this is going - and it isn't anywhere good.

I need to make this change. I need to fix myself. Thank you, /r/stopdrinking , for all the help over these next 50 years to come. I hope you all get sick of my posts here - because I will fix this...and posting to all of you will be one of the reasons why.

TL;DR I am a 32 year old struggling alcoholic who needs to change.",166

I am so grateful for my sobriety, it is the most important thing in my life today. In one short year, I have a life beyond my wildest dreams.

Here’s an overview of two humbling months in recovery.,"Drinking used to be my default stress-management and social lubrication tool. My drinking never impacted my work performance, but after I filed an equal pay act complaint, I learned that this tool wasn’t feasible given the level of stress and trauma I’ve been forced to endure since March. 

I am grateful that I was able to observe a vicious cycle— I would fight all day, numb myself all night with alcohol, which would subsequently fuel my anger, anxiety, and depression.

I pursued a 30 day treatment center to sober up and engage with intensive trauma-informed therapy that illuminated the numbing role that alcohol played throughout my life.

I started to engage with various facets of the recovery community— including AA, dharma recovery, refuge recovery, and an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy intensive outpatient program. I learned that the recovery community is a uniquely special space where all walks of life can gather and share their pain and victories without fear of judgement. There are frequent moments in which I find myself feeling more at ease in a room full of recovering addicts than with my closest family and friends.

Three days after residential treatment discharge, I attended my best friend’s alcohol and cocaine fueled wedding and maintained my sobriety with the help of Antabuse. I learned I’m still a snarky asshole who can dance hard to Robyn even when I’m sober.

A couple week later, I had my own civil ceremony in San Francisco City Hall, alongside my partner and closest friends who are drinkers. I maintained my sobriety during a Halloween party the night before, through the day of the ceremony, and at a luxury inn that was filled with fancy wine and wealthy couples fueling their mutual resentment with alcohol.

I’ve become an acute observer of moments and feelings that I was numb to before. I put a lot of energy into focusing on acceptance and the magical experiences that each day offers us on this planet. Pema Chödrön’s book, WHEN THINGS FALL APART, has become an essential text for me.

Every day I am floored by the stories shared by the recovery community, both in meetings and on this platform. I am humbled by the resilience that flows through this network. 

Thanks to you all for sharing your pain, strength, setbacks, and victories. Thank you to the recovery community for tapping me in to the kind spirit of humanity that’s often overshadowed by reactions to current events and deeply-seeded assumptions about one another. This year has been hell, but I find myself grateful that this horrible employment situation I’m in has yielded this new approach to life. I feel more alive than I ever have before.

I can't keep doing that. The anxiety I was drinking to settle was only settled temporarily, and then multiplied when it returns after the booze wears off. I owe it to my family and myself to be on top of my game for everything coming.

There's so many things going on and I just feel so overwhelmed, even now the itch to drink is ever there. But the sauce only makes me more overwhelmed and less capable of handling the things I need to.

I say ""you know I want to but I can't stop drinking if I don't stop right now. I have to get some distance from it.""

When I was 18, I used to work as a dishwasher.  It was physically demanding work and I was usually pretty sore at the end of a shift.  I remember coming home one night to my brother and a friend hanging out with a 30-pack and playing cards, as that was the normal routine for us back then.  I sat down and joined in.  A few beers deep, I noticed that I couldn't feel the pain anymore.  That soreness and physical exhaustion that I was feeling had been replaced by a comfortable, warm, numbness.  I remember mentioning this to them as if it were a revelation to me and ended it with something like ""that's probably not a good thing, huh?"", half-joking.  I don't recall what their reactions were, but I'm sure not much mind was paid to it and we went on with our lives.

This is what I think fueled my addiction for so many years.  The desire to numb the pain.  Working manual labor jobs throughout my 20's,  I used weed and alcohol to self-medicate on a daily basis.  Booze for the physical exhaustion, weed for the mental stress.  Now that I'm older and no longer work a physically-demanding job, my habits have continued into my 30's.  I'm just now realizing that my pain runs deeper than the external circumstances that trigger my addictions.  These are all excuses.  Having a bad day?  Drink.  Someone pissed you off today?  Smoke.  It really came down to just looking for any reason to escape reality and the pain.  Well, I don't want to escape from reality any longer,  I want to live in it.

I don't have any money to go to a doctor or any type of program and no one cares about me enough to try to support me. It seems my family would rather just call me a selfish drunk etc than offer any type of support. It seems they just don't understand how difficult it is for me.

But I don't want to let that stand in my way; how can I break free when it's always around me? Hi can I treat my anxiety when the quickest fix has always been alcohol for so many years?

So I watched this video where a fellow explained that there seems to be a few very dangerous times during early sobriety or people are prone to relapse, and the potential reason why. 

He feels that the most dangerous times are three months, six months and one year. Of course… It goes without saying that a potential for relapse can occur at any time… These were just the areas that he noted were people may be particularly vulnerable. 

He feels that a major reason for this is because after a time of being sober we begin to feel good… Then really good… And then fantastic. And as that begins happening, we slowly begin to forget the hell that our life was when we were drinking heavily. 

We slowly forget how horrible it felt to have to go into work hung over or have to call in sick. Humiliating ourselves and people that we love or care about in public. Accidents, falling down the stairs, DUIs and fights with our spouses. For sure… We are cognizant that these things used to happen to us… But how awful it truly made us feel slowly begins to wane, and this puts us in a precarious position. 

So… I went ahead in my phone and queued up messages to be delivered to myself at three months, six months and one year of sobriety. In these messages I pour out my heart about how awful it feels to be an alcoholic and some of the things that I have done and how they made me feel. After only 12 days… These feelings are still pretty fresh in my memory. 

I don’t know… Hopefully these will help me if I am vulnerable at those times.",9

Most in my life don't ""get it"" so I'm coming here to celebrate.","This is likely my longest stretch of sobriety since before I could legally drink. I feel good, but tired. I still have a lot to accomplish in my quest for self improvement but today I would like to focus in what I have done in a month of not drinking. (Plus about 2 weeks built up before a weekend relasoe that luckily didn't last.)


- I have started therapy again.
- I've come to terms with my mediocre relationship with my mother. It's still mediocre but I am accepting that state and not letting it define other aspects of my life. I cant control her actions but I can control how I respond to her actions.
- I significantly improved my running skills, including setting a PR for my half marathon time. (I've been a runner for a long time but my progress had stagnated and I previously wasn't willing to admit alcohol was the cause.)
- I travelled alone and even visited a bar to enjoy live music without drinking
- My house is so much cleaner
- I remember the books I've read and the late night conversations I have.

That being said, there are some challenges facing:

- My husband and my best friend both drink a lot. It's not my place to diagnose them as alcoholics but I'm growing worried about them. I'm grateful they don't try to convince me to drink but me not drinking hasn't slowed them down at all. The best friend's drinking is especially worrisome.
-I may be the only person in my run group that doesn't drink. 
- I'm really freaking tired. I go to bed early and still feel like I could sleep in.
- I have a stressful job. I love it but it's not easy. I kind of thought the stress would evaporate when I got sober but that isn't the case. 
- I may need to hunt for a new therapist. Mine has been great in session but did some questionable things financially (quoted one price and then ran my card for another and is dragging her feet at clarifying).
- I'm eating way more than usual lately. I'm never full.",60

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Need to confess, cause I wasn't doing best last couple of weeks. Although some time was the best of my life. How come? Let me explain. I was doing alright with not drinking and couple weeks ago I went to leaving party of my friend at work and well, got absolutely smashed. Let's say I barely could leave a taxi at home, I tried to went to neighbors doors (you know how it is). My girlfriend was upset cause I came back late and smashed. But I thought it's one time. For a few days I was alright and then I went for a beer with friend. And my friend went home at evening and I stayed at the bar. Or bars. It was like a beer-shot of vodka tour of bars. Until I was unconscious. My girlfriend tried to reach me and freaked out that I was hurt. I don't remember much but friend pick me up from city and later on he said I was totally without contact talking unreal things with no sense. My girlfriend was worried and crying at home. And then I've had a hangover. For couple of days. Felt bad about it but I tried to work on it again. 
And then I've had best two weeks of my life. I went for holiday with my girlfriend. We were in France and I didn't have a sip of alcohol that time. And I proposed to her. She said yes but asked me to ppromise her that I will work on myself. And don't harm her by drinking out late and without contact. Because she didn't know if I was sleeping somewhere, got beaten up, or anything else cause I wasn't picking up phone. And well we came back home. 
At that time I was already on notice at work. So after week or two there was mine leaving party and guess what. I don't remember too much. I wanted to have just a beer but ended up with lot of shots, beers and being smashed. I don't remember leaving taxi this time either. And I had hangover, couple of days filled with regret and shame. And last weekend I've started drinking on Tuesday evening and finished Saturday. Alone. And I've barely left bed all this days. Just to get some more drinks, watching shit on internet and numbing myself with alcohol. I used to do it all the time, the only exception is that now I don't have to. Cause I'm not in position I used to be. I was alone and unhappy. Now I have family that I have to care of, have a good job and a lot of people around me that are ready to help and care about me. I was doing well back this year, I've had like 100 days sober and I felt alright. I've had up and downs that time but I did it and I was proud of myself. But then idea of having just one beer came in. So I did have one beer. Next time I was like maybe two this time. And next time it was four pack. And you know rest of the story.
I just wanted to share I know it's a bit random, but important thing is I'm starting again. I've had last drinks last saturday. I have this feeling about having a beer maybe but I fight it. And now it's not about hitting a 10, 100, or 1000 days. It's about not drinking today.",8

Joy to all mankind indeed.

I’m making big changes in my life right now that alcohol was keeping me from, my career is going to get a second life, my one year old and I have built a strong bond, I’m not ashamed of who I am between the hours of 5 and 10.

I drink a 12 pack of light beer daily. The most I cut back thus far was by 48 oz’s mainly cuz I had a cold or was sick but that’s never even stopped me before. I cut back twice last week which eventually lead me to one day of me drinking an additional 16oz more then my usual 144oz’s total. Today I cut back by one 12oz beer.

-----------------------------------------

**The Good:** I just discovered the incredible luxury of a nonstop flight between Tampa Airport and San Francisco International. I used to always have one or even two layovers on the way across the country, which made the coast-to-coast journey into an all-day ordeal that exhausted me. This time, I got onto the plane, slept a little, had a snack, read a book—and the next thing I knew, I was home and ready to start my day. It was amazing.

**The Bad:** Once you’ve had filet mignon, there’s no going back to cube steak. Now I’m spoiled for life when it comes to air travel, and suddenly a three-hour layover at Chicago Midway—which used to be fine—is now no longer acceptable.

**The Ugly:** While I was gone, a friend stayed in my apartment, but apparently she used all the bathroom tissue, didn’t buy more, and forgot to tell me, because when I got home from the airport and wanted to use the bathroom, I was out of luck—there wasn’t a single square of toilet paper left.",22

I stuck to that for 4 months before deciding to relapse.  Prior to it we were proud of the progress I made and when I said I wanted to try drinking again she told me she’d support me as long as I had a strategy. I drank 4 times in a week, started sneaking shots again, and one of those times I went too far again and realized I had to stop. I’m now 9 days alcohol free. 

I didn’t think much of it until tonight when I started listening to a podcast called Recovery Happy Hour. The host begins her interviews by asking her guest what their sobriety date was.  For some reason this really bummed me out because I thought about what would have been my 5th month coming up but will instead be my 2nd week alcohol-free. People always say relapses are a part of the process but I don’t know. I’m sad I couldn’t have my story be “I went too far and was given an ultimatum and decided then and there I was done and never looked back.” What a story right?  But now it’s “well I had a good couple of months but now I’m starting over again.”  I was a firm believer in “it’s not how many days in a row, but how many days sober”, but tonight I just feel a little let down.  

I’m trying to give up weed as well and yesterday, 11/11 was my day 1.  I’m trying to stick with it and if I do then I do have a corny story that my total sobriety started when I made a wish on 11/11 to be the best person I can be.  I hope this story has a happy ending!",11

Again.,"I'm an alcoholic registered nurse that takes care of pre-op/post-op liver transplant patients. I've seen people die from alcohol-related liver failure time and time again yet I cannot stop drinking, no matter how bad I want to. I've cared for patients on life-support and critical drips for days on end, blood pouring out of their mouths from ruptured esophageal varices, only to see them pass. And whenever I take care of those people, I go home anxious and scared as hell because it is a glimpse into my own future if I don't quit drinking. I've already been experiencing liver pain and excreting bile whenever I go to the bathroom. I'm no doctor, but based on my symptoms, I would predict I'm either in stage II or stage III cirrhosis and I'm only 23. My life has barely started and I'm scared.  


I'm in the process of weaning my daily alcohol intake to curb dangerous withdrawal symptoms. I've had two major withdrawal periods from alcohol; the first time landed me in the ER with a rapid heart rate and palpitations. I truly thought I was having a heart attack. My sister took me to the ER and she was pissed at me. I can't tell my family about this because they chalk addiction up to, ""you can just choose not to drink."" I know they would get mad at me if I told them I relapsed after a short period of sobriety (about 50 days or so). The second time I withdrew my symptoms were minimal; mainly just irritability and anxiety. My two closest friends live out-of-state so I feel like I have no friends here to support me as I separate myself from alcohol. I've spent the past four days in my apartment alone with no contact to any support system whatsoever. I feel like I can't tell anyone. I'm scared for my health, mentally and physically. I feel like I have no one except for you guys here on SD.",9

I used my company's EAP to go to a therapist for the first time in years.Today was the 2nd session. I didn't know when i scheduled it that her background was in D&A counseling. 
The first day I told her about the secular AA and that i wanted to work on some things that had been really bothering me that contributed to my drinking and she kept steering the conversation back to the traditional AA and drinking. She did the same today.
In the 1st session she lectured me on how i wasnt going to enough meetings and how belief in a higher power is the only way it will work.
Today,  i said how i'm depressed because i compare myself to my brothers and she cut me off and questioned me about my family members histories with abuse.  i changed the subject and talked about how i had been depressed because I dont have a wife and kids and how i havent had any luck with women in 6 years and she lectured me that recovery is not the time to get into a relationahip. I reiterated that i was trying to talk about what lead up to the drinking problem and she just looked at me as if confused.
Each time i brought something up (like how i want to work on issues with my parents) she would steer the conversation to drinking.
Then at the end she lectured me that i need D&A counseling but she isnt licensed to do it. I said again that i have AA for the alcoholism and i want therapy to address other stuff and she basically didnt listen.
I left really frustrated and just needed to vent. Thank you for listening.
Luckily i have an appointment with my former therapist tomorrow.",2

At dinner yesterday I just got water. Tonight I got a ginger ale. Guess what. Not a single person asked me about why I wasn’t drinking. I have rehearsed what I’d say over and over, but I didn’t have to. Instead I fumbled over saying I wouldn’t be partaking in the wine for the table.

I’ve done enough decades of being at least slightly ‘out of it’. I’ve spent enough money in the last few decades on alcohol for it to have seriously added up. I’ve drank enough in the last few decades to affect my health negatively and possibly irrevocably.

Decades come and decades go. The days drag by but the decades fly. This next decade has the possibility of being my best yet and I think that is worth pursuing actively.

2019-11-12 21:05:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dvkobx/this_naked_mind/,This Naked Mind,"I have been reading this book 'This Naked Mind' for the second time and I wanted to share some things that clicked for me.

The first time I read it, it didn't really stay with me.   At one point the author said something like ""when you know the truth, quitting alcohol will be easy, in fact it will be a joy"".   I found it so ridiculous that I put the book down.   I missed the meaning because I was skimming it.

On the second reading, I think I got the right understanding of what she was saying.  Basically it is this:

Our minds consist of 2 parts that don't communicate very clearly, the conscious and the unconscious.

The unconscious is what really has stronger control.   It makes decisions before we know it, without explaining itself to us.

However, the conscious mind wants to believe it's in control.   It invents all kind of false reasons for why we do what we do, because we need to feel like we're in control and we're good people.

If we could directly ask the powerful unconscious why we drink alcohol, it would tell us very clearly that it's an addictive drug.   It's an unpleasant tasting drug and we never really wanted to drink it, but we saw others doing it, so we kept on trying.   The conscious mind kept pestering us to take a drink, and then we got addicted.   That's the plain truth.

This offends the conscious mind, which likes to think it is rational, in control, and nice.   So we invent all kinds of reasons to hide the inconvenient truth.   Reasons like...   It tastes good (false).   It makes me feel good (false).   It makes me more social (false).   I need it (false).   I'm just defective or I'm somehow special or different from others (false).   I'm afraid to quit because of all those reasons (ok, that fear is true, but it's based on false beliefs).

When you look at all these beliefs logically, they all fall apart.   None of it is true.   I don't have to be scared of quitting.  I'm not losing anything at all.   All I have to do is admit I was wrong and I made a mistake and I simply have an addiction to deal with.

This is not the total solution.   Dealing with a ""simple"" addiction is unpleasant and challenging.   But now I have made the problem more smaller and manageable.   I have done unpleasant things before.   If you paid me a million dollars to quit my addiction, I could do it.   So, although it's a challenge, it's not nearly as hard as my lazy brain tells me it's going to be.   I can do this.

And it is worth more than a million dollars.    So I'm going to do it.",51

I would have never thought I would be where I am right now.

&#x200B;

The first few months of quitting alcohol were a breeze because I knew it's what I wanted to do and I still had my pink cloud. Months 7-11 were really rough and I actually had one big swig of wine during that time. It was a brief moment of weakness during an intense argument with my significant other. Honestly though, the second after I swallowed I regretted it and knew I did not want it. I don't really  consider it a break in my sobriety but I guess technically it was.

&#x200B;

Since then it's been surprisingly easy. I still crave sometimes but It's just not a part of who I am anymore. I don't feel like the person I was before. I am slowly taking steps to be the person I know I can be. I'm struggling now to quit smoking marijuana and that's been really difficult for me. Pot's a much safer way to ruin your life! But I am getting away from it.

&#x200B;

I just want you all starting out to know It does eventually get better. It gets easier. You start to change just by abstaining. I am so glad I had this community when I began my journey and it's been so supportive on my hardest days. SERIOUSLY, IF I CAN DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT!!! Good luck to all of you. I believe in every single one of you. It will be worth it for you, I can guarantee it.

2019-11-12 17:33:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dvhr8a/just_a_random_thought_on_alcoholism/,just a random thought on alcoholism,"in the early 90's i was a big fan of howard stern. I listened to his show every day, for at least two hours, over a 4 year span.

as many of you may know, howard has always had employees on his show who were addicts. jackie, stuttering john, later sal, and richard, of course artie. howard, for the life of him, could never understand the mentality of a drunk. And he would always berate them, and goof on them, and he would say over and over, ""why can't you just be an adult for one moment, and control yourself? why can't you say no, and be okay with it"". something always along those lines

we all understand it is not that easy, but i think of this often, and during these past 6 weeks or so, i've had a real moment, standing in my living room deciding between a six pack and the gym, and i say to myself, 'just be an adult in this one moment"", and i will go the gym or the store, or whatever keeps me from buying alcohol. and, before i know it, i am another day sober.

i understand we have mal functioning, physically altered brains, and brain chemistry, and saying no to drink is not as easy as saying no, but sometimes it is that easy. it's like when i tell myself ""no"" my brain has a toddler like meltdown, and typically i would give in, just to stop the internal crying. understanding that i am appealing to my base needs, like a toddler might, is helping me cope with the long dull hours of the evening. in the morning, i am never sorry i didn't drink.

tonight is a bit of milestone. actually craving exercise, and not alcohol after work. let's not drink just one more day",110

I’ve been lurking here for awhile, and have been playing with the idea of quitting drinking completely for basically my entire drinking life, and now is the time for the rubber to meet the road for me and booze. I’ve wasted so much time and money, and been such an asshole to people that I love over the years, and I know I have to fix this. 

It’s time to get serious. The stakes feel high right now. My relationship is on the rocks and might not be salvageable because of my behavior when drinking. I feel like I’m hanging on by a thread at work. I’m depressed and anxious and half the time all I want to do is check out of life and fold myself away in my room to drink beer alone. Even worse are the nights when I leave the house, walking around town getting hammered and searching for relief from my problems in all the wrong places. The bad nights keep happening more and more frequently, followed by the hangover days, and the feeling of shame never stops or gets better.  

It’s not a question of whether or not the drinking is going to ruin my relationships or destroy my body or derail my career or even kill me. If I don’t choose a different path, it is clear that it will only be a question of which happens first. 

My moment of change begins today. There has been no revelation, only acceptance of a  fundamental truth I’ve know for years about my relationship with alcohol. This lifestyle doesn’t work for me anymore and it never did in the first place. Tonight, I will not drink. That is my one goal, and I will stick to it, alongside the rest of you.",8

I now have 5 non consecutive sober days under my belt, but he refuses to see it as progress. My smoking has ramped up pretty significantly, and he's pressuring me to stop that right now too. Also, I haven't been going to the gym because it was a routine for me to go, then stop at a liquor store on the way home. I don't think I'm strong enough to skip it yet, and have been nervous to push myself.  It, he's pressuring me to go. We've fought 3 days in a row, once with him waking me up in the middle of the night to yell at me for going to get more cigs after he went to bed. He says I'm too emotional and touchy, and he just wants to have conversations; I'm the one amping the fights up. But, each time he tries to start a ""conversation,"" I tell him that now's not the time, and he refuses to back down. I'm so tired of fighting. Today's fight revolved around the amount I've been smoking, and how he thinks I should focus more on losing weight and less on stopping drinking. I don't understand his thinking at all.
Take all this with a grain of salt; I'm sure he could write a whole wall of text about the same fight, and make me out to be the bad guy. But, right now, all I want is love and support without pressure, and he isn't giving it to me.

Day 1: Alcohol was my master, that much was obvious sitting at my low point, so I attended my first-ever AA meeting on January 27th at the yellow house foundation in Leander Texas. I was in rough shape and everyone in the room knew it. I was warned by the old-timers what I was in for (detox wise) and was scared to death.

Over the next 7 days, Detox was hell. My drinking was very heavy and in hindsight, this should have been expected. Shaking, flu-like symptoms followed by a doctor's visit for detox meds. I was still stupid and still full of attitude and self-will. So, of course, I didn't take my meds and had a seizure as a result. After that, I gave in and followed the instructions on the bottle. (my post from day 5 - [https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/am5w0a/on\_day\_five\_im\_not\_doing\_well\_granted\_i\_was\_a/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/am5w0a/on_day_five_im_not_doing_well_granted_i_was_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) )

Over the next month (still month 1) I attended meetings every day, twice a day. I don't know why the meetings helped me so much but I can tell you, it was great to be around folks that knew what I was going through. They gave me great advice like to eat ice cream and to watch out for H.A.L.T. (hungry angry lonely tired). ""Acting squirrelly"" were the words that they used to describe wanting to drink. I could relate.

**Month 2**: I decided to continue moving forward in the program picking up a 31-year-old sponsor with 11 years of sobriety. (yup. he has never legally drank in a bar.) I was still full of self-will and told myself to stick with all of my previously made plans (that were made drunk) including attending a concert I bought tickets for and a trip to NY to visit family that was already set in stone in my mind. It was at this point that I downloaded an app on my phone called ""meeting guide"" (blue background with a white chair) This app was a huge part of finding others like me while a traveled outside of my comfort zone and away from my homegroup. I attended the Cypress Hill meet and greet concert with my GF (who doesn't really drink at all) and met Xibit as well as Cypress. A sober companion was key to my concert success. When someone at the show offered me some weed, I said I was in recovery. The guy asked from what and I replied, from whatever you have in your pocket. He was shocked at first but later told me he admired my decision and strength. I laughed to myself because I still felt weak without my usual fixes.

Side note: Month 2 was when my dreams became vivid nightmares often bouncing back and forth between post-apocalyptic scenarios and of relapse escapades and realistic feelings of regret.

**Month 3**: I decided to get busy on recovery, working step work as much as humanly possible with my sponsor. Step one was easy. powerless? Yes. Unmanageable? Yes. Step 2 was a bit hard at first until I realized there were people in the rooms that had recovered and I was not the powerful force that made that happen. So I did ""come to believe"" that there was a power greater than myself that could restore myself to sanity. Hell, if it worked for them, why not me? Step 3 happened (in my opinion) when I decided to come to my first meeting. I don't know exactly what god is, but I decided to turn my will over when I gave up on ""my will"" and started looking for ways to stop the madness of drinking constantly. Step 4 was where the real work came and I listed all of my fears and resentments towards all people places and things. Holy cow. -On step 5, I went over these items with my sponsor and came to the discovery that I should not have been mad at my mother for dying. My mom had the disease of alcoholism and the disease had its grip on her. She was sick and it took step 5 for me to see that fact and the fact that I was sick too. Step 6 also seemed kind of easy because with the new knowledge from step 5, I was able to list my now obvious character defects and I was definitely entirely ready to have all of these defects of character removed at once. In step 7, I asked God to remove my shortcomings in an hour-long meditation. For step 8 I reflected back and made a list of everyone who I had harmed and became mentally prepared to ask for forgiveness from all of them. I then sat down each of them and went over all of my wrongs as well as asked them if I missed anything they thought we should discuss. Step 10, 11 and 12 happens almost every day as I look back at my previous 24 hours trying to identify self-seeking actions of self-will and selfishness growing once again while praying for the knowledge of the next right thing and looking to help other alcoholics that need help understanding how to get and stay sober.

**Month 4 to 9**: Sponsorship and working with others. Many people seemed to consciously decide not to raise their hands in my groups when asked to help others get through their step work (they figured there was a better sponsor out there for the newcomer) and so I asked my sponsor if I should be helping people. I was told. ""obviously. That's how this works."" So I tell people that I will be their sponsor until they find a better one :) At some points over the months, I had 4 sponsees at once. Some went out and decided sobriety was not for them and some stayed in the program but moved on to another sponsor. One of them took his own life while we were getting him packed for rehab. I still go to meetings a few times a week and continue to work with others and I chair a PPG (primary purpose group) meeting on Thursday nights at 8 pm in Leander Texas at a group called the yellow house. Today I can say that working with others who are like I used to be, keeps me sober one day at a time.

Things I have learned in Sobriety:

* Demoralization: to erode morale. Encourage them to retreat, surrender
* I only have control over the decision to take the first drink.
* Because (for me) first A Man takes a drink, then the drink takes a drink, then the drink takes the man.
* I have a disease that tells me I don’t have a disease.
* I have to “Keep coming back” to meetings to gas up.
* While I’m here in a meeting, my disease is in the parking lot doing Push-ups.
* Because My disease is the only disease that wants me dead but will settle for me being miserable.
* So I have to ask myself Would I rather Rule in my lower powers hell or serve in my higher powers heaven?
* I started drinking because I thought it was fun, I continued to drink because it became a habit. I came to AA because of my habit, but I continue to come back because it’s fun.
* I’ve seen many lives ruined due to alcohol but I’ve never seen an individual's life become better off, from excessive drinking.
* If you wonder how people get 40 years of sobriety, it’s easy... don’t drink and don’t die.
* All I need is a little bit of the past, and I’ll be denied a future.
* The big book of AA is an instruction manual to achieve and maintain sobriety. I once tried to put an IKEA baby crib together using just my self-will... So it wasn’t crazy for me to think I could get sober on my own.

2019-11-12 15:55:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dvg728/im_doing_this_for_my_health/,I'm doing this for my health,"I decided on the 12th of January that I had to stop drinking ""for a while"".  I found drinking fun and I liked having fun socializing and drinking. But then sometimes it wasn't fun, and I drank too much and couldn't quite remember everything I said or did in an evening. I made it a habit of being around people who were heavier drinkers than I was and taking on a caregiver role, making sure they got home etc. If I could do that it meant I wasn't toooo drunk. 

But I felt a bit sick all the time and a bit ashamed of how messy I acted at times. For me the decision came to what was healthy for me. I realised that alcohol wasn't helping me be a healthy person. Everyone knows that drinking in excess isn't healthy but slowly I came to really know that in every part of me. If I wanted to be responsible for my life and health I had to make better decisions. 

I lost my Dad a couple of years ago to cancer (he was 65) and even though he fought a hell of a good fight a fairly big part of me wondered if he would still be here with us and see his grandkids grow up if he hadn't spent a lifetime drinking and smoking and not exercising. For me, I made the choice to research cancer risks along with other diseases and there is clear evidence alcohol is a known carcinogen. Everyone knows that too, but when I started looking at every glass of wine I drank as something that could make me very sick in the long term I just had to stop drinking it.

I spent a pretty extreme amount of time scrolling through this sub when I first stopped, as a distraction from the cravings to drink. I also ate a fair amount of sugar at the start of my journey. Some days are tougher where you wonder if you should just have a drink ""to be more relaxed"" but as so many people here have mentioned - Deciding to not drink each day is one decision, trying to decide how much to moderate your drinking is more exhausting.

I guess this post is for anyone that wants to take a break from drinking or is trying to moderate. Not drinking has been one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life. Here a few things that have improved in the 10 months of not drinking:

It has motivated me to lose 20 kilos (45 pounds) now that I am not drinking empty calories  
I am healthier than I have been in 20 years  
My husband has also stopped drinking and is happier for it  
I run a business that is no longer overwhelming  
I have increased by income by almost 100% this year because I now charge people what I am actually worth and I am better able to manage my workload",6

Each day I woke up feeling rested and relaxed.  I worked out.  I ate delicious food.  I had good conversations.  I enjoyed the company of others.  It was a wonderful sober weekend.

Despite all that positivity, I’ve come to realize that I have a couple of people in my life that may be problematic for me.  One of my best friends is struggling with her own alcoholism.  I’ve been talking about my own wishes to get sober for months, and I’m finally making an effort to make this happen.  She really wanted me to get wasted with her at lunch this weekend and I refused.  She tried to get me to have “just one,” and I instead asked her to come watch our favorite movie at my house.  She declined, I think so that she could go home and continue drinking.

This is really hard for me.  I felt bad for disappointing her, and I felt bad for her, for the struggle she has, even if it’s not affecting her in ways that make her want to change yet.  What can I do to help myself here?  Are there any tools that I can employ to stay sober and not lose a friend?  I know AA basically says to leave them behind, but we’ve been friends for 20 years.  Neither of us started out this way either, we became this way.  What can I do?  I should also note that AA is NOT for me.  I’ve read Annie Grace’s book and I’m doing a Smart Recovery approach.

But seeing it happen to someone else, the way the police treated her so terribly, the way her husband and kid loved her, her parents coming to search for her when she went missing, her love for animals... I see myself in this woman.  Its devastating. 

I have actually had drunk day dreams and romantically thought about walking away from my life in the winter and never returning only to  die alone outside and be free from my horrible life.  I figured they would be sorry and they would miss me and then realise when they did, but the only them was me. Everyone did care and it was me who kept drinking and i didnt care if I died. I  wanted to die. Drunk me wanted to die...sober me is trying every day to live.",6

(LONG)","Deep breath on my part. Realize this is long and a little rambling, but I wrote it all out. It's a bit of a confessional. I think I feel better admitting it all to the cosmos as least! Hope it's okay to share.
_______________

Took my first real drink at 16, and quickly became a weekend binge partier. Took a bunch more drinks in college, and at 24 spent one intensely shameful night in a rural county jail when I earned a DUI after stupidly driving home from a friend's wedding. Vowed to get it under control.

Moved to the ""big city"" (Chicago!) with my partner after college, where we drank socially - a LOT - through our twenties. I mean, everyone in our crew did for the most part. Drunk house parties, drunk concerts I barely remember, drinks with dinner, tons of free drinks at work functions. But we never really drank on weekdays (that would be over a line, right?). But weekends - up for grabs! I got used to those hangover weekends with Sunday headaches and puking all day.

Moved again with my partner to Portland, and man there were a lot of great local pubs and breweries there. Not to mention a ton of great, easy to locate and easier to smoke weed. And we were kid-free, and I had a great job. We traveled and hiked and experienced a ton in less than 2 years. We indulged a lot, but this was a golden era.

Then dad, my best friend and kindred soul, had a stroke. We dropped everything. Planned to move home to aid in what was going to be a tough, long, not full recovery. He died the weekend I was there apartment hunting. He didn't want to be a burden to us, and I think his body and soul were just too tired to try anymore.

We moved home anyhow, to help in my family's grief (and our own). It changed everything. 

This was one of those honest-to-god lynchpin life moments that you hear about. We've never recovered. Dad was the bright spot, the goofy joker, the incredibly loving guy that tied us together, and since his death it's clear that my mom and brother and I were always teetering at the edge of being cynical souls. 

It's been 7 years. Mom still works but has essentially cocooned herself in her and my dad's home. All the warmth and love the house held while we were growing up left with dad. It's a tomb now. My brother has gone through a life-altering divorce, and a nightmare custody battle that still won't end. He holds it together as much as he can. I quietly continued to drink, alongside my partner. We slowly stopped going out much and drank more at home.

Things change, life doesn't stop with grief. My partner and I still live in my hometown. No more travel or adventurous ""pick-up-and-move"" scenarios. Not many friends. We traded that reality from our twenties in two freaking awesome, adorable, smart and hilarious little sons, still pre-K. They are my only bright spot at the moment for me. They are the reason I have to get it together.

My partner drank excessively through each pregnancy, though I pleaded for him to stop, even kept calendar records of how much he drank and told him I was terrified I would start again after I gave birth. I guess that terror was short-lived because I still started to drink again a few months after each pregnancy. No excuses, I am an adult, and I made the choice to pick up the bottle again - but I know we enable each other.

This year was a breaking point. I've become the blackout mom. It's like a switch flipped. In February, after another night of blacking out and yelling at my partner (i only remember snippets0, we went to counseling and I stopped drinking...or 40ish or so days. I lurked here constantly, taking note of places or stories where I felt solidarity. I started reading Annie Grace. My perspective shifted, and I started to notice that booze surrounded everything. And I could trace it back to most of the grand mistakes or embarrassments of my life.

And then after 40ish days...after multiple bouts of not drinking for a week or two over the past several months, after diligently installing sober apps on my phone (and eventually ignoring them sadly), and after more blackout moments again than I care to admit.  After realizing I've become a verbally abusive monster that unleashes years of anxiety, passive-aggressive anger, and grief upon my partner after that magic number of Jim Beams or Red Bull/Vodkas. After realizing over and over that soon, the boys will be old enough to know what's going on with Mom & Dad. After realizing my five-year-old probably already has a vague inkling that something is off.

Well. I'm here again. I'm back at square one. 

I blacked out last Thursday night, after a rare date night for us. One margarita at dinner and half a bottle of vodka at home later. I yelled, I got a little physical with him (a terrifying first), and I didn't remember ANY of it. My partner didn't talk to me until Saturday morning. We finally sat down. He said he can't live like this anymore, and I agreed. We cried together and said we would work on this together. 

I know we are reaching 'last chance' territory, here. It's either sobriety or I lose my partner of 20 years. I lose my boys for a joint custody situation. I lose the loose ends of a person I remember that I used to be: hopeful, kind, creative, shy, honest, eager. I have to choose, and I have to choose to do it alone - not whether or not my partner does it too (he kept booze out of our house for a whopping 24 hours, sigh), or whether or not I still feel functional-ish during the daylight hours.

It sucks, I feel lonely, and I'm scared. But I also feel a weird sense of peace, resolve. Like ""Ok, fuck it. This is it, let's roll up our sleeves."" I know the kids are worth it, and I feel like their mom is worth it too. Here's to day five, and more in the works. IWNDWYT.",116
2019-11-12 13:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dvdo7b/day_1/,Day 1," 

I will not drink with you today.

I finally gained the courage to admit to myself and, importantly, to my wife that I am an alcoholic.  Alcoholism runs in my family and it has been an ongoing struggle throughout my life and my current relationship.  I tried to tell myself, and her, that I could keep it under control.  Have a beer or 2 while watching TV.  Have a glass of wine and relax.  Then the day would arrive where it would come creeping up on me.  Any little excuse to have a drink, just to feel that relief. Working from home comes with certain freedoms... Freedom to raid the liquor cabinet and have a go at some whiskey or vodka.  Make a quick run to the liquor store to grab a few tallboys or a pint of Smirnoff.  Before I know it, I'm feeling nice and fucked up.  Then reality begins to set in.  My wife is coming home soon, I gotta sober up.  Have some coffee, eat a snack, hop in the shower, brush my teeth to get rid of the smell (I don't think it ever really goes away).  She comes home ""none the wiser"" and I spend the rest of the evening feeling like shit and hiding it.

Which brings us to yesterday.

The same old routine.  A couple of hours into my shift, I drink half a pint  of Vodka.  Then, before I know it, the other half.  I spend the rest of the day in a daze.  At the end of my usual shift, I go to the office for a few extra hours of overtime on Mondays, but I was in no state to show up.   Instead, I went to a local bar and just hung out by myself for a couple of hours, nursing a few beers and scrolling through Reddit.  Halfway through my 3rd IPA, I began to realize I was pretty fucked up and I drove home (yea, I'm a fucking idiot).  I was seeing double lines on the  road, but I made it home safe.  When I walked in the door, my wife immediately knew something was up.  She thought I had just taken some Xanax (i have a prescription) and so I went along with it, even though I was slurring my words.  Eventually, I started passing out on the couch,  so I went to bed and knocked out like a light.

This morning, I woke up with a hangover.  I spent the morning thinking about how awful of a person I am and how I'm putting myself and my family at risk with my behavior.  I decided to finally take control of my life.  I thought about what I'd say to her and how she might react.  I was scared of her reaction, but was scared even more so by what might happen if I don't say anything.  Just thinking about the words, I cried harder than I have in my entire life.  The feeling of dread and hopelessness overwhelmed me.  I knew then and there that I had to make a choice and bring an end to this once and for all.  When she came home for her break, we sat down and I told her everything.  She was so understanding and supportive, I feel like an even bigger piece of shit for just lying to her about so much over the years.  Once I got it all out, I felt like a weight was lifted off of me.  I am going to seek professional help and take whatever steps I can to put this behind me.

If you read this, thank you.  I really needed to write this out.  If you're in a similar situation, my best advice is to let it out and save yourself before it's too late.  There is hope.",15

""So, what's wrong with you?"" he asked. ""Well,"" I said. ""I think I basically have five major problems. I'm fat. My career is going nowhere. I don't have any money. My love life is a disaster. Oh, and I drink too much.""

""Let's talk about that last one,"" he said. He asked me how much I drank each week. I thought long and hard and came up with a number that was accurate. I then divided it in half.

""That's way too much,"" he said. By the end of our conversation, he told me that I was clearly an alcoholic and that my best bet would be to give up drinking completely. He suggested I join AA. I scoffed. ""I don't believe in a higher power,"" I said. ""Everyone says that,"" he said, with a laugh.

I decided to see another shrink. I found a woman whose office was close to mine. She, too, asked me what my problems were. I told her the same thing. And, to my dismay, she echoed the first guy and said that it sounded like drinking was the culprit. ""But that's ok!"" she said. ""We'll work on it. I've been sober ten years myself.""

That was in November 2016. In June 2017, after months of agonized discussion, I decided to take the plunge and give up drinking completely. By the grace of a higher power I once scoffed, I've been sober ever since. 

When I think back to that initial conversation with the therapist, I realize that I actually wasn't wrong. Drinking *wasn't* my only problem. But, like untying a knot, it was the issue I had to address first in order to solve the others. My lifetime of addictive behavior included overeating (hence being fat), unhealthy behavior with women (hence the dismal love life), and compulsive spending (hence the lack of money). But these problems didn't make me pass out drunk on a subway train in the middle of the night. They didn't make me lose my job. They didn't make me piss myself, act like a lecherous creep at parties, and spend mornings curled up on the bathroom floor. Drinking did.

I spent the first year of recovery simply learning to live without alcohol. It hasn't always been easy. I drank for 20 years and could not imagine my life without it. But one day at a time, I began to piece my life together.

Through AA, I began to understand *why* I drank. Since childhood, I had always felt uncomfortable in my own skin. I felt an acute sense of social anxiety, always worrying what others said to me. I was a fearful boy that grew into a fearful man, one who simply could not cope with the normal ups and downs in life. Alcohol provided me with an escape. So did food. It was only through AA, where I could talk about myself in an honest way with others who understood, that I began to address these root causes. 

I'm happy to say that I'm now much further along and being ""me"" than I ever was. And that's a glorious feeling. But — it all starts with deciding, one day at a time, to not drink. Not even one. Not even a sip. Because, it's very easy for those shoelaces to get tied up in a horrible knot again.",1062

I just shook my head and said ""Not today"" she laughed and told me ""Good job"". I really notice when my family has had some drinks. I thought my brother was in the bag on Halloween until I realized he had only had a beer when my father in law cracked one and they smelled the same.

I was so embarrassed about it that I finally got help with the anxiety I'd been suffering with for 12 years. The therapy helped but I never really got over my fear of carrying drinks and instead started to drink water instead of tea because I could carry it in a bottle.

Recently (2.5 years after the anxiety therapy) I started to wonder whether the shaking was provoked by drinking. Today I left my water bottle at home but just thought fuck it, let's test it out. I dusted off my old water glass and set off. Today I've carried four drinks upstairs at work in full sight of my colleagues without an issue and it feels fucking fantastic. It might sound stupid to you, but this is a BIG deal for me. I'm so happy.",191

2019-11-12 09:13:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dvaief/ugh_family/,"ugh, family...","I am closing in on 100 days, have broken my previous records (two times 68 days, dunno why 68...), survived restaurants with friends and a work conference in the UK (with free catering and free alcohol everywhere...). I started running again, feel 10 times better than before, lost a lot of weight, no longer look like a pregnant male, and am building more tools to deal with sober living each day. I do not want to go back to my previous life, and am tremendously grateful for this community and all of you great people, the stories, the help, the support, and the tips and tricks you have provided.

But the weekend was hard. Not because of cravings, but because of family members that simply do not understand how you cannot drink. We visited our uncle, aunt, mother, ... the first time I am on this sober stretch. They did not know, and could not understand how I was not drinking. These are people that are all drinking wine well before lunch, and go through several bottles each every day. Not fast, but continuously throughout the day. Fridges stocked with craft beers. Shelves of fine bourbons and whiskeys. It was so hard, not to not drink, but to constantly face their questions, their disbelief. Every time my wife left the room I was asked if I really didn't want something (wink wink), that they also have just regular beer besides wine, that there are craft beers cold as well, just one glass, just a taste, as if it's my wife holding me back. 

All my grandparents died of cirrhosis or lung cancer due to cigarette and alcohol use. My mother has cirrhosis, my father died of lung cancer. My uncle was relating a story about a friend of theirs that died last week due to falling off the stairs to his basement when drunk, and how it's strange that that was the fifth (!) acquaintance already that went that way, falling to his death attempting to get more booze. Their son in law died of alcohol abuse. Their own son still lives with them because, basically, he is an unemployable drunkard. These are the people feeling terribly threatened when someone shows up and declares he no longer wants to be a part of this. What hurt the most is that even my own mother doesn't understand, even when she can no longer have a drop due to cirrhosis herself.

Sorry, just needed to vent. I am NOT looking forward to Christmas with these people...",8

Right now my biggest struggle is that I’m gradually becoming more annoyed with virtually everyone in my life. That’s not how I want to be and I’m not exactly feeling like a great ambassador for sobriety either lol 

Basically, I’m feeling like I bend over backward to accommodate people who don’t really appreciate it AND like I don’t know how to express that without starting some absurd fight that will gradually leave me a friendless exile. I think that, for me, alcohol let me be an undemanding and low maintenance partner/friend/daughter, and without being able to drink... am I *really* that stoic and low maintenance? 

But maybe I’m just in a weird mood and I’m the one with the problem rn.

example: I recently moved across the country, over my mom’s fairly vehement objections. She’s having some minor surgery later this month and, feeling guilty, I promised her I’d come “home” to help her out.

Well, her sister lives in her town and would be happy to help, but my mom’s place is a mess and Mom doesn’t want Aunt to see it “like that.” 

Nor can she be bothered to clean it up. Or even hire someone to do it. So I realized I’m being asked to travel 900 miles so someone else can be both proud and lazy. 

I’m irritated about it but feel stuck because I don’t know how to decline those kinds of situations or initiate conversations about my feelings. 

But I have crap like that going on in a lot of my relationships, so the common denominator is clearly me. 

An old friend asked me come visit over the long weekend that I’d *liked* to have spent with my SO and/or with my kids, because my friend had special plans for us... but she failed to secure childcare so the plans fell through and I spent a (very) long weekend listening to her and her kids scream at each other instead. 

I put a smile on and made the best of it, excused myself for long trips to the grocery store and generally declined to get involved in her family drama, but I felt kind of... taken for granted? idk. It’s like... I drove 3 hours *and* gave up a long weekend for this? 

(My opinion of the situation was not at all improved when I got texts asking for me to buy groceries for the family while out, sans even a polite offer of payback.)

Anyway, normally I’d have had quite a few drinks with her and that would have taken the edge off and reminded me of how warm, charismatic and funny she can be, in addition to being an improvident flake. (Nobody’s perfect but I wouldn’t be friends with her if she had NO redeeming qualities, right?) 

but I don’t *want* to drink. I want people to respect me, I guess. ugh 

Anyway, thanks for listening SD, AND... IWNDWYT",1

Hi guys,

I’ve been lurking for a while but this is my first post here. Please be gentle on me. 😊

I’m 29 and I’ve had a problem with alcohol for about a decade. I’ve never been an everyday drinker, but once I have *any* alcohol then things only go in one direction. While I know one drinking bout every week or fornight or even separated by several weeks (at most) doesn’t sound like much to some people, the consequences are almost always disastrous.

During that time, I’ve lost a good job due to alcohol. I’ve alienated friends and ruined potential relationships. I’ve lost my keys and been kicked out of a train station for trying to sleep there at 4am. I’ve been mugged at knifepoint and had my phone stolen countless times walking alone in the middle of the night, blindly stumbling around hammered. I’ve woken up in the houses of complete strangers (and sporadically covered in piss or vomit), tumbled down steps and ended up in an ambulance and at one incredibly low ebb – sat down in the middle of a busy road because I wanted to die.

I know that alcohol doesn’t affect everyone like this. Some people can go out, have a couple of beers, come home and watch a movie. I know that having OCD and anxiety (as well as traumas in my life I’m struggling to process) are a major factor in how alcohol affects my brain.

I have to accept that alcohol is terrible for *my* life. And now: instead of just saying “Oh I don’t want to drink again”, I’m finally ready to actually put in the **real work** that goes with quitting. I want to see stopping drinking as a *reward for myself* and not as a chore or a ‘necessary evil’. I don’t want a sober Friday night to feel like a punishment. I want to see it as a way of giving myself ‘a better Saturday'.

If you’re still reading this, wow, thanks. That in itself means a lot. So here are some questions I have:

1.) I’m reading *The Alcohol Experiment* by Annie Grace and signed up to the I Am Sober app. Are there any other books / podcasts / resources you’ve used that you’d recommend?

2.) If I reach a point of not drinking for long enough that people notice – have you found the best option is honesty (“I’m just sticking to soft drinks at the moment / I’m not drinking for the time being”) or coming up with an excuse (“I can’t drink on this medication”)?

3.) One of the things which seems to be a major issue for me is how I talk to myself (constantly firing negative messages at myself). Are there any mantras or positive messages you’ve found useful to help yourselves?

4.) Have you found joining groups IRL to be helpful? I’m not sure something like AA is for me, but I’d like to be part of some kind of group for non-drinkers (I’m English but recently moved to the Netherlands, so this may have to wait until my Dutch improves!)

Best of luck to you all on your sober journey. IWNDWYT.",20

I would never leave my kids alone but my dream was just telling me that when you drink bad things can and do happen. I never want to feel that way again! IWNDYT,4

Needless to say, I’m awake! One day at a time but it feels so good to finally say what I’ve wanted to say for so long but didn’t want to close the door to alcohol yet...”I don’t drink alcohol anymore.” Not “I’m taking a break” or “maybe I’ll have a drink when I’m in Portugal or Morocco or for REALLY special occasions” Nope, I just don’t drink alcohol anymore!!!

My partner and I had the day off yesterday and went for a walk. We passed through a touristy part of town near our place loaded with bars and I felt a pang of craving for beers. I realized that I’d often suggest we go to one of these bars on Sunday afternoons (I’m not really happy with my career and was trying to escape the back to work blues.) But when I was drinking, I didn’t really understand my motivation for stupid decisions like getting wasted on a work night.

2019-11-12 05:27:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dv86pr/slowly_regaining_control_of_my_life/,Slowly regaining control of my life.,"I am coming up to 4 months sober. I was drinking pretty much non-stop during my waking hours; I rarely left the house, rarely showered, and totally gave up on cleaning the house for about 4 years. I was a binge drinker before that for probably 8+ years. 

In the thick of things, I really believed that I had everyone fooled. I was pretty sure no one else knew when I was drunk because I'd gotten so good at it. I've since come to realize that I ALWAYS smelled of booze, even after a shower, brushing my teeth, and mouthwash. It was coming out my pores. 

I used to be really, really pretty. I always looked younger than I was, I had perfect skin. Then, as my drinking got to be out of control, I aged 15 years overnight. I was bloated and had the telltale broken blood vessels in my face. I hardly noticed at first, but then I just stopped looking in the mirror. 

The first noticeable difference when I stopped drinking was that I started showering regularly again. I started to go out and get my own groceries, smokes; I could even pick up my kids! I started to actually show up to family gatherings and events I wanted to attend.  

My depression became more manageable. I was able to find something to be grateful for every day, and thoughts of suicide have all but vanished. 

One of the most impactful changes though has been my appearance. My face is no longer bloated and splotchy. I’ve lost weight. I didn’t notice because I never looked in the mirror. Then people started commenting about how good I was looking. I didn’t really take it seriously when my mom mentioned it because, well…. She’s my mom. She’s “supposed"" to say things like that. It really hit me about a month ago when my brother in law noted that I was looking really good, and really healthy. He said it in a genuine, non-creepy sort of way. He’s a pretty quiet guy who doesn’t waste time with frivolous words, so I felt inclined to believe him. I went and looked in the mirror and finally saw that although I’ll never be the beauty I once was, I am back to being a decently attractive woman. 

Another of the big changes is my home. The mess was totally overwhelming. I wanted my home to reflect how I was finally feeling inside, but it was such a terrible disaster. Looking at the mess made me want to start drinking again so I just wouldn’t care, but thankfully I persevered in my sobriety. I realized that the house didn’t become a mess overnight, so it was unreasonable to think that I could get it back in order in just a day. I have been slowly chipping away at it, and I’m very pleased to be at a point where I will be able to entertain guests in just a few short weeks after I replace my flooring and paint the walls. 

This journey has not been without its challenges, but I’ve managed to face them all and overcome them. I grow stronger and healthier every day, and I’m not interested in giving up my sobriety for anything.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Seriously though - I’m the type to drink in a social setting. I got tired of abusing myself so I started moderation in August. There’s a lot of calories in booze and it was time to cut the shit out. You’re aging, your friend groups phase out, and you get tired of wasting money on nausea and headaches. 

It’s just not as interesting or desirable anymore. One too many rides on that coaster. I just wanted to say it feels like old habits are fading and better ones coming up. 

Been getting physically active again - can’t do that hungover. I’ve been hanging with friends who don’t drink or smoke - I feel way better being clearheaded and put together. 

Most of all - there’s not that heavy weight of constant irritation and anxiety. There’s not last nights regret parade of dumb shit you did drunk. I wake up calm and rejuvenated. 

When you really truly hit that commitment to healthy living you notice everyone who doesn’t. You notice why they make excuses. You notice they aren’t genuinely happy to be happy. You notice every social event involves booze and excess indulgence. 

I have the propensity to over indulge but haven’t acted on it in months - five or six - I can’t remember the last time I woke up hungover frankly. 

It just feels good to feel good - and it’s a real feeling!!!

Changes from my first big quit attempt to my second.,"I did it. I made it past the point of my last sober attempt, and this time - no major cravings, no white knuckling, no desire to get back on the drink.

The difference for me was instead of becoming a sober person in a drunk world, I decided to create my own sober life.

This includes:

Enjoying the sweet pleasures of early mornings on the weekends. Just getting up at 7am and gaming or reading or whatever. It’s just so satisfying.

Not suffering eternal FOMO, not forcing myself into situations where everyone around me is getting wasted. You don’t miss anything if you go home at 9pm.

Budgeting - this is an odd one, but it honestly changed my life. I actually set up and stuck to a monthly budget. I am able to pay off my debts and I feel so much more responsible.

Volunteering- there is so much satisfaction to digging up a flower bed in a local park or helping run a night for free so other people get to enjoy it.

Being myself - getting back in touch with myself. The slightly kooky, loud, version, the shy, quiet version. Accepting all the aspects of me and not labelling any of it as good or bad.

Meditation - a total game changer. My thoughts have a much looser grip on me these days. 

Just appreciating all the little things. I have a nice house, a lovely partner, and loads of lovely friends. I get all those things and those things are enough.

Thanks SD for always being here! This community has kept me going through the thick and thin. So happy to be able to still be here, living my sober life.",193

“I’ve never smashed up my door or gotten in fights, it’s okay if I drink.” 

But I gotta tell myself I can only get so lucky and pretty soon I’ll hit that “rock bottom” and I’ll regret it more than ever. So, quite simply don’t have that one drink.

I worked with a counselor a few years ago and bounced from one counselor to my current one a few weeks ago. All three have tackled my substance abuse problems by suggesting I work on developing a practice of mindfulness through meditation.

I understand the theory-- that I should learn to recognize my emotions and greet them without judgement. This makes sense because I clearly met some emotions with such strong judgement that it caused me to want to escape them by drinking. 

Unfortunately, I find mindfulness/meditation to be extremely tedious. My ADHD doesn't help. I'm open to trying if it will actually help.

From the outside I look like I’m living the life man. I have a beautiful house. A gorgeous wife. Two amazing kids. I retired from work ten years ago so that I could be with my kids more. I live for my family. I’m fairly wealthy. And the little work I do is looking after my real estate investments.

I’m a drunk. I’ve never admitted that to anyone. I drink all day every day. I don’t get drunk. I don’t get hangovers. I just like drink. Drinking. The feeling it gives me. 

Ive always bullshitted myself that I was fine. No I’m not fucking fine. I’ve become lazy. Stupid. Sometimes aggressive. I’m hurting my marriage. 

I didn’t realize I was in trouble or why. 

I’ve always been a drinker. All those years ago, I would always have a beer or three after work. It increased a little when I stopped working. 

Then came the darkest day. My wife died. Suddenly. Unexpectedly. Pregnant. It didn’t feel real. It destroyed me. I was left a single father of my angel four year old daughter. She saved my life. I’d be dead without her. She gave me a purpose. A reason to go on.

I gave myself six months to do whatever it took to get my head right. This includes smoking a ton of cigarettes. Smoking weed all day and night. And lots of booze. 

It took me three years to come to terms with my loss. But the drinking continued. 

At about this point, I met someone new. I am an introvert and don’t really like people. But she pursued me. I liked her. Very soon I married her. And we had a son together. He is two years old. He is spectacular.

The drinking continued. Bored. Stressed. Internal struggle with myself. Always. 

I came from a pretty close family. But it’s broken now. Two of my brothers cut me off. Haven’t spoken to them in almost three years. My parents are distant. And only stay in touch to see my kids occasionally.

To many I have the ideal life. To me I believe I’m mentally ill. But I won’t get help. I don’t like people doing anything for me.

Today I didn’t drink. It’s the first day in many years. My body aches. I can’t sleep. Today my head was clear. Today I had energy. Today I made love to my wife. Today was a good day. 

The nights are still dark. But I’ll stay and fight the demons.

-Waking up every weekend morning feeling like death, being unable to properly care for my daughter, needing to sleep in while my husband takes care of my daughter 
-being easily irritable all the time by everyone 
-being incoherent and “out of it” for half the day at work during the week
-being unable to take phone calls or engage in any sort of professional discussion before 12pm at work due to hangover
-weight gain, effects on my skin
-cost 
-I was training for a marathon but pretty sure alcohol contributed to me not being able to run it. I got drunk both nights before my 10km races (and still managed to finish them in under an hour and was super impressed with myself) 
-the numerous times I’ve embarrassed myself, gotten into conflicts, said things I’ve deeply regretted 
-I had one beer during my pregnancy as a “treat” and that one beer turned into 3 until I could feel the buzz. That scared the shit out of me. I did not touch another drop until I gave birth. I felt amazing.

I am a decently healthy 34 yr.old male. Play a decent amount of sports, go running, love outdoor sports and activities. I've taught ski lessons, love mountain biking, and am a general outdoor enthusiast. None of this is the problem.

In my 20's I was a binge drinker. 4-6 days a week, I'd be drinking and often heavily. Now, I realize the health costs, and moreso I'm an absolute wreck with hangovers. I would lose a 24-48 hours to the couch with a hangover.

This has helped and hurt in my recovery. I've cut out alcohol almost entirely, apart from social drinking. Mon - Fri I have no problem turning it down, or having just one or two. But I spend all week looking forward to Friday or Saturday night so I can go drink with my friends. It's probably been a decade since I've spent over two weeks without a night of heavy drinking. And then I'm back to square one with my health - a day or two on the couch, lethargic at work, making bad eating choices, any gains I made in my runs or exercise I'm back where I was.

Sound familiar? How do you fill those weekend nights, when it's been your habit for decades?",2

I didn’t realize the impact that my drinking had until I accidentally hurt my own cat and was too drunk to see that she was critically injured. I was so drunk that I went to bed instead of taking my cat to the hospital. My roommates had to take her and i got a bill for $750. I was almost a month sober but I had a moment of weakness. My friends and I were celebrating one of my friends’ performance at a music festival in Vegas. I didn’t drink then but now I thought i was ok to have a couple drinks. One half glass of wine turned into an entire bottle. My friends had to take my keys away cause they feared that I would hurt myself if i drove. I woke up the next morning and thought i was ok but I was far from it. I thank God that I didn’t hurt anybody. I thank God that I am alive and here to learn from my mistakes. Today marks my first day of sobriety and I cant wait until 11.12.2020 so i can see how far my progress has come. Do not be afraid to tell someone how you are feeling. Do not be afraid to ask for help. As long as there are good people around you and you actively seek help, then no one can hurt you but yourself.

I made awesome progress this summer and went two whole months without drinking. I was so incredibly pumped, but then I got laid off completely out of the blue.  I was so pumped about my sobriety that I even went to my first concert sober in a decade even after losing the job...

But then I got depressed. REAL depressed. I laid on the floor for 3 days straight and could not get my act together to apply to jobs or do anything. So after 3 days of being a blob of nothing, I gave in and poof, lost 3 months of time with my son and things I enjoyed.

What I miss the most is how much after I stopped drinking I could enjoy SOOO many more things! I took up guitar, could enjoy movies again sober, I could enjoy going to the PARK! I was able to bike around town, bike with my son. Just enjoying life.  I miss the ability to enjoy life and I hate drinking. 

I started reading This Naked Mind and it has been very helpful if nothing else but to help occupy my time during my prime drinking hours of 730-9PM on a work week. 

So 1 week today and while I'm not quite as happy as I was back then, I started getting an itch to watch Stranger Things and I'm hoping I'll become a bit more interested in more things again soon

After trying antidepressants this last year and having a bad experience, I figure I should stop consuming the depressant in my life rather than add anything else to the mix.

Has anyone experienced a profound difference in depressive symptoms/episodes after become sober?

How long did it take for that to be noticed?

I've stopped entirely for a month at a time, as well as cut back to a moderate amount, but I come back to catching a nice buzz pretty often, because I'm sad and its one thing that helps me feel better, even if it's short term relief.

I had a breakthrough today because of a reply in the comments of this sub, actually. I tend to binge heavily when I'm in a good mood--I've rarely been a person driven to drink over anger. Depression and a desire to escape from it absolutely, but never anger. I'm typically not an angry person, anyway. Even when I've been black out drunk, mostly I just get sloppy and loud and pass out where I'm standing, according to my friends who can control their drinking.

Joy though? I love celebrating. I love how cozy a glass and Netflix can be, especially when the weather is bad outside and I'm snuggled up on a couch.

Except it's never just one. It's 3. Then 5. Then 10. Then sometimes, more than 10. It's two or even three days drunk with no break. It's passing out on the couch with candles burning and the TV and lights all still on, no blanket, and waking up at 4:00 a.m.wondering where I am. I don't even remember being on my own couch. I go to bed. Wake up still drunk at noon after waking up at 8:00 a.m. for just long enough to call into work for the third time that month, get some more alcohol delivered to my house, and keep going. Same decisions, same results.

I'm in a great mood, I feel hopeful. Jubilant, even. Life is good, it's cozy inside, I'm going to make a great dinner, and the weather is shitty outside. Perfect night in. I had a painful urge for a glass of wine. Just one.

I've made the choice to stop drinking about 4 times this year, I'm a 31yo who has been binge drinking since 14 yo.

The last year due to stress, anxiety, financial and relationship problems and a long standing depression diagnosis my drinking has escalated to 2-2.5 litres of white wine a day.


I've been blaming my depression for the downs and anger I've been experiencing which in turn gives me a valid excuse to drown these demons.


Friday after a big fight with my wife and father in law (both incredibly supportive people) I mad the decision to take off to my nearest city without letting anyone know and I turned off my phone.


Fast forward 5 hours and 3.5L of wine later I came to after being pulled out of the river and slapped awake by a homeless man (Who I did not thank and ran away from).

I sobered up enough to realise I needed help instead of what I thought was helping everyone else.

Although I’ve been really successful for the past year about not drinking I would go a few weeks then drink then quit again for a few weeks, this is the longest stretch and I’m not going to break it again. 

Last night we were looking through old pictures and I noticed in every single photo we had together there was a drink in my hand or on the table. I would make drinks every night and finish hers because she didn’t have the same habit as me. I grew up with my dad going through almost a 30rack every day and a fifth every other day for my mom. They’ve been that way my whole life and when I left to be on my own I continued their habits on my own.

When I came back from my second deployment I met my wife shortly after and was probably in the worst of it. I ignored every comment she would make, or suggestions we not drink tonight, or any requests that we don’t need to buy so much. One day it got through to me and I was infuriated that she thought I had a drinking problem, this was so normal to me and why was she telling me I had a problem? It flashed me back to when I told my mom the same thing and it really tore me up, so I gave it all away the next day.

Now, it’s a story of success and breaking the bad habits that span generations. But I still feel guilt that I wasted so much time together, and a horrible wrenching feeling of disgust at how I behaved and the values I had at the time. Now I can be around other people drinking and just have a soda, now I don’t feel the urge like I used to. 

It feels good to write this out, I know it’s very stream of consciousness but I was scrolling through this sub that I just discovered and thought to myself how much it would have helped to be a part of this community when I was going through the worst of it. The past year and a half our photos together don’t have any drinks, I’m more present and our time together is more special. Honestly, I’m eternally grateful that my wife was the partner I needed in order to be the best man that I could be and she inspires me to always strive for the best, for us.

I have tried to quit for years. The longest I have gone was earlier this year, when I quit for 2.5 months. I remember, in the early days, having a conversation with my husband and telling him that it felt like I had lost a close friend and I felt like I was mourning. It was really hard, emotionally, for me those first few weeks. I ended up caving in one night when we were at my husband’s best friend’s place. I am slightly uncomfortable with his wife (she’s lovely, I just feel really awkward), and after over an hour of conversation (the boys were hanging out by themselves), I had a glass of wine that led to five.

When I started drinking again, I had more disdain for alcohol and got less enjoyment from it. I would drink and hate it (and myself) at the same time. I was disgusted with myself and with the way society has embraced an addictive substance and how it judges those who struggle with said substance. I hated myself and I hated that I couldn’t say no to this thing that was terrible for me and tearing me apart.

I found this group when I was at my wits end. I lurked for one day and then set up a counter and joined. All of my combined knowledge of alcohol and addictions (from years of reading and talking to people), together with this group just helped things click into place. I do well with accountability, and I feel accountable to this group. I also really started paying attention to how others’ drink, why they choose to etc. I have realized that the majority of people have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol, even if they aren’t alcoholics. (Just my opinion, of course.) And I just don’t want to be a part of that anymore. I want to be the healthiest version of myself and see what that feels like and brings.

I feel like I have had blinders removed and it feels great. I am still tempted and I still have rough nights, wanting to drink, but overall my view of alcohol has changed. I have not lost a friend, I have said goodbye to an abuser. I am free as long as I choose to remain sober.

All suggestions welcome.,"Last night was my first non-drinking night in as long as I can remember (at least 16 years, probably more). I drank a ton of water and caffeine-free tea. Haven't cracked a beer yet today, but the temptation is growing. Friday seems so far away.

Main goals: reduce spending on alcohol, lose weight, improve vocal health (all sites for aspiring voice actors say to limit alcohol). I want to drink socially, not habitually.

Edit: Has anyone had any luck by switching to NA beer?",2

I posted this about 1.5 years ago and I got a lot of messages that it helped people.  

\*\*Since then, I have had a few friends and relatives reach out to me about how they can stop drinking.  The first thing I do is always send them an email with this attached.  I believe it may have saved some lives in the past 12 months.  I am not smart and not a good writer, if I can do this, any one of you can.  Please read below, it is dark and sad, I am so happy this isn't my life any more.

&#x200B;

"" 

I wake up at 4am stumbling to the bathroom still drunk to pee.  The stress and anxiety would start to enter my mind at this point, what could I do to neutralize what I had just done to myself from the night before.  Usually, I would pound a half a gallon of water, some food, and some tums hoping I would feel better when I had to wake up in 3 hours.  This never happened, although the water and food probably kept my body going.  7:30am hits and my alarm goes off, I have to get up.  This is the feeling most people don’t understand. 

Why would you have a drink, how could it get that bad?  Why are you so stupid to think that having a drink will solve your problems?  I completely agree, that is unless you have experienced that feeling and are fighting the demons in your head.  One drink at all that anxiety will go away.  You will no longer feel like you are going to have a seizure, or that overwhelming anxiety where you whole body is tingling and ready to go into shock.  Plus, you are super smart, you will just have a couple to make that feeling go away.  You have a new plan that will work today, it didn’t work other days, but it’s going to work today.  I have done my research, I can’t quit cold turkey, I just need to have enough and slowly widdle off of the alcohol.

I do find some alcohol in the house before work, I take a drink, then what always happen with the first drink happens, I throw up a bunch of yellow bile.  I hop in the car for my 45-minute commute, I feel a little better, I know longer feel like I am going to have a seizure, but I know it won’t last long.  The whole 45 minutes to work I am battling the demons in my head, do I stop at the liquor store that opens at 8am by my work?  Nope, not today, it is going to suck and I will have the worst anxiety ever, but I’m not stopping at the liquor store.  One of these days they will smell it on my breath at work or I will get pulled over and get another DUI.  

Again, this is something else that is hard to describe.  You don’t think for yourself, you are in front of the liquor store, you walk in, and you buy a .375 of vodka for $6.  How did this happen, at some point on my ride in, my mind went blank and quit arguing with itself.  I don’t think it wanted to hear from the angel, so it turned it off and made the decision on its own.

I walk into work, I’m pretty sure everyone is suspicious of me, so I try to act as normal as possible.  How could they not be, I am always sick, I always leave early, my hands are shaky, my face is red and fat?  I go around to my coworkers and spark up conversation, I will appear normal to them.  I probably just went home last night and watched some Netflix like they did, I maybe even had two beers like a normal person.  If I can make it threw this 15 minutes of chit chat and make them think I had a normal night, I will be fine, they would never suspect that I went home after work and drank close to a liter of vodka last night.  They won’t know I woke up and have puked three times, I have had a couple drinks and am probably blowing a 0.15 right now.  0.15 might sound pretty high to you, it is not for an alcoholic, that is about where you feel normal.  

I have some chit chat with my coworkers and I make it to my desk, I made it, I will survive today.  I need to have just one drink though to make sure that anxiety doesn’t come.  If I drink some now, I won’t have to drink 3 times as much later to make the anxiety go away.  It’s just the smart thing to do right?  I go into my work bag and pour out about 3 shots of vodka into a glass and hide it off to the side.  15 minutes have gone by and I feel normal, and I won’t be needing more alcohol today, yes!  About an hour goes by at my desk, and those demons come back.  I can’t get more drunk, but I also can’t let the anxiety come back.  If I can keep this same level the entire day and get to sleep, I will have done my goal by weening off.  This is what people do who are trying to get better right?  This is the right thing to do, so I pour another drink.  The first sip tastes great, I make a call and notice I am slurring a little bit on the phone, shit!  Ok, no more to drink Mike, you are going to get busted.  I also realize I had only made one call, I may have made my coworkers think I am normal for the day, but I still have to make my boss think I worked today.  I am already in the shitter with him and on a performance plan.  Every day I get it, I have to email him and then email him again when I leave.  This is 3M though, it is almost impossible to get fired.  I am also the highest performing rep on our team.   What can I do to get through this day, Mike no one else can do what you do, you are so smart.  You somehow can be drunk 24/7, be the best sales rep on your team, and always get away with it.  

I send out some emails to customers looking for any kind of good news.  I get one back and exaggerate the crap out of it to my boss.  I send him and email as to what I did to get that sale and how hard it was.  This email gets sent up the chain and I look good again at work.  Mission accomplished for the day, I can sip a little bit more alcohol.  1pm rolls around and I am starting to sober up hard, the anxiety is cruising on in and I’m not really sure what I am going to do.  I go down to the gym and sit in the cold shower for a long time, I take long deep breaths.  I feel better, I have used some of my techniques to get over my anxiety, so I go back to my desk.  I see there isn’t as much alcohol left in the bottle as I thought, I must have spilt some or misplaced a drink somewhere today.  Oh well, I usually drink a .375 throughout the day, so if I finish it right now, I will technically have less then usual.  I also will be more sober for the ride home, this is a smart decision.  It only 1:30 and I am drunk at work, shit, I could get caught and fired, the only smart decision is to come up with an excuse to go home.

I am a drunk, but I have been able to come up with some good excuses at this point in my life, which one haven’t I used in a while?  I have two “goto” excuses, I had made up that I have prediabetes to my boss.  I had also made up that I get vertigo.  It’s a long story, but I decide to go with vertigo.  I hop in my car and I text my boss that the vertigo is real bad today and that I needed to go home.  This way I wouldn’t have to talk to him and it was a medical excuse.  I’m just hoping one day I don’t need to get this cleared with a doctor, but they are buying it for now.  I mean, I have prediabetes, who would make that up?

I am feeling great now on my drive home, I left at two so there is no traffic and I won’t get pulled over.  My anxiety is gone as I don’t have anything to do for the rest of the day and I have a plan in place so I don’t have to feel the way I do every morning.  I just need to keep enough alcohol in my system so I don’t feel like death, but I can’t get drunk either. Then I remember, last night I filled up my room mates bottle of vodka with water so I could drink it, I will need to replace that.  I should stop at the liquor store, but that is all I will get.  I get to the liquor store and stick to my plan, I buy a liter of vodka and I then head on home.  

Once home, I dump out the liter full of water and fill it back up with vodka.  All I have to do is get through a night of hell and tomorrow will be a new day.  I decide to make myself something to eat, this was a mistake.  Nothing brings on that feeling of anxiety like a meal after drinking all day on an empty stomach.  I will need one drink just to get over this feeling.  I go back to the bottle of vodka and make one drink, I make sure to fill it up to the brim with water, my room mate will never be able to tell if it’s a little bit diluted.  I sip on my drink while playing a game on my kindle fire when my room mate gets home.  I need to act sober enough and not let him know I left work early again.  Thank god he doesn’t ask why I am already home, he probably doesn’t want to know.  We talk for a bit, I make some jokes and all is good.  I have no idea if he is suspicious, he doesn’t act like it.  This is where I usually ask him if he wants to do something I know he won’t want to do, I also need to complete one task to carry on my normalness.  Oh yeah, its paramount that I make up an excuse now for going to bed early.  I ask if he wants to hot tub, he says no.  I take out two birds with one stone, so I take out the dog and play some fetch with him then hop in the hot tub.  

Its about 5pm and those demons for a drink are entering my head, but I shouldn’t.  My friends, my family, my coworkers are worried about me.  If I stick to my plan, I will be on the right track.  I can only have one more to keep alcohol in my system and that is it. I get done hot tubbing and get into my room, how am I going to sneak in this drink with my roommate walking around the house.  I do what I always do, he is a busy guy always walking around, worst case scenario I would have to go to the liquor store to buy some vodka.  He walks outside with the dog, I know I have a few minutes, so I run to the living room grab the bottle and start pouring into a glass.  I look at the bottle and it is half gone, I had to pour more because of the water I had thrown in in earlier, it was really just a premade mixed drink with water.  I then run into the nearby bathroom and fill the bottle back up to the brim. 

I wake up at 4am and go to the bathroom to pee, I look at the bottle in the living room to double check.  If it wasn’t full I could say I had one or two to the roommate.  It was full, I have no idea if there is any alcohol in that bottle, I blacked out again, I will probably find out at 7:30am if there is anything left.  It’s ok, my plan didn’t work yesterday, but it will work today.  Today will be the day that I change.""",53

I turn 25 this month. I went to a university notorious for partying and began drinking in 2012 when I was 17. Through graduation it was normal college partying stuff - I had a good balance of *heavy* drinking on weekends with hard work during the week. I ended up finding work in the same city as my university and this is where things began to snowball. The increase in free time along with having a disposable income and college friends around me brought the drinking into the weekdays. Started with ""let's go for some beers after work"" to playing beer games on weekday evenings. Eventually in the middle of 2017 I found myself drinking 1-2 drinks on 3/5 weekdays and still heavily drinking on weekends.     

After New Year's 2018 I began having these weird spells of dizziness and heart palpitations, and I thought I had a serious medical issue. Ended up spending over $10K in medical bills (America the beautiful) for inconclusive results and doctors telling me I had developed an anxiety disorder. Every night I would get no sleep because every time I felt like I was about to fall asleep I would feel like I was having a heart attack and jerk myself awake.     

Midway through 2018 I found that drinking 3-4 drinks every night (still heavily drinking on weekends) would put me to sleep, though since then every single day was a hangover. I moved into my own place in July and having no housemates made it that much easier to drink without judgement, and by the end of 2018 I was consistently having at least 4 drinks a night.    

Every single day I had a fuzzy head, dizziness, heart palpitations, and wasn't able to focus. Started losing motivation to hang out with my friends or do anything unless it involved drinking. Most days I'd get off work, go home and just start drinking and watching TV. I'm surprised I didn't lose my job as my productivity went to shit, too, not to mention my memory. It kept going up until a few months ago when I accelerated up to 6 drinks a night. Went on a 2 week vacation in early October where I drank from morning until night every single day and when I came back at the end of the month I was up to 7-8 drinks a night.     

Last Sunday night I had about 12 beers before bed and when I woke up I made a decision to just fucking stop. I knew I had a problem when I recognized I was only eating once a day and was probably taking in more alcohol than food. Went to my doctor and got some sedatives to help me sleep and I've been sober for about a week. The shakes/anxiety were really bad the first few nights but I'm sleeping great now, and I cannot remember the last time I felt this good. I am actually motivated to do stuff now - built my desk (I'm in love with it), cleaned my room, and I've been so much more cheerful and motivated. I don't really have an urge to drink - even went to a party with friends and stayed sober the entire time and DD'd for everyone.    

Biked to work a couple days ago and had my first real cardio exercise in what feels like years. I feel good, and even though it's only been a week, and even though I may not have as severe an alcohol history as a lot of other people, I am really proud of myself. My friends all told me I don't actually have an alcohol problem and it's probably just all in my head, but I am really happy I recognized it for myself and made a decision to stop.     

I've got a much clearer head, I feel really happy, and motivated to go out and live my life! I'm going to stop the sedatives this week and replace them with rigorous exercise. IWNDWYT",27

So far I have really weird and vivid dreams and a little restless leg syndrome. 

When I go out to clubs I am not having as much of a good time as I used too. I talk less and I end up hating the place realizing drunk ppl are stupid and rude. 

Food wise I’m snacking like crazy. But ironically I’m eating less overall. 

I’ve also started jogging outside and I’m loving it even though my lungs burn like hell. I haven’t done this in 10 yrs.

What’s really helped me is ordering fake drinks like ordering just a cranberry juice. Nobody notices I’m not drinking. Which is good because I really hate it when people would ask me why I wasn’t drinking. I really felt like I put a damper on things.

I am coming up on 2 years of abstinence from alcohol. I quit drinking because of some serious legal and general life ramifications. When I quit, I started going to AA, got a sponsor, went through the steps. I have since fallen away from AA due to how jesusy it can be--it works for a lot of people but it makes me feel out of place. 

Though I always did other drugs as well, alcohol was always the only one that was a serious problem. I stopped smoking weed a little while before alcohol purely because I don't like weed all that much. Here and there during my sobriety I have taken, in moderate amounts, some other drugs like molly and mushrooms. I truly do not see these as being a problem for me and they don't affect the changes I have made in my life after I quit drinking.

I do, however, still like to get AA chips, because they are shiny and it helps me to have indicators of the milestones I have reached. I have a good friend from college who is now \~4 years sober and has completely bought in to AA. It works for him and I respect his program; however, I don't find AA to be as essential to staying away from alcohol as he does. This friend has told me that I should probably stop collecting chips and might want to consider resetting my sobriety date. 

For whatever reason, this is sort of devastating to me. The thought of re-starting my sobriety timeline makes me feel like I have failed, even though my goal was to quit drinking and I have been 100% successful in that respect. Is it wrong to go pick up my 2-year chip from AA, even though I don't strictly follow AA's principles? Hoping someone out there 1) made it to the end of this and 2) has had a similar experience and some advice. Thx  😘",5

I have 3 spoiled cats that are my whole world. Over the weekend, my oldest cat fell ill. I got her an appointment first thing this morning and, after an Xray and blood tests, got the news that she is at the end, dying of cancer. In her liver. I saw the Xray, her liver is about 3x the normal size, and her lungs are filling with fluid. She's 10 years old, the same age as my daughter, and we've had her since they were both tiny babies. The vet said she won't make it to the end of the month, so I made an appointment to have her euthanised tomorrow morning. My heart is broken, and as I drove home my mind was racing, trying to find a way to make this hurt less. Like, if I bought a bottle of wine on my way there tomorrow, I could chug it when I get home and just pass out. Or maybe I can bum a couple xanax or valium off of someone to knock me out. Instead I've got all my kids coming over tonight for dinner, so we can all be together as a family, and everyone can have a chance to say goodbye. When I was a kid, my parents took my dog to be put down while my brother and I were at school, without even telling us, and I never quite forgave them. So when the vet told me I could take her home for a day or so to prepare, I texted each kid and gave them a choice and they all want to say goodbye so that's the plan. I will not drink tonight, I will keep it together and get through this. And I will not drink tomorrow when it's over.  I have to learn to feel pain like this and not immediately leap to trying to numb it. After almost 3 years sober, feeling feelings is still a really tough obstacle for me.

Also, the irony is not lost on me, that it's in her liver. I abused the hell out of my liver for so many years, got sober, and I'm fine. She's done nothing but be a happy little furball who loves everyone and it's her liver that killed her.

I usually cope with grief ( as well as everything else) by drinking. Instead I made tea and talked it through with the children. Normally by this time of day I would be drunk so I am very grateful that I was clear headed and won't have any thoughts of what if I did something to cause it and did not realize it, such as let him out and forget about him. Also since there was quite a bit of damage done to the car that hit him the RCMP officer at the scene had to inform us about some things and I did not have to worry about smelling like alcohol.

Since then I've been drinking considerably less but the fact is that it is still drinking. 

It was always a 50/50 chance of it ending up a bad night after consuming more than a few beers and I'm still embarrassed over some things but I just have to move passed it.

Last night my SO and I had a couple friends over to bbq and we drank. I got pretty drunk and everything was cool. SO says he didn't get intoxicated and even drank a water bottle between beer. All in all- it was a super fun and relaxed night.

But this morning, holy fucking shit. We both woke up with really bad stinky cotton mouth, the spins all topped off with an intense headache right in the center of my forehead and the temples of his. It felt as if I binged for a straight week. 

That was point 1 I made to myself.
The 2nd was that the whole apartment was dirty. Food was left out all night and there were cans everywhere. Bunch of dirt in the floor that was tracked in. 

The 3rd final straw that made it clear to me that I did not want to drink not even a little bit was when I was cleaning up. I got dizzy and couldn't catch my breath from sweeping. I'm fucking 26 and not morbidly obese. I should not be having physical problems from sweeping. 

SO is on board with me. Plus we gotta better shit to do. Friday night we took his son out to a restaurant. We didn't drink one sip. It was the best time ever too.

Typically 10-14 hour days that leave me sooo ready to get home and relax at the end of it. 

I always seem to think having a stiff drink at the end of the day will be a great way to unwind and treat myself after surviving another day on the job. My rational mind knows this is not true - the one drink always turns into two or three.. or more. And *even if* I was able to just have the one, it makes me sleep shitty, is the main contributor to my stalling weightloss, costs me $$$, and more that are definitely not ""treats"". 

I've tried replacing this with tea, kombucha, some sort of relaxing exercise like yoga, or a snack that I enjoy but after a few days I always end up reaching for a tall boy at the store instead. 

How to I convince my idiot brain to stop viewing alcohol as a reward at the end of the day?",11

Suffice to say I didn't take any more that night, and last night (Sunday) I just took the dayquil instead with some melatonin to aid with sleep.  

I'm just wondering what everyone else's experiences and/or thoughts about it are?  Obviously if it was still in the first few weeks of my recovery I'd be furious with myself.

I was about a centimeter away from ordering a beer while out celebrating my fiancé and his dads birthday this weekend out in Astoria; my favorite tiny beer town, but I didn’t. I went into immediate anxiety while holding the beer menu and had to leave the pub because I was so overwhelmed, I started to cry.
The previous week I went to the doctor to have labs done and see what sort of havoc I had done to myself this past year.
That being said, 2019 is the first year since I started drinking in high school where I have gone the longest consecutive days without drinking. March-May and now 60 days complete. My doctor said she was impressed with how well I’ve been taking care of myself. My labs show liver and kidney function are completely healthy. For as many consecutive non drinking days I’ve had this year I’ve followed them up with nonstop month long benders to make up for lost time. What a huge relief.
The easy part is not drinking. The hard part is not drinking. The anxiety I felt Saturday was a reminder of the withdrawals. I battled my silent battle and then Sunday was easy and I’m on day 61 without opening a can first thing after my fiancé leaves the house at 630am because 1 is too many and 12 is never enough and there is no stopping.

I was never a normal drinker. I never drank to unwind or loosen up. I never had just one. What I sought every time was oblivion. Didn’t matter if I was at a party or alone at the laundromat; if I was drinking, I was doing it not just to get buzzed but to get trashed, to lose myself, to let someone or something else steer the ship even if only for a little while.

For a long time, I thought if I just spaced out my drinking, as long as it was only every once in a while and not every day, as long as my hands didn’t shake in the morning, then I was fine, I wasn’t one of them. For a long time, that worked. I would black out, do something stupid, let enough days, weeks, or months pass to cover the shame and allow me to do it all over again. Eventually, shame stopped being a powerful enough motivator to space it out. I became seasoned and confident in my ability to wake up at 7 am and go to work with my head pounding, emptied of the memories of the night before. My hands still didn’t shake. Sure, it was most days, but it wasn’t every day. I still faithfully waited until 5 pm if it was a weekday. I was fine. I wasn’t one of them. 

When I finally made the decision to quit, it (thankfully) wasn’t because of one big, catastrophic event but the accumulation of ten years’ worth of shame and regret, of friends distancing themselves from me, of dark thoughts alcohol was more often than not unmasking instead of masking. It wasn’t even intended to be a permanent change. Six months, I told myself. I needed to stick it out for six months. It was long enough to feel meaningful but not long enough to intimidate me into throwing up my hands. But at the end of the six months, something was different. I had started to feel like maybe I could win this game of chicken. I liked that feeling. I still do. 

I would be lying if I said the thought of relapsing doesn’t still terrify me. It does. I would also be lying if I said I no longer have any desire to seek oblivion at the bottom of the bottle, just one more time. I do. It probably always will. I probably always will. I can continue to learn to accept this. I have my 1,000 days. In the grand scheme of things, I realize it’s not much, but to me, it’s a hell of a lot.",75

I’m working on my sobriety. I’m wondering if anyone has something physical they carry or use to remind them it’s not worth a drink at that moment. I thought about maybe a necklace with a saint medallion or something but didn’t really want that as I’m not super religious. Is there anything someone has used to optimistically remind themselves its worth it to be sober?

Not to be mean or anything, I just find many reminders, such as the patron saint of alcoholism, to be very pessimistic, which ultimately makes me just want to drink more.

Obviously a tough question. Just wondering if anyone has found something they keep in their pocket or something to remind them they’ll be happier if they abstain.

I really miss the self that loved to chat with friends (or strangers) over beers. I know that this is better for me but it is such a struggle to feel like it’s worth it. I feel isolated whether I’m around people or not. I feel like I can observe my emotions more clearly, which is great, but expressing myself is painfully difficult when it used to feel easy.

Argued a little with DH although it was a lot less than usual because I'm not irritable and foggy from drinking so I didn't play the pettiness game. The bickering set me on edge a little and I actually said out loud, ""No matter how much we fight, I'm not drinking tonight."" He asked me what that had to do with drinking and I told him how some people use conflict as a reason to drink. As in, they'll create conflict where there isn't any so they get stressed enough to justify wanting to drink. He seemed to understand and we went on to have a pretty positive weekend. He drank 2 beers on Thursday and 3 on Saturday night but that's a pretty big cutback for him. I had to remind him that I don't want him watching our son if he's had more than 1 beer and he seemed to understand. I know that he's chugged a beer while I'm in the shower so he can get a buzz faster and on less alcohol.... That was probably the toughest part of the weekend. The best part was that we actually went and did stuff two days in a row! We went and got a Christmas outfit and a coat for our 3mo. son and we went to the park on Sunday! It was so magical feeling like an actual person.


DH starts therapy on Thursday and I'm feeling really hopeful for the first time in a long time. I've had a lot of therapy over the past couple of years and right now we can't afford it money wise or time wise for me to go, too so for right now I feel confident that with this subreddit and going to online meetings I'll be okay.

I kept drinking on Saturday and couldn't even think about food, so I didn't eat again.
By Sunday morning it had all caught up with me, but I figured it wasn't going to be that bad of a hangover (not sure why) and I didn't finish puking until they gave me a strong anti-nausea pill at the hospital at 3:30am this morning. I decided to go because the pain from puking in my throat became unbearable and my throat was starting to bleed.
I haven't puked since but I am having terrible gastric reflux and my throat is in so much pain it's hard to swallow even just water.

I can't keep living like this. I isolated myself all weekend but I made a few terrible phone calls to my significant other and my uncle. 
My S/O and I are on the rocks as we speak and my Uncle and I may never speak again.

I don't know what I'm doing. My entire body hurts and I feel like a moron for letting it get to that point. All I want to do is chug water and sleep but the stress is keeping me awake and I can only swallow the smallest of sips.

I had a great birthday weekend and I spent yesterday relaxing and reading, with a round of exercise thrown in for good measure. We got a new washer and dryer and I spent over an hour trying to get the stupid things connecting to my phone (they are smart machines 🙄) and figuring out how to use them. So, I spent my pre-bedtime swearing at LG, ill-prepared instruction manuals and technology in general. And right now, the thought of that is making me smile like crazy, 1) because people getting angry at machines look hilarious and I’m sure I was no exception; and 2) because it was still a way better use of my time (and more enjoyable, oddly) than drinking and feeling sorry for myself.

This was huge for me, and really woke me up to just how much alcohol I'd been consuming all those years. I felt great - more energy, increased mental clarity, an organic happiness I hadn't felt since getting married 3 years earlier, all was great!

Fast forward to this fall, and I began to play with the idea of cutting out regular weekend drinking as well. There were times that I was still buying wine on a Friday night out of habit alone, not with any actual desire to drink. 

At the same time, ever since cutting back my drinking so drastically, it's like my true natural biology has kicked in to overdrive and I'm now in a near-constant state of baby fever. 

I haven't had a drink at all the last 3 weekends, and during this time my husband and I have started our first attempts at trying to conceive. This past week my period was late which is super uncommon for me, and so I started to seriously consider the idea that I could be pregnant right away and so obviously stuck to my new change of not drinking on the weekend. 

Last night my period came accompanied by much disappointment, and given that it's a long weekend here in Canada, I won't lie, I had a fleeting moment where I considered buying a bottle of wine to drown out my disappointment.

But after scrolling this sub to ride out that idea, I put on a movie on Netflix and mentally re-hashed the importance of an alcohol-free lifestyle for making myself succeed at conceiving that baby I'm dreaming of having.

It was a set back but I got back up that pony and told myself I will not be upset. I got hired on the spot as a PCA to start that journey of my life. I want to go to school for addiction counseling because I am an addict and want to help myself by helping others in need.

Things are looking so bright for my future, and alcohol will not be apart of that future.  

Achievements since quitting:
—
working out every day (feel amazing and self-confidence is through the roof)
—
eating 3-5 meals a day (I never used to eat and am gaining weight and filling out)
—
working two jobs (my career path has only started but my attitude has changed completely)
—
sex life has gotten much better (I really didn’t have a sex life because of my drinking habits, and just didn’t feel like it)
—
I have my own apartment for the first time ever in my life.
— 
Paid off all my credit cards but wracked them up again but not on booze and drugs but on items that were absolutely needed. So a budget will happen but confident things will be paid off.
—
Normal poops!! Cannot stress that enough, I’m a pooping machine and it’s regular (TMI I know)
—
I’m happy, I’m drawing again, reading, playing sober video games (I do smoke pot a couple times a week though)

I want to tell each and everyone of you how much I appreciate this group, this support group has really helped me when others haven’t. NA, AA, counseling, did not work.

I was heading to detox before I checked into residential treatment.  I have been drinking and using since I was 16 and was now almost 40.  Id managed to hold a job the entire time and was good at it so I surely couldn't be a real alcoholic.  It was at about 10 days into treatment I wanted to leave, I was fine and didn't need anymore help. My counselor asked why I wanted to go, I said I just didn't want to be there. He said ""So help me understand. You don't want to stay in this multi million dollar cabin that has a chef to cook for you, an activities coordinator that chauffeurs you to events, and being surrounded by a bunch of people that like you for what reason?""  It was at this moment I realized that even though I was in paradise I wanted to leave so I could drink.  I had that moment where I realized I was truly an alcoholic. 

&#x200B;

Over the next few weeks I really decided to take advantage of what was being offered.  I learned more about me than I cared to and figured out I had a bit of PTSD from a series of plane crashes. It was nearly 20 years later and that still affected me but why I thought.  Turns out not dealing with emotions does not make them go away, they lay dormant and strike at random. I have learned how to deal with pain and sorrow.

&#x200B;

If you wrote my last year on paper you'd think it doesn't sound good at all. I lost my job, in may my dog died, in September my father died. All of these would have been great excuses for a relapse but I know deep down that its not what I want and certainly not what those around me want. Especially my father who fought so hard to get me into treatment. 

&#x200B;

The other night I was at a meeting and a guy got up to get his 30 day chip, I had a flashback to rehab and remember thinking about people picking up 90 day chips wondering how the fuck they made it that long.  I am not sure where my recovery shifted but as I sit here with a year I can confidently say that I see people getting 5 and 10 year chips and think to myself that its just a matter of time till I have mine.  

&#x200B;

With that I just wanted to share a bit of hope to those of you struggling, if I can do it I know you can too.",71

All the things I think I was subconsciously drinking to forget. All the cringe-inducing moments that used to only sneak up on me in quiet moments or the middle of the night. And what I've discovered... is that they are ALL alcohol related. Like without fail. It's absurd how consistent it is: 

\- The time I was supposed to help a friend move but told her I was sick. 

\- The time I tried to kiss a married co-worker at a conference.

\- The time I met a strange man from an app (30 years my senior) for sex.  

\- Chain smoking in my non-smoking apartment, risking eviction. 

\- The time I fell down and threw up on my birthday (THIS YEAR) in front of good friends.

Anyway, you get the picture. The point is, that before getting sober, I could make you a super compelling argument that my drinking was normal. Mostly because I thought I was hiding it well. I even had myself convinced most days that it was not that big a deal — that quitting really wouldn't make that big a difference. But now, I'm keeping the list of incidents like the above. So whenever one of these cringe-y moments does spring on me, I write it down and it just becomes more useful evidence for why my current life is and has the chance to be so much better. 

It's a very helpful tool so far, so I wanted to share it. It helps handle the memory (because I'm turning it toward the good), and it keeps me duly reminded of why I can't go back.

My concern is that when I hang out with my friends we usually drink a lot of beer, and because where I live beer is very cheap, we usually drink around 10-12 pints of beer, sometimes even more and find myself spending only 5-6 Euros. However my concern is that I don't feel like I get really wasted, just like light-headed and in the flow of the conversations we have and very rarely find myself having a hangover the next day. And we usually do this 2-3 times a week so I've set some ground rules such as only drinking beer or wine and never alone.

I'm concerned about that because I don't have a problem about drinking alone, but I can't see myself skip one of these meetups at the bar since I very much enjoy drinking with my friends or family.

Do you guys think this is the way you fall into alcoholism and I'm just setting theses rules to make myself feel better based on personal experience or people you know?

Edit : Thank you sharing your thoughts and helping me acknowledge the problem, and give me the keys to deal with it from now on. I feel better in a way, now that I know how detrimental it can be and the fact that I can accept that I have a drinking problem thanks to you. 
I'm grateful to all of you for giving me what I needed to stop, as a I feel pretty confident about myself stoping, however I'll have to force myself really hard during those reunions.

Here's how it went.

First off, booze did not taste very good. A beer that used to be one of my favorites was honestly kind of gross. I guess my palate has changed. Also I'm now aware of how awful alcohol smells. Second, it really wasn't that fun. I didn't get much of a mood lift, except for maybe 30 minutes the first night. Third, a cough that my immune system had actually been successful (for once) at fighting off when I was sober, came back. So now I'm sick. Fourth, the skin around my mouth and nose is already dry and red again, and I'm getting nosebleeds. Fifth, I don't really remember yesterday and it feels like the whole day passed in the blink of an eye. Sixth, I undid some progress I had finally made on my physical fitness (gave up my six-pack for a six-pack). Seventh, my sleep is no longer very restful and I can't stay asleep. Eighth, I don't feel happy. At all.

So im f(22) and over 5 months ago i quit drinking altogether. Alcohalism runs in my family and honestly i drank since i was really young. Younger then youd ever expect someone to start. Throughout my teens it got worse and caused a lot of ugly in my life. A lot of black outs that ill never remember. 
After quitting my life is actually turning on a flip to be more positive. Im focusing on my mental and physical wellbeing, finding my passions the whole 9. My dad, who im living with currently, is an alcohalic. Drinks damn near everyday. Hes very functional with a good job and everything. And for now this is my only option.. Im seeking mental health help and its a slow process but im planning on moving out asap. The problem is that last night he cooked dinner. Beef stew. It smelled a little funky when i got some but tasted alright. I was hungry and mowed only to find out an hour later that he put beer in it. Im not sure how much but i think quit a bit. Hes also braught me to a bar with my step mom last month. Even after saying no, i guess it was a grill as well so not too bad right? Everybody there was drinking and it was tempting. Theres even small comments he'll make picking apart things and looking down on my sobriety.
But last night after everything I shot him a quick message saying ""hey, please dont put any beer in our food or else i really cant eat it. Id like if youd respect those wishes."" He flipped tf out. Literally. Saying that i was just bitching at him and it was only 'cooking wine'. When i know it wasnt.. I heard him tell my step mom he had put some beer in and it boiled out. I honestly think hes trying to get me to drink. Trying to undermine all the hard work ive put into this.  I almost feel as though all the sobriety went down the drain last night because i ate a freaking bowl of soup. What do you guys think? Am i overreacting? Am i starting over with my progress? 

One more thing is when i went to go get a bowl of the stew.. He almost added more beer in not thinking about the fact i was right there (he was pretty drunk) i didnt think much of it at the time i thtought maybe he was just going to take a drink and he made a wrong motion with his arm...

I don't like the feeling of being too drunk. I'd say I've only gotten drunk as fuck on a few occasions - which is why I can't tell if I blacked out or almost died. I decided to stop drinking after this event because it scared the shit out of me.

One day I hadn't slept for 2 days and was depressed so I chugged alcohol. Probably around 13 shots within an hour. I was asleep pretty fast, and woke up and wiped something off my phone, which I later learned was vomit. I'd pissed myself as well.

My girlfriend and brother got home and apparently left me alone for long periods of time (thanks), but told me I was arrousable, responsive, forming cohesive thoughts, that I'd walked down the hallway unassisted, and that I was blurting out really stupid shit while laying down. I remember some things, but definitely had significant memory loss. I woke up fully conscious after an 11 hour nap, with no nausea or breathing problems. My memory was pretty consistent after 5 hours.

The time that I drank between the time I was discovered was around one hour, so it was an hour maximum before I woke up and wiped vomit off my phone, which I remember every detail of doing.

Aside from choking on my own vomit, was I running a serious risk of dying here, or was I just very, very, very drunk? My girlfriend had 2 similar cases where she blacked out and threw up, but was arrousable, responsive, and showed no signs of respiratory depression. I'm not sure what exactly ""black out drunk"" means - I had large lapses in memory, and was told I said things I didn't remember saying.

Posted a week ago about my decision to stop drinking due to the number of problems it was giving me both physically and mentally. So this is a followup.

First things first I've managed to stay sober for my first weekend in five years and the dreaded Sunday night shakes and Monday morning anxiety is nowhere to be found and I can't believe how much of a difference that has made to my mood in general

I went out to the Leeds game over the weekend and stayed on the soft drinks. I still enjoyed myself immensely watching Leeds win even though my mates we're drunk as all hell around me but funnily enough didn't bother me in the slightest. In fact, through sober eyes, I was watching some of their behaviours with a sense of displeasure and thinking is this really what I acted like. Think alot of that has to do with Allen Carr's book and I will be re-reading that this week just to reinforce my mindset. I did notice I smoked a lot more than I normally would but I think that was because it gave me something to do but one thing at a time. I will sort my smoking out later

Off to go watch Blood Red Shoes this weekend with my family so looking forward to my first music gig I can remember and not have to spend most of it at the bar queuing or in the pisser every half an hour after breaking the seal

Cheers for all the advice given to me last week really did help a lot.",5
2019-11-11 04:34:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/duq4bz/recovering_alcoholics_and_relationships/,Recovering Alcoholics and Relationships,"Hello! I am on here in the hopes that perhaps someone might be able to give me a little advice on recovering alcoholics and relationships. I have been dating a recovering alcoholic (five years sober) and we have moved in together. We have a lot in common intellectually, our values are similar, what we want out of life is similar, and we share a lot of interests. But we are struggling. I can’t say I know an awful lot about addiction so I am hoping to gain some wisdom. 

We struggle a lot with control. He is very disciplined in his day-to-day life: how he eats, what order he does tasks in, his exercise routine. This is often in conflict with me as I often bend to how he wishes to spend his day. We often can’t go to events for too long because he gets hungry/tired/emotionally depleted. He makes large decisions often without consulting me. He largely perseverates on tasks he needs to accomplish which means he pretty much ignores me until they are. And when I ask to deviate even slightly from the plan, he often becomes upset. For example: We checked out of hotel one morning. We wanted to eat breakfast in a crowded breakfast area and I wanted to brush my teeth after eating. He became very upset when I suggested we leave the bags in the room to avoid inconveniencing other people and so I could brush my teeth. He felt that was going to tack on time to our drive so it he became upset. It added a minuscule amount of time (maybe) so I couldn’t understand why it needed to be so regimented. 

I spoke to my therapist about this who knows he’s a recovering alcoholic. She said it seems like he moved from one addiction to another: the intense control. And she said that some of the situations I describe almost appear to be obsessive compulsive personality disorder. I asked him about it and he said he feels like if he doesn’t put this routine in, he’s afraid he’ll drink. 

I love him and I want to be with him, but the control he needs over every aspect of his (and this our) day/life creates an enormous amount of anxiety and stress for me as I am unable to confine myself to his expectations and his compulsiveness to complete tasks (he calls noise) means I’m often forgotten until the end of the day when he’s finished “the noise.”

I suppose my questions are: Is this a common coping mechanism in recovering alcoholics? If yes, is this something he NEEDS to stay sober? Or is it something that, perhaps with some therapy, he might be able to overcome? Or is this something else entirely like obsessive compulsive personality disorder.

Again, any wisdom would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",3

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

2019-11-11 03:17:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dupfml/after_444_days_i_drank/,After 444 days I drank.,"Two days ago I drank a six pack of 7.5% beer. This was after 444 days of sobriety. I cannot give a complete explanation as to why I did it, because i'm still not really sure. It wasn't a spur of the moment thing. I wasn't having a particularly bad day. It felt like I had something to proof, but i'm not sure what. The funny thing is, after making the decision hours earlier, when is was in the store it took effort to buy the beer. I had to not think about it to be able to do it. There have been a couple of very hard moments in the 444 days of sobriety and this wasn't one of them. It was just a decision, not really a feeling attached.

Well, it wasn't great, and that is exactly what I thought it would be. The ""fuck it"" moment was nice and for about 20 minutes the ""rise"" was really nice. After that, mweh. It was the same old ""better drink some more to feel the 'rise' again"", which didn't happen.

The waking up at 3 in the night was just like I remembered it. Headache and regret. 

But I don't regret it now. The badge has been reset, my resolve has been replenished. And the wanting to find some form of moderate drinking has been put in it's place once more. I have shaken the urge to moderately drink by drinking. Which is ridicoulus ofcourse, I know that, but somehow it made sense this once.

Thank you for reading. I will not drink with you today.

It hardly seems like any time has passed at all, but maybe that's because I was in such a dazed, low level functioning state when I stopped drinking. 

Anyhow, not sure what day I'm on - it's not a big number, yet my kids are noticeably happier, better taken care of, exercised, eating healthy and have their teeth brushed more frequently. They definitely, even at their young ages, appreciate a cleaner house, a mom that gets library books everyday and puts their toys up before the puppy eats them. The dog even notices and I'm now his person (unfortunately).

It almost feels like I've always been sober. 

Old shameful thoughts of the dumbass shit I've done while drunk, do poke into my mind often because just about anything reminds of something I'd rather forget. Yet I'm handling those better and not letting it get to me. I have to love myself so my kids have a great mom. That's cheesy, but it's true. Self loathing = alcohol = more self loathing. 

It can get better really quickly, so please have hope, if you're out there feeling as hopeless as I did.

I'm currently at 110 days sober and I feel like I'm losing my mind. Its not fear of relapsing that's making me lose it. I don't know what it is. 

When I first began my sobriety, I had felt like a rollercoaster of emotions with some really good, happy, easy days, and some really hard depressive days which I drank non alcoholic beer just to keep sane. But overall the vibes were good, my mood had improved and I was happy. I was more like myself than I had been in years.

But for the past couple of weeks I've just been fucking depressed. I feel empty. I snap so easily, I anger quickly. I feel like my brain is working slower than when I was a drunk. I can't even do basic mental math without having to stop and really try. It doesn't make any sense to me that I feel dumber sober than when I was drinking a 12 pack a night.

I always thought that the longer I stayed sober the better I'd feel, but I feel like I've peaked after a couple of months and now I feel crappy for no reason. 

Although I feel like this, becoming sober has been the best decision I've made in a long time. I never want to be the man that I was when I was drunkard again.

I really needed to get this off my chest so thank you all for being here. This community had helped me alot with my recovery and I greatly appreciate everyone who posts in here. It's comforting to know that there are others who are on the same journey with me. You guys make me feel less alone in the world.

I drank a little bit of it and then remembered my sobriety. I felt kind of bad but figured I've already been drinking it, I should enjoy it even if I don't like the taste. I didn't finish it, but not because I didn't really want to, I kind of actively chose not to, to see if I could drink without needing to finish it. A few hours passed in my dream, and I was at a bar. I was offered a few shots and decided to take them. Apparently in, in dream world, one beer and then 2 shots several hours later gets you plastered! I immediately felt  guilty for throwing seven months of sobriety down the drain, but I remembered when reading This Naked Mind, the author suggested that when you drink you should try an analyze and really think about how the alcohol is making you feel. I felt a little euphoric, pretty giddy and buzzed, for about 20 minutes. I felt really good and high, and then I got a really bad headache and the spins. I knew I threw away 7 months of sobriety for a 20 minute buzz and it made me feel like shit. I got the spins really really badly and ended up falling down on the sidewalk. I'm surprised I didn't throw up since I always get sick when I drink too much in real life haha. I saw another drunk girl stumbling onto the ground, and offered her an uber home. She got into her car and wrecked into a bunch of parked cars like 5 times in a residential neighborhood.... It's crazy that I'm using sober skills and coping tactics in my dreams! I fucking love This Naked Mind and recommend it to anyone who wants to stop drinking.  It's so deeply embedded into my subconscious that it's showing up in my dreams.... I listened to the audio-book maybe 3 times, and it completely changed the way I thought about alcohol. I thought a life without drinking would be miserable and I'd always be missing out. After listening to the book a few times, I realize and believe and truly know that alcohol has never been my friend, it's always been my worst enemy. I don't feel like I'm missing out, I feel like I'm living my life more than ever before. It 100% changed my perspective and changed my subconscious views on alcohol. Sometimes when I'm out at a show, or bored, I'll have a craving for alcohol and I think about it and break it down. Why do I want a drink right now? What would it add to my night and do for me? Generally, it's because I'm anxious and uncomforatble, or want to fit in or have fun like everyone else around me is... Nothing that spending 5+ dollars on poison could fix. I usually write in my notes on my phone, tell myself that it'll just awaken my alcohol craving, cause me to get drunk and act like a jackass, waste a bunch of money, and write about why I'm feeling the way that I am and that alcohol won't fix it, it will only make it worse. It squashes the temptation and reminds me of the reality of booze really quickly, that it's not the nectar of the Gods, it's not the elixir of life, it won't make you more fun, classier, it won't get you laid.... it's not anything but extremely processed ethanol, poison, expensive, and pointless!! And frankly it doesn't taste very good.... Maybe if I had remembered to break down my urge at the beginning of my dream, I could have done something fun and exciting instead of ordering a beer and two shots.... I just wanted to share with you guys, I always wake up feeling a bit panicked from dreams where I break my sobriety, but not this time! More so amazed haha! IWNDWT.",1

My mom was recently hospitalized and her life expectancy was basically 5 years with dramatic change (lose weight, get more active, and stop smoking.) That sent me into a spiral.

I'm trying ( with doctor's approval) to decrease the amount I drink slowly to avoid withdrawal.

Since my mother's diagnosis I haven't been able to self monitor like I was before. Things in my relationship with my boyfriend of 9 years, and roommate/best friend of 7 years is changing. I hate myself. I hate who I am becoming. I want to be okay, I want to be myself again.

I thought I'd share how those days went. Some were not so easy.

Wednesday (night before the trip): lots of anxiety despite feeling in recent weeks that I have a better handle on how to navigate my weekends sober. Not having work to do is a big trigger for me, and I have a problem with relaxing/boredom. That's when I drink, and knowing I don't have to be at work until the following Tuesday was triggering me. I power cleaned my home so that it would be nice and ready when I came back. I exhausted myself so I could pass out.

Thursday (day of trip): I slept in, got a nice work out in, made a nice meal, packed and then left for the airport with friends (relaxed!). We arrived to New York late evening, but were able to find a nice Italian place. Despite being surrounded by wines, the food was so good and my friends weren't drinking so I wasn't triggered. Sparkling water'd it up, got a good night's rest and was happy to wake up Friday full of energy.

Friday: We were pretty busy during the day hitting up all the spots each of us wanted to see, and after a Broadway show in the evening, decided to check out some gay bars because why not. I was triggered here. My friends ordered drinks and were dancing, I kept an eye on our jackets at our table, browsed this subreddit by searching ""vacation"", and texted with another friend who knows I'm sober. Everyone seemed to be getting hammered, and the shots guy kept dancing around me with Jell-O shots. It wasn't my scene at all, I almost told him to fuck off, but my friends were enjoying themselves. I stuck it out for a little while, trying to make the best of it, but threw in the towel early. They wanted to keep going. Knowing that alcohol pushes our bodies further than they want to go, I felt no shame about walking back to our hotel early and getting some rest. It did take a while to fall asleep. I felt some sadness and deprivation, but reminded myself I'd feel better, and proud, in the morning, and that if I were getting drunk in that club and making out with some rando, that I'd beat myself up for it in the morning when I woke up in that anxiety-ridden, brain-fogged haze.

Saturday: Woke up feeling proud, yet slightly tired. Food -> Central Park -> Nintendo Store -> food -> designer stores -> food -> Empire State Building -> treated myself to some Korean skin care items in Koreatown with the money I would have spent on drinks Friday night had I been drinking -> ice skating -> comedy show. At the comedy show the headliner threw in that she was sober during a joke. It wasn't much, but I smiled knowing that I'm not alone despite the two drink/item minimum in the club. I drank ginger beer, ate Pringles and interacted with the comedians when they posed questions to the audience.  There was a group of belligerent drunk women in the back, (like falling down, lap dancing each other while a set was going on, being made fun of by the host and chastised by the staff) and I said a silent prayer of gratitude that I was not making a fool of myself in front of 100 people like they were.

Sunday (today): Touristy things, food and an early arrival at the airport. Home now, happy I made it through.

All in all I'll say that I only felt deprived those two nights: the night before the trip and the night at the bar. The rest of the trip we did so much I didn't have a chance to be bored. The big takeaway for me is knowing what to do in those situations. The first night, I cleaned and exhausted myself so I could go to sleep and start the trip. The night in the bar with music so loud that the only activities were throwing drinks back, dancing and making out, I knew I was too tired to dance, so I got the hell out of there (gracefully) when it felt like enough was enough because that was the best choice for me. My friends still had a great time.

Also, I'm so tired right now. Like a good tired, but tired. I know for a fact I would not have gotten half of those things done if I were hungover. I would have slept in and told my friends I'd meet up with them later, and then I'd want to drink again the next evening so I wouldn't feel so physically drained. And I'd hate myself for the money spent. Spiral.

I share this for anyone else who needs to search ""vacation"" on this sub.

50 days tomorrow!

Edit: Also, remember to treat yourself! Popping into that Korean skincare store, and giving myself permission to use the money I would have spent on poison on something fun and healthy for me gave me a great surge of joy! If you go through hell one night, then definitely treat yourself the next day for pulling through!",11

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK which have touched us this past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about secondhand or through the media. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

I went out for dinner last night with a couple of sober friends. The topic of how we’d screwed up in our professional lives and financially came up, very organically. One person was talking about their stresses and regrets in those areas, and then me and the other person had to chip in with our own regrets and struggles in those regards.

What was notable for me was that each of us was hard on ourselves, but compassionate and understanding of the others. They seemed to think that I’m nowhere near the screwup that I think I am. I felt the same way about them.

It has gotten me thinking about the ways that I talk about and to myself. I can be pretty hard on myself. I have unrealistic expectations for myself. My best is never good enough. I’m way harder on myself than I am on anyone else. And this seems to be a fairly common trait among people with drinking problems, so I thought that it would be a good topic for AoK this week.

I would like to be kinder in how I talk to myself and about myself. Any thoughts or suggestions, SD? Or any other AoKs that you’d like to share about this week? I’m all ears!",24

But then the liquor store closes, and I'm alright. When I don't have the option of going out to buy a bottle, I'm completely fine and at ease. It surprises me every time it happens.

I said again that I wasn’t going to have any and my other friend lit up and thought it was because I was pregnant. I laughed and said “I wish that was why, but it’s more for my own mental health right now.” They totally understood and that was the end of that. The rest of the night went perfectly!

What started as an intentional “day off” from drinking slowly turned into 2... and then 3... and now a full week, including the first weekend I have been sober in god knows how long. I won’t go into detail about my history with alcohol for the time being, but it certainly hasn’t been pretty. I honestly didn’t think I would make it this far, nor did I have any intention to.

However, over the last 7-8 days, the nightly panic attacks have slowly subsided and I have noticed some subtle, yet significant changes in my behavior that bring me fleeting moments of what I believe to be joy or at least contentment. While the reality of sobriety remains bombarding and overwhelming at times, I have made the commitment (albeit difficult) to once again not drink today.

Tonight I’ve found solace in a quote from Annie Grace’s book, ‘This Naked Mind’:

“You cannot find peace by avoiding life.” -Virginia Woolf

Thank you, SD, for being a source of inspiration and encouragement for those like me who are just fumbling around, still trying to figure this whole thing out.

No more breaks or convincing myself I'm in control.  No more Friday nights buying a bottle of wine, saying I'll only have a glass or two, then finish it, pickup a 6 pack of beer and finish that too.  I'm not an every day drinker, but when I have one I get the itch and will wake up either hungover or keep going on an awful weekend bender.  It's happening more often and getting worse and I'm really sick of it.  This morning I woke up too hungover to meet up with friends all because I thought I could handle a glass of wine on Friday.

This year I managed to do dry January with a group of friends, and also gave up drinking for lent with a friend.  I'm not religious but I wanted an excuse to not drink for another month.  These were the best two months of this year by far and I want my life to be like that, but now every time I've tried to go on a break since I slip up, without someone else not drinking with me it's so easy to say it's fine to grab a beer that will turn into another weekend bender.

I found this sub this morning stuck in bed hungover and have been reading posts all day (I'm very much a reddit lurker) and really want to give this a serious shot.  I think it's great that there is a community out here offering support.

I don't know where to go from here though.  I've kept my issue with alcohol pretty secret from friends and family, and without an excuse like lent or dry January I don't know what to say when I'm not drinking.  I'm worried about going home for the holidays and explaining why I'm not drinking at Thanksgiving or Christmas, my Mom already worries too much about me as it is and I'd rather not add my struggle with alcohol to the pile. 

I really like the taste of beer and trying new drinks and cocktails and it's not fair that seemingly everyone else I encounter can enjoy a drink or two without going overboard.  But these are the cards I've been dealt with and I really want to make this positive life change.

I'm really happy I've found this community and got to vent like this.  I feel awful today, but at the same time I'm really excited about a future booze free life!

I won't drink with any of you today!",4

2019-11-10 20:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dulbjy/trying_to_stop_hating_myself_today/,Trying to stop & hating myself today,"This is my first ever reddit post after lurking on many different subs & reading here for at least a year. I’ve been actively trying to stop drinking for about a month, trying to moderate for at least 6 months, and drinking in a way that’s significantly impacting my life and relationships for at least 2 years. 

I’m a mom of two young kids. I’ve always enjoyed social drinking, and definitely overdid it many times in my 20s. After having my 2nd child, both under 3, and staying home full time with them while my husband worked 60ish hours a week, my drinking became problematic. 

I feel so ashamed to even write out my story, but I don’t know what else to do at this point. I started drinking a few times a week in the evenings vs just the weekends, and drinking different things out of our liquor cabinet. I’d go to the store & replace what I drank at the end of each week, vowing it would just be this time, and it became a weekly trip to the store to refill what I had drank. I was sneaking around and lying to my husband. I didn’t drink during the day, or drive after drinking, or put my kids in danger to my knowledge, but it was getting increasingly problematic. 

One of my most shameful moments 2 years ago was when I embarrassingly drank too much at a Birthday get together at my in-laws, tried to go downstairs for a snack in the middle of the night, and fell down the stairs. I practically landed on my head and had bumps and bruises all over my head and body. This ended with a hospital trip, and endless shame and embarrassment. Yet I still didn’t stop drinking. Although that moment is the worst, I’ve had so many more shameful and embarrassing moments. Waking up not remembering what happened and frantically checking my phone to see who I’ve texted, called or googled. Random bruises on my body, feeling sick, anxious, depressed and full of self loathing. 

Fast forward to present day. My marriage is in such a place of distrust, and I know I can’t keep going like this. It’s horrible  for everyone, most of all myself. About a month ago I started going to AA meetings, although I don’t really feel like it’s the right fit for me. It does help somewhat, and keeps me sort of accountable. I stopped drinking nightly. In that month, I’ve slipped up 3 times, with last night being the worst. I was just hanging out at my sister’s, watching a movie, but the stress of the day and my kids being demanding etc .. in a weak impulsive moment I snuck to her basement and drank a few shots of rum. I don’t remember much of the movie, tucking my son in, or eating a bunch of food & making a mess in their guest bed. I feel so stupid even writing that out, and just so fed up with myself. 

I’m a good and present parent the majority of the time, have a master’s degree and do well at a job I love .. my life probably looks close to perfect to outsiders. But in reality I’m ruining everything, anxious, depressed and hate myself for what I’ve done and continue doing. 

If you’ve read this far, thanks so much. I feel so lost, ashamed and angry. I need more support. I can’t imagine a future without ever again drinking socially.. but I definitely can’t continue like this. I just want to live a normal life.",35

I just meditated for 5 minutes sitting on the ground in a quiet place and I am more at peace. I do not need to be perfect; there is no perfect when it comes to recovery.

In fact, perfection is unatainable. I drank to deal with trying to force myself to do everything very well, to deal with depression (it is a depressant! Why make it worse by making it better for a few hours?), to deal with existenstial issues, and to deal with life in general. I can do fewer things well.

I am only human and that is okay. I will be better one day at a time. I have been here before and I will get to a year again and then beyond. I am only three or so weeks in. Yet I am okay; I am surviving. It is up and down emotionally for me and PAWS is awful, yet I can make this work. 

Why do I care so much about whether people like my posts or comments? I think it is because I want to help but also feel validated. It does not matter what anyone thinks as long as I am being genuine and kind. This is a fear I have when posting and commenting. I am no a wuss but at the same time definitely not immune to criticism or social rejection just like everyone else (less sociopaths). 

Anyway, I needed to get this out. Thank you for reading kind internet stranger.

I think about it now, I read about people like me, I read about people just starting their journey, I read about alcohol...I think... about alcohol.

I'm just questioning whether or not this is healthy for me.  Maybe I'm best on my own, or I'm just not seeing the benefits of the group stuff.  I wonder if I'm missing the bigger picture, or if I'm finally seeing it.

I had a couple beers for my baby’s gender reveal a while back but for months before and after that I hadn’t had a drop. I learned that for almost my whole adult life I was always coping using different substances and I truly regret that. I was either always smoking weed or drinking every day from my teenage years to my early 30’s. I know now I was trying to drown out my anxiety and now that I’m clear minded I can handle and tackle life more efficiently. 

I have no interest in alcohol or weed, especially now that I’m expecting my first child (baby girl). I’m here, I’m present, and I’m ready to give her the best life I possibly can. 

If you’re struggling to quit drinking, let me tell you, you may have underlying issues you’re just not addressing. It gets easier once you stop drinking and see things clearer which includes just seeing your true self and who you really are. It gets easier once you realize how we’ve been conditioned to think alcohol consumption is just a “normal thing” any “normal person” would do. FUCK THAT. 

At the worse part of my drinking I found myself wasted on my garage floor and crying like a baby because I wanted to just kill myself but I was too scared to do it. And now I look back at that person (who I thought I was) and I’m just so god damn thankful that I did not take my life. I look back at that moment and it reminds me that alcohol led me to those tears and that cold garage floor.

I’m never going back there, I don’t even want to move a single centimeter in that direction ever again. If you’re struggling, I can assure you it’s because alcohol has its hands around your throat and it’s tightening its grip with every drink you have. Take a deep breath and break out of that choke hold, the grass is SO MUCH GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE!

I already experienced social isolation being a young single mother (I’m 26, had my son when I was 21). So drinking kept me social. Or made me feel included with people my age. Now I’m not doing that and I feel lost and the isolation has increased. It’s not always bad, and it’s been necessary in some ways. But I just feel bummed. I feel different. And weird.

Since the last time I got drunk, woke up, and deleted embarrassing snapchat stories. Since the last time I woke up in the morning and wanted to die. 

I’ve been apart of this sub longer than I’ve been sober. This sub helps me everyday because everyday I want to drink. I was convinced that I didn’t have a problem, that I was just living the college life. I was convinced that no way no how did I get my parents alcoholic genes. 

The things I’ve been able to accomplish these last three months were things I didn’t think I could do and didn’t think I had time for. 

Instead of drinking I’ve picked up reading for fun. I’ve picked up rock climbing gear and a gym membership, I have a part time job, I’m never late to my 8AM classes!! 

I was convinced I’d be missing out. Missing out on fun people and fun parties. I still go to parties. I end up being the last survivor and taking care of everyone puking. I used to be the one puking and it wasn’t fun. I’m not missing out on anything. Sobriety brought me out of my shell. I’ve branched out and met so many cool people with the same interests.

This is because, for me, and I suspect other people too, the term 'alcoholic' implies a whole story, including severe consequences. My conception of alcoholism has always been basically this: a person drinks all day, every day. Their life becomes chaotic. They lose their health, job, and family, and sometimes a place to live too. Also, they drink an amazing amount. They have crazy stories. 

But when my drinking problem was at its worst, it didn't look anything like this. My health certainly suffered, both physical and mental. And I did drink a lot. But I drank alone in the evenings, and at the end, I had managed to reduce it to 3-4 evenings a week. During the day I was fine. Life was not chaotic. I did not lose my family. I was not employed at this point, so my late mornings were not a problem in that regard. 

The point is, because of my idea of what an alcoholic was, I think this prevented me from understanding I had a drinking problem. And now that I've stopped drinking, I'm not 'sober', because I always was sober—until the evening. This makes me feel 'not the type' when it comes to AA meetings, which is part of the reason I don't go. 

I definitely had a problem, and it was—as my alcohol counsellor assured me—only going to get worse, and quick. I felt at the time that life was getting unbearable, if only in my own head. 

I know all our stories and situations are different. I would like to say that I'm an alcoholic but now I'm sober, but that doesn't really fit. So I just don't drink any more, and, if pressed, I actually can't drink anymore. So I offer these thoughts in case there is any else on here who doesn't 'fit'. In the end, if you have a problem, you need to address it, whatever form it takes.",8

Drinking allowed me to shut off my doubts and seek the attention I wasn't getting from my husband from other guys. It was a cheap substitute, a distraction. But I'd always feel shitty about it the next day and wonder what was wrong with me. I was just too scared to face reality.

I thought about offering to be designated driver, but I don't want to have to drive around the city. So I'll just share the cost of the Lyft. I'll buy him a drink but otherwise I'll be drinking water. Or I might just get sparkling water with lime just to make it look like I'm drinking lol.

Anyone been in this situation and have any advice? I can be just as fun sober so I'm not worried about being a wet blanket. Otherwise, not sure what to expect. It'll be my first time sober around drunk people in ten years.

Do any of you have this and if sober for a bit (longer than a year) did you ever see improvement? I’m at a year and I’m not sure if it’s a tiny bit better or if I have just learned how to live with the new sensation. 

I don’t yet have pain. Just the feeling that my feet and legs are filled with sand from my toes to maybe a few inches above my knee. Hard to tell where it ends. 

Can’t wear flip flops or slip ons.  They fall off and I don’t know I’ve lost them! Hate the feeling of socks since I feel like I have a pair on even when barefoot. And I don’t like walking down stairs. Not confident unless I’m looking.  I’ve started wearing shoes with a slight heel again, but I think high heels would be too risky. 

Ive started exercising to keep my legs conditioned even though the sensation is beyond creepy. I used to run and figure those days are over. I haven’t tried it. I’m scared I’d fall. I’m just doing the elliptical and the recumbent bike. Going to try resistance training this coming week to supplement. 

Anyway, I don’t know anyone else with it so would love to hear from anyone else out there. Thanks and IWNDWYT and ever. Gotta hold on to the feeling I still have!",4

I am tired of worrying whether alcohol is going to cost me my job or family.

I am tired of worrying if I did anything stupid on Facebook last night.

I am tired of worrying if I said or did anything to made my wife or kids sad.

I am tired of worrying if alcohol is going to kill me.

I am tired of hating myself because my hangovers are keeping me out of the gym.

I am tired of doing self-care that has no effect because I'm just fucking hung over.

I am tired of having my brain constantly racing but making no sense at all.

I am tired of reassuring myself that things aren't actually that bad, it just looks that way because I drank a fifth yesterday.

I am tired of everything being hard because I am hung over.

Up until this point I have been secure and happy with stopping drinking, but I haven’t put a label to it and I still don’t want to. The closest people in my life know I don’t drink right now and might never again. But my work doesn’t know.
I’m the wild one. The party girl, I get the party going and keep it going. “It’s not the same without me” they say if I don’t make it. A lot of my ego, identity and value is wrapped up in alcohol during my business trips. 
So this time I didn’t want to drink.
But I didn’t want anyone to know I didn’t.
It’s a fucking conundrum.
I know no one cares, but i apparently still do and I am trying to get over it but I’m not there yet.

2019-11-10 10:30:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ducu07/starting_hopeful/,Starting Hopeful,"So it's Sunday and I'm sitting at my desk having a coffee. The last time I drink was Friday after work. I had two cocktails, went home, and didn't drink the beer I had in the refrigerator. 

If my drinking were always like that it might be okay. But years, decades really, of experience shows that just isn't the usual case for me; and I know it never will be.

Before last Friday the previous time I drank was Wednesday. That evening I was drinking as if my life depended on it. Directly after work I had one. Met up with friends and had many, many, more. Bought more and had those on the way home. Had more at home. That is more often than not the way I drink. 

Fortunately my drinking hasn't caused irreversible problems yet. My health is pretty good. I haven't lost friends or family or jobs from it. I can stop for days or more without shakes or withdrawals. I've done a few embarrassing things but not much more than just be too drunk to function well and having called or texted people, saying nice things, while pretty drunk.

The worst of it has been driving. I've worried a few people by driving after having too many. I've been in three accidents due to drinking. One was a long, long, time ago when I was just a kid. The other two were two and three years ago. Fortunately no one got hurt and the damages were minimal and only to my own cars. And no DUIs for me. In one case no one but me even knows it happened.

But still, of course, I know how awful and dangerous that is. The very most important reason that I am committing to stopping drinking is that if I don't, someday I'm going to hurt of kill someone. I just can't live with that. 

Even if it never happens, just the fact that I'm endangering others is not acceptable. Their lives are not mine to risk.

Not harming others is the most important reason but it's not the most visceral or even the most motivating one for me. 

The most visceral one, the one I feel the most, is the desire not to feel the guilt and shame of my hangover days. Even when I drink and don't do anything embarrassing or dangerous to others, the next day I feel ashamed, guilty, and depressed. 

It didn't used to be like this. In my 20s and 30s a hangover meant being tired, usually while feeling somewhat satisfied with the hijinks of the evening. Now, in my early 50s, every day after drinking I simply feel awful about myself. I hide from people and the world. 

So we , I, have the most important reason and the most deeply felt one. I want to mention one more. The most motivating.

Drinking has not ruined my life; I have it pretty good and I am, by most accounts, a   fairly good person, employee, family member, and friend. But I know, for sure, that drinking is interfering with my potential. Truth is, other than being an okay guy, I haven't amounted to much; I haven't done much with this life and these gifts and opportunities I've been handed. Drinking is not the only cause or reason for that, but it's the first cause, the first hurdle.

I've recently started to look at it this way. If I'm drinking I'm at Level 0.  As long as I'm at Level 0, I never really take care or or follow through on all the other steps and actions I could take to do more with my life. 

Sure, even then drinking I sometimes eat healthy. But only for a day or a week. Sure, sometimes I go to the gym. Sure, sometimes I study the things I want to learn. Sure, sometimes I write (what I really want to do). But never for long enough, never sustained enough, to amount to anything.

My decision, over and over again, to drink have come at the cost of abandoning, over and over again, being who I believe that, maybe, possibly, I could be.

Delving into all the reasons I have made that decision time and again would make this long post even longer. The sort version is probably three things: Wanting friends, habit, and, as Marianne Williamson put it, ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.""

Anway there are just two more things I want to think about before closing.

First is my current trigger for drinking. 

Over time my habits have taken different forms. Currently my drinking trigger is getting off from work. Even when I feel hungover and guilty and like I never want to drink again in the morning, by the end of the work day I feel good, invincible, and like a couple beers would be just the thing. 

I'm clearly lucky that I have a job that gets me feeling that way. But I have to find ways to not drink at the end of those days. 

One thing I've noticed it that if I eat about an hour before leaving work, or **immediately** after work, my craving to drink is shrunk to nearly nothing. 

So my plan is: #1: Commit to not drinking no matter what. #2: Help make that easier by having food (or buying it right then if I have to) immediately after work.

Last thing: When I stop drinking I notice I kind of what to ""take on the world."" That may not be a bad thing. But, as maybe you can tell from this super long post, it can also get overwhelming. When drinking I can forget, or just not have, all these thoughts in my head. When I don't drink, there is so much I want to do, so much I want to say; it's fine for a while, but I suspect all that activity, all that pressure, is one part of my problem.

Anyway, thank you for reading. Thanks for this group, which I have been lurking on for a month or so. And good luck to all of you in your journey.

2019-11-10 09:58:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ducey3/update_im_going_to_jail/,Update: I'm going to jail,"Quite a few months ago I posted about my legal issues on a DUI and wanted to give an update.  I was scared and mad.  Looking back it was mostly because I couldn't control the situation anymore.

I was released from prison an hour ago after completing my 30 day sentence.  In reality, I only served 15 days.  3 days credit from when I was arrested, 10 days credit for good behavior, and 2 days for surrender and release (I don't count these as days served because I was only in jail for a few hours but they still counted as full days).

The jail I went to was built a year ago in a Pod style.  I was in a Pod with 6 cells and 4 other inmates. We each had our own cell, shower, and toilet. Everyone was min security and generally pretty chill.  We had a tv with cable, movie channels, books, a texting device, and microwave.  It was clean and most of the staff was respectful.

So what was actually bad about it?  Well as an alcoholic I couldn't control what was going on anymore. You do whatever the CO says or good behavior is taken away.  Lights are on all the time, food was terrible, beds were a 2"" foam pad on metal with a bump for a pillow, & 2 hour lockdown every afternoon.

So how did I get through it?  Well, if I'm being honest, my sentence was a reality check.  A week after I came in another kid was booked on a DUI with vehicular manslaughter and fleeing the scene.  He killed the other driver and will be spending at least a decade in prison. So every morning I reminded myself what could have happened and how lucky I was. I read a daily meditation, big book, and 12x12 every morning.

I spent mornings watching TV, Price is Right, walk in circles (common area was 50 steps in a circle), eat lunch, lay down, walk circles, watch TV, lockdown (read, nap, Sudoku, shower, read), lockdown ends, clean cell/common area, dinner, meds, walk circles, cantine, laundry, and watch TV.  Went to bed at 9:30 and woke up at 6am.  That's it.  Rinse and repeat until I was released an hour ago.

Like I said, it was a reality check.  There was a guy in there for 2 weeks for a probation violation (missed a call from PO) and another in there for 3 months waiting on his next court date (his bond is only $500 but he can't afford that). 

I did get to talk to a young kid who was struggling and he might check out an NA meeting when he gets out.  I also lost 10 lbs because the food is terrible.  Last but not least, I showed up and made amends to the county by doing my time. 

Some final thoughts: The jail I went to needs more books, recovery programs, and better food (God damn white bread with cheese, apple sauce, and pretzels is not a balanced meal!).  I was also shocked someone can sit in jail for 3 months 

I feel lucky to have the support of my wife, family, friends, sponsor, and fellowship through this.",268

Last weekend, I went to a close friends wedding and was so tempted. This was two days after posting having the strongest craving I ever had in the grocery store. I looked at my boyfriend and commented how the signature drink was one of my favorites and he responded that maybe I should give it a try. I ended up having 3.5 drinks which meant I was drunk. I still drove my car home like an idiot. I would’ve backed into a pole had my car not automatically stopped me. Everyone seemed so happy that night that I was back to drinking with them. Friends commented about how hard it must be on my relationship that we don’t have those bonding moments anymore and they were right. I felt like my boyfriend was so happy to have the old me back that I thought “why not”. Over the last week, I’ve only had a total of 12 drinks which I believe is still over the recommended amount for women. 

Yesterday, we were at a friends house when someone suggested taking some shrooms. Every time I’ve taken them I’ve had a breakthrough with myself and this time was no different. When they kicked in, I immediately needed to get out. I had my boyfriend walk me home and just sat in my living room, drinking tea, and thinking about my life. I know why I decided to pick back up again. I’ve felt like an imposter in my own life with my successes over the last year and felt that I didn’t deserve any of it. I am self-sabotaging and self-destructing. 

I no longer want to surround myself with people that thinks it’s cool to just get hammered every weekend or think that doing drugs is perfectly normal. I’m done. I’m tapping out. I can’t anymore. IWNDWYT.",13

But now it's time to stop. This morning we had a blazing row about nothing and I know it's the alcohol making me behave like this to the man I love more than anything.

Beyond grateful.,"Two years ago today I woke up, fresh out of an (albeit short) relapse, shaky, sweaty, and filled with anxiety. Here I had been seven months sober, but in that one night I managed to drink way more in that sitting than I ever did, before. It terrified me. When they say that your disease is doing push ups in the parking lot, they aren't kidding!

I took it as a lesson, and was determined to learn as much from that relapse as possible. I went on a journey of becoming more aware of my triggers and cravings, and most importantly, I learned that bottling up my emotions and not talking to people was the worst possible thing for my sobriety. I was always horrible at asking people for help, and prided myself on my independence; but, I quickly learned that asking for help and being vulnerable is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength. 

I am so grateful to my treatment program, to AA, to this sub, and to other members of my support system. I know that however difficult the hardships may be that I face sober, they would be 10000% more difficult drinking. 

Before getting sober, I tried time and time again to white knuckle it, convincing myself that it was a matter of willpower; now I know that it has very little to do with willpower and so much more with learning how to use all the tools in your toolbox, whether it be medical help, personal connection, etc. 

I'm sharing this to say to anyone that may have relapsed out there, know that there is a way out, and it does not have to be the end of your story. For me, it was only the beginning of a much healthier and more emotionally honest recovery.",15

I really have to count this sub as one of my tools of staying sober. I’ve gone 30 days before. I’m fact, I went 6 months from December to June. 
The stakes have never been higher though and I’m not going to rely on merely resolve to get me through it this time. That’s what I did last time and that worked for a while until I convinced myself I could do the whole “drink like a gentleman” BS. I can’t. I’m an alcoholic and I only know two speeds. 
I’ve been reading a lot about alcohol. This Naked Mind, Sober Curious, Alcohol Lied To Me and The Big Book (AA). They’ve all had good points. If I was to recommend skipping any of them It would be Sober Curious (my MIL bought it for me). 

I attend AA every other day. I don’t just show up, I really listen and participate. I know a lot of people shit on AA but it’s been incredibly helpful for me. I don’t agree with everything, but I don’t have to. I am beginning to work the steps and I’ve got a sponsor. If anything, it’s just a big support group where everyone understands this wretched battle that goes on in my mind. I also attend talk therapy once a week, and that’s gotten heavy. Dealing with the problems alcohol created as well as whatever it was that I was running from by numbing myself. 

I actually feel the real challenge has only just begun. Breaking the habit took about a week. Now it’s not part of any routines I have.
However, the first 30 days I was motivated by fear, shame, regret, making up for lost time, etc. I was waking up every morning with a huge laundry list of things I needed to do to make up for clocking out almost daily for a a couple months as I relapsed. 

I finished a class last night that should have been done weeks ago, but I was trying to take a critical thinking and logic course while studying intoxicated. I don’t know about you but if I was thinking critically I wouldn’t have been studying drunk in the first place. 

When I was done with the class last night and thinking to myself that I had some room to breathe is when it hit me that I needed to start filling my void. Before I was just playing catch up; this is when I need to develop those tools to help keep me strong and also stay humble - lack of humility is what got me in trouble last summer - the whole “I’ve got this” bullshit thinking. No, I don’t got this. It’s going to be something I must work on and be aware of every single day for many years to come. 

Anyway! Here’s to 30 days! And I look forward to the next 30 days. I can and will do this. Thanks everyone for your support!

2019-11-10 07:35:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/duawtn/6_years_sober_at_25/,6 Years Sober at 25,"Please read this if you are struggling. 

So, yesterday I celebrated six years of continuous sobriety. This is the strangest anniversary I've had so far, and I really want to talk a little bit about emotional sobriety for a minute and the ridiculous pressure that people in recovery sometimes put on themselves to ""act their age"".

This may be the longest period of time that I've been away from a drink or a drug, but this past year has been the most challenging year I've experienced so far, and I have felt ""closer"" to a drink than I ever have in previous years. I am not sharing this for congratulations or for attention. I was not planning to acknowledge my anniversary publicly at all this year actually, because I always feel kind of weird about doing that, but as I was journaling yesterday, I somehow ended up writing a novel about it, so here we are.

This is actually really embarrassing, and I acknowledge that I am completely blowing up my own spot on the internet to people that have not the first clue about my past, because I've been very careful to protect it, but I feel like this is also important. I'm attempting to be vulnerable right now, because Brené Brown says vulnerability is a good thing, and Brené Brown is Bae, but I’m also terrified of judgment. I really hope this doesn't come off as preachy or egotistical, because that is not me at all. I'm putting myself on blast, because if there's anyone out there right now who feels the way I felt this year, hopefully something I say might be helpful to them. Hopefully they don’t drink. 

This year has been very hard to say the least. I work full time during the day and have class four nights a week some days until 10 PM. I'm tired, overworked, overwhelmed, broke (my own fault), and pretty depressed most of the time. I'm too busy to adequately take care of myself most days. I'm really struggling to consistently eat well, sleep enough, get to the gym, and be of service in any capacity. I'm trying, but I just keep falling short. I started smoking again and really want to stop, but you know how that goes. I’m also having a hard time being&amp;nbsp;present in my relationships. I might be there physically, but emotionally I am miles away.

I wake up every day, and I feel trapped. Every time I come up for air, another random wave that I didn't see coming knocks me out and fills my lungs with metaphorical water. Some days I literally feel like I can't breathe. Like there is just this invisible weight coming down on my chest and crushing me, hour after hour, day after day. It's insufferable at times. There are brief moments of reprieve, but generally, its been rough. I promise I'll get to the bit about hope soon

As the result of being too tired, too busy, or let's be honest, too unwilling to work on myself during this period, I've watched my general emotional state slowly decline, and to be frank, I've thought about drinking a lot in the last few months. If someone randomly brings up alcohol in conversation lately, I actually start to disassociate right in front of them. They are still talking to me about whatever, but my mind is somewhere else trying to remember what alcohol feels like when it first hits your stomach.

I've felt extreme jealously toward coworkers of mine who go to happy hour after work or go home after a long day and drink a glass of wine on the couch or in the bath to unwind. I’ve scrolled through Instagram stories of friends drinking, paused them, and felt myself get really uncomfortable as I started to imagine what their martinis taste like since I've never tried one. I felt jealousy toward my family members who were all drinking White Claw and enjoying our beach house weekend last month while I was drinking La Croix. I often sit and wonder what it might be like to sit around a dinner table with my friends, eating good food, and drinking good wine. I got sober when I was 19, and I never got to experience what that's like. I've never had one glass of ""good"" wine in my life. Franzia and Barefoot forever</3. And I never got to try a White Claw. GAH.

I've been finding myself feeling like I'm missing out on something recently, and this makes me really sad and REALLY angry. All. The. Time. Especially because I know, and 100% understand, that this is insane thinking, that I’m missing actual nothing, and that drinking will never improve my situation. I’ve done enough drinking for one lifetime. I know and have fully accepted that I can not drink socially, but this is just the reality of what addiction and recovery looks like for me sometimes. This is a common occurrence for people who get sober young. Although sobriety has given me a life second to none, there are still times when I find myself feeling like I missed out on certain things. This feeling often manifests itself as grief. The best way to explain it to someone who may not understand is that I go through periods where I mourn the loss of drugs and alcohol.

For the last week or so as my anniversary has gotten closer, I've been reflecting on the last year, and I've felt incredible shame and guilt about this. Although I've been physically sober for a while now, my brain, overwhelmed by these feelings of failure for “missing the mark” on self care and for experiencing this recurring obsession about alcohol again after so long, has told me that I don't deserve to celebrate this milestone. I know this shit sounds wild, because I am definitely physically sober, but in my brain, it's 100% real and very intense (if you know, you know). My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to do anything for my anniversary, and I basically shrugged and said no, because I just didn't want to make a thing about it this year. It all felt wrong.

I've been talking about this to those who are close to me, and the more I share about it, the more I begin to realize that nothing about this experience is a failure. I’ve gone through this before, but never to the extent that I am right now, and that’s ok. It doesn’t mean that I’m doing it wrong, that I’m doomed to relapse, or that there’s something wrong with me. It’s just part of the process right now. Things are challenging at the moment for sure, but things are also beautiful and transformative. I really don’t know shit at the end of the day, but if there’s one thing I do know, it’s that everything is temporary, and these feelings will pass.

Some people might think, “Well she lacks balance. If she doesn’t take a step back from some of this she’s bound to drink.” I disagree. I believe, if left unacknowledged, yes I may eventually turn to alcohol, but as things are currently, I am aware of my pitfalls and am taking calculated actions to improve them. I am analyzing my habits and making small changes where I can. I am reaching out, speaking up, and keeping my sobriety a priority as best I can at the moment with as much as I have going on. In the beginning, my life was in shambles, and all I had was my sobriety and the wreckage of my past. Today, sobriety has given me a life that is so rich and full, I can't keep up sometimes, but that is not a bad thing. It's actually incredible. It will just take some minor adjustments here and there when things start to feel overwhelming. I truly believe that I will never be given more than I can handle.

Nothing that I'm going through right now is bad, and not one single thing that I am doing at the moment would even be possible for the ""me"" of 6 years ago, so that’s pretty cool. Everything I'm facing right now is a gift and is the direct result of a life I've worked so hard for. A life I’ve been given a second chance to live. A life I legit almost lost.

Almost 9 years ago I dropped out of high school, because my addiction took over my life, and I couldn’t face failing. I moved to Florida to run away from the mess that I made back home. I was so ashamed and humiliated about who I was and everything I’d done. 8 years ago, at age 18, the doctor told me my liver enzymes were too high from all of the alcohol, xanax, and tylenol in the pain killers I was taking. 7 years ago, I could not get through one day without putting a substance into my body. I couldn't even take a shower sometimes, because I was so sick. 7 years ago, I could barely hold a job. Not even working for my dad slinging ice cream. He seriously fired me. 7 years ago, I quit community college, because I was more concerned about getting high in the parking lot during class than actually going to class. 6 years ago, I had already been to 3 rehabs and 5 detoxes within a 3 year period. 6 years ago, after getting arrested, I told a CO in jail to go fuck themselves and lost my license for a year. 6 years ago, I was sent to the ER in an ambulance on 2 separate occasions in less than 90 days. 6 years ago, I almost lost my life in an alley in St. Pete next to a dumpster (Narcan saves lives for real). So, 6 years ago, I made a decision.

I decided that drugs and alcohol would no longer be my master. No matter how hard life got, or how unbearable my feelings became, I made a decision not to to drink or use drugs no matter what, one day at a time, and I've made that decision for 2,190 days in a row now.

Something that I've learned these last few years is that recovery is not linear, and anyone who tells you that or who makes you feel like sobriety is nothing but peace and serenity all the time is a fucking douchebag. If you’re going through something difficult right now and feel like you're falling short, it does not mean that you're doing it wrong. Everything is always changing and shifting in my recovery. Emotional ups and downs are still normal for me, and I've had to learn how to become malleable and how to experience intense emotions without running away or letting them consume me they way they used to. Maybe your experience in sobriety is or will be different than mine, but my recovery so far has been littered with periods of really intense darkness followed by periods of pure happiness and peace. It's always worth it though, and I'm grateful every day.

The only constant in my life is not drinking. Life did not suddenly become easy when I got sober like I thought it would. Maybe for a little while. My pink cloud probably lasted a year or two. Maybe even three. But with time I’ve learned that the world and the people in it do not owe me anything. The world doesn't care that I'm sober. I still feel pain regularly. I still have bad days. I still randomly burst into tears in my car sometimes when a song comes on that brings up past trauma (shout out to Tom DeLonge), and I'm still afraid all the fucking time no matter how many fears I face along the way. What has changed is my ability to stand my ground and experience everything, good or bad, that life has to offer. I do not run.

If you’re a normal person, you’re probably confused about why I would day dream about something as innocuous as drinking wine around a table with my friends when I just revealed that I overdosed on a curb next to an actual dumpster 6 years ago, because that is one WIDE gap of delusion, but addiction is a subtle foe. My addiction may sound like me and think like me, but it's something else entirely. It's like a virus that waits patiently for the perfect opportunity to strike. It will plant an unrealistic image in my head when I'm tired, weak, and vulnerable, and like a virus, it disguises itself as part of me so that I'll let it slip past my defenses undetected. The idea will take root and grow and meander through all of the dark corners of my mind like a vine, latching onto my insecurities and fears and refusing to let go. It tells me, ""it will be different this time"". It tries to convince me that I was just a dumb kid with a lot of trauma and no coping skills, but now I'm a grown ass adult, I've been to therapy, and I deserve a ""glass"" of wine after a hard day dammit. I was ashamed to admit that I had been feeling this way to my friends, because well, “I shouldn't still be having these thoughts with 6 years of sobriety."" Whatever the fuck that means.

Before getting sober I always had this misconception that someone with a year or more of sobriety had it all figured out. If you're also sober you know what I mean. Most of us feel this way in the beginning. I thought they were spiritual giants, and I put them up on pedestals. I honestly thought they were better than me. I truly hope nobody ever feels that way about me. I literally have no idea what I'm doing half the time, but I still show up.  The longer I’ve been sober, the less “sober time” actually matters in the grand scheme. There is no golden year or amount of time that we reach and the growth just stops. The journey doesn't just end, and I'm grateful for that. The journey is what I signed up for. In the day is where life happens for me, and more and more, that’s where I try to stay.

Even though I’m sober, I can still be a piece of shit sometimes. I'm still mean for no reason. I experience rage, envy, and hatred. I'm SO selfish, impatient, impulsive, and I can't make good financial decisions AT ALL. I am still sometimes painfully awkward in social situations. I still have to make amends when I’m wrong, which happens to be a lot, and I am constantly beating myself up for not meeting my own unreasonable standards and expectations.

But I am also kind, generous, hardworking, loving, ambitious, adventurous, passionate, thoughtful, and honest. I own my shit today, and I take responsibility for my actions. Sobriety has given me the ability to take an honest appraisal of myself and to love myself for not just my great qualities, but also for all of my faults and flaws as well. With each year that passes, I learn more about what it truly means to love yourself and to love others. Sobriety has given me the opportunity to know myself- to know who I am at my core and not shy away or crawl out of my skin when things are hard to look at. Sobriety has given me every single good thing that I have in my life today. It has given me the ability to see others and to let them see me, to love unconditionally (in a healthy, independent way), and to experience the other side of true hopelessness.

But most of all, sobriety has given me a choice. I never had that before, and I refuse to give that up for the delusion of drinking one glass of wine on the couch while watching Ghost Adventures on a Thursday night, because #1, that's dumb, and #2, the reality of that delusion is as follows: 

Me, two bottles of gas station wine deep, wandering around in the dark screaming at ghosts to come fight me.

So, today I’ve made the choice not to drink once again, and I hope that with faith and the proper guidance, I will continue to make that choice every day going forward for the rest of my days.

And if you’re newly sober or wanting to get sober, please don’t let anything I’ve said deter you. I’ve only made one good choice in my life and that was getting sober. Every other good choice that followed was just the result. What I’m going through right now is not typical for me. I do not always think about drinking alcohol. For the first five years, I barely thought about it at all. This is just a season in my sobriety, and like any season, it will pass. So, I am leaving a lot of space for myself to grow into the woman I am meant to be at the end of this.

If any of my sober peeps feel this way right now, especially my young friends, it’s okay if your time in sobriety is not an accurate measure of what you feel your character or your life should reflect at this point. I know that we all ""know"" this to some extent, but a lot of us still feel shame when it happens to us, and we still try to hide it by putting on an act that everything is fine. ""Sober time"" seems to be what everyone is after, but time is not sobriety. Living sober is a daily act of radical honesty and ownership, and in my opinion, that is the true measure of a person's character.

It's okay to be honest when we feel like we've missed the mark. It's okay to be vulnerable about this. It's okay to let people see the truth about what recovery looks like sometimes. It's okay if you’re not okay right now. We still deserve to celebrate.

Grateful for today. Love y'all.",37

I reframed it as finishing drinking. I finally finished drinking! Ive accomplished all the drinking i need to, ive drank more in 6.5 years than most people do in their entire lives. What an accomplishment! I did that better than most! I could've been on the olympic drinking team! So now i will retire.


I know i only have a few days under my belt again but this past run of sobriety has been the easiest yet. I even went to a concert surrounded by alcohol (much of which was spilled on me) with no desire or urge to drink.

I felt so disrespected last night that I had to get out of the house and go somewhere.  Girlfriend says shes going out to the bar with her GF's as I am leaving work and does't even bother to invite me.  Understandably I am livid.  We argue a little bit and I say well Ill just see you at the bar, I'll go myself since I am not invited.  She says I am not going to that bar anyways and hangs up on me.  I end up at said bar only because I live in a town where I have no family and very very few friends, so fuck it, it was something to do and too late to really go anywhere else.  Of course shes not there. This place is the definition of glorified dive bar, cramped, shitty live music, and disgusting bathrooms.  I sat at the bar choked down a disgusting NA beer and split.  The place was loud, extremely smoky, and just crowded; not my thing at all, no wonder I would have to be so hammered to hang out in a places like that who wouldn't? I used to hang out at dive bars in my 20's and enjoyed them but now in my 30's ill pass.

I ended up hanging out with a buddy who was already sloshed and we went to the Casino.  Of course casino is full of drunk people as well.  Middle aged and older drunk people on the dance floor looking like fools next to the roulette and black jack tables I blew 20 dollars on the roulette table and left.

When I got home had a new found appreciation for my quiet and solitude and was the best feeling ever.  No stinging eyes and smelling like an ashtray from all the smoke.  I have a new found appreciation for my sobriety and my piece of mind.  Life can really suck sometimes and throw shit in your face but if you stand strong and listen to that inner voice guiding you in the right direction you will only come out stronger mentally, physically, and spiritually I believe this.  I have a half full bottle of vodka in my freezer cause my girlfriend is an alcoholic and I honestly didn't even want to touch the shit.  I am in this for the long run.  Life does not always get easier but if we approach our problems with a healthy perspective we can only get stronger.  The isolation you feel sometimes in sobriety is real especially since so many people drink, but that's only cause your literally adjusting to a new lifestyle and a new way of living.  Their are many out there like us attempting to reinvent our lives for the better so we really aren't alone and this forum helps me when I am feeling that way.  If anyone gets an ounce of inspiration from this then my work here is done.  Now get out there and live your best life!

2019-11-10 02:20:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/du8fcb/365/,365,"It’s kind of strange, when you start out on this journey you think of all the daunting milestones ahead of you. One day, one week, one month, 90 days, 6 months... You start out in a pit, claw your way through withdrawal. Try to pick up the pieces from whatever you shattered on your way to the bottom. Then you start counting everything. How long it’s been since the start. How much time you’ve wasted. Things that you are afraid you’ll miss out on if you slip up. Who’s still here now that you’re back. 

When I started sobriety, I never thought I’d lose track of my count since the start. I actually had a calendar alert set for today, so we can blame this post on that. It’s been a year since I showed up at the train station with my tail between my legs. (Literally. My last bender took me 5 hours away from home.) Knowing that was it for the drunken part of my life. 

It started out slowly. Dealing with the mess I’d made of my life. I’d say the first 100 days were the hardest, we all had a routine we were used to. People you knew may fall away, but that’s likely because they never knew you. Hell, even you have to get acquainted with yourself at that time. But slowly I started to notice I wasn’t still picking up the parts of my life I had been tearing down for years. There were new parts being added on now. 

I reach out to the people I care about. Remember birthdays, see how they’re doing. Typically pay my bills on time. Anxiety is at bay. My eyes are clear, face isn’t puffy. I spend my time having meaningful conversations with my future husband. I get to see happy dog faces whenever I come home. 

I didn’t have any of that the day I walked out of the train station. I couldn’t see it. But that’s okay, because it’s here now. And nothing in this world (I’m looking at you, vodka) will be able to take that away from me without a very serious fight.

I got into the party scene and drinking/drugs were just normal. I quit the drugs and thought to myself that alcohol was fine because there are way worse things. A few years after that I find myself always drinking, weekends were lost to just sitting around with a bottle and nothing to show for it. Others had stories while I just sat around and drank. Shoot forward a few more years and I ended up marrying a fantastic girl who does not drink at all. It all has been going well and I have been drinking less, I don't buy hard liquor anymore and rarely drink liquor at all.

These days I struggle with a stressful job and just wanna come home and have a few beers to decompress, but always feel guilty when I do. I feel the guilt comes from all the dumb stuff that I did do when I drank i.e. random hookups (when I was single), falling down and accident prone, hangovers at work that made it impossible to perform my best. When I think I'm doing I'll have a moment when I just want to get hammered thinking I've done well I can let loose for one night. If I'm lucky it'll stop just with the single night and other times it becomes a whole binge period and feel all that progress was lost. 

I feel immense shame when I wake up after a night of heavy drinking. The most recent was a concert I went to with my friends back home for my 30th birthday. I haven't seen these friends in almost a year due to my job moved me away. I was so excited, but was blacked out within a couple hours and don't remember the fantastic time that was supposed to be had. I feel so ashamed and haven't talked to them since I left out of embarrassment.

Everyday seems to be a struggle with wanting to drink and knowing that I don't like the person I am when I do. Thank you for listening to me vent, even typing this up I feel more accountable.",4

Read before drinking...,"Wake up, wish you hadn’t. Vaguely think for a while about opening eyes whilst grimly wondering how bad the headache is. Wait for three seconds. Yep...It’s really bad. 

A pounding head would be welcome. But this? This feels like your brain has expanded inside your head, or sometimes shrunk inside your head but either way -there is a horrific pain all the way around the membrane of your skull as though someone has scooped out sections of your brain with a melon baller. 

Your mind is sluggish, slow, weak. 

It hurts to open your crusty eyes caked in mascara that you forgot to take off- again. The light from the window hurts your eyes, you just want to be somewhere dark with your eyes closed. 

You are wearing light nights’ clothes. You smell of stale sweat mixed with last nights faded perfume/aftershave and of course wine/beer/vodka/whiskey. 

Your eyes have deep dark circles around them. They feel painful, overly sensitive to light, like they are bulging out too far. You want to press on them, put something cool on them, when you put eye drops in they just sting and suck up the moisture. They are dry, bloodshot, yellow, achey, they hurt like this all day, exacerbating the pounding headache. 

Your head is boiling hot.  Your skin is greasy in places and dry in others, you want to be cold, you want to be warm, you don’t know what you want. You can’t get comfortable and you can’t get back to sleep. 

Your skin is grey. 

Your mind is whirring with anxieties, fears, promises broken, deadlines missed, fear, fear, dread, fear. You can’t think about anything, it’s all too scary. 

All you can taste is the wine/beer/vodka/whiskey in your mouth. The sicky, achey, empty, acidy feeling in your stomach. 

SO Thirsty. All day, your mouth constantly feels dry and like it’s not possible to really taste anything without the underlying pervasive taste of old stale alcohol.

Maybe your fingers or hands are twitching or shaking, maybe they’re not today. 

You get up because you have to pee.  Look down and realise the traces of puke around the toilet. Oh no, you think, that was me. Fuck. At least you made it to the toilet though, because the alternative of puking on your bed is way worse and puking whilst lying on your back does not bear thinking about. You look in the mirror and see some traces of puke around your face. This is bad, you want to cry but feel numb. 

The world looks frightful, filled with monsters, obstacles and impossibly high and treacherously paved mountains that you have to cross. But you just can’t face it right now. 

Your dog is whining to go for a walk, to be fed, you battle your way downstairs past last night’s drinking effort, in order to feed him. He is still ridiculously happy to see you, you feel unworthy of this show of affection. You scoop his food into a bowl, it makes you feel nauseous. You feed him and then have to dash back to the bathroom as the acidic bile rising up from the back of your throat starts to move. 

As you flush the toilet you realise that being sick has made your headache worse. You think about drinking water but are not even sure you can face that either. 

You are back down at the bottom of the pit, a little more broken, a lot more sorry looking up at the light so far away in the sky. The day ahead seems like a ridiculously impossible mission you have been given to fight through, feeling terrible, for the next 24 hours. 24 hours is all we ever have: they don’t have to feel like this, the light is still there and you can reach it.  

TLDR: Dont pick up that first drink, put your happiness first. IWNDWYT

Almost 90 days later after quitting, I still haven’t come to terms with getting rid of the many hidden empty bottles in my closet. I have been eating better, exercising, and doing the needed daily tasks to keep my desire for alcohol at bay. I take it day by day as I can.

Tonight, my husband asked me to grab a bottle of jack daniels after I’m done at the gym. Whiskey was my thinggggg. I panicked. How big of a bottle? How much do you plan on drinking? All questions I’m asking so I can buy exactly the right amount to ensure none will be left over. I can’t have it sitting around, I just know I can’t. It comes across strange and aggressive to him. He knows I’m not drinking from simple observation but doesn’t understand why. He doesn’t understand how hard it was for me to stop and how at this point waltzing around my old favorite liquor store is...well, scary for me. He doesn’t understand because I’ve never explained it.

I never explained it because I am fucking ashamed. There it is. I don’t want it thrown in my face during some future argument. I don’t want to be treated or looked at differently. I don’t know why I’m like this and can’t just get along and have a drink or two and stop like others can. I hate being asked the question, “can’t you just show a little self control?”.

This is more or less a rant-thanks for listening. I rarely post on here but rely on those of you who do and share your stories, so thank you.",10

Another is just some dumb personal stuff that I wish didn’t affect me as intensely as it does. I used to think my reaction towards it was heightened due to drinking, but now I know that it actually triggered me wanting to just toss back a few shots- but I did not!

I smoked a bowl with a friend after work (I honestly have no issues with it, which is why I think I am hesitant to AA, because the last time I was in the program it was hard abstinence and I don’t want to seem like a liar) and we were talking, and I kind of went over some of the events from the last few weeks, and it fully reminded myself of why I can’t drink.

All my jeans have started to fit a little weird, even my favorite pair 😢. I measured myself to order new styles to try, and I've lost an inch in the waist! 😱

This is the first tangible sign that something changed for me. 12 weeks! My face does look different to me, but no one has said anything. And I wasn't weighing myself regularly before I stopped drinking, so I'm not sure how much I've lost. I think around 4-5 lbs. That makes about a quarter pound a week. Sloooooow going for us tiny peeps.

All I do (besides go to work) is lie in bed and be depressed, but I was also doing that before 🤷‍♀️I do eat less crap/smaller portions and, obviously, no booze.

Now to run some errands and maybe, *maybe,* get totally crazy and go to the gym tonight.

2019-11-09 14:39:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/du0mmp/panic_attacks/,Panic Attacks,"I’ve dealt generalized anxiety disorder since I was a kid and have had mild panic attacks over the years. However the past year or so I’ve suffered with frequent debilitating panic attacks. I’m talking like extreme feeling of dread like I’m have a heart attack or a stroke. They have gotten so bad that at one point I actually went to urgent care and got an EKG and everything turned up normal and they told me it was just panic/anxiety. This was scary at the time and embarrassing later..

I came up with every reason I could think of to explain them.. financial stress, big life changes, too much coffee. None of this made sense because I had experienced all of these before in the past with only mild panic attacks that were easier to manage and cope with. 

There was one thing that I never factored in and it only made sense during a particular sober stretch. The mornings and days that I had massive panic attacks were after nights of heavy binge drinking which had become more and more frequent in the past year. I notice during sober stretches that I wake up and think about more positive aspects of life instead of dwelling on the negatives. I also am able to drink 1-2 cups of coffee without the jitters that usually signal the start of a panic episode. 

TLDR: I think my binge drinking heavily exacerbates my panic disorder and is just another huge reason to stay sober and live a more normal life.",3

**The backstory:** I started a new job in 2015, recruited by a former work associate, and she became my boss. We went on to be good drinking buddies after long stressful days at work. I looked up to her. However, I started distancing myself from her after seeing her terrorize a colleague she thought was underperforming. I saw her mean streak and grew cautious and aware that it was so easy to fall out of favor with her and how easily I could be next on her shit list. As a master manipulator, she didn't like me distanced and disenchanted, because I was more useful under her spell and kissing her ass. She started being harsh and critical of me over trivial things, and I knew I had fallen out of her sphere of conditional approval and there was no recovering from it, no matter how hard I tried.

Her treatment got worse over the next year, to the point that I had regular panic attacks when confronted by her, and I started daily heavy drinking in to numb myself from my stressful job and hostile abusive boss. I worked from home and easily slipped into early morning binge drinking regularly for the next 2 years. I inevitably developed major depression and anxiety disorder, which I blamed on the ""trauma"" I endured with having an ""evil boss"". I filed formal complaints with the company. Lawyers got involved, she was investigated and put on a performance plan, which made her very angry and more hostile. Not long after reporting her, I was laid off due to ""team-reorganization"", a tactic she is known to use to exit people she doesnt like without raising flags with HR  (because ""HR makes firing people so hard""). I still don't know how she pulled it off, a 1 person layoff of the one person who had an open harassment complaint against her, but she did, and went on to get 3 more harassment complaints filed against her.

But my ""layoff"" was for the best. I got a new job with a great company in a completely different industry, sure to never cross her path again. I continued daily heavy drinking though, and lately feeling very depressed and worried about my drinking, because I've never gone more than a few days sober since 2016. I signed up for a 5 day therapy retreat and the requirement is that I stay sober for 30 days leading up to the retreat. With something to look forward to, something holding me accountable, I feel I have a better chance at staying sober and making it to the retreat.

**The ""run-in"":** Yesterday was my Day 3. I was attending a charity event for my new company, when I spotted the ex-boss across the room. I went into a full blown panic attack, shaking and unable to breathe, fighting tears. I was in complete terror. She was the last person I wanted to or expected to see. I made it out of there, and spent the rest of the day in a bundle of raw nerves and self pity. Why me? What are the odds? Of all places and all people, why her? Why there? Why today?! I knew what I went through with her was bad, but why was seeing her again making me have such an extreme reaction? I had regular panic attacks when she was actively and directly terrorizing me, and those panic attacks were nothing compared to yesterday.

For how bad this day was, I gave myself permission to rush to the store after work and getting a 6 pack. In the car on the freeway, I screamed and cried so hard that I looked terrible enough to not want to show my face in public, and went home instead to wait until the red left my face.

I just don't feel comfortable at those dinner or events anymore... I'm not tempted to drink or anything, its just so boring to me now...

I haven't taken it yet today, and of course, my brain goes straight to drinking. This is always what happens, the moment I start  feeling better, no matter what my memories are of how sick I felt, I feel better and bam, I want more. 

I went to a meeting this morning but I think that triggered me even more. Got some numbers but I don't know how to ask for help, so I'm asking here. The craving is so intense, I don't know how to get over this. They recommended an IOP which I plan to call on Monday, but until then I'm on my own.

Normally I would have taken at least a few shots before heading out the door, but not today you evil disease!  Anyway, I get there and my dad is there (they say alcoholism is hereditary, if that’s true I get to blame his side of the family).  My dad is a great guy and is 100% functioning, but nonetheless an alcoholic by definition.  Throughout the entire play I could smell the beer on his breath.  The play ended and he left and I said something about it to my boyfriend.  Now this man, who hardly ever drinks has stood by my side holding my hand through every relapse and detox, almost to the point of enabling me.  He says to me, “I know I kept smelling it too and was worried it was you until I finally realized.”  My response - I blew a strong air of moist breath right in his face.  Awakening in the sense that I realized, I probably always smelled that way to everyone and that is no longer something I have to deal with - Amazing!

So, awkward - and I do hope this isn’t too inappropriate.  Skip to later in the night, kids are in bed and my man and I are watching t.v.   We have not had intercourse since my last relapse, in fact, mostly all of our sex was drunk and I really thought he just wasn’t that great at it.  So why the 19 day delay?  I felt weird initiating it.  It seemed weird to be SOBER for such an event.  And for guys it’s like, let’s have sex, not the same for women.  Any way, I decided to get over it and go for it - needless to say last night AND this morning -  WAY AMAZING!  

If anyone else is experiencing this above, throw yourself out there.  You will not regret having all of those feelings and not being numb.

Seconds later, a few of my friends stumble to their seats behind us, and one friend hands me a drink and all I hear is “here’s a sparkling water.” 

I take a sip and it was a vodka club (which we used to call “[my name] water” as a joke -yikes, you know you have a problem when...) but he also didn’t know I’m not drinking anymore, and this would usually be a wonderful gift for me... so honest mistake.   

As the sip went down, a quick flash of justifications why it was ok to take another sip wash over me, BUT at that EXACT INSTANT I look at the Jumbotron monitors and the images with the song playing show a woman crying inside her car while parked at a liquor store, as she’s eyeing her AA chip. 

BOOM. It hit me like a brick wall. NO! NO! NO! I started welling up with tears as the video played, subtly showing other images of addiction... 

I handed the drink back to my friend (who somehow sucked his down already) and told him I shouldn’t around the in-laws.  

The instant I handed the drink back, it was like a spiritual moment where the notes rang sweeter, the words went deeper, the colors brighter. After a few songs, the artist spoke very candidly about his struggles with addition and asking for help. It was like he was speaking directly to me. Tears ran down my cheeks as I tried to conceal my emotions.

Thank you, Sir Elton John, for being my white knight. You saved me last night.

You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough”

It was as if two temperamental children were screaming and arguing and my head was basically the room in which they were arguing. And for some reason I couldn't stop it. So I try to listen to the radio, and that doesn't work. I try talking to myself, but then decide not to because it makes me feel like I'm losing my mind. 

I'm on my longest streak, so I should be feeling minimal cravings, right? Nope. The cravings elbowed their way right to the front of my mind for most of the drive.

There is something about this time of year that makes me want to drink (and I'm sure lots of other people too). Whether it's the stress or the ritual of holiday drinking or simply because one wants to feel good. And I fall for it every year. I want this year to be different. I feel confident I will overcome. But the Holidays is a tough hurdle, because I've always drank during them.

 There's a lot of thinking about the past, and mixed feelings. This is primarily why I know I shouldn't drink. There's something about resonating old feelings that another year has passed and the inevitable greediness of wanting *more* out of life. When in reality, 202 days is my longest streak. In the past, drinking was a more of an escape during the holiday season. I would always end up feeling lachrymose. Thinking about times passed that I shared with old friends, people that aren't around anymore, and moments in life that I'm proud of. However, all these intense feelings turned me into an emotional mess. Being in this state, it's tough to feel optimistic about the future.

So this year, I'm going to fight through these cravings and start feeling optimistic about 2020. Lots of good things can happen and I can be the forward driving force. I hope that everybody feeling holiday cravings knows that they are not alone and we can overcome them together!",1

He used to play with his little cousins and had FUN with kids. Now it's like he's completely checked out... Mind you, we're both quitting alcohol, me 100%, him not so much even though he's the one who's been diagnosed with FLD. I'm scared our marriage really won't survive sobriety. Is there even a chance he'll be motivated and loving ever again?

And that reminded me of how I need to stay vigilant because although I currently feel on top of the world, a huge success story..I could have one really, really bad day which could cause a relapse. But then.. that particular failure does not need to be the end, it does not need to be fatal. As long as I have the courage to keep going towards that goal of being sober, that's what counts.

It’s cozy and warm and through the windows I can see the sun irising in a pink and purple haze, peeking through the bare, snow-covered branches of the trees outside. I’m just lying here, soaking up the luxury of waking up with no alarm and no real need to get out of bed. No hangover, no jangling, jittery voices of regret screaming through the peace. Just feeling rested, blessed, and at peace.
Weekend lie-ins are the best.

I decided to post it in case it helps someone.,"I had to repost this because the previous post contained a link.

This is a song that has helped me not just in my sobriety but in other aspects of my life as well. I wanted to share it for those that are always looking for a song to add to their sober playlist and may not have heard this one before.

The song 'Fear' by the band Blue October was written by the lead singer, Justin Furstenfeld, about his alcohol addiction.  

A sample of the lyrics:

'Cause fear in itself
Will reel you in and spit you out
Over and over again
Believe in yourself
And you will walk
Now, fear in itself
Will use you up and break you down
Like you were never enough
Yeah, I used to fall, now I get back up

He is quoted about the song's meaning - ""The reason I did use and drink was because of fear. The reason I kept myself from being happy is I was scared of the outcome. In the last year and a half, I learned there's no room for 'Fear.' When I hear that song, it wraps up the last seventeen years of my life. I found what I've been looking for.""

I believe there is a genetic component to this condition and I have that gene. Some people don't. Some people can just have a glass of wine with a meal and then just go home and not drink anymore without even thinking about it. They're the lucky ones but there's no use in dwelling. I have to contend with who I am. I'm unable to moderate at all. I have a 100% losing streak when it comes to the game of moderation. It's either no booze or all the booze for me, they're literally the only options. I've spent long enough ticking the ""all the booze"" option, it's time to tick the ""no booze"" option.

This certainly isn't my first day one but there are lessons to be found in my past attempts. There's no such thing as losing, you either win or you learn something. The demon of alcoholism is a force to contend with and shouldn't be taken lightly. That's what I'm going to do differently this time: I'm going to give this wino demon witch the respect she deserves, trying to maintain a Rambo-like vigilance and developing strategies to keep her under wraps, because she will always be there.

""Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories.""

One aspect of this new strategy is becoming more active in this online community. I have lurked for ages via other accounts but now I want to make myself accountable and play my part. This subreddit is truly remarkable and you are all beautiful. I will be here daily.

I'll just get straight to the point, i live by myself in a ""decent"" studio apartment in LA, i left behind all my friends and family back in Massachusetts to pursue success here and everything is going great and i'm making some good career moves! ...except for the fact i'm realizing that, most days, i'm drinking a 6-Pack of Corona and a 375ml of Jim Bean to pass out, especially on my days off

I have been doing this for close to a year now and i have noticed that my social skills have gone down, (living alone probably helps with that too) and that it's usually hard for me to go to bed unless i have some kind of drink, something i hate to admit

I know this is incredibly unhealthy and i'm ruining my body but i cant seem to fight the ""last-minute"" impulses to buy some alcohol when i go grocery shopping or when i get off work, and i see myself wasting money on delivery services like Postmates that makes getting alcohol even easier and i am so fucking tired of wasting money on a high that i don't even fully appreciate or even enjoy anymore

i'm 25 and i don't want to fall down the scary path of being alcohol dependent (even though i already feel like i am), the thought scares me but it's almost like i lack the willpower to do it alone or on my own terms and i just need some advice on how to stop this behavior

i'm scared and i'm alone and i need to stop this now before it gets worse... this is my first attempt EVER on seeking some kind of third party help on this and it hurts to admit, but i want some help and i need some advice",5

But then I thought, why even put myself in that situation? Turns out that you can substitute wine with a lot of things, depending on what it is supposed to be used for or what it brings to the recipe (acidity, sweetness, to deglaze the pan, etc.)

Genuinely didn't think that would actually happen, it was tough and I did have quite a bit of FOMO...but never the less I did it...very grumpy and short tempered but still...I DID NOT DRINK.

Woke up this morning feeling quite driven, but I am moody and I do feel restless. We have a bonfire tonight and we are doing the outside bar for the first two hours....now if that isn't going to be tough then I don't know what will. But, if I can get through that then I will be happy....but right now I can't say if I will. It is too much pressure, so I just need to take it minute by minute. I have an AA meeting this afternoon so hopefully that will inspire me a little.

So the other thing I wanted to write about is the ""monster"". My therapist and I attached the name to the craving. I gave it a colour, a shape, a feeling and even a name. Now I understand what she was trying to do - to give me something to ""fight"" ...but how can you ask someone with little to no drive, no fight left and a huge feeling of weakness to ""fight"" anything?! That just set me up for failure....I don't walk round wearing a f\*cking cape....this isn't a comic book. 

I have been really thinking about this and the mythological fight with some black shape in my mind is just not working for me. I need a pragmatic approach. I need to take responsibility of what I have been doing, I can't pass the blame on to the monster as it wasn't her that bought 3 bottles of malbec on a Wednesday afternoon...IT WAS ME. I understand that many people need to disassociate and I might read this post in the future and totally disagree with myself, but for now I have to have this black and white approach. I've been the monster and I need to stop. Simple as that.

Literally she replied back saying she would give me the money but wants it back when I'm on my feet and this wasn't just a few quid.

It just shows me that I don't need to dig my head in the sand and that there is a way out of most situations. I'm obviously very lucky my mum is in a position to help me out in this exact example.

When she put it down I didn't touch it for a long time and then I started to drink the beer because it would have been more noticeable to change my mind, it just made me realize I'm afraid of even having one beer because it will turn into 2 then 10 then who knows how many on some nights. It didn't this last Wednesday night maybe because I've been so honest with myself about how bad I feel about who I am when I drink.

I'm committed, I told my Mom today that I made the decision to stop drinking. I love her dearly but she's an alcoholic and I know it probably scared her to hear me say that because it would have made her think about her own drinking, I just needed to be honest with someone and start to be accountable for not drinking anymore. I don't always like who she is when she drinks too much, she can't walk straight by noon on the holidays and often sleeps it off mid day but wakes up drunk still anyhow, can't play a board game because she can't keep track of things while wasted, it's uncomfortable for me and part of why I haven't gone home in 3 years for Christmas. 

I'm mad at myself for having that beer, I wish I hadn't because it wasn't worth it. I think I got scared about what life would be like without drinking, would I be able to enjoy comedy anymore without beers? Can I meet my friends at breweries and not be drinking while everyone else does? What about holidays or traveling? Will I be happy on a beach without booze? I keep running all these scenarios through my head and realizing that it will be ok, I just have to stick with it until this becomes my new normal, one day I won't think about if I'll have fun without drinking but be glad I stopped because I can finally have fun.",3

Basically what happened - I was in the middle of a total living room floor gut, with lots of involved subfloor work. And this is the time my house chose to start giving me headaches / fatigue, due to a faulty furnace. 
Now, as you can imagine, having to move all of your crap out of the living room is already a huge inconvenience. Throw in a new furnace, as well as a bunch of other projects I probably shouldn't have started. My house is a disaster. Normally, if I was drinking, this would have sent me off the deep end. I would have been on binge after binge. I probably wouldn't have even wanted to step foot in here. Luckily I was far enough in my soberness, and I realized that drinking was going to do nothing to get me through this. It would only prolong it. 
So long story short, I stayed sober. I helped my cousin put in the furnace, and we finished tonight.  It felt great.
My credit cards aren't looking too good, because I bought the furnace - but on the bright side, I saved about a grand by doing it ourselves. Plus, now I have a super efficient furnace. I may have not wanted to get into that, if I was drinking.  I just love how much easier it is to deal with problems....and how much more positive my outlook is. I know if I was drinking, I would've been like ""why does this shit happen to me, I'm never going to get ahead."" Self-pitying the shit out of myself.

However I find  I’m doing other things to compensate like overeating carbs and sugar and (eeek) going slowly back to smoking.  

I feel like I need some relief somewhere and I just don’t want to exercise or do anything constructive.  It’s like I gave up on booze, I earned some other shit that’s not quite as bad. 

But I’m not happy about it.  I want it all gone. The urges for these small pleasures make me realize how out of control I truly can be.  

Honestly I feel like my will power is low.  It just happened to be alcohol before, now I found sugar or tobacco.  And maybe I’ll give that up someday too and find something else to fill the void.  

I don’t feel recovered in that sense.  I’m lacking wholesomeness or serenity or depth of character or something.  I fully acknowledge my life is 1000% better without alcohol but I still feel that desperation of being held by something beyond my control or understanding. 

 Anyone else feel this way?? Thanks for your comments in advance.",3

In a way, I want to be able to also go back and show people my experience with this book, because it seems to be working for me without me even knowing. I'll explain why. 

Today is a weird day. I remember the last Friday I didn't drink, I was on the sub, freaking out, asking for someone to please motivate me. To help me through the next hour. The next minute. 

I'm so at peace today. Have been all day. I've thought about drinking, sure. But I haven't been attacked by desire to drink. I haven't had to fight it at all. I've honestly told myself, ""no, I'm not drinking tonight. I don't want to."" And then poof, the thought is gone and I am at peace again. I'm sure it's hard to believe, especially for those who are in the position I was in last week. Today's just been surprisingly easy. I can't really explain it. 

I'm having thoughts of drinking tomorrow. I feel pretty confident I could only drink tomorrow, and not turn it into a weekend binge honestly, which is again, a weird feeling. The book says not to go out of your way to change your drinking patterns, and after today I trust the system. The weird part of all of it is, I don't even think I will. 

I mean maybe, we'll see when I'm there, but I just don't think I want to. Obviously i may be in a different mindset tomorrow, but if it's anything like today, I just...won't. Which is awesome.",3

I was planning on stopping by my old store after work today and grabbing a few mini bottles. Not a binge or anything, I told myself. No one would have to know, nothing would happen. I even turned the blinker on to go left to the store instead of right to my house. And then, seemingly out of nowhere I had the thought “Or, you could just... not do that. You could just go home.”

And that’s what I did. I heated up some cider and threw on a movie and am making it to 43 days without having to lie to myself or anyone else about my sober streak.",15

I've had only some cravings and no physical ick to deal with other than sleeping too much.

Context: 58 y/o female, 5'2"", average build, 3 kids, 1 spouse. Business owner/operator. I never was a sloppy, angry, dopey, irrational or hungover drunk. I didn't run afoul of the law. Didn't screw up or loose my job(s). High blood pressure was the only physical ""symptom"". My relationships help fast. (Like I said - Blessed!) 

I decided a week ago that I was done and started trolling sites like this one...for hours a day and taking St Johns Wort & Kudzu Root to calm my brain and settle my cravings. I know, deep within me, that those herbs & this site in particular are why this has been working. 

I have literally not been sober more than 2 days in a row in over a decade, and very infrequently at that. I really don't know who I am or who I'm going to be now, and I sure do wonder who I'd be if I'd not been ""fuzzy"" for all those years... I'm excited to find out.

I cracked that beer open, as I normally would, that same familiar sound I came home to every night, the smell, the fizzy yummy tasty beer. The beer that I would normally pound 12-20 a night.

As hard as it was, I flashed back to who I was almost a month ago.. that sickly-looking sad person. The one that would take advantage of anyone, all the lies, the manipulation.. I didn’t want to be that person.. 

I successfully poured it down the sink, and went upstairs and did pull ups till I couldn’t do them anymore, and did them again until my arms hurt.

* Regular therapy
* Meditation
* Food (I've not been good in the past about eating and while that still may be true, when I *do* eat, I'm eating really healthy and yummy stuff)
* Hiking and exploring the mountains and Northern Plains where I now live
* This community & friends I've developed here over the past almost four years of being actively involved
* Yoga and somatic therapy with an amazing person
* Reading, especially beginning to read poetry again. 

These things make me feel more whole and fully myself and support my sobriety, just as much as my sobriety supports them.

(long)","Hello! I used to browse this sub a lot but never contributed much as I never saw myself being able to quit. I was an every day - sometimes all day long - drinker for about 8 years. about 4 years into my drinking habit I started adding Xanax into my drinking every day as well...  Never the ridiculous high amounts that put me in rehab years ago though - but I did take  1-3mg of Xanax daily deepening on much I was able to drink and how my day went. I was extremely depressed, anxious, and suicidal. I thought about ending my life every single day and obsessed over the thought of trying to OD.  I saw no point to life and I was a terrible spouse to my husband - who is the greatest man Iv ever known who loves me more than anything. He is not and never been an addict and I don't know how he tolerated me in that state for so long (been together almost 2 years and he never pestered me to change my black out ways) And then everything changed...

I randomly became extremely nauseous and started having severe stomach pain one day at work. I ignored it and figured it was a stomach bug. 2 days suffering extreme pain and I still refused to go to the hospital ( I'm terrified of medical stuff). My husband was very adamant on getting me to go because iv never complained about being in pain before. This was unbearable. Turned out it was Appendicitis and my appendix had already ruptured by the time I got to the hospital.. By this time I was in septic shock and my body was shutting down.  I woke up blind, extremely confused with no ability to understand what was going on and was told my kidneys had completely shut down. I was told that once the body goes septic and your kidneys no longer function that is usually the end but it did appear that I was possibly going to make it and had to start dialysis immediately. 

I woke up blind (could only see directly in front of my face), 190 pounds ( I was 140 pounds the day before - I swelled up because my kidneys failed), I was being told I was possibly going to die or be on dialysis forever, and I was hallucinating like crazy from withdrawals. But my body was so toxic and close to death, none of this bothered me. I felt 0 pain. I felt peace. I didn't feel any pain from the surgery the day before where they cut me open and basically washed me out with a hose. Nothing.  I was put on about 12 different pills a day to help with WDs , seizures, and other things and immediately had a chest hemodialysis catheter installed that went straight to my heart.  Every day I did dialysis (3 times a week, 4 hours each time) I would wake up more and more coherent, I wasn't coherent until day 5. In the previous 2 days (days 3 and 4)  I was apparently a nightmare patient. my husband said I attacked nurses for ""destroying my hotel room"" and ""letting my cat out"". I was never in a hotel and I don't have a cat and haven't in years.  I also ripped my IVs out every night in deranged tantrums. I said the craziest things and blamed the craziest things on people I hadn't seen in forever.I blame all this on the toxicity and WD, and I did profusely apologize to every amazing nurse that had to deal with me. 

Days 5-9 in the hospital were full of anxiety considering I was still in WD, and I was recovering meaning my brain was functioning again but I knew it was still a possibility I was going to die or that my kidneys would never work again.  I was terrified I was going to die on my husband. Before my husband met me, he lost his partner of 9 years to cancer and I did not want him going through that again. Day 10 my blood pressure was still a steady 180/120 and NOTHING would bring it down which was still concerning but they released me anyways from the hospital. I just had to continue going to dialysis until my kidney function came back (if ever).  By the grace of our higher power I did dialysis 3 more times at a dialysis center and my blood work came back great. Meaning no more dialysis. 

I had another appointment with my kidney doctor a couple weeks later to ensure everything was going ok and it was but I have been warned, I can not go back to my old ways of drinking and pill popping and I have to eat healthy (low sodium at least). And guess what. I have had no desire to go back to that lifestyle whatsoever. I walked out of that hospital and never smoked a cigarette again (never thought id EVER be able to drop that habit) and iv quit my drinking habit.  My life has improved DRAMATICALLY. my husband says Im a new person now. Im much much happier and he says I smile all the time now - something I never did before. Were more in love than we've ever been and it's amazing. I cherish life and want to live a healthy lifestyle with him for as long as I can. my doc said I could go back to moderate drinking in 6 months  if I wanted to but we all know how that goes.  Im done with that lifestyle. Also being at work sober every day is actually AWESOME. Didn't think that'd happen. Im self employed and found myself returning to work drunk as hell at 2pm allll the time. Not good when dealing with clients.  Thanks for listening if you made it this far lol !

I heard once that the definition of ""honesty"" is: straightforwardness about what is real. 

What I told my doctors and therapists for 10 years was that I drank because I was angry, and this or that person's behavior made me angry. I was absolutely convinced I was being honest, but it wasn't real. So they treated me for anger but I kept drinking.

Then I learned alcoholism had made me insane, and I was unable to tell what was real and what was not. I was absolutely convinced people were pissing me off on purpose, especially my family. I completely ignored my role or twisted words to make it look like I wasn't at fault.

With sobriety came sanity, and the truth is that anger is my reaction to fear. I was afraid of disappointing people, having them judge me or look down on me, and especially call me a liar. I dont think I'm the only alcoholic who preferred to be angry than scared.

All my doctors were treating the wrong thing because I couldn't be honest.

Sanity gave me the ability to be honest about my fear so I could deal with the real problem: me and my attitudes and beliefs towards the world.

And like magic, I'm not as angry anymore either.

If the medical cure for depression, anxiety or anger is not working for you, try the spiritual cure for alcoholism.",4

I thought I kinda had this thing figured out for a while, but now that I have a chance to reflect, I feel like I'm only now beginning to put what drove me to stop drinking past me. If someone asks me why I don't drink I don't feel like I'm being found out anymore, I can just be myself, the person I am now and in the future. Yes there was a past me, but I'm not that person anymore. Different guy.

So I guess I can look forward to new revelations along upcoming months and years. Honestly I think it's just part of evolving as a person, regular personal growth, not some spirit of sobriety making me change as a person. BUT alcohol is not in the way of that anymore, and I can enjoy the ride with a clear mind.

To anyone out there struggling, my thought for today: what are all the things you have potential for, when booze isn't a prohibiting factor?

You have all been a part of this - this community, everyone who ever commented on my post, or posted an uplifting message to someone else, has made a difference in my life. Literally.

I didn’t think I had a problem.  I started drinking regularly when my ex and I split. It helped to « escape » for a few hours. I only ever drank on the weekends or when I didn’t have to work the next day. I’ve never drank in the morning or felt like I needed to have a drink. So I think I’ve been able to convince myself that it isn’t a problem for awhile. 
When I drink, however, I can’t usually stop. This has lead to extremely risky situations for myself. I’ve never driven while drunk (thank God!) but I’ve woken up in the ER, I’ve woken up with a man in my bed and no recollection of how he got there. I’ve woken up in a mans bed and no recollection of how I got there etc. You get the idea. 

This happened for the last time two weeks ago. Last Saturday morning I was still drunk when I woke up. 

My friends and family don’t know I drink like that, they certainly don’t know I hook up with random strangers when I get like that. It’s not me. 

So anyway, long story short, I am not going to drink tonight and I’m going to make some popcorn, watch a movie, read some and maybe play some games. 

I know there are others out there who are not drinking tonight so I’m just saying heyyy 😇

Very happy to not be drinking tonight. Hope you are too.",9

I’m spending today cleaning up our yard and my barbecue stuff so I can cook up for my friends and family. I’m left wondering how many of my mates will show up though. 
Since quitting the booze i have only hung out with my drinking buddies once, and I feel as though maybe I’m an outcast now. It might all be in my head, but the drinking/smoking/snorting culture among my mates is pretty well ingrained. I left it behind so I could become a better person, husband, and father to our incoming baby. 
In full fairness, I have avoided going to the weekly drinking sessions, so my buddies might feel as though I’ve abandoned them too. I guess I’m just feeling a bit weird about it all. Everything else in my life is going so well. My relationships, my health, my powerlifting training, but I’m just nervous about next weekend. 
Anyway, sorry if this is hard to read, I’m on mobile. 
Hope you’re all doing well. May your coffee be strong and your couch comfy.

- no more shaking hands. 
- I can eat again without getting sick or running to the bathroom
- I can sleep and wake up early and rested
- I remember conversations
- I have energy
- my blood pressure and heart rate are coming back down to normal levels
- my hair is growing back
- my skin is glowing
- my sex life is so much better
- my house is clean and I'm keeping it clean
- I enjoy being awake
- my relationships are improving
- I've got a great new job
- I don't go into withdrawals every Sunday when I'm out of booze 
- my daughter actually brings her friends around now that I'm not a mess
- I have a great friend who is getting sober and we check in every day and support each other through cravings or hard times
- I'm not passed out on the couch by 2pm

The list goes on and on 

Thank you to everyone here. The support is incredible.

To all you thinking about quitting, I'm happy to talk to you any time.

I certainly don't appreciate them more now that I'm sober, with nothing to dull the noise, the smell, and distract from the sloppy drunks.

I understand and respect that she wants me to be friends with her friends, I just wish it could be at a different venue.

Alcohol is a depressent and without it I can be the best me and contribute to make this world a happier place even within my limited locus of control.

I realized that when I want to catch up with an old friend, meet someone outside of work, or ask someone on a date, the most natural thing for me to suggest is that we ""get a drink"" or ""grab a drink."" I've never drank as an adult due to family history/past experiences with family's alcoholism. recently I've watched a few friends start and thrive in recovery, and I can't unsee how alcohol-centric my social life has been in the past, even as a non-drinker.

how can I make casual plans that don't assume that the other person drinks? should I always suggest coffee or a walk instead? is there a way to rephrase ""get a drink"" in a way that makes it clear that although we might meet at a restaurant/bar, I won't be drinking an alcoholic beverage and i don't expect them to either?

Thanks",5

I had no issue not drinking on the monitor ***because I knew I couldn't!*** Of course, after the DUI scare etc., I'm back to drinking - NOT while driving - NEVER again.

So I'm thinking something like Naltrexone might work like the monitor did.  But (and this is hysterical) I'm super afraid of medicine.  Yeah, I'll drink enough wine to float a battleship but don't even have Tylenol in my cabinet.  I'm afraid of side-effects, especially weight gain.  I'm prone to depression/anxiety (hence the happy juice) and don't want to take anything to exacerbate either condition.

I’m celebrating one week for the one billionth time (I know, I’ve counted), but that’s not the point of this post...

I’ve got some anger issues. It has certainly resided as I’ve aged, but every time I stop drinking (again - one billion times), my anger comes back out. I’m pissed at other drivers, I’m pissed at my boss, I’m pissed at my family, I’m pissed that I’m not drinking, etc. etc. Perhaps not coincidentally, I’m also a huge fan of hard rock (the good stuff - not that pussy crap they call rock these days). My runs (the exercise kind, not the hungover ‘oops I crapped myself’ kind) were always done to a backdrop of Slipknot, Tool, Panera, RATM, and Nine Inch Nails.

I haven’t felt the anger too much this past week, and I’ve certainly been more introspective than I used to be sober (thanks therapy!). Anyhow, this is getting a bit long, so let’s get to the point...I went for a run this morning and queue’d up the usual running mix. But as I started listening to a little Tool, the thought popped into my mind - what if I make the lyrics about alcohol? For example:

RATM - Killing in the Name Of: “Fuck you I won’t do what you tell me!”

NIN - Only: “There is no you, there is only me.”

Tool - Hooker With a Penis: “Fuck you buddy!”

And let me say, once I cracked this code, I had the best run I have had in years! I feel so amazing right now and actually quite calm. I’m intrigued to see if the next time I’m feeling the anger build I can point it at alcohol, which, frankly I should be angry at for taking so many years from me.

Wishing you all a great sober day!

Waitress: Can I get you all something to drink besides water?

Friend 2: The Hazy IPA on tap for me.   
My Husband: I'll have the same IPA.\*   
Me, anxious, kind of sweating: I'm good with water. 

And that was it! No one asked about my choice of drinking water, no one brought up that I wasn't drinking, and we had a great meal with our friends. It's amazing how you can get in your own head and create scenarios that make life more difficult. It felt so great to be present in the moment and enjoy the time together.

2019-11-08 10:04:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dtgmpo/friday_thoughts/,Friday thoughts,"Hi all,
I have a lot of thoughts going through my mind today as I have reached 15 days without a drop of alcohol. I have tried to ""regulate"" myself in the past, but it always fails me. Over the summer, I went 70-ish days without alcohol and felt GREAT. My downfall is always social events. I went to a baseball game where there was tailgating beforehand. I thought, I have been so strong for the past 70-ish days, I can have one drink and stop. I was wrong. I had way more than one drink and then went right back to my binging ways. 
In the past, I have reached out to my family for help. My sister was an extreme alcoholic and was about 7 months sober a few years ago. But she's back to her alcoholic ways. About a year ago, I reached out to her for help, since she went through this before. However, I learned quickly that I cannot rely on her for support because she is back to her ways. A few months ago, when I started my 70 day free journey, I went up to visit my parents for a weekend. I went up there on a Saturday night. My family and I had a baby shower to attend (for my cousin) the next morning. I was extremely nervous about visiting and staying with my family (mainly my siblings) because they are huge drinkers. They find the smallest reason to drink. So, that Saturday morning, my dad texted me ""We are grilling out for dinner tonight. Bring your own drinks"". I wrote back ""Thanks dad, I'm not drinking though so I'll be fine"" and he replied with ""okay."" I felt good. Okay great, he's not questioning me. However, as soon as I arrived at my parents house, my mom immediately goes ""so what's this about not drinking?"" in an extremely rude manner. I just told her that I wanted to cut down and I don't want to get drunk the night before my cousin's baby shower. All night long she kept trying to pour me glasses of wine. I declined them all. My spouse, who did drink a little bit that night, also kept declining when my mom told her to drink more. When my spouse would leave the table, my mom secretly poured more wine into her glass. It was ridiculous but I was so proud of myself for staying strong. Fast forward to two months later, I stayed with my parents the night of the baseball game where I lost myself again. I was drunk and embarrassed. The next day, after leaving to go back home, I texted my Mom ""I'm sorry I was so drunk, thank you for letting me stay with you."" and she wrote back ""don't apologize, it was nice to see you having fun and relaxing."" That hit me hard. Fun and relaxing because I was drinking? Am I not fun and relaxing when I'm sober? 
Why do people, especially family, get so weird when it comes to alcohol? I've rarely seen my mom shit faced but she does drink every now and then..mainly on the weekends. However, like I mentioned before, my family finds every little reason to drink when we are together and it is extremely toxic. I'm really not looking forward to Thanksgiving.

My wife knows I need to get sober, but she is mourning that part of me. The wine by a fire, the long talks that drunk me is so ready to engage in. I know my friends will feel the same way. So do I, for that matter.

On Monday, I ended a relationship with someone who I really care about, because I knew it was not a healthy scenario for me to be in.

The week was busy, and I was managing okay. Then today, the thought popped up: I’m having few friends over - we should have wine! Let’s get drunk! It’s a break up; I’m allowed.

It’s crazy how my knee jerk reaction is still to drink, even though I can identify my difficulties with alcohol, and how easily I can try to sway myself.

I just want to remind you all that this sucks. I don't get a happy buzz, I just have headaches and cravings. I'll feel sick in the morning, even if I guzzle down water. I'll have blood shot eyes, I'll reek of booze. I won't be witty or sharp or funny, like I usually am, because my mind feels shot and we're tired.

It's almost 6am where I am, I'm not asleep because alcohol just fucks with my rhythm. And when I say rhythm, I mean the ins and outs of my life. I don't sleep. I don't have to eat. I skip work. I throw up. I lie and make up excuses.

If you're reading this because you just started your journey to sobriety, you made a damn good choice. Don't give up now. 

I know I need to quit. I'm blacking out all the time, waking up at random times, pockets of my life missing in my memory. Who did I fuck? How did I get here? Was I okay?  Were they okay? I don't even know.

My time is coming, because I feel sick and tired and I hate how blood shot my eyes are. I've already had a DUI and I have to go cold turkey very soon and I'm scared. I don't have shaky hands yet. But I sit at work with my frustrations and think, I want a drink. Like that'll really solve anything.

If you've gone sober, and you're reading this, then you've done well for yourself. I want to remind you of the rat race and its misery. I hate the burn it gives me when I take a shot. I hate the numbness that isn't happiness that I'm chasing. I hate missing the job I love because I had too much and I'm too hungover to be on time. I hate the lapses in my existence, because alcohol literally erased it. I hate thinking if I can't quit soon, maybe I'll die from this. I hate worrying about my father, a high functioning alcoholic, and our fate together. What's it like if our liver fucking rots inside of our bodies? How ugly is that?

I want to quit. I need to quit. I'm terrified. Please be stronger than me tonight. Do not drink today for me.",44

I’ve lost 20lbs, rebuilt trust with my kids after a decade of hard drinking, and continue to work on the personal shit that caused my alcoholism in the first place without hiding behind the booze. 

So, yeah, lots of self reflection. 

The other thing I did was look at how much I was spending on alcohol per week. A daily bottle or two of wine plus or minus the 6-pack sure adds up.

Was drinking about a fifth and a few beers or a twelve pack a day for a few months, but haven't gone more than a day without for probably the last 5 years. Six pack/Half a bottle a night was light. Depressed and haven't felt up to really talk to people much in person (mood wings are getting better, but were really bad first few days. Pretty sure as soon as I talk to anyone in person I'll break down, but I have a friend who has a very similar past and is sober and has been giving support over messages). But at night when I can't sleep and the self loathing has been bad, been lurking here. Decided to make a post.

Physically I feel way better. Mentally I'm a a Jenga tower 3 moves from the falling over. Evening/nights are bad. Realize now I have a sever lack of coping skills and was drinking to escape self hate due to years of drinking, as well as sever depression. But I'm determined not to drink. I'm tired of hurting people just so I can escape my own problems.

Therapy is on the table but atm I just am focused on surviving work and not drinking. I know I probably need it but I feel like I'm gonna have a mental breakdown just thinking of talking to someone in person about my issues.

Well, that's the case for me anyway. Got that yucky awful feeling inside and it won't go away? Let me just go and grab that magic potion from the nearest bottleshop and drink those feelings away, push them right down. 

But during my many stints in rehabs and hospitals I learned about distress tolerance and I'm getting better at it every day. And I just wanted to put it out there cause maybe some of you haven't got a clue what it's about and some of you may be a lot better at it than me.

Basically you just learn to sit with the uncomfortable feelings and ride them out. I found deep slow breathing, muscle relaxation and centering myself extremely helpful. This works for mild to moderate uncomfortable feelings for me. Acceptance and faith are another source of strength. Not faith as in religion as such but rather faith in the universe, that everything will turn out alright. 

But sometimes I still get overwhelmed. Loneliness is the hardest one for me and the most difficult to sit with. It brings up huge abandonment fears that can quickly swallow me up and make me reach for the bottle.

I went to a show tonight with my sponsor. I chose him because hes an old school punk, he was going to shows before i was born. 

I was surrounded by the scent of weed and beer, much of which was spilled on me. Despite that i had zero desire to drink or smoke (quit weed around the time i started drinking) and had a fucking blast in the pit. I had to go to the bar to buy water and a red bull, i saw the bartender pouring some shots and for a split second thought ""i could take a shot right now and my sponsor would never know."" Then i realized, first of all wtf am i going to do with A shot, secondly it costs $10 and it would trigger the phenomenon of craving leading me to getting wasted either at the show or at home afterwards so my sponsor wouldnt know. Either way i wouldve wasted my money on drinking instead of buying merch.

All in all im proud of myself and its nice actually being concious enough to remember the headliner and also not be falling over in the pit. And on top of that i have pretty bad anxiety so i never thought i could jump into the pit sober, turns out its way better when you can actually balance and see straight.

When I drink in the second situation I purposely drink several very strong drinks.

Maybe sharing this will help. I can reread my post here next time I feel a trigger situation building.

&#x200B;

I turned 21 in April earlier this year, I've never had a problem with alcohol before but things slowly got out of hand. I would start to binge drink after class almost nightly and once summer rolled around I was still drinking relatively heavily. This would range from 6-8 beers every other night before I felt satisfied. Fast forward to this semester and I've been going through a 12 pack for what feels like most days of the week, although I know I took breaks for a few days at a time with the help of marijuana and me forgetting about alcohol. Now, with no access to the substance (attending school in an illegal state, too awkward to meet many people in that scene) I've definitely started drinking a little bit more, with some nights hitting 16 beers (this is incredibly rare).

&#x200B;

Everything has hit me and I realized I'm on a horrible track. I've been lurking this sub all day and I'm very ready to quit. I'm just scared of running into harsh withdrawal symptoms and potential DT's. I know I haven't been drinking for too long in my life, but I was still drinking way more than I should have. I was planning on meeting with the on-campus health center to hopefully find out what will work best tomorrow. Luckily, after a day of not drinking I don't feel cravings in the slightest and I'm actually feeling quite disgusted with alcohol.

&#x200B;

My main reasons for posting this, and I know everybody is different, is that I was wondering  if my withdrawals would have the potential of causing seizures/hallucinations? I've tried looking at graphs but they all state daily, continuous drinking. I only drink at night and its never gone for more than a few days at a time without a day or two break. I make my money delivery driving out here, and needless to say I'm absolutely horrified with that being a possibility. I know that there may not be any medical professionals on here, but I guess I'm trying to ease my nerves. Thank you everyone and good luck!",4

Tuesday night drunk turned into all day Wednesday drunk and passed out for half of the day.

I'm at my wit's end and this is my desperate prayer. I'm an awful person when I'm drinking, and it's costing me health and wealth. It keeps me in a shell where I can't be truthful to others. Tonight I almost bought liquor but at the last minute said out loud how insane that was because it has never worked in over a decade of trying. I need to change at a fundamental level to stop this for good, but I don't believe that change can come from within - I am praying for the mercy of God to forgive and change me.

I was abstinent for almost 6 months this year but I found myself obsessing over alcohol and living in fear of it. I’ve been listening to Annie Grace’s podcast and seeing a substance counselor and really working on mindfulness. This forum has also been fantastic help. 

Right now I’m trying to work out what moderation would look like for me, but it seems so hard to find examples. The world feels really geared towards the black and white mentality that says you’re either an “alcoholic” and therefore can never drink again, or a “non-alcoholic” and you can therefore not think about it and just drink forever. 
I’d really like to hear from folks on this forum who have practiced moderation (even if that wasn’t a forever situation). 

Any insight?

(I’ll also just add that I’m currently basically abstinent but with exceptions for special occasions. So I’m not currently struggling with feeling like I’m missing out or needing to drink every day, or even at every single social circumstance. )",4

After my shit day yesterday, I slept poorly and was still mentally spinning all morning. I gradually worked through it, chatted with a friend and spoke to my husband about it. I did what I could and now I have to leave it at that. I am better now. Because I slept in this morning (hiding in bed wishing the world would go away), my work from home day started and ended late, which was fine by me because it meant no temptation to drink.

Even through the very high stress of last night and today, the thought of drinking was actually repellant to me. I was genuinely freaking out and when I thought about drinking, all I could picture was how much worse I would be and feel. This time around, there was nothing appealing about it and I am thankful for that.

Since this weekend, it’s been every other day. I’d usually have a nip or two of hard liquor, some other times a moderate amount of wine, other days beer. I’ve had an entire liter of rum in a day a couple of months ago, and had the worst hangover.

This hangover feels different.

A friend of mine and I drank a ton of wine within about two hours. He had around 8 glasses, I had around 4 or 5. Mind you, I’m a bit of a lightweight. After a really embarrassing moment between us, I somehow walked home. I recommend that no one does this - I was worried for my friends’ safety if he did drive, despite his insistence. 

Feeling emotional, I choked back about half a beer that I had in the fridge when I got home. Within an hour, I was profusely vomiting all over the side of my bed while trying to make it to the bathroom. Yesterday was okay, aside from some lasting lightheaded ness, but today it feels like I have a full on flu. Woke up with bad, painful, and bloating acid reflux in my upper stomach. I feel cold and shivery - yet was able to catch some sleep. Stomach feels completely uneasy.

I fell asleep for a few hours, woke up still shaking and cold. No matter what, I cannot seem to get warm. If I eat anything, my stomach balloons and acid reflux comes back. I feel slightly more aggressive and annoyed than usual.

I believe I may have, or am developing an issue. I need help getting sober and staying sober. I don’t want this to be a cycle.

Was sober for 90 days. Fell off the proverbial wagon. Want to get back on. Need support. 

Will try to condense my backstory. 
Sure, I partied in college. I was a casual drinker for 20+ years after. Could always control it. Food was my drug of choice. Ballooned to 430+ lbs. Had bariatric surgery. dropped weight to 255lbs. Was warned not to trade one addiction for another. Didn't believe them. Now, I do. Stress in personal life and work drove me over the edge. In 18 months went from being an almost non-drinker to drinking a bottle of whiskey a day. It almost cost me my job/career. was getting the shakes and chills daily.  gave it up cold turkey and joined a secular group of AA (No offense to any believers). Did 90+ days. then relapsed. I feel like I am back at rock bottom. I spoke to someone in my AA group and I am going tonight. I decided I need therapy to address personal demons. I went to an appointment with a new therapist. I also made an appointment with my former therapist. I think I am going to go back to him.

I am single and am geographically isolated from friends and family (who are overwhelmingly supportive).

I've become wittier since I can actually follow a thought with another one. I feel more interesting as a person, and funnier. I can actually be with people instead of just blathering my drunken bullshit.

I do not miss hangovers

Some people don't really accept that I'm not drinking or maybe it hasn't sunken in yet. This isn't my first attempt, but it actually feels pretty solid this time around. I have a trip coming up with some friends (old drinking buddies) and I'm trying to figure out how to roll with this as the hotels are already bought. I do want to go to the beach. I might just do my own thing the whole time. Could be an interesting test. I've gone to shows and not had any trouble. I almost feel like seeing how they handle it to see if I should keep hanging out with them. (We don't live in the same city.)

I honestly haven't really wanted a drink lately. I think it's because I am so incredibly disgusted with what I became during my last bender and I know that each time I go back there the chances of death, injury, arrest, fire, etc, increases. Though as usual I will stay vigilant.

This same thing happened with weed back in my late 20s. I just didn't like it anymore and stopped accepting it. So far, I have noticed that most people truly don't care what you are or are not ingesting. Unless you're smoking crack in front of them of course. But there are always the people that want you to remain the same to them, as a fellow drinker.

I look forward to continuing this and seeing what else I can see about the nature of it. I'm certain there is way more.

I woke up one day and decided I no longer needed alcohol in my life. Up that point I hardly ever drank. I was a two drink drunk. No Alcohol tolerance. I would go from a ""woo"" girl (girl who always says woooooo when drunk) to flat on my ass. I was the butt of all the jokes to all my friends with several changing my name in their phones to ""Youguysimsodrunkrightnow"" something I would say often in my early 20s.

In October of 2018 my good friend (over 15 years of friendship) asked me to be Maid of Honor in her wedding.  I accepted without much thought to how I would survive a Bridal Shower, a 3 day Bachlorette Party and a wedding without a drop of alcohol. This is how I did it/ things that happened:

**Bridal Shower**\- This was the easiest. I hosted this event. It was a breakfast brunch. There was a mimosa bar. There was a plethora of N/A options.   I drank orange juice and tea. No one cared/ noticed the slightest.  I was very busy being the Emcee and hosting the games. 

**3 day Bachlorette-** This was a road trip, 3 day weekend, hosted by the other bridesmaids with some of mural friends and family members of the bride in attendance.  They had planned it all to be a wild night of debauchery and drinking. The first night we went out to dinner. I got my own drink from the bar, a mocktail that a babied for all of dinner. We went out to the club, I bought two quick rounds of drinks for everyone and then proceeded to dance and drink my diet coke/ sprite all night long. Pretty Simple. Had to drink copious amounts of caffeine to stay awake, I did it though. 

In the morning I was woken up by one of the bridesmaids demanding that I do 1 shot before 10am or 10 shots before 1 pm. I told her ""no"". A Few minutes later the same bridesmaid got all in my face once again saying ""tick tock 1 shot before 10am or 10 shots before 1pm"".  MIND YOU, one of the bridesmaids was visibly pregnant at this point and no one hounded her to take the shots. I told her much more firmly ""Hell no""  About 30 Minutes later, again, reminder I still haven't taken a shot and this time I was angry and responded ""I said no. drop it""  I eat breakfast and wouldn't you know I'm standing  there in front of the sink rinsing off my plate when I'm handing a shot of ?? (no clue) by my friend the bride- who knows I don't drink. ""Just one drink won't kill you."" I hold up the filled drink and when everyone goes to take the shot i go right over the shoulder and into the sink. This was probably the coolest moment of my life ♥ (lol).

Afterwards, all of the bridesmaids thoroughly drunk, or at least getting there we go to a day club. Which is basically a night club with a pool and everyone is in Bikinis. We have a private cabana, there are drinks and mixers. I make several of my own drinks sans the booze and enjoy my sugar high. I dance on the pool island. I ride a floaty. Everyone is drunk. I am sober, everyone looks so sloppy. This happens for the majority of the day. We come back just before  sunset, and a day in the sun and everyone drinking like fish is a bad combo. Everyone is sick. I play mom to the bride a little bit. I take a shower. I find a way to entertain myself while everyone is passed out. 

The next morning everyone is hurting from the daytime bender.  We go to an elegant tea party. I'm fancy as hell- I'm wearing a fascinator! (I actually enjoyed the part the most) Pinkies up if you're sober. I am!   We shop, we drive home. 

**Rehearsal Dinner**\- A buffet, with a buffet of drink choices. Diet Coke please and thank you. 

**Wedding Day**\- Started out with 5 Bridesmaids drinking 7 bottles of Champagne between them. I am not joking. Bridesmaid from Bachlorette this time ""offered me a drink"" and I said ""No thank you""  I was very busy, running around, coordinating all the vendors. Make up and Hair and I had no time to eat let alone drink alcohol. During the ceremony the bridesmaids managed to put their bra flasks away enough to walk down the aisle and stand for 20 minutes without incident. We take pictures. We go to cocktail hour. Someone pukes on the dance floor. It's cleaned.  We have Dinner.  I had to give a toast. I wrote and memorized a funny and heartfelt toast. Everyone got the jokes, the bride cried. It was amazing.  I actually had planned to bring up a N/A drink with me. I forgot, I was busy like I said. I asked everyone to toast to the couple and then toast again because I forgot a drink. I turn it into a joke. I'm so absent minded I forgot one, everyone laughs.  Best man stumbles over his toast, it was badly written and poorly executed. I sip my metaphorical tea from my seat.  I enjoy the  rest of the night pretty much uneventful. I take home leftovers of cake from the kitchen as the caterings clean up. Cake was good in the morning when I woke up without a hangover.

TL:DR People pushed Alcohol on me many times. I didn't drink. They were sloppy and I was sober.",7

It first started when some colleagues offered me a drink after a day of work on Saturday night, it was awesome after some sips, I was talkative I wasn't shy at that moment I felt like a different person and I was, at that moment I was no longer myself.

Passed some days after that, I started taking bottle of alcohol to school, cachaça to be precise, so my friends would think I was cool, everyday the same thing, drinking till I couldn't control myself in school or after it, I embarrassed myself countless times, and I didn't care about it I just wanted get drunk and ""be cool"", it was October's 2015 at this time.   Fast forward December has come, and I were fired because I missed work and was hungover. I was unemployed from 2016 to October 2018,  almost  three years, I was depressed, sad and still I didn't stop drinking.

October 2018 new job yay, end of first week colleague asked if I drink, ""hell yeah"" I replied. I would drink every weekend with them I didn't have money for food, clothes or nothing else just alcohol parties and even started doing drugs. So I started dating someone around March 2019, i would drink  before meeting her so I didn't feel shy around her. She would drink too but not like me, she was controled. First month with her was awesome untill I drank too much and we had a big fight so it started a loop of 6 months of huge fights and breake ups because of my alcohol problem, I even stopped drinking 1 month was awesome no fight no hungover I was happy.

But I started drinking again and couldn't stop no more, because of that I lost my job after 1 year, lost my girlfriend of 6 months 5 days ago she is in really bad shape now because she has depression I made her situation worse  I am really sad and sorry for everyone who I ve hurt. But now I am starting a new journey now I can see my problem I can't take her back but I'll compensate everyone who I made cry, so wish me luck and pray for me. 

I just wanted to vent so I hope this is the best place, thanks in advance.

Today I got the 2000 drinks passed notification. Which is crazy to me as 1 I was a binge drinker not a daily drinker. 

And 2 that it hasn't been a full year yet.

But hard drinking 8-15 drinks Thursday Friday and Saturday plus 1 or two on work nights adds the fuck up.

I thought I was being smart by drinking low calorie cheap liquor as a result I haven't lost much weight and based on the app saved about 2k = 1$ a drink.

In 15 days I'll have 365.

- not having hangovers makes life 500000x better
- semi-related, I have so much more TIME now! 
- my sleep is better (though I’ve also cut out caffeine) 
- people are really into the concept of “getting a drink” and “buying you a drink”. The concepts are literally ingrained in our society now and when you don’t drink, it’s really bizarre
- going out to dance is still just as, if not more, fun. My friends that did drink ended up crying at the end of the night and screaming about how the night sucked, while I had enjoyed the night the whole time 
- almost every singe guy’s dating profile has something about drinking in it as if it’s cool, but it’s starting to be a turnoff for me. If a really big part of your life is drinking a substance that’s poison, idk dude (not judging since of course I’ve drank a ton in my life, but it’s just how I feel now

I have been lurking on this sub, and all your posts have been so inspiring!
 I started by cutting out any hard alcohol, and that was fine for a while. Then this week I decided to cut back on wine. I get so used to having a nightcap, it is such an easy routine to fall into. 
It makes me think of back in my dieting days. Like it's some pass/fail thing, and if you had a sweet or something you were ""bad"" so you mine as well just try again tomorrow because today is scrapped and have that second glass anyways. 
I have decided I'm not trying to deny myself, I'm not punishing myself, I'm not BAD, but I am actively choosing sobriety instead. 
I have been dealing with some mental health issues. I'm taking my meds, and I'm talking to people, but I feel like the alcohol isn't helping me at all. 
I don't plan on quitting drinking forever. I just dont want a glass of wine after dinner to be an everyday thing for me anymore. It makes me gain weight, it makes me sore and tired, and I want all the things that sobriety has to offer me! I want to get better sleep, have more energy during the day, not have this overhanging sense of guilt all the time. 
Today will be day one. I dont know what my goal is after today, but today I wanted to actively set an intention of having ZERO drinks. So I decided to tell all you guys about it.",13

Booze hasn't been on my mind in the slightest. Once the cycle was broken and I faced my demon's there has been zero drive for it. I scared myself shitless and I knew even before that it had to go.

My other fear is that this might be a cooping mechanism as I am having a hard time being passionate about anything beyond moving forward. I guess I will have to wait and see when my life drops in to a ground state as I am always on the move right now.

I’m absolutely sure that I am not the first to bring this up but I just need to vent. At a training about physical/mental wellness yesterday, we got into small groups to discuss ways we can practice self care. Immediately, a woman in our group expressed how she enjoys a few glasses on wine everyday after work while she is making dinner for her family. And so many in the group actively agreed with her. I get it. There are people who can control their alcohol consumption and not fall down the proverbial hole of alcoholism. But I just hate how we promote this behavior, as if it is perfectly normal to down a bottle of wine or two each night as “self care” - BS, this same line of reasoning moved me from a “few” glasses on wine a night to a few more shots of vodka to a half bottle to even sleep. 

Am I bitter because I can’t control myself? Maybe. But I feel like for myself and for many this culture of wine-mom/not-mom-but-can-relate is pulling people into the idea that drinking a little too much is fine, we all do it! 

It is just horrible.  

I so wanted to say something at that small group. I wanted to warn others of the slippery slope. But I felt ashamed about my own abilities to not just have *a* glass of wine.

Yes, the normies can probably enjoy a glass of wine with a nice dinner. Great. But. Can we cancel the normalization of drinking every day?",262

And I can't decide if I should let it out. I used to drink a lot more than I believe my wife and family know. You know the drill. I had gotten very good at sneaking drinks. Lots of them. I've never told anyone this. So even though the people closest to me knew my drinking was problematic, I have no reason to believe they knew just *how* problematic it actually was. 

I'm approaching the one year mark and doing a lot of reflecting. There are big milestones I'm surpassing. There are so many areas where my life has gotten immeasurably better. Yet, I don't feel like I have anyone to share it with. There's no one other than me who really knows how far I've come, how big of a deal this was, how serious the struggle, how great the pride. 

Do I open up about it? I go back and forth. Part of me says I need to come clean. But then I worry about what my wife will think. The betrayal she might feel knowing how much I was sneaking around. And to what end? Just so I can get some external validation? Just so someone can pat me on the back and tell me how great I've done? So, as you can sense, the other part of me says to let it go. Keep moving. No one else *has* to know where I've been. Where I am and where I'm going are the only things that count. 

Not so much looking for anyone to tell me what to do. Rather, wondering who here might have gone through a similar internal debate? What mental models or frameworks did you use to think through it? Where did you land? Do you have any regrets?",7

It occurs to me I'm still setting xx day goals, as if there will be some reward at the end of 30, 60, 90, one year, whatever.   
I mean, I might easily remember next Halloween that it has been a year, or notice at the end of NOvember when I break a past record (30), but that's not the end goal, and there will be no reward. This isn't about willpower, resisting temptation, fighting cravings... that will never work in the end, at least, not for me. 

This is about changing my head, and my lifestyle. I'm not going to get a number of days sober badge (no knock against everybody who is, I totally get it, and you guys are awesome) and I'm not going to keep posting about xx days without a drink (again, great on all of you, seriously, but that kind of thinking is only setting me up to wait on that reward at the end, forever.)

Instead of fighting or resisting urges, I have to learn to live with them. Instead of willpower like it is an extra set of crunches with a hot fudge sundae waiting at the end, I need calm acceptance. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and the desires and temptations will be with me until the end of time. 10 days, 100 days, 1000 days...whatever. This is about now, and will always be about now. 

If I fail horribly, you all can set me straight (and I hope you will) but for now I'm gonna try to make it about the day I'm actually doing, not the past or the future.  No offense meant or implied, you guys are so damn inspiring in all the ways, but being here now is enough of a challenge, and all I can really deal with. IWNDWYT.",7

As part of routine bloodwork with my Endocrinologist, I found out yesterday that my kidney function is severely impaired.  On my last lab work in June, my kidneys were functioning just fine.

I was set up with an urgent referral to a nephrologist this morning and he has ordered a huge list of tests.  I don't know what has happened, but surely continuing to consume alcohol has played at least a minor role.

This morning I also called the local hospital addictions outpatient program that I attended two years ago and asked to come back and do the program again.  I have an appointment set up for an assessment next week.

I really think I can't afford any more relapses.  My body can't take anymore.

I will not drink with you today and I hope I can keep that up going forward this time.

Edit:  Just got the results from the quick lab work that was ordered yesterday (didn't mention this above).  Things have improved quite a bit over the past week or so since I got the initial blood work done.  Of course my addicted brain is going to try to see this as an opportunity to pick up a bottle today.  I can feel it already, and I hate it.  Just because the numbers have improved doesn't mean I'm out of the woods, it just means the situation might not be as dire as it looked yesterday.  I'm going to try to fight this urge today.",13

Then that drink had another. 

I have been drinking since a car accident in 2013. I had plenty of reasons in my life to start drinking before that. But something about the looseness that came with being drunk, helped me justify another bottle after the last one was empty. 

I drink with my husband. He's a big guy. You have to keep up with the banter, so naturally I tried with the drinking too. 

The drinking turned into a crutch for a long crippled emotional and mental being (me).

The jokes started before people had the chance to notice. If I joked about being a functional alcoholic, then no one would seriously think I was drinking more than my fair share. 

It wasn't breakfast beer everyday, or drinkypoos the moment I got home. It was a 40 on a Friday, Thursday, Tuesday, maybe Saturday if there was cash left over. 

Alcohol saw me through six years of school. Recently, a series of alcohol induced poor decisions, forced me to change. The beginning of October I contracted gastroenteritis from a contaminated bag of ceaser salad. The real devils lettuce. 

I was in the hospital for two days, puking out anything that touched my lips for eight, hallucinating for one, pooping blood on another, 10 days before food was an option. Getting up from the recliner to go to the bathroom was a choice, not a necessity. 

But I chose to get up every. Single. Time. 

I had a sober October. I remember most of it. I don't remember much of the last 6 years. 

Last night I had a drink. That drink had another. This morning was a tidal wave of sick. Mind, body and self. I realized I had a choice, to also get out of this (proverbial) chair.

The first couple of weeks were hard. I was a daily drinker, but not super heavy but uncomfortable for me. 2 beers or glasses of wine each night during the week. Could be up to 6 drinks per day on the weekends. I quit because my anxiety was starting to get out of control. And I’d started going to couples counseling with my husband to nip some things in the bud before they got out of control. I was snippy all the time and generally an unhappy person. I didn’t feel like a good version of me, let alone the best version of me. And I have a 3.5 year old son and am terrified of setting him down the path of addiction just by witnessing my own. So on October 7 I said no more. I told people I’d started sober October a little late. I said I was going to abstain for 30 days. 

31 days later and I can feel things subtly shifting. It’s become much easier to not drink. I wouldn’t say I crave alcohol, but I think about it. I genuinely like wine and craft beer. But it doesn’t spark joy anymore. My head is clearer. I’m not annoyed when my son wakes up early and subsequently wakes me up early. My sleep has improved immensely. I don’t lay awake anxious and my daytime anxiety has also diminished, although it’s still there some days. My skin looks amazing. But I’m also washing it before bed most nights now... And I’ve lost weight. I immediately started tracking my eating so I know it’s not all due to not drinking, but I’m more motivated to stick with a healthy lifestyle by not drinking. I’d usually find a reason to say fuck it. 

I’m extremely proud of myself and excited to see where my journey goes. I’ve got some tricky situations coming up, but I’m feeling more confident each day. 

Thanks to everyone who shares their story and their struggles. It’s inspiring and it also helps to know that I’m not the only one going through this shit.

The top offender is my father who always comments on my drinking. Now, you may say, you deserve it, you are an alcoholic. That is if you didn’t know that my father drinks, and my sister and her husband drink, and have much worse repercussions to their drinking than me such as multiple duis, major scenes in their neighborhood, work, family, etc... but for some reason, I am always the focus. I’ve only seen them once since I stopped and it was at a bd party at my sister’s. I was actually very sick that day and ended up leaving because I got a fever but even while Ill and not drinking, while everyone around me was drinking, my father made a snide comment about my illness keeping me from the booze. 

My sister, judger number two, is overweight and makes negative comments to me about what I eat (she’s mad if I turn down dessert, vocalizes her disapproval of my making my kids eat nutritious foods at meals instead of giving into them and letting them eat junk, etc) so it’s not a stretch that she’ll also be pissy about me not drinking.

On the one hand, it will be noticeable and maybe deserving for people to mention me not drinking since I’ve always been a heavy drinker. But, on the other, I don’t want to talk about it, particularly with people who are always critical of me. I expect they will make passive aggressive compliments. It will be very hard for me not to tell them to go fuck themselves. There’s no way to hide me not carrying around a big glass of red, my drink of choice, but of all people, I do not want to discuss my sobriety with them.

Got the usual- ohhh you don’t drink- how strange. Which I can handle and have dealt with it for the past 5 nights and past year and half, pretty well.

Comes to 11pm and our bus is ready to take those who wish to go back to the hotel. 7 people go back and the rest stay to get shit faced.

Ones that are staying on just can’t understand why we are going back to the hotel. I used to be that guy that couldn’t understand WHY would you go back, foreign country, free booze and the adventure that would lie ahead.

Feeling a bit sad about it all, that I am missing out on the adventure that could occur tonight, I used to be the guy that would be the ring leader in adventure that tonight would hold.

Now I am back in my hotel room, sober and having mixed feelings. 

Am I missing out on life???

Well no, the past 20 years that I have been drunk that is the part of my life that I missed out on... I know this but just can’t stop feeling sad about it all.

Well tomorrow is a brand new day so what I am going to do is:

1. Get up and pack my bag with time and care. 
In the past on these sort of trips I would wake up, freak out about packing and stuff everything in.

2. Go for an early morning walk along the river and admire some beauty that surrounds us.
In the past this would not have happened cause I would have had no time and been hungover.

3. Eat a delicious breakfast
In the past I would not have done this as I would have still been drunk or been vomiting an hour before

4. Spend the last day in Korea with a clear mind and enjoy being truly present.
In the past I would have been completely scattered.

5. Probably have a cheeky grin on my face when I see some very sick men getting on the bus and know the morning that I have just had.

Not sure why I am posting this. Guess I wish that the feeling over missing out would just stop.

The man who was speaking is large, at least 6'3 and wide. He fills out the blue prison uniform.  Much of the time he is jovial, good-natured, but last night he let us in deeper.  The topic was spirituality - not religion so much as finding and accepting your place in the world, the scheme of things.  Belief can be a part of this but is not necessarily important.  It's a pretty profound topic, not what one might expect from a group of criminals.

This man is certainly a criminal. In an alcohol fueled rage he killed someone and society locked him up.  This happened in the early eighties, years before many of you were born.  He is still in prison, now in his late sixties, and is a very different person from the self described out of control monster he'd become.

He spoke about the pain of waking up every morning in prison, and knowing that he deserved to be here.  He talked about knowing that he caused greater pain to the family of the man he killed. ""I do not expect forgiveness.""  He's been sober since the first morning he woke up in jail - and this is not a given - there are drugs and alcohol in prison - but he knew he was done.

He's eligible for parole in another year (for the umpteenth time) and would like a chance to prove that he is reformed, changed.  He also understands that it is not his call.

Now here's the point I'm trying to make - he said, ""It all happened in an instant, one minute the night is going exactly the way hundreds of other nights have gone, and then something happened, I'm not sure what exactly but I snapped and a man was dying.""

On a personal note: Alcohol put me in places I should not have been, with people I should not have been with, and regrettable things happened - but fortunately the only thing I killed was my marriage.  

Watching this man speak, the occasional tear running down his cheek was in a strange way uplifting.  I understood the privilege I had been granted to witness this, to be moved, and to be able to offer him understanding.  But beyond that, to be able to be a small part of his healing process - which extends far beyond me - and now with this,  to those who have read this far.

In the beginning I questioned whether I was an alcoholic because my bottom was not ""that bad"".  I now see what a gift that was.",177

Im outside playing with them:)

My sister told me to write down all the things Ive noticed. I figured Id share for anyone that may need it. I havent gone a month since I was 12 so drinking has been rooted into everything I do. I had to start doing muay thai, hit some meetings of AA (I go for the fellowship only), admit I was an alcoholic and buy NA beers. Working out helps keeps the good endorphins running, AA lets me chat with people in the community that are going through the same thing and the NA beers lets me taste beer when I get off work and eat dinner. NA beers dont make me crave the real thing but watch out, some people here have said it made them go back to the bottle.

I didn’t stop for a wake up call, medical issue or close death. 

I’ve been doing it mostly as a challenge and a bit of detox. Also I really don’t like the fact that you HAVE to drink anytime you go out and hangout with friends (party, disco, dinners, happy hours, you name it) or you are weird. So I said, fuck you, I won’t drink and I’ll still hangout. Society has nothing on me. So I did sober October.
My friends were a pin in the ass but after a while you get over it. Funny how 10 people can peer pressure you in stopping your sober October but if you mention weed once you’re a druggie.

Anyways, I’ve done Sober October and been thinking about the next steps. I like being in control. And I don’t want to go back to “let’s loosen up, I’ll have a drink to break the ice”. I’d rather get over that by myself than with the help of alcohol. I’d be fine not drinking ever again.. I thought. 

However, I do like scotch. I’ve started learning about different types and gifting bottles to my friends. I like tasting the different notes and aromas etc, finding different pairings etc. Not that I’m an expert but I appreciate it. 

This weekend there’s a whisky festival in my town and I’d love the opportunity to check it out and increase my knowledge but I’m on the fence. 

I guess is silly but idk what to do. 

My rationale is that it’s fine since it’s a deliberate situation. I’m planning to go there specifically to learn about whisky, not to have fun or because I have to. 
Also, could it be a good test of my will/problem? I drink in this occasion, I see if I slip up out of line, get hammered and most importantly, if it makes it harder to not drink in future situations. 

I’d love to be able to enjoy a nice bottle of wine at dinner every once in a while or a nice craft beer, I just hate the social obligation. However I tend to be an all or nothing kind of guy so if I’m at an open bar club I’ll just drink all night long (maybe 3, maybe 7 drinks).

Also before soctober I noticed I’d drink 3-4 drinks and pretty much still feel sober, rigid and not “buzzy”. So I’d just keep drinking until it felt stupid and went home.

My problem was in my mindset. Because I am very sportive and energetic. So even with a hangover or being drunk I would still get shit done.
And there fore I thought that it was ok for me to drink everyday as long as i was productive that day.

That was a load if crap. I mean I was being productive(ish) but in the end it was a lot more self destructive than building something up.

Now 3 years later i'm broke but I have a new job that starts at the end of december. Until then I'm on unemployment money, but due to some clerrical error I don't get it this month. Luckily I had the last of my saving to pay rent etc.

How did I let it come so far?

I would really like a beer right now. But reading through all the succes storys in here. Makes me realise that the only way to make my life better is Sober.

I didn't drink for tree days. And now the reality is catching up. And that's a hard one

And also I’m finding it hard to resist. Although actually what feels different this time compared to other spells of sobriety is that I don’t feel excited by the thought of drinking with her. Usually I’d be looking forward to the ‘treat’ and feeling like I’d earned it. But this time I feel really shit about it and burdened by the thought of drinking.",3

Psychologists would probably tell me a broken home, a bullying father and a neglectful mother probably set me up perfectly to follow this path but that's not really important. I can't change the past and I blaming other people for my actions is counter-productive. What is important is what I do now, day-by-day, hour-by-hour. Looking after myself now like a loving, caring parent would do, and making the best decisions for the future. 

I've just hit 60 days sober according to the Recovery Elevator app and the memories of why I stopped are fading. It's also 60 days since the argument with my partner that lead me to finally stopping. 60 days since I finally admitted to myself I  was gambling with my family. 60 days since I stopped blaming everyone (and everything) else. And most importantly, 60 days since I stopped putting it off and just stopped it. No more 'I'll just wait until after my birthday' or 'I can't go through summer without a cold beer' or 'I'll just wait until Christmas is over' or 'I'll make it my New Year resolution' or 'I'll do it on Monday' or 'I just need to finish the bottle of Gin' or whatever the excuse was at the time. 

Rock-bottom is a powerful, motivating place to be but for some it's far too late. There is only today. We can't change the past and the future is only a direction we point ourselves in. Today, however, is the day I'll think about how much better my life is already. Today is the day I'll make sure there is no alcohol in the house. Today is the day my plans won't involve the pub. Today is the day I'll love and appreciate my family and remember how I nearly threw it all away.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn’t:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Europe—Morning

Asia and Australia—Evening/Night

I'm telling them comedic routine of how they will go home at 8 pm and pass out and I will stay up til 11 cuz there is never a reason to call it to early right!? Then I tell them how Monday will suck and I already know it but can't do anything about it cuz we are already doing Sunday funday already! (Laughs) I tell them that everyone at work will say I look tired or possibly smell.  Friends will laugh cuz they don't get how its possible to not call it a night early and that they've never been told they smell. I will respond back because cuz your not alcoholic enough yet. They laugh. 
 
Then I will tell them how I will text one of them to go to hh monday because I will have felt like shit all day, battled through and deserve some tall beers and of course its Monday night football now, am I right? I'll tell them that after hh I'll have gotten back on cloud 9 and gotta stop on the way home to get a twelver for the game.  

Ill tell them now its Tuesday , I will feel like shit again and I already got 5 beers left from the twelver so I'll text one of you to go to hh again,one of you better answer! (Laughs) to cure the hangover from Monday. 

Ill tell them, Now its Wednesday, I'm not gonna stop drinking in the middle of the week,  it's pointless now to stop with the weekend coming up.

As of today I am 17 days sober. I have had a few minor relapses since I realized that pulling my head out of my ass would save my life. That being said the trials I face every day are tough. Not insurmountable but tough. Today is the toughest and it is all my fault.

I started drinking at 14, that's more than 10 years ago. I was a good boy and only drank with family on special occasions during that period of time. At 18 I joined the Navy with an awesome job, Nuke. Only the smartest of the smart get that job and I tested right into it. Unfortunately I had a college girlfriend that liked to party. I don't remember the weekend but I do remember losing my Navy job due to a nice underage possession ticket.

Fast forward fast forward...

I'm 20 about to turn 21. I went on to become a SeaBee in the Navy. At first I knew nothing about this job but now I have grown to love the lifestyle surrounding it. Given the choice to do it again, I'd choose SeaBee every time. 

My best friend from 6th grade has always been depressed. When he turned 19 he turned to the bottle. I partied with him. I saw nothing wrong with it, we were having fun and the night always was full of laughing and stupid shit. 

July 6th 2014, 
Phone call...
""xDrxFeelxGood, the worst thing just happened...""
""What, you got a girl preggers, dude I told you to wear condoms lol!""
""No...best friend...killed himself...""

I drove damn near 100 mph down town streets to his place. Cops, ambulance, everything. You've never heard the worst sound in the world until you bite the metaphorical bullet and volunteer to notify their next of kin. It's better coming from someone you care about instead of the authorities. 

This is when i started my downward spiral. 5 years. A bottle to wake up, a bottle to fall asleep. Fired from multiple jobs and still living with my parents.

I don't remember much. I just existed.

I finally hit rock bottom when I went to a Navy drill weekend and was called out for smelling like a bar. I was sent to meet with the substance abuse counselor and my blood work showed 0.186 12 hours after my last drink. I had suicidal ideation and was willing to drive myself over an hour to get home. I felt sober. I functioned ""perfectly"". I did not see an issue. That was August 5th. 

Since then I've done my damndest to be sober and the very few falls I've had were learning experiences to not push my limits to the point where I can't say no. You fall so that you can learn to pick yourself up. 

This is where we come full circle. Right now, all I want to do is raid the liquor cabinet. 

A few years ago I meat a dude who would become a good friend. We were on a Navy training exercise together. Levi, always larger than life and pushed others to be the best they could be. 

A juvenile stole a car and was speeding through a parking lot. Levi and his friends were walking and the vehicle approached at an excessive rate of speed towards their group. Levi jumped towards his friends, pushed them out of the way and took the blunt force of the vehicle. He was pronounced dead on the scene.

Yes, losing a friend may be enough to make anyone want to drink. Not me, I like to think I could cope. I found out today...that this happened in July. IM FUCKING 5 MONTHS LATE FOR A GOOD FRIEND'S HEROIC DEATH!!! (Yes, sad...but fucking badass...there needs to be a movie)

I was so goddamned drunk that I missed hearing yet again that someone close to me died. I was pissed out of my gourd worrying about my own life ending issues (will I have time to grab another bottle on my way home from work?) that something I care about got fucked. 

I wrote this asking for no pity, my pity party is at max capacity right now. I write in reflection of how my responsibilities and everything I care about took back seat to my addiction. I am grateful to have the presence of mind to be able to think about more than one thing. That even includes these sucky emotions. I'll use them as motivation to continue being sober, I don't want to be the jackass who misses this thing again. (Hopefully again will never come) 

Levi, I am so sorry. I wish I would have known. I wish I could have reached out to comfort your family in their time if need. I wish I could have told them how much I looked up to you and aspire to be as heroic as you. Please forgive me for my sins.

I've known from the beginning that if I were to break my sobriety it would be because I convinced myself I could moderate rather than reacting to a really horrible day. Its the casual, bored, ""just have a beer"" type thoughts that are most dangerous for me. I'm not going to drink today and I'm not going to drink tomorrow, but I'm getting worried that eventually, these thoughts will turn to action. Any advice for me? 

What's getting me through right now is that my friends and family know I'm sober and I don't want to have to admit I failed, but they definitely won't give me a hard time if I do so that motivation is pretty flimsy.

Then I sobered up. Daily showers, nope, not even close. I have all the time in the world now but am still shying away from the basics, time to ask for help. 

I went to a doctor last week and told them all about it. And after some prompting, remembered that I was diagnosed with clinical depression, back in my 20s, right before I started drinking.

So here I am. Nearly twenty years later learning how to ask for help, and it feels pretty good. I'm starting anew, and with high hopes this time.

But I enjoyed it. I'd have 2-3 whiskey drinks from a glencairn 4-5 nights a week. Sometimes a glass or two of wine with dinner. I used to primarily drink beer back in my 20's and early 30's, but that easily packs on the pounds, slowly switched over to spirits.

I'm in my mid 40's now, always tired, single dad of two kids, working full time etc. A glass of whiskey or three in the evening would help calm me down to sleep after getting kids off to bed. But I'd always wake up middle of the night for no good reason.

Well a couple months ago I just quit drinking cold turkey. I don't know why, I just felt I should, maybe I'd sleep better, lose a few pounds, better for my health in general, I dunno. Started eating healthier and exercising more too. I've done this a few times in my life, quit for a year or two, but then slowly edge back into drinking regularly.

Thing is, I still sleep like crap, and am still groggy through the day. My vitals are ""normal"". Part of me says ""fuck it"" and just start drinking again, I miss the flavor and aroma of the whiskey and how it relaxes me. But as I get older I start to get scared of all the shit that can happen to you, and getting fatty liver or heart disease is on my biggest list of concerns. I'm not afraid to die. I'm afraid to die a long miserable death.

Point of this is that I don't feel any better or worse now than I did when I was drinking on a regular basis. So part of me says it doesn't make a difference. I just feel like it's my one vice that's personal and makes me happy in this shit life I have. Because life has thrown a pile of crap at me the last ten years or so...

Today has been an extremely hard day for me but I believe that it could be the first day of something greater. I've always been a drinker and honestly couldn't imagine having a social life without it. Last night, I stayed up until 4 am drinking whiskey, knowing that I had to go into work this morning. Woke up extremely hungover, avoided pretty much everyone in the office and even one of my best friends that I work with, I am usually a pretty social guy but couldn't think about talking to anyone. (This has happened on multiple occasions). My manager comes up to me and asks if everything is okay, and if I am doing alright and say that I am just going through the motions and trying to get things done at work. He than has a private meeting with the director and then  my manager proceeds to tell me that I need to put all of these safety managers phone numbers in my cell-phone and ask, ""why?"" and he said just in case I ever need to report someone at work that is drunk or you can sense they are in danger of themselves. At this point, I am thinking well that is rather strange, so now I am freaking out that I am going to get drug tested tomorrow and recently whenever I have a drink, I have been doing cocaine and gambling (was sober from gambling for the past 6 months but recently just started back and now it's worse than it was before. 

&#x200B;

I am nervous that I will get caught and my job is really the other thing that keeps me together in life. I have been having a hard time dealing with the regret of ending my relationship with my ex girlfriend, all that my friend group does is get drunk together and feel like I don't have anything in common with them unless we are getting drunk, have been doing a lot of cocaine and starting to get in financially debt. I just feel lost in life right now, I am 26 years old. I like to consider myself pretty healthy, enjoy being active, being outside and meeting new people but I am scared If i give up drinking than none of my friends will want to hang out with me and I am afraid that I will be boring if I do not drink. I currently attend a counselor from my gambling problem and he asked me what it would look like if I didn't drink for a weekend and that request just seemed impossible. I don't want to end up a lonely alcoholic with nothing to show but being known as the, ""drunk"". Thinking back on all of the things that I have gotten in trouble with in the past in regards to addiction, I have always always been drinking but I have never stopped to think that Maybe the alcohol is the problem? I am in denial but my higher power is telling me that I need to stop or I will be miserable. Maybe my higher power is helping me type this right now because it knows that I am right. I have reached out to one of my best friend Adam who is my co-worker and told him that I think I have a drinking problem. He is really religious and has had his fair share of struggles. I believe this is the first step along with typing this message out. Any thoughts or help would be greatly appreciated because I am lost and all I can think about is finishing my bottle from last night and maybe then I will find the answer.",3

I’ve been trying to get this thing licked since summer 2016. After having nearly 17 months, completely clean the last time I stopped drinking, I convinced myself in late July that I could stick a toe in the water and not end up to my neck. That only lasted a few weeks. 

I’ve been thinking about triggers, reasons, etc and could cite some stressful/life challenging and life changing events that pushed me over the edge. However, the truth is that when I set my mind to have a drink, I will find a justification. It could be the death of someone close, stress at work, or a broken shoe lace. I drink because that’s what I do. 

Feels like the only thing I’ve done right is that I keep trying. That’ll be enough for today. Not going to fall into the trap of self-loathing and guilt.

To once have been in a place where I thought there was no way out, an extended all time low, severely depressed, self medicating and self sabotaging with alcohol and drugs.. and to now be nearly 5 years into my sobriety.  It’s crazy when I really think about it, it doesn’t feel like that long.  Maybe it’s just an emotional day for me, but just felt like posting on here.. to people who really actually get it.  To people who have been there and are getting through it Day by day.  If you’re in the beginning of your journey, please keep going.  It does get easier, it does get better.

2019-11-06 16:49:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dsn7sc/mentally_tough_day_vent/,Mentally tough day (vent),"To be very honest, sobriety doesn't really feel helpful right now and I want to vent about it, so here's my shout to the wind.

I feel like I am experiencing the same or similar mental issues that led me to a bottom and on the road to stopping drinking. I had hit a high point this summer as I moved past a year and into a year and a half, but then since mid-summer multiple things have occurred that have contributed to mental/behavioral regressions. One key loss was the cessation of regular therapy sessions, which I intend to start up again ASAP in 2020. I've been managing to improve a bit over where I dropped to, but I have not yet gotten back to where I was, nor do I feel capable of reaching that peak again on my own.

What's making me feel worse is that the circumstances of my life are almost as good as they can get right now. I'm actively involved in a community, though it is hardly a sober one. I exercise for at least an hour 5-6 days a week. I had been crushing it at work, but now have taken a slight step back to doing mostly well. I have a lot else to be grateful for especially given my circumstances. Despite that I focus on the negatives - I feel like my future is maybe more limited by the situations that brought me here than I thought it would be - in terms of developing a serious relationship with someone and my employment.

I also don't feel like an alcoholic anymore. I don't remember what it was like to be drunk or any of the negatives. I don't even drink seltzer water habitually like I did at earlier points in my recovery, nor do I have any ""craving"" of any sort. I have thoughts of use on occasion, but a lot of the times I don't even think of using, just the fact that I'll be around it and will have to tell people I don't drink anymore. 

I would say I have a desire to drink right now, born out of the sheer boredom and monotony of my current lifestyle which I am currently blaming at least half on sobriety. I also desire to cease being the odd one out who doesn't drink at parties or when they hang out with friends.

Admittedly, my desire to cure my boredom with drinking says a lot in of itself. My logic and rationalization wheel spins and says well you have to meet new people to hang out with and build friendships to go do the stuff you want to do without drinking, and in order to do that you need to drink so that you'll more quickly build relationships to the point of enabling that. But that's some crazy talk. It's possible to be that person sober. I've done it a lot this past year and a half+.

I also don't know how to meet people in real life outside of bars or a dedicated activity or an online dating app. I've tried a few Meet-up groups and have not had success building a lasting friendship or relationship with it yet. The best has come from regular going to my local dog park and talking to a few people there but I hardly confide my life story in them and now that DST as started, this will not happen as regularly for the near future.

Another big piece of my frustration comes in my personal relationships. I think I am realizing that I'm probably better off being single. I may not be cut out to handle a real significant relationship for the rest of my life. I'm also a hopeless romantic at heart, and this pains me to feel like I can't do it. I feel like I've made just as many if not more poor judgements about dating and relationships this year as I ever did when I was drinking.  Admittedly, I went on more dates this year than ever before, but that can be blamed in part as a function of my age and other factors around my socioeconomic status, free time, romantic and sexual desires, and so on, in addition to being a minor replacement addiction in of itself.

All this to say I'm struggling. It feels like I am what is somewhat the the equivalent of a ""trap game week"" for you sports fans out there where my season/quest for a championship (sobriety) could be lost if I'm not careful. 

It's a time that requires patience and focus when it is very easy to lose both as I have passed the year and a half mark and try and make it to 2 years. These are skills I need to (re-)develop, and I am frustrated because I had done so when I was drinking, and I developed a period of moderation that worked well for me and led to what was the best time of my life at that time (still is today, though hopefully the best is yet to come). What I remind myself is that time also led to the worst time of my life (knock on wood). I thought it was drinking that made me lose these skills, but instead it seems to just be the way I am to cycle in and out of being fully mentally healthy. If I go back to drinking in the future, I feel confident that it will be a choice. Today i am choosing to post here and will not drink with you.",2

I've spent all morning googling ""how to stop drinking"" ""how to not be an alcoholic mother"" ""i'm a young alcoholic, how do i stop?"" and my searches have led me here. This seems like a super supportive and helpful community..and support and help are two things I could really use right now. Without going into too much detail, I'm a young mother to a beautiful newborn, in my 20's, and I'm an alcoholic. That is the first time I've ever been able to say that. I've drank at work and passed out on the job, I've hidden drinks through my house, in my clothes, in my purse, in laundry hampers. I've driven, I've screamed hysterical rants to my husband and friends, I've held my baby while intoxicated. I've lied SO MUCH. To EVERYONE I care about who has tried to help me-my parents, siblings, my friends. Everyone knows that I have a problem, and right now I just feel stuck. It feels like the guilt of the pain I have put everyone through fuels my need to keep consuming, so I can forget it all. At the same time I can easily tell myself I dont have a problem, all my friends do it in moderation, why shouldn't I get to? But once I start, I can't stop. If I have a couple of glasses at a public function, the next day I am sneaking to a gas station and chugging a tall boy in the bathroom. It's like a switch is flipped in me.I keep telling myself ""I want to turn back time and make everyone forget the mistakes I've made, THEN everything will be normal, I can hit a re set button, not make all these mistakes, and then people won't judge me when they see me drinking"" But I know that's not how life works. I want to be done with this. I don't want it to get to the point where my husband leaves and takes the baby with him, I don't want to drive drunk and kill someone. I want to be DONE. Please help- will take any advice available. This is my first day sober.",19

This sub is amazing.","Thanks to the positive posts and countless recommendations of reading “This Naked Mind” I finally stopped drinking and feel like I’m ready to actually live without alcohol. 

The last three years of my life were an honest blackout, with a few sober days or weeks here and there. Wetting the bed constantly, horrible digestion issues, and basically destroying my brain. I got tired of it and was lucky enough to realize I needed to cut alcohol out of my life completely. At this point it was an easy decision. 

I’m lucky enough to have family that genuinely understands addiction and for the most part don’t consume alcohol at all; that makes things way easier. Also having friends that don’t drink is a major plus because we can hang out and I don’t have the thought in the back of my mind “I can’t wait to be alone to drink”. It’s sad, but that was my thought process most of the time... how long until I can drink?

It’s been 5 days since I did a “test” to see if I actually enjoyed alcohol and it’s effects. To be completely truthful, I don’t. It tastes awful, barely has any positive effects, and leaves me feeling worthless.

I started working out again and am using my booze money to save up for some records I’ve wanted for a while (vinyl collector).

Mostly I just want to say thanks to anyone that’s shared a story on here. Nobody is excluded when it comes to addiction and I’m excited to live without alcohol.

I've been MUCH more open and honest with people this time around about my alcoholism. With my husband, random people from AA, even a new friend who I found out is 8 years sober. All of that has made me really vulnerable and emotional lately, so I've just been riding the waves up and down with it.

i get that working with sponsors and other alcoholics is meant to teach us to look outside of ourselves for feedback and support, and that this is a huge part of the culture in aa makes me incredibly grateful. that said i am struggling to understand my sponsors reasoning about something on my amends agenda.

i am working on my amends and there is one that wasn't on my resentment list that my sponsor just happened to remember from one of our conversations (this is because it's not so much a resentment). it's a really complicated thing that's hard to type out. without launching into a novel length explanation, the amends is something that makes me feel very unsafe. we have already talked about living amends for situations that are not healthy for either me or others to bring up, but my sponsor seems pretty dead set on me at least acknowledging this thing publicly. i personally don't understand how they are drawing that line, and this is the one amends that i feel like would actually be harmful (to me) by way of retribution, that i have quietly made restitution efforts on my own about.

I drank that beer and honestly, I felt much better.  I’m not happy with my choice.  I wish I would have been stronger.  I wish I would have chosen a different outlet.  But, I didn’t.  I failed.  I haven’t craved a drink since that beer and I haven’t caved since.

A couple months ago she lost her job, and her brother from suicide and the resulting stress/anxiety/depression has resulted  drunken evening arguements between us that have just gotten worse and worse. I didn't want to quit drinking but she needed a change to help get her back on her feet, so the drinking continued, and so did the arguments. Last Wednesday I threatened to leave her during one particular heated argument, so she tried to overdose on boose/benadryl, then disconnected her insulin pump before passing out. By morning she was suffering from severe ketoacidosis and had to be taken to the emergency room. 4 nights spent in ICU getting medically stabilized. This was a real eye opener as I had to spend those nights alone without her while she was in the hospital.

We both agreed alcohol can no longer be a part of our lives (she is also getting some psychiatric help). This is day 2 for me, I haven't gone this long without booze in years. I know it's going to be tough but will ultimately be good for both of us in so many ways, and the money saved will help pay the incoming hospital bill.

Movies, books, TV shows, even music, artists, poets, mantras, quotes, etc. any and all suggestions are welcomed. I'm currently watching, ""Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot"" and I find it incredibly helpful. There is a line in the movie where someone said, ""..The problem with saying, ""Poor me! Poor me!"" is that eventually you're going to say, ""Pour me another drink!"""" It really hit home for me. Also, it's worth noting that I am currently an at home mom caring for a small child so I'm not able to go to meetings as much as some (Even with online meetings I don't want to be distracting with a baby...)

I am having serious problems with motivation to quit drinking.  I can't seem to find my ""why"" again.  Previously, I stopped for the wife.  I know that isn't a lifelong sustainable reason though.  I do get tired of all of the grief that drinking causes.  All the hurt that I heap on her and the next day conversations.  For some reason though, that is not enough.  I'm open to suggestions and experiences for personnel ""whys"".  Maybe it will help give me an idea or lead me to the direction of my own personnel why.

My job absolutely sucks rocks.  It's amazing how much time and energy we put into our jobs, but at the end of the day, if it is not the right job it is more detrimental than not having one.  The company that I work for is going bankrupt.  I've put in a ton of time and effort into this place.  I work in finance so I've seen it coming about 10 miles away.  I've been looking for new jobs and have had some luck in the way of phone interviews, but I cannot seem to land an in person interview.  I'm getting very tired of this process.  I really just want a place to go to work and feel that I am valued.  That my professional opinions matter and does not fall on the deaf ears of some idiot in leadership who thinks they know everything (while the business is an absolute failure thanks to them.).

I'm going out of town this weekend to help my wife get guardianship over her parents.  They both have dementia and have lately been scammed by scammers that prey on the elderly.  I know they have sent out about 5K already.  It is going to be extremely taxing on my wife.  Her family put on facades that they supported her, but now that the rubber is meeting the road they are aghast.  We are both pissed at the world right now.  Pissed at her parents for putting this kind of burden on other people, pissed at the family for criticizing what we are doing, and pissed at the absolute feeling of helplessness.  I know this will all come together and settle down, but fuck.  What a bitch of a situation to be in.  I know that we will break two old people's hearts this weekend.  I'm actually a little afraid that one will have a physical event because of it.  That will hurt my wife and make her feel guilty.  I have to be sober to be her rock.  Right now I can barely make it a week sober.  So I don't know how much of a rock I will be.

If you have read this far, then I appreciate it.  I don't feel that I am personally doomed to be a drunk my entire life, but right now life is not throwing me a lot of inspiration to be sober.  I keep trying though.  Honestly I do.  I'm hoping that one day it all comes together and sticks.  Hoping that I'll wake up and be like ""hey, I haven't had a drink in a year"".  Honestly though, I don't like planning around on hope.  If you have words of inspiration, I would appreciate hearing them.

Thanks.  Lazyeyejim.",6

This time, I’d like to last longer. Indefinitely. I know it’s a bad idea to commit to forever - because it seems unattainable and might have the opposite effect - but ultimately, I want this to be it, this time.

But I struggle with planting those seeds “maybe after 100 days I can drink again”. Even if I brush it off and I tell myself no, the seed is planted. It’s already in my brain - and I want to pass 100 days this time.

“Maybe on Anja’s wedding day I can have one glass of champagne”. As soon as the flutter of a thought enters my head, I can’t throw it out. If the wedding is three weeks away, I’ll wait, but on the day I find myself justifying it.

I reach a big birthday in a few months - a new decade. And there is a small flutter that says, maybe you’ll have a drink, a last hurrah. Maybe not. But maybe you will?!? .... I’ll push this to the back of my mind, taking one day at a time, until the birthday comes and then..... :(

How do you stop yourself planting those little seeds of thought? It’s NEVER a random “fuck it” on the day for me. Its always something that’s been festering for weeks that I’ve tried to fight.

2019-11-06 10:58:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dsi9d6/the_time_is_now/,The Time is Now,"Hey All. In my early 30s.

I first got drunk at the age of 14 during my sophomore year of high school. I surrounded myself voluntarily with peers that were troubled as I would become. In fact, the first time I got drunk, I got high AND drunk at the same time. The feeling was euphoric.

Throughout high school, I failed miserably in just about every class. Heck, even PE at times. Before I high school, I found joy in learning and was intrigued by math and science. For that reason, I knew it was not for a lack of intellect, rather I was placing my priorities in the wrong places. In my junior year of high school, I decided one late start thursday morning to get hammered with a buddy of mine at the time. We played Counter Strike before school and finished a bottle of Rum. He decided to stay home that day, his parents were very absent. Always working and they were divorced, so he only had to deal with one parent. I on the other hand, decided to school. One bad decision lead to another and I showed up stupid drunk to school. Slurring my words and wobbling throughout campus. Long story short, I didn't get away with it and I was found to be drunk by my teacher and I ended up getting a suspension of 4 days. Hey, what a punishment right? I get myself a nice little vacation!

After that moment, I had a realization that I was leading myself into a dark dark place. My dad was surprisingly understanding and we had a good talk that night. I then self reflected and realized this is not who I was and not what I wanted. I dropped the clique I was hanging out with and completely ostracized myself from all my peers. In fact, I ended up having to finish my senior year of high school at a continuation school, in order to be able to graduate on time. The next few years I spent most of my time with family and two good childhood friends, who did not drink or do drugs. Most of my free time I spent reading, learning foreign languages, and engaging in photography. I felt so happy, despite having very little friends. I learned that I was able to fall in love with myself because I wasn't being influenced by outside sources.  It was a moment of self discovery. Heck, i even found enjoyment in listening to Enya - the music put me in a very serene place.

From the age of 18-22 I didn't drink. I would say that these years were some of the best years of my life. Once I finally transferred to a 4 year university at the age of 23, I began to start hitting up bars with my college friends to study. I allowed myself to drink at this time, because I felt I was doing something productive while drinking. However, that lead me to start visiting bars with my college friends Thursday nights after the last class of the week, just to relax and reward myself for getting through a week of school. I continued this trend of drinking and successfully graduated college at the age of 25.

Post college, from the age of 25-28 I was still following my college day routine, since I still had friends in school. Hit up the $2 power hours Thursday nights at the local college bar and rush to the local 7eleven at 1:45 am to catch them before they stopped selling alcohol at 2am. Trust me, my buds and I would RUN to 7eleven. Friday nights were typically trying to recover from the night before and repeating the cycle Friday night, then Saturday night, and Sundays were either recovery days or continuing the madness from the night before with botomless mimosas, especially if it was Football season. I also found myself drinking to escape the empty feeling of no longer being in a relationship with the women I dated from the age of 19 to 26. Nearly 7 years. I credit the end of our relationship to my preference to maintain a relationship with alcohol. I recall one of our last trips to Vegas. I made a complete ass out of myself and ruined the trip. She stayed at the hotel room for the rest of the night on our final day, while I went out to a club and partied on. She dumped me several months after and I don't blame her.

About 6 months after the break up, I decided to take a break and didn't drink for 3 months. I remember how great I was starting to feel during those months, It started to feel like when I took a 4 year break when I was 18 to 22. That only lasted 3 months and I resumed drinking on weekends again. I must note, I rarely drank on a weeknight and almost never alone. This was my justification to continue drinking and I told myself that I didn't have a problem, because I was able to control at least part of my drinking.

I got married at the age of 30, last year, and while I have cut back my drinking BIG time. I still find myself picking up beers or a bottle on a Friday or Saturday night (sometimes both) and blacking out occasionally. My wife will partake at times, but it is mostly me. We just got back from a 6 day trip to Hawaii and we wasted 2-3 nights because we were pounding drinks by the beach at 2pm and by 7pm we were done for the night, headed back to the Airbnb and passed out. We even missed Halloween on Waikiki because we drank so much early Thursday, that when we went back to our airbnb to get ready, we decided to take a short nap, but ended up waking up at 3am, realizing we overslept. We were disappointed. At that moment, I realized I no longer want to live like this. I've also become more hostile towards my friends and family when I drink. I start bashing their sports team or discussing politics to the point where I wake up in the morning and I am too embarrassed to look at the conversation. I remember waking up last Friday and saw the preview of my recent conversations from the night before and I closed one and and the other eye half way and deleted all of them. I did this so that I wouldn't read the stupid things I was saying.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I think it's time for me to stop drinking. If I don't, I can see my friendships ending, I;ve already noticed that I've scared off a few friends. I can see my marriage failing and I can see myself head into a destructive past like before. My wife looks up to me as a leader and I am ashamed because I feel I have been failing her and me. The time is now.

Since I hit the brakes last Wednesday, I have.... 

Slept great 6 nights in a row.

Drove 1200 miles in 2 days, got home feeling fine, alert, ready to go.

Spent a night in a casino, eating and gambling in comfortable moderation. 

Inspired my SO, who is 2/3 my body weight and drank half again as much as I did, to stay mostly dry at home. 

Worked out 5 days in a row (both of us). 

Taken a walk without distractions, just to check in with myself, every day.

Got a ton of stuff done including progress on some studio recording. 

Played a monthly show while declining my monthly specialty beers (brought a tea bag, ordered hot water, tipped heavily). 

Tracked calories with the LoseIt app, easily staying under an aggressive weight loss goal, even with snacks. 

Laughed when the app showed me my ""favorite dinner foods"" with Jameson and Cabernet in the top 5.
(I thought I could limit by tracking, measuring ounces in a Pyrex cup before pouring it over the ice, before I gave up tracking altogether last time around). 

Handled a really odd, online stalker type situation without much drama. (Went for a walk, posted here, blew it off). 

Ignored the urge to grab a glass, at a few key moments (Hello urge,  I see you. Go to sleep again please.) 

Ignored the news, for the most part. 

Watched a few really good movies, noticing a ton of detail and nuance

Laughed a lot. 

Cried a lot. 

Spent a ridiculous amount of time on here and r/griefsupport (thanks everybody). 

Spent a lot of time thinking about the future, and only a little about the past. 

Felt more like my own best friend than I can remember. 

Come on, week 2. IWNDWYT.",8

I was surprised to find myself going from 8-10, sometimes 12 drinks in a night to 4, then 3, and tonight I'm aiming for 2, then 1, and then hopefully none. I've struggled with finding a good support group, especially as an atheist, but I know that my drinking has cost me so much--so much money, so much physical and mental well-being, and it's irreparably damaged relationships, including my ended marriage. I know that with winter coming and having diagnosed depression, I can't let alcohol make turn up the volume on my depression when the holiday season already stirs up a lot of bad feelings for me--I'm estranged from my family after coming out them as bisexual and polyamourous. I remember how I feel when I drink heavily, and I am trying to hold on to how I'm feeling now as I cut back--better. less anxious, less depressed, more energy. I want to make this year's holiday season the first in a long time where I don't end up hating trying to get through it, but instead, where I thrive and take care of myself.I want to make my own traditions, support my chosen family, and not destroy myself in a vain desire to be numb but instead only exacerbating my mental health issues.

Binge drinking and staying up all night doesn't make me feel cool, it makes me feel strung-out and out of control. When I was sober for ten months I felt proud of myself. I'm quitting drinking because I know who I am, I know it's the right thing,

and fuck everyone at this school who normalizes binge drinking as the only way to have FUN on a Friday night. I'm quitting drinking because I'm gonna be proud of myself again.

\-- I sleep so much more soundly. It is amazing the better quality of sleep you get when not going to bed drunk. Also, 51 days of no hangovers. I don't miss that for anything.

\-- Thanks to an app recommended to me here called NoMo, I have saved $736 in the past 51 days. I don't even want to calculate how much I might have spent in my heydays.

\-- Alcohol is tightly woven into our society. It's everywhere, and I am learning to ignore it.

Thank you to this sub and whoever it was that posted the 100 days of being sober at Christmas Day. my life is a lot different now than it was 51 days ago, for the better, and I thank you for that!

As the holidays creep up I am starting to get anxiety and my grief slightly eat at me. I haven't had a sober holiday season since my Dad died and I am determined to change that this year.

Yesterday, it was huge anticipation and a build-up to the count down to a legitimate 30 days. It was almost obsessive.  I actually set a timer on the stove for the last 30 minutes of sober October. I thought that some of you would like to know how my experiment went. Here are my findings:

&#x200B;

* The first glass in I called my mom ( it was her birthday yesterday). While talking to her I twice tried to find the right word I needed and could not. I also felt as though my ideas weren't as well rounded. The wine does not taste as good as I remember it.
*  2nd glass- My appetite felt unnatural.  I went from fine to ravenously hungry and had to make a quick dinner for myself. My husband got home and I felt as though he was judging how much wine I was drinking and I got a bit standoffish/ snippy with him.  
* 3rd glass- I felt a wave of sadness come over me. I felt disappointed and worried that all the work I had just done was gone. I started to think about areas of my life that I was less than happy with. I began watching a sad movie. 
* End of the bottle- by this point, I felt wistful/ stuck in a sad spiral and turned off the TV to sit alone with my glass and my thoughts. I listened to Joni Mitchell ( My husband later commented that I have done that before when sad).  I came to bed with my computer and when my husband asked if I was ok I flat out said ""No"". 

The next morning: 

* I woke up twisted in my bed covers in and uncomfortable position. I am thirsty and had to pee urgently. 
* I have a massive headache/ feel a bit queasy 
* I feel tired and that I did not sleep well. I am unmotivated to go to the gym as early as I promised. 
* Husband confirms I was indeed snippy with him last night and sad. I discussed the above findings with him.

My conclusion:  I do not enjoy drinking the way that I used to. It is not how I remembered it prior to the 30.  

What I did enjoy from the 30: being able to remember what I said the previous day, having a great night of sleep, feeling hydrated, dedicating time to building muscle at the gym, feeling in control of my food choices, enjoying a beverage that tastes good through and through, being polite to people around me and saving money. 

( I used to drink a bottle a night during the workweek more often than not and more on the weekends. Not sure how I did that now.  I may choose to drink  at some point again but this 30 has drastically changed my perspective on my personal habits and goals with regard to the "" benefits"" of drinking)

I highly suggest checking out  This Naked Mind the audiobook and website. The author has free tools for a 30 day and suggest doing the "" drinking experiment"" for yourself.  She very carefully talks about all the myths surrounding drinking culture. Her work has been a game-changer for me. 

Thank you for your time and for reading. I wanted to share as many other posts have helped me out. IWNDWYT.",47

I’m a 24 year old guy that’s been hitting the bottle pretty hard since I was about 18. Of course, as all addictions do, it started off small. A few shots here, a couple beers there. Today I am averaging about a fifth of vodka a day, more or less. And I’ve been at this level for a few years.

Now, I’m sure that everyone else in this sub has similar problems. Most of my life has been filled with a deep, chronic, overwhelming depression. I won’t write a long sob story, but I just.. Ive been alone, depressed, and hated myself for most of my life. When I started drinking, it was more or less for fun. But over time, it developed into a way for me to escape. To be out of my head. To actually have some kind of confidence in myself. 

My life today is not something I enjoy. I’m unemployed, still live at home. I’ve delved to the point where I spend most of my time alone, in my room, and depressed. I’m also, of course, drinking a lot when ever I can.

Lately, I’ve been getting really tired of it. Well, tired of everything really. I feel like a period of change is coming, and I really want to embrace it. But I know that the drinking definitely needs to go. Along with the emotional/mental problems it affects, I’ve also noticed problems with my health have been popping up lately as well. Weight gain, sleeping problems, I shake a lot. The most concerning thing is my pancreas, as lately I’ve been getting pancreas attacks and feel like it’s only getting worse. I’ve read up on it, and it seems that once you develop pancreatitis, you’re at a significant risk for dying, and need to stop drinking IMMEDIATELY. I’m hoping to use this as kind of a wake up call, to finally do something and stop drinking.

So, I got drunk last night. Drank up what I had left. I woke up this morning with a bit of a hang over. I’m sitting here now with some coffee and just thinking about it all. Today will be day one. I’m hopeful to have many more.",10

-neither of my parents or my best friend’s mom ever wanted to drive us anywhere after about 3:30-4 pm. I’m 42 and just figured out it was because they knew they’d be drunk and didn’t want to drive drunk. 

-since my father had money and a lavish lifestyle, his drinking looked to me like something successful people do. Bottomless scotch very day is a sign of success in money only—he died two months ago, alcohol related of course. If he’d done as the doctors asked and stopped, he’d easily have had another 10 years. I miss him so fucking much. 

-the way I stumbled upon this sub was trying to figure out why my cheeks were so red and my nasolabial folds were so pronounced. I found the term “gin blossoms”, a band I’d listened to but not an actual phrase I was familiar with. I’m a gin drinker. I’ve had a few day ones but overall over the last two weeks I’ve drank less than I have in nearly a decade. My “gin blossoms” are 80% gone and my nasolabial folds are less pronounced. Wow. 

-when the cravings get the strongest I think about how amazing my mornings have been the last couple of weeks. It’s my favorite time of year and it’s a gift that’s basically free to enjoy it without hangovers. 

-I don’t pick idiotic fights with my wonderful husband when I’m not drinking. Admittedly I’m annoyed more easily but instead of exploding, I am able to stop myself and remind myself how lucky I am to have this partner who loves me unconditionally and supports me in everything—do I really need to tell him to chew with his mouth closed? Nope. I’m thankful to be sharing a meal with him instead. 

Those cravings sucked last night but I didn’t drink and I was up at 6 am today. And IWNDWYT.",5

Tired of every single relationship at some point  being tainted by my usage.  

I ordered a whoop (like a Fitbit, but I'm a sucker for joe rogan sellings - I used to work out a lot before the alcohol demon full on put hooks in me), I found the AA meetings I will be attending near my house that work with my schedule, and most importantly I have my dr appt to dabble with naltrexone locked down for this week.

In fact, I had a relapse while we were together.  Not his fault, but a sign that something wasn't right, either within myself or with us.

When we argued, he'd give me the silent treatment & storm out, and that's when I would drink, while anxiously awaiting the time he would talk to me again. Now I can see how unhealthy the dynamic was, but of course at the time I thought it was just 'us'.  After all, he was a lot nicer to me than my ex (sad but so true) so it took me awhile to really identify our dynamic as unhealthy. At least I didn't spend YEARS with this person - just 1.5 years, long enough for the bad times to weigh heavily enough on the good times to call it quits. Just long enough to see my own sense of wellness start to drift away from me.  

Now that we are done, I don't want alcohol,  I only want to feel happy again & move forward with my own healing, growth and positive mindset.  Like my relationship with alcohol, I didn't realize how unhealthy my relationship with this man was until I gave it up.  I had become so used to feeling depressed that I didn't know what happy was, much like my alcohol haze, I had a relationship haze that kept me disconnected from the beauty of life, without knowing why I felt so bad.  And like alcohol, I need to protect myself from myself & ensure that I don't relapse with him the way I relapsed with booze. 

I will not drink today, nor will I drink from the well of unhealthy connection.  Working on my sobriety from alcohol has given me the strength to fight for my health in other ways.  I've come this far & I'm not going to let anyone come between me and what I've accomplished, and if it seems like I am starting to drink to cope with relationship (or job or whatever) , then I really need to consider that relationship & my actions within that paradigm.

I had long realized that alcohol affected me differently. Some people have the ability where it doesn’t affect their quality of life. I am not one of them. This is on the heels of 10 years of bodily abuse, false promises, and convincing myself repeatedly it was 'different this time' (Spoiler: it was NOT). These past 121 days, not drinking has been challenging and I continue to be anxious at points, but I am absolutely certain that I now have the healthiest relationship with myself I’ve ever had. I heard recently that “true courage is experiencing fear and acting anyway.” If that is the case, then stopping this cycle has been a courageous act for me since I have (and continue to be) scared shitless. Still, as the evidence mounts, I can’t help but look back at Day 1 and say ‘Why was I ever worried?'   
I know the process is far from over but the benefits and realizations I’m grateful for so far are:   


* (1) Acting, thinking and feeling deliberately 
   * I’m entirely operating with intention for the first time in my life. Every decision I make is both thoughtful and considerate, no matter how insignificant. I’m thinking and looking at the way I behave completely differently. At each cross roads I consider ‘How does this impact my day? My health? Will this activity or person drain me? Am I helping others?' Despite these being basic tenets of the responsible decision making process, they were always far removed when I was over intoxicated (which is often, if not always, when I drink) or emotionally unstable between periods of drinking. 
   * I wake up each morning and know I can impact my emotional state effectively and can control the inputs that make it better. For example, I have the energy to exercise, meditate, and work. Hangovers completely derailed my process and forced me into embracing negative thought patterns. A person cannot control everything but, by deliberately eliminating voluntary chemical imbalance and keeping my body healthy, I am putting myself in position to respond healthily to life’s challenges.
   * I feel completely freed from the looming and unpredictable possibility of 'Am I going to black out tonight and make a fool of myself? What am I going to do?’ Being liberated from that fear… it having been four months since the last time I risked it, it’s really difficult to describe how magical that feeling is. I don’t know if I’ve experience a greater weight being lifted. 
* (2) Rediscovered my ambition, made progress toward self improvement, and have SELF-ESTEEM 
   * I’m not constantly fluctuating between rebuilding and destroying myself. I’m feeling my emotions and facing them instead of using vice to run away. With these inconsistencies gradually disappearing, I’ve begun to feel things that I’ve missed. There is a new confidence. It’s not talking to a girl or standing up to speak in a business meeting, it’s knowing I deserve more. It’s knowing I'm worth more. For example, I went to an MBA information session and, instead of seeing how I would fail at the program, I saw instead how I would succeed. That is self-esteem. Without alcohol hanging over my head and clouding my image, I have rediscovered my self worth. 
   * With regards to goals like going back to school or learning a new skill, I've now realizing how often I would lie to myself with promises of ’starting tomorrow’ or writing robust lists of next steps just to convince myself I was doing *something* when, in fact, it was an elaborate ruse to enable my substance abuse further. I can SEE that now for the first time for what it was. I was doing the bare minimum to trick my mind into thinking I was accomplishing something when it was actually still inaction. 
   * I *see* myself moving forward instead of constantly staying in the same position of back and forth, overindulgent then self loathing then repentant then overindulgent etc. Treading water isn’t enough anymore, it’s not enough to enable my behavior, I want more because I deserve more. 
* (3) Anxiety and uncertainty near non existent 
   * Aside from the occasional over caffeination or normally stressful situations (like a big travel day, lack of rest, new people), my anxiety is now *gone!* This is nothing short of a miracle to me and I attribute it entirely to not drinking and embracing more healthy alternatives (e.g. exercise). 
   * I was absolutely convinced I needed to be on medication at points, overcome with palpitations and immobilized on my couch. I was so close to pleading with my doctor after countless sleepless nights. Once I stopped, I no longer needed another dependency. What it took was eliminating the existing dependency I had created. 
* (4) More honest with myself and others, I’m not afraid to be me, and not trying to fit into others molds 
   * I feel more comfortable in conversation, I’m listening more and speaking less. I feel far more secure in who I am than ever before. I feel less invested with others' opinions of me and more comfortable with myself. 
   * I’m present in those conversations, not thinking about the next drink, next indulgence, or next unhealthy escape. 
   * I accept and understand rejection better. I also understand clearly it is not a reflection of myself. In fact, I’m never as quick to blame myself as I was when I was drinking. 
   * I have felt a resurgence in my spirituality and empathy for others. It is much easier to concentrate on helping others and listening when I'm not barely functioning. I’m learning more about meditation which is easier with a clear head and healthy body. 
   * It was so difficult for me to tell people I’m not drinking, grabbing the water, explaining myself at first but I’ve learned it gets *easier* with experience. Plus, in the spirit of not fitting into molds, it is about what works for me, forget explaining myself to strangers. I’m doing and speaking with a calmness more than ever now knowing I owe no explanation to anyone for the journey that is right for me. In the words of Jack Kerouac, “Rest and be kind, you don’t have to prove anything."" 
* (5) Understanding my existing relationships 
   * Without the veil of intoxication, other enablers antisocial behaviors become more conspicuous. Gossip, ugliness, even cruelty, all rear their heads. I am not one to judge but I do know that those behaviors become far less tolerable without the numbing characteristics of alcohol. As my self esteem grows, my desire to be surrounded by negativity has lessened. Not drinking, I’m actively challenging negative thinking with my friends and avoiding it all together now in ways I might have not that jeopardized my ‘drinking buddy’ relationships. 
   * The facade relationships are starting to disappear. Within the first three weeks, a friend of mine texted me to hang out. She and I always got obliterated, the enabling was infectious and bilateral. We made plans to hang out. I texted her that I was ’taking a break from drinking’ and, in no less than 30 minutes, she canceled. Without the substance, I found more and more of these connections start to evaporate. This, ultimately, has been to my benefit as it's freed up more time for what matters and eliminated those negative influences, revealing how they actually supported me. 
   * I have had the realization that many of my friends are not on the path of self betterment. For a long time I have wanted to *be better*. I kept the thought in check with lists and lies to myself as mentioned before but it always remained. I know now that, as long those circles continue to revolve around drinking, at least for me, true growth is not possible. I want friends who want to grow, who want to be better, who want to experience more in life, see places, learn things. I have pursued these things inconsistently in my life but now I can do so with a renewed vigor and a stronger resolve to find people who *share* that passion. The brass tax is, I have realized I need friends who are like the real me, the sober me who seeks more. 
   * I have received support from the most unlikely places. Many of my friends in these circles too have struggled with addiction so they have been greatly empathetic. I’m thankful for that support but know I need to find others on this path to nurture my growth, a new challenge I have yet to understand. I’m grateful since I’ve learned more people understand and will support me if I share with them honestly. However, I have also learned sober support is strongly rooted in a mutual understanding and shared pursuit. 
* (6) My outings are rejuvenating, not debilitating 
   * Seeing people and going places now is a rebuilding tool, not a destructive one. I have conversations I can remember, I go to bed on time, and avoid outings that would otherwise drain me. 
   * I can DRIVE everywhere and not worry about getting home! Added bonus, I can help others get home. 
* (7) Physical changes 
   * My face has lost its puffiness and redness. 
   * My eyes are clearer and more visible. 
   * I’ve lost 10 lbs since stopping (not a big surprise when someone cuts out multiple 4000 calorie beer bender nights out from their week). 
   * My energy and sleep schedule are much more reliable, I have fewer interruptions with the latter. 

This process continues to have its struggles, there are some questions I’m still trying to address but I’m grateful to continue learning so much every day. I think my greatest challenge at the moment is that, after building a strong personal foundation in this pursuit, I’m afraid to build more social connections surrounding it. I know I need that pillar of support in the sober community to continue this journey (especially in light of discoveries on existing relationships and how I am growing a part from my old friends), but I’m just not there yet. I’ve been to a collection of AA meetings throughout town (maybe 15) but there has been no real calling or connection there so far. In fact, I haven’t even been able to speak (I’ll admit, I’m afraid). I don’t know anything about the big book and feel like my ego maybe getting in the way.   
Despite these new challenges, I know, more than ever, this is the right decision for me. I will continue to be patient with myself, attending meetings, and, eventually, I’ll learn to navigate these areas. Once I do, I’m sure I’ll be stronger and even look back, exactly like I did to start not drinking, and think ‘Why was I ever worried?’ After speaking with a friend, my next goal is to find a sponsor so I can explore it more with guidance. Any advice with this is greatly appreciated.   
\--   
If anything that I described sounds like you now or in the past, a cycle of rebuilding - personal stagnation - uncontrollable anxiety - low self esteem - friends unfocused on growth, just know this is the right path and there is a solution. I don't have all the answers yet, I probably never will, but I know this is the right direction. I still cannot believe how remarkably better my life has become in this short time and I’m so grateful for everyone and everything that has brought me here now.   
I'm cheering for you and IWNDWYT.",18

A bit of a cautionary tale to not let it get this far. I've managed plenty of my own withdraws, figured I was Wolverine. Here I learn we mortals don't have that power forever. 

&#x200B;

Long time lurker, have been working on real sobriety the past 3 years or so. Had some good multi-month stretches, but always fell down again. Could go on and on about triggers, (for me a new book and a glass of wine \[then two more bottles of wine\]), whatever. Also repeatedly failed the regulation experiment even a little (no more hard liquor (fail), ok, JUST wine (fail), ok fuck it, just 1 beer (or 20)...fail. Went to a regular therapist, tried a few AA groups, nope. 

So here's where it's ending for me, and has to end. I've got a lot time on my hands, and money, after selling a company. No structure is no good for me. No obligations to leave my house except to buy JUULs down the block, I get my groceries delivered. So I'm on probably on day 29 of my only beers experiment, and once again the experiment failed. I'm locked into a wake up a four AM and start slugging beers, and my tolerance was enough to keep the steady flow until probably midnight, when I would, maybe, please, fall asleep. Snap awake at 3, keep going. Pretty serious stuff. But at least it wasn't that old habit was wine or whiskey like it used to be, right? 

I snap awake at the usual 3, but now, I've really gotta puke. In fuck it mode, I just puke next to my bed. Beer is easy enough to clean. Half asleep the rest of the night, puking and puking. Sun comes up, and what I thought was going to dried beer bubbles was a black bile, more likely beer and blood. This was a bit scare, and I had apparently also decided missing the bed wasn't important, so it's all over me, pillows, sheets, blankets. 

Well fuck me, I've really made a mess, and barely able to get out of bed, much less clean up. My reserve bottle of wine is the perfect thing, I'll get a little buzzed, get the pep back, and get things back in order. I lay back in the wet, disgusting sheets, and take my sip of wine. Immediately threw it up. OK...so the stomach is sensitive, we'll go back to beer. One sip, immediate throw up. Alright then...orange juice. Throw up. Water....throw up. I cannot keep anything at all down. 

I've kinda approached this level in the past....just give it time, use today to taper, just four beers. Can't keep any down. Ok well body won't have any more so we'll wait till tomorrow. After an awful, cold sweating night of semi sleep, dry heaving, and nightmares, the sun rises again. We'll try some water, throw it up. I try to get out of bed, and fall on my face. Well fuck, haven't been here before. Walllow the rest of the day barely able to move. I'll be able to keep something down tomorrow. 

The next day, after again zero sleep, from what are just now violet dry heaves every 10 minutes or so, I'm losing faith in pulling this one out alone. I realize I should be pretty sober after two days of keeping nothing in, but 2 nights of zero sleep has me seeing double, so not gonna drive anywhere. 

I never go to doctors, but am truly worried about how long I can go getting so dehydrated. I take an uber to a top rated urgent care. A nurse seems me immediately, takes my temp, blood pressure, and heart rate, and quickly leaves the room. Doctor enters, I tell him whats up, and that what I need is a stomach settler, a Valium, and an IV hydration drip. He laughs and says they've already called an ambulance. Between blood pressure and heartrate, apparently I'm about to die, maybe right there. I object, and sign an against-medical-advice, I get my own uber to the ER, with a plastic back in case I spontaneously need to puke in the car. Pouring sweat, I make it. 

ER proved not to be a total madhouse as per my expectation, and nurses checked me out immediately. I tell them I've trashed my stomach through drinking, but I think because of also being so dehydrated, my vitals are apparently all over the place. Very quickly am given EKG, and so many needles in my arms they're drawing 25 vials of blood. Lots of questions about international travel. Then chest X-Ray. Then torso CAT-scan. Then head CAT-scan. Then some waiting. 

I'm really just barely hanging on now. Finally, I'm in a room, an IV in both arms, and they start loading me up a a cocktail of fluids, anti-withdraw (some kind of benzo I guess), a stomach settler, a tranquilizer, and finally after 3 days, I'm getting fluid in me and am gonna sleep. 

Wake up to really nice nurses and doctors who spent a shocking amount of time with me, a lot of just talk, I'm freaking out I'm getting buttered up for bad news. In testing, a whole menu of possible serious damages was searched for. Sepsis, parasites, kidney, heart, eyes, failures, brain-blood-barrier breaches. HOLY FUCK! I start feeling a lot better with the fluids finally getting in, and chilled out enough to doze happily all day. 

Day 3 and the let me know the news: I am shocking lucky, the worst case they've ever seen arrive (and on top of that--walk in) and turn out without permanent damage, or permanent death. After all the testing and CRT scans, I've got mild fibrosis with no scarring, and get a long explanation that if I completely stop drinking and do good things for my liver, in 2 years it should be relatively just fine. 

So here on Day 3 (If detox doesn't count, tomorrow will be Day 1) I need to only watch that number increase. Or it's pretty much my life. 

Hospital 10/10, Every one there is really trying to save people it seems. if you know you need a detox, go to the ER. Had I known the lack of shaming they put me through for a self inflicted and selfish thing, I would have gone to one years ago, and maybe have been scared straight earlier. 

Experience for me 4/10: I'm a lucky son of a bitch, and really need to act like a grownup",7
2019-11-06 00:09:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dsblzq/feeling_overwhelmed_with_aa/,Feeling overwhelmed with AA,"I've written this 5 times. I can't seem to explain this easily. AA helped me stop drinking. But I no longer get as much from meetings. I feel myself relating less and less. And I'm feeling more and more pressure to do things I do not want to do. Not calling my sponsor every day means I'm not accountable. My friend and I suggest a meeting each week to go to together. While I know I cannot and will not make them go, it does help both of us to attend meetings. My sponsor told me only they can hold me accountable and if not then they won't be my sponsor and that I'm not utilizing the program.

I've been trying to write this for over 2 hours and getting tired. I don't want to be whiney. I've given my all to AA and I've come away wanting to drink more. Or feeling overwhelmed with calling someone every day, calling my sponsor every day, reading the literature, going to meetings at least 4 times a week. On top of daily doctor appts, household chores, vet appts, visting family, etc. It's too much. I'm doing well in my sobriety. The last few months have been my rock bottom and I've gotten through with very little thought of drinking. No I do not feel I'm perfectly fine and won't ever be tempted. But I'm using good coping skills and healthier ways to manage any cravings or thoughts.

AA is just hurting me more than helping me. I feel horrible about this as it did help me to stop but it just doesn't feel right. I feel guilty if I stop going. Just...I don't want to quit. If I quit the program everyone I know from the meetings will think I'm drinking or heading toward drink. And I'm not. I've actually had less cravings since going to the meetings less.

Anyone have any thoughts on this? I don't exactly know what I'm asking. I just need some support that it's okay to stop AA if it is doing more harm than good.",4

Sometimes I cant tell if I'm more shocked that I quit drinking or at how much of a big deal it turned out to be.  
I was a typical drinker, I would say probably balancing between very average and a bit dependent.   A hair less than a bottle of wine a day so I could keep from saying that I drank a bottle a day.  But the bottles piled up.  
I would say the biggest difference in my life is a mood shift which seeps into absolutely everything.   I gladly do my chores, and I feel more intentional about things.  I like to try to make good choices each day.  Not drinking,  not smoking,  eat a veggie, take a run, play with my son, rake the leaves, vacuum the stairs, do a load of laundry... I feel like I don't really need a vacation anymore.   I mean, not to say my life is so awesome I am always on vacation,  but that's how much worse it was before I quit.   I was always grumpy to HAVE to do stuff.  More grunting and begrudgingly making it through...all for that moment after bedtime when I could pour a fat glass of red wine.

Even went to the doctor to get a script for this so called wonderful drug naltrexone. I took it for 10 days and every single time I felt SO lethargic the filling day, even after cutting my pill I half, then quarters, then dividing up the quarters themselves!!! The crazy tired feeling made me think that even my worst hangover feeling wouldn’t cause this kind of tiredness!

Anyway that being said, what I noticed about myself more recently is when I tell myself something like ‘only one or two drinks tonight’ I actually end up consuming more like 4 or 5 in the same night. It’s like when I put a constriction on myself, I almost always rebel! I never really paid much attention to my self-talk vs consumption before until tonight. And now I’m wondering if I didn’t put those constrictions on myself if I would actually drink less? Like if I wasn’t so mindful of my drinking habit and if I didn’t think it was problematic, would I drink less? 

The mind is a curious thing, and I’m not sure I’ll be able to answer my own question any time soon, but I think I will be able to one day because I think maybe I could be on to something. I’m sure if I was more preoccupied with something else other than how many drinks I would have tonight, then maybe I would absolutely drink less. Food for thought! Any suggestions??",2

Visit after visit after visit, I kept coming up with excuses or things that I can do differently while I drink so next time I don't end up with an IV in me an medication trying to control the seizures I was having. 

Yesterday, I finally did something I've never done before. I finally told myself that I am an alcoholic. I know many people have different views on that term. But for me, I finally accepted I have a disease that I couldn't have admitted before. After that moment, a woman from the hospital came in with the Health Care Proxy form. I didn't know what this was, until I realized it was for me to choose the people I want to decide if I should live or die if i'm not able to make that decision for myself. 

I don't know if that was God, a higher being, coincidence, random, but all I know is that, that very moment touched a part of me that has never happened before in my 12 years of drinking. I swore to myself that I will never let someone make that decision for me due to alcohol. I swore to myself from that very moment. I told myself I would wake up each day knowing alcohol has done nothing positive for me all these years, besides the hurt I have put to myself, my family, my loved ones and my friends and I need to find ways to control it each and every day.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn’t:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Sorry if my trials and tribulations are getting old and frustrating to hear about. God know they are for me. Just can’t seem to kick the drink. No matter how much I want to in some moments, I toss it all away in a heartbeat in others. 

It’s gotten to the point that any social interaction or serious conversation, requires booze. I’m not one for social anxiety either, or so I thought. I was meeting with my fam the other night and was trying to find a way to weasel in drinks before. Given, the relationship between me and them has been strained over the years, but it is getting much better as of late. I speak freely to them, but only after a few drinks. 

I can’t speak about deeply personal stuff, which I really need to and seek to, unless I’ve been drinking, a fair amount. And by can’t I mean won’t but also it feels as if I truly can’t. Any real conversation is booze laden. The rest is just superficial bullshit that I put on for show. I’ve had some successes to the contrary but the fallout is an alcohol binge. 

And then a good binge, because I’m starving myself all day again. Out of self hate. It’s not working like it did when I was in my early twenties. My willpower is naught, and I drink a ton and then eat a ton. My weight is bothering me heartily, and yet I keep doing the same fucking shit. Over and over. And living the definition of insanity by expecting different results. 

My therapist has said I’m never going to find my true self, and that is something I’m desperately seeking, when I drink. Or I’ll just define myself as being an alcoholic. Really hit home yesterday. And then I went and bought vodka, to level myself out from drinking the night before. Jesus. How’s that for personal growth eh? 

Health wise I’m freaking the fuck out. I have surgery, major surgery, in a little over three weeks. I can’t go into it like this. And I NEED this surgery. From a mental health standpoint and a physical standpoint. I want to go into it feeling settled and strong. And that driver still isn’t kicking me in the ass. Guess that’s what addiction is eh? Plus, I can’t be drinking like this after. And I’ll have three months off. Which my addict mind is already having a field day with. But my body needs to be well taken care of, and drinking isn’t that. 

Ugh. Just frustrated.",3

In 2018 I did not have one sip of alcohol. In 2019 i thought i could drink a little here and there and keep it under control. By now i have blacked out twice... maybe 3 times. Last time I blacked out I think I may have done something dumb... but not sure. Waking up to a hangover made me extremely depressed like it usually does. I had a lot of suicidal thoughts and they still won’t go away. As I lay in bed tossing and turning thinking about my life, I can’t stop thinking about how alcohol has basically ruined my life. Every bad moment and decision I ever made was under the influence of alcohol. And a lot of the consequences to those actions have stuck with me for years and years. The depression won’t go away. The guilt won’t go away. The hate for myself won’t go away. I fear what more alcohol can do to me. It has already done so much bad... so... I would like to take this moment to say I will not drink with any of you today (tonight).  And cheers to hopefully new beginnings and learning how to live with this and learning how to hopefully love myself...",13

I’ve tried to quit many many many times but it only ever lasts a little while until I start secretly drinking alone every day. 

It causes me major depression and anxiety daily and has affected many aspects of my life negatively. Last week I was on the anxiety sub and someone mentioned that taking CBD oil helped a lot with there anxiousness so I went and picked up a vile of it at the dispensary and holy shit. Within minutes of taking it my body relaxed and my mind was at ease for the first time in a very long time.

I drink because I overthink a lot and because it ‘helps’ with my anxiety but I’ve been using the Cbd drops for a little over a week now and it’s literally night and day. Before, I’d wake up at 4a every day in a panic, usually have a panic attack, then be up for the day til I tried to sleep again at midnight- now when I wake up I’m well rested, I feel at ease and i finally feel like a normal person

I’m at work right now and earlier I was irritated with everyone around me (I work as a bartender in an upscale Italian restaurant) and my first instinct was to pour a stiff glass of grey goose but instead I took like, 10 drops of CBD under my tongue and it all became so much more tolerable. 

I haven’t felt like this in so long so I wanted to reach out to whoever is suffering right now, GET SOME CBD OIL! Ask someone at the dispensary what they recommend for anxiety (for me anxiety goes hand in hand with my impulsivity thus causing me to self medicate with the bottle). I promise you won’t regret it. I haven’t been this relaxed and happy in so very long and I only want others to feel the comfort of knowing things can get better. IWDWYT",40

Last week, after about two weeks of heavy bingeing even for me (750ml+ a day, while my regular was usually a pint and a few beers) I became quite ill, shaky, vomit, pain, sweating, you name it, I had it. I was freaking out and paranoid, I spent all night and day looking up symptoms of everything from liver failure to sepsis to a ruptured gallbladder. I was scared, no insurance, almost no money, and too afraid to even try the doctor. I thought that if I could at least fall asleep maybe I would just pass quietly. 

After being awake for 48 hours straight without food, because I couldn't hold it down, and drinking only water and a few sports drinks.. I finally slept, two whole hours. This was outstanding news to me, I WASN'T DEAD. 

Each day that has passed I have gotten a bit more sleep resulting in a full 8 hours last night! I have been able to eat more foods and have continued to focus on hydration. Today, I went for a bike ride though the woods that lasted an hour and a half! 

As weird as it sounds I am so very thankful for this last episode as I believe I have finally turned a corner in my life. I not only want to live, but live well. I know the road ahead won't be easy but I believe I am ready for it. I'm going to form a regular meeting schedule and begin journaling to help with triggers.

I think, mainly it's because I (for some dumb reason) thought that if I stopped drinking, several things would happen, most of them in the realms of magically induced life changes. They were: 

1. The weight would fall off. By now I would be around 20 lbs lighter, my man boobs would have sculpted into a chiselled chest, (ok, I'm exaggerating) I would be able to crack walnuts between my buttocks and presumably have enough muscle control to whistle a tune when I farted. (Ok, definitely exaggerating now.)

2. I would have achieved a zen like level of self control, unable to be tempted by _anything_. From beer to Jaffa cakes and everything in-between. 

3. I would sleep like a particularly well treated child: without dreaming yet waking with a sense of profound happiness reached only by Tibetan llama's, tai chi masters and the one person personally controls the only world who gets to maliciously fuck with random people for shits and giggles. 

But not so. However, I have found certain... Improvements. To address the first three above (and a few more, I'm sure others have pointed out these things in the past):

1. I have definitely noticed a tendency toward food or sugar addiction. Seriously, I thought I would be on three square meals, perfectly balanced nutritionally, but avoiding Kale and no more than two portions of spinach a week. No. Chocolate. Chocolate all the way. Seriously, I could sing songs, write poetry to equal the poet laureate describing my almost orgasmic need for the good stuff. Bars, biscuits, bought singly, in multipacks, share bags and all sorts. Until yesterday. Seriously, I had some chocolate biscuits and they were a bit 'meh' and the bar I had earlier today was the same. I think I've finally satisfied my cravings for that particular stuff. Thankfully. 

I've still got man boobs though. 

2. Haven't even wanted a drink for a while, i just remember the flavour and that I've decided not to for now. Maybe it will change, I hope not though. Christmas will be a challenge, it used to be an all day bender, this will be the first sober one since I was sixteen. As above, wanted a lot of chocolate until yesterday. Couldn't give a fig anymore though. Wierd, huh? 

3. I actually sleep ok, and my dreams are more... Analytical. I've always been able to attach meaning to what I dream, it's my subconscious and it's not hard for me to decode what it's trying to tell me. So far so good, but sleeping like a baby? No. I often wake up feeling like shit, wanting more than anything to just have another five minutes, but I expect this is normal. I don't glide out of bed like a Disney Princess, bird song chirping in my ear. If I'm honest if it did, I'd probably crush the bird in one hand. At least let me have some caffeine first, please. 

4. I have more control over my temper. Yes, I still shout at the kids sometimes, but it doesn't ruin my day. It fades in a few seconds, which is pretty nice. 

5. I'm actually happy with my lot in life. I'm actually enjoying what's in front of me, not wanting things I haven't got, getting jealous of what others have. Plus, beer money is now books and games money! I enjoy them far more. 

6. I'm not paranoid anymore! I used to think that people talked about me, my mental health was a rollercoaster dependent solely on my self confidence and whether it had gone into arrogance or not, but now? I've realised that it's not a case of people don't care or I've actually screwed up, but that people have better things to talk about. 

7. Excersize takes effort. I really need to get my running gear on and go out for a bit tomorrow. But even though I can't promise I will run with you all tomorrow, I can promise that I will not drink with you today. 

Thanks for letting me rant at you guys.",126

After committing to sobriety, and it becoming something that is publicly known, my phone gradually started going off less and less. I don't see that as a bad thing though. The people i was hanging out with then are still doing the same things i have sworn away.

My question here is though, how do I go out and make a new friend group that isn't fully involved in doing nothing but getting drunk and doing drugs. Every day off i get or any free time i have i want to go out and do stuff, but i literally dont know what people do. I have been going to bars every free day since adulthood.

I guess i just don't where to go to be involved in a fun and social setting that doesn't involve alcohol.  I am in my mid 20's after all and hate to think i am wasting my youth. Any advice is appreciated! IWNDWYT!",19

Vacations are so much more fulfilling when they aren't squandered on drunken hazes and hangovers. We had so many amazing adventures all over the island that we would've never been able to accomplish if we were still drinking.

So he said he drank 1 beer usually on work nights and 4 on weekend nights.  Actually it is 4 beers typically sometimes 3, sometimes 5 rarely 6. You know there is a problem because that is counting.  Then the weirdness with the recycling of the returnable cans/bottles.  He's giving them to the homeless and keeps them in his room separate and not in the hall closet.  So it was obvious the other night that he'd been drinking more than the four beers from the fridge because his demeanor shifted a bit and he was talking a bit in circles which he was saying was ""debating"".  All he does is stay in his room with the window covered over (to keep heat in) and drink and watch video games.  The other day I had an opportunity to go out after him as he dumped his recycling and look.  Sure enough, a 750 ml of cheap Rye Whiskey and four bottles of wine on top of the beers.  The downside is the spirit of a person living in a dark room drinking for his waking hours home from work is kind of a downer.  Seeing him in the grips of alcohol and hiding alone in the artificially lit room with the window closed is a good deterrent that I really love not drinking.  My plan is to get my shit together and possibly relocate to another state in one year.  I'm going to not say anything for now.  I think this is a good lesson for people who think they are fooling people about drinking.   Sooner or later there is always a very obvious sign.  IWnDWYT

I've decided that drinking is holding me back so if decided to quit. However, I've made this decision before and the #1 thing that's stopped me is my problems sleeping while sober. I've always had trouble falling asleep and 10 years ago is started using it as a sleep aid, only to also spend those 10 years feeling like shit all day until I started drinking the following evening the majority of the time.

Last night was my probably 100th first night of not drinking and once again I laid in bed for hours, either awake, or jolting awake as I tend to do when I realize I'm asleep.

I know it will get easier, and it has in the past, but drinking for me has always been the surefire way I'll get at least an ok nights sleep and the anxiety of being dead sober trying to fall asleep, with the anxiety of knowing if I dont get enough sleep I'll feel worse than a mild hangover has given me trouble.

So my question is, are there any tips that dont include other substances to help ease you to sleep on those first few nights?",1

I belong to a private club which is also my part time job and the home bar for my pool team. I haven't had a drink since last Thursday but I've been to the bar every single day for work or other obligations. I drink water or Pepsi or Sierra mist. 

When you work at this bar (and I do about 3 days a week) when you're done working you are allowed to have a shift drink. I've worked two shifts and work one again tonight and I haven't had a shift drink and I will not have one tonight either! 

I've been lurking on this sub for months and finally decided to try not drinking ""just for today"". My goal is 30 days. But each day has had it's own victory. I wouldn't say I hit rock bottom but I had been trying to moderate my drinking and it just kept getting further and further out of control. I'm enjoying going to bed at a decent time and not feeling like garbage when I wake up. I've had more clarity and energy. I've had moments of temptation but decided I like feeling good more than I like feeling wasted. My productivity in a few short days has been amazing compared to the last few months and I want to keep it going. 

I also want to admit I had been hoping to find the answers to the feelings I was struggling with over my ex and a messy breakup in the bottom of a bottle. I finally realized not only are there no answers there, but I feel worse about myself after drinking. I do not miss the shame of thinking what happened last night? I like being able to remember everything I did the night before. I like knowing I didn't risk my safety by driving or having someone else who probably shouldn't drive me. I like knowing that I will get a good night's sleep instead of passing out. I even like the looks of confusion on my friend's faces when they realize I really am drinking water, not vodka tonic.

One year ago today I rejoined crossfit after a few years of just powerlifting. I started tracking my calories again and a friend and I made a pact to not drink through the end of the year...though we were going to give each other passes for Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.

I didn't even make it to Thanksgiving before I realized that I had a far worse relationship with alcohol than I thought I did. Wait, you mean you're NOT supposed to wake up feeling like shit every weekend morning? (and frankly a few weekdays here and there, too?) It turns out there are SO many more hours in the weekend when you don't spend half of them recovering from the night before! Oh and it turns out all that anxiety I'd been experiencing? Yeah, turns out that was alcohol induced (in my case). So needless to say, I did not drink on Thanksgiving. I'd  been feeling just too damn good to risk feeling crappy again, and I just kept that train rolling....and here we are. :) One year sober, way fitter, and 65 pounds lighter.

Has it all been easy? Of course not. I live in FL. Pretty much all of our socializing around here involves alcohol in some way. But I'm also really blessed to have a boyfriend and friends who are super supportive of my choices. Do I go out as much as I used to? Frankly, no . Have I had just as many laugh-out-loud moments with friends stone cold sober this year, as I have had drunk in the past? You betcha, I have. Only sometimes now, those laughs happen as we're being silly and messing around at a Goodwill or Walmart at noon on a Sunday, instead of at a bar at 1:00am.

(Possible TW.),"Hi all.  Sorry if this is inappropriate or off-topic.  I'll understand if the mods need to delete this post.

I used to be quite active here, once upon a time, but getting a diagnosis and treatment for bipolar disorder pretty effectively killed my urge to drink, thankfully.  Through no virtue of my own, I have't had a drink for seven months and haven't been drunk for almost a year.

However, I have found myself falling into a new problem: problematic eating patterns.  Quitting drinking helped me lose weight.  Taking medication that reduced my appetite to nothing helped me lose more weight.  The extra energy I have from not being depressed all the time helped me to exercise more, and... you guessed it, lose more weight.  Altogether, I've lost about 50 pounds this year, 100 pounds down from my heaviest, and am at the ""ideal weight"" for my height, and perhaps a little underweight for my build (I'm pretty large-framed and I've been doing some strength training).

Anyway, for various reasons - positive feedback, self-esteem boost, need for control, etc. - I am not eating properly now.  I gave up meat (not a problem in itself, but is definitely a means of control), cut myself down to one meal a day, mostly stopped eating with people, and rigorously police myself / force myself to burn off ""extra calories"" with extra exercise.

I *know* I'm cultivating a problem, but - like it always was when drinking was my problem - I don't care.  It feels good.  That combined with my mental illness is a recipe for disaster, but I just.  Don't.  Care.

Can anybody relate, either specifically to the ED thing, or more generally to the act of switching one bad habit for another?",3

But I’m realizing that somewhere along the way, the script flipped. I started hiding my drinking. It started being a necessary element for me to want to attend social events. My drinking started rendering me unable to drive places, my intoxication made me feel self-conscious around strangers, my addiction left me constantly looking for an out so I could go find a drink.

In short, I fell in love with drinking to escape, and then alcohol became the constraint instead of the liberator. 

Been sober for a week now. Last night I got a call at 7:30 from someone who needed a favor. I drive to their house and helped them fix something, then had a nice conversation that I can remember. I was safe to drive. My motor skills were up to the task they needed help with. My eyes were clear and my words were crisp. Being sober has now become the refuge I once fled from.",88

2019-11-05 06:18:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/drxs4r/book_movie_tuesday/,Book & Movie Tuesday,"Good morning and welcome to another Tuesday. Today I wanted to talk about tracking our reading and viewing habits. 

It seems to me that the past few years in the business world, tracking has become all the rage. The job I had from 2013-2015 was at a hip, online retailer’s call center and they tracked/logged and scored absolutely everything we did. It was really exhausting and when I quit I was thrilled to leave that part of it behind. My current job is more of a traditional business but tracking is huge there too and only getting more extensive at both micro and macro levels. 

I got to thinking about it last year. It can be kind of depressing and dehumanizing to feel like a human productivity/error rate machine so I decided to start tracking my reading habits, to keep score on something that actually matters to me personally. I like seeing the number of books per year add up and reflecting on all the time I spent relaxing. I don’t think books or movies or TV have to be edifying to be worth doing. And sobriety is a huge aid to racking them up. I didn’t keep count back when I was drinking. I read all the time back then. I probably spent hours more per week reading back then, in fact, as my job didn’t require any overtime and I was too sick/tired to workout a lot in my spare time as I do now. But even though I spent more time, I know I finished fewer books. I remember picking up books and opening to the bookmark then flipping back a page, a chapter, a few chapters, until I got back to where something was familiar. It was slow going. And movies were much worse. I watched but did not form memory during dozens of movies per year, sometimes even at theaters. 

So as we are starting our 2020 planning at work and writing up big budgets and goal numbers and looking back at the data we logged this year, I’m thinking about my reads on my own time. I read 37 books last year and am on track for probably a few more than that in 2019. I know there’s no contest or prize for finishing a lot of titles (and no, I don’t count the ones I don’t finish for whatever reason), but it just feels nice to look back at the list. I think I’m going for 50 in 2020. How about you? Got goals? Or is it more fun for you to leave the counting out of it?",12

2019-11-05 04:53:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/drx1zm/character_vs_author/,Character vs Author," 

Reflecting on a weekend full of casual drinking (not by me) for my husband’s 40th birthday, I feel as though being sober now for some months has changed me from a character in my own life into the author of it. 

It was a typical celebratory weekend in France. For lunch with the family a bit of apero with Champagne, then the meal with a starting cocktail and wine drank throughout. Head on to dinner with his friends, apero again with a few cocktails and whiskey drinks, then wine with the meal, champagne with the cake, and then the whiskeys to keep the fire burning. 

At some point people started talking about the drinking problem of one of our mutual friends, some people poking fun, some people serious about how they were endangering all the things that mattered to them in life, some people saying it couldn't be helped because he has a disease. I stayed quiet, not afraid to speak out, but not wanting to discuss someone else’s problem as if I can really understand it because I have my own. 

Later that night a friend congratulated me for staying free from alcohol, this meant a lot to me because I do not talk about it,  but I am aware it is noticed because I am the only person I know here in France that does not drink. Others are politely awkward about the fact that I abstain. 

All of this leads me to a thinking about myself when I was drinking, what would have been said about me at a table discussion of friends drinking, but not drinking  like me. Thats when it felt like a shift to me. By taking control of alcohol in my life I went from the character, my identity being shaped by alcohol and people’s character sketch of who I was because of it, to a person who is writing her own identity. Alcohol robbed me of making my own decisions, and of controlling my own thoughts, emotions, actions. Without it each choice and thought process is more my own. I will continue to write my own future without the heavy hand of alcohol.

Sorry if this was too long, but after passing 100 days just wanted to contribute a little. IWNDWYT!",24

Everyone who posts here seems to have such control over things. Like, ""this happened and I didn't drink"" or ""I bought a six-pack and dumped it down the sink"" type posts, while I'm over here knowing that if I encountered those situations or bought a six-pack I'd probably be right back into those same habits I was neck-deep in. Please don't think I'm discounting anyone's successes, but...sometimes it just seems way too hard and i don't know why. And the worst thing is it actually almost makes me more depressed than I was. 

People here with less days than me seem so far along while I'm sitting here *still* trying to get the alcohol smell out of my bedroom. I know it's not a competition, but I browse through this sub on an hourly basis at least to keep my spirits up, and it just kinda sucks seeing all these happy posts when I'm still trying to find ways just to cope. 

I'm probably just being silly, so don't mind me. I just wanted to get my thoughts down somewhere so I can refer back to them and add them to the list of the reasons why I choose not to drink today. I don't know why, but sometimes, it seems even this sub is a trigger. I need better coping skills, I think.",2

I think the last time I was leaving my ex who supported me through my start of sobriety. I stopped drinking and picked up a nasty coke habit. I eventually met some younger thing that was also into the coke party lifestyle. I left the support I had and decided to start a new life with the person I was doing coke with. My luck eventually ran out and I got caught with a small amount of coke. The courts offered me a plea bargain: no felonies, no jail, just probation for three years. So I took it... The whole process took about a year to actually convict me and by then I was sober and clean.  A few years had gone by, girly and I had since moved in together, got cats, and we're doing the whole domestic thing. The relationship wasn't bad, it wasn't violent or crazy, it just was... It felt like two people just living through moments together, but not actually living. Funny thing about coke is it revs everything up to eleven but when it's all over and done with, everything just feels like a five. We were just resting at a five... 

About a week ago we had the talk... 

It was mutual, but at the end, parts of me still fought to save something just to stave off being alone. Looking back I don't think I've ever been alone. The idea still scares me thinking about it now, but that good kind of scared... At least sometimes I feel that way. 

The thing is right now we still live together... At least for a few more months. So the transition is hard because there are tons of emotions involved and this is the first time I've had to deal with those kind of feelings clean and sober. I don't have a craving to drink... But I won't lie, the idea has crossed my mind. I know it wouldn't be a good one considering I know that outcome. So, I've been going to the gym, painting, working, trying to eat healthy, and will be starting a new play tomorrow... 

I just keep having these moments were my emotions get the best of me and I don't think as a person I ever understood how to deal with them. 

I don't know if I started this post with a question in mind. I think I just needed to say this to someone.

I'm telling myself it's okay to feel things, to feel sad, or hurt. 

I keep telling myself that this is only temporary and that I shouldn't fret over the things I cannot control. 

And most days it works. Just some days it doesn't and those are the days that are hard. 

Thanks for the read.",4

Really, though, I think I was mainly just going through the motions of sobriety without *really* meaning it. 

I was sober because I knew I needed to be, but not because I actually *wanted* to be.

This time I not only feel that I REALLY need to be sober, but I actually WANT to live a sober life. I'm totally over alcohol. There's nothing else it can do FOR me, and everything negative it can do TO me.

I don't feel any craving to drink at all. I do miss it, the way it makes me feel, but it's just not worth it and I feel like I  won't go crawling back again this time.

My girlfriend wanted to go t a Halloween party and helpfully signed me up to be the designated driver and I wasn't too happy about that at first.

But now that it's over, I'm glad I did it. I'm glad I was sober and capable of driving and making sure we all got home safely. This was the biggest win of the night. Instead of staying home and worrying all night about whether my girlfriend would get back home safely, I saw to it myself.

At the party itself, I felt good too. Everyone except me and one other girl were drinking like their livers owed them money, and in another life I would have resented them and their youth and their health. I would have been sullen and irritated.

This time was different. I was in control of myself and as things devolved around me, I was in control of those situations too.

My girlfriend, despite many discussions about how she should not do, immediately became hopelessly drunk. But this time I was able to simply remove the shot glass out of her hand and set it down after she had had her fill. Nobody said anything, and she didn't pick up another one. A big win there.

One skinny kid had way too much, way too fast. He was only 19 I guess, which I didn't know until after he was already completely trashed (I had never met him before) but unlike other nights, I didn't just watch him fall down and hurt himself or go into a coma. Instead I talked to 4 or 5 people until I found some people who knew him and told them he was blitzed. They all gathered around him, got him a pillow to rest his dainty head upon, made him drink water, and called his sober brother to come pick him up. Another win.

I'm 22 living in a small drunk rural city and having such a hard time meeting people I can spend time with. 

The problem is that when I'm in a social situation and alcohol is near me or offered to me, it's game over, I can't control myself. That wouldn't be a big deal if I could meet anybody who didn't drink or do drugs constantly. I find it strange because most of my anxiety and depression happens when I'm alone but I have much better control when I am alone.

2019-11-05 01:48:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/drvjg4/1_year_today/,1 Year Today.,"If you would have told me 1 year + 1 day ago that I would go an entire year without drinking I would have laughed at the idea. My entire life revolved around alcohol. I couldn't leave my house without having at least 2 or 3 drinks. Every activity, every lunch, every dinner, and every meetup involved drinking. Every friend I had was a drinking buddy. I was probably spending close to $700 a month on alcohol. To me, it was normal. I didn't understand people who didn't drink. I, regretfully now, talked shit to people for not drinking. Even when I was diagnosed with a fatty liver I stupidly just decided to ""drink healthy"" and switched to only drinking vodka. I was a fucking mess.

Then one night, 1 year and a day ago, I went into to the local convenience store to buy my daily bottle of vodka. I had a gig DJing and desperately needed a buzz before getting to the club. I walked up to the counter and the clerk who I had known for a few years at this point looked at me and said ""You drink too much"". I was pissed. How the fuck could this person tell me that? We always made small talk but now she is talking shit to me. I just gave her a look and bought my bottle and went on my way. The whole night at the club I thought about what she said. It haunted me for some reason. As if it was the biggest insult someone had every said to me. Even after I finished my set, packed up, and got a taxi home I kept thinking about. Then I realized it upset me so much because she was the only person who ever called me out on it. She wasn't attacking me. This person I barely knew had said it because she genuinely gave a shit about me.

The next day I decided to stop. I wanted to see if I really had a problem. The first few days were a breeze. I thought I'd just take a break for a few weeks to prove to the world I wasn't an alcoholic and then I'd pick things back up. After the first week I felt like I was going crazy. Dizzy, stressed, hearing/seeing shit, and raging out over small things. That is when I knew she was right, I was fucked. I stuck it out and over another week or so I got my shit together. It was like being a completely different person. After a month and a half I felt great and decided that not drinking wouldn't just be a phase but something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

I had to make a lot of sacrifices. I stopped partying and quit the 2 club nights I had built up. It broke my heart but I couldn't really exist in that world anymore without alcohol. I also began to get serious about my health and making sure my liver didn't get completely fucked up. I lost a lot of friends. No burnt bridges or anything but when you really only see people out or meet up over drinks you realize being sober leads to isolation. I ended up just closing out my social media accounts because almost every post I saw was just people partying and getting fucked up.

I felt alone for a long time. I was being healthy and saving money but I just felt like I was in even more of a rut. I was also really bored. I decided that I needed shit to do. I had stopped drinking and cut out almost everything in my life attached to it but forgot to replace it with anything. I joined a gym, picked up some hobbies and allowed myself some fun.

We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn’t:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Asia and Australia—Evening/Night

2019-11-04 21:46:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/drsxmc/should_i_go_to_an_aa_meeting/,Should I go to an AA meeting?,"Within the last 5 months, I have become completely sober from weed (4-5 months) and alcohol (2-3 months). I consider myself an addict in general (not specific to either substance) because...

1. I very often relied on weed or alcohol in order to avoid pain or uncomfortable situations. A lot of the other times were because I was bored.
2. It was almost impossible for me to control myself once I started smoking or drinking. (EX: One drink was never enough, etc.)
3. I would habitually (daily or multiple times a day) use weed or alcohol (usually not both).
4. I put myself in dangerous situations.
5. I've gotten myself in trouble due to using weed and/or alcohol.

My drug of choice was usually weed once I had access to it, but I would always drink (a lot) if I didn't have weed or there was a good reason to drink. Now that I'm not around weed much, it's been a little easier to not be tempted. However, alcohol is something I can't avoid and I'm getting closer and closer to using it again. I especially want to use it because I'm very depressed that I can't find many activities to meet people around my age (20s) that don't involve alcohol.  I also feel very isolated due to being the only person I associate with that's sober.

Are my reasons good enough to go to AA? I truly feel like I am getting closer to drinking again, but I don't want that for myself. I also feel like my addiction isn't bad enough for me to go to AA and I'll be out of place.",6

I don't seem to have any issue not drinking, rather, I struggle to stop once I start.

Sober October was a great success, and I was feeling very good about sobriety. The only issue I faced was a complete lack of social life. Like a lot of you, my friend group is based around drinking.

Saturday night I decided to meet at a friends place and hangout. I knew I was going to have a few beers, but I thought I had it in me to keep things in control. The next thing I know I'm blacked-out in front of my house at 2am. I happened to catch something strange out of the corner of my eye in my neighbors yard. It was a man laying face down. I gave him a few good nudges and didn't get any response. It's getting cold where I live (below freezing at night) and this man wasn't wearing a jacket.

I woke up my neighbor because I figured he'd want to know what's going on, and he called 911. An ambulance came and took the man away. I'm mortified that my neighbor saw me so drunk. My girlfriends mad at me, and I'm just as mad at myself.

All day Sunday I laid in bed and thought about the man passed out in the cold. I could easily be that man. You could easily be that man. He was lucky to be found, but not everybody can be so lucky.

The irony is that if I hadn't stayed out late drinking he would undoubtedly be dead. Sometimes things happen for a reason. Maybe that was part of the deal? He get's to have his life saved, and I get a sobering wake-up call?",4

The thing is, I live in a small town. I was at the bar 2 weeks ago for the rugby, and I know she was drinking beer then. I saw her do it. Of course I don't give a shit - she can or can't drink whatever she wants, not my problem.

It never would even have occurred to me to mind that she had a beer - but it irritated me to hear her dismiss a sober month as useless when she hadn't even done it.

I didn't say anything - what would the point have been? But I was annoyed.

And I came home and I thought about WHY I was annoyed. Because if I'm annoyed every time someone lies about their alcohol consumption I will be pretty miserable pretty quickly.

Maybe it is my own ego that is troubled - i HAVE done 'sober October' and I feel great. Where is my credit? What is the point of claiming to do something you have not done? (of course, I'm not doing this for credit, I'm just trying to think through my own thought processes...)

So I need to try and figure out what's going on in my own head. I can't figure out that woman's shit - I need to concentrate on my own. Right?

He hadn’t drank much Friday.  He woke up Saturday with full body shakes and vomiting bile.  All day he puked up what he drank. Couldn’t even keep water down, let alone a shot of whiskey. At about 8:30 pm, he made a strange noise and when I turned to him, I realized he was having a seizure. 

This has been the most traumatic experience of my life. Over the top of what I was actually seeing, I was seeing him dead on our couch. I have never had to dial 911. I can’t get that sound out of my head. I can’t get the look on his face when he seized nor the look of terror when he came to.

So hey  this is my new day 1. I had recently completed 28 days and decided to dabble with that slippery word ""Moderation"". I will say, overall, I was much happier with this attempt at moderation but - look where we are again. Bear with this long post, it just helps to get some of this off my chest...

End of May, I decided to follow my dreams and move to Mexico. I had a job, a place to live, and the begrudging support of my spouse - aptly acronymed ""AA"". Prior to leaving, I was toying with the self diagnosis of a stint of depression as so much of my life just seemed... dim. Not bad or unhealthy or anything just - boring. Uninteresting. Monotonous to the Nth degree. My mother passed away 6 years ago now - at the age of 54 and this made me wonder if 'this' is all we live for. So - I bit the bullet and made the move. As expected, the first few months were great - sunshine, beaches, new friends and experiences. I even did my 28 days during this time and I felt AMAZING (so why, the million dollar question, would i ever entertain that poison again...). Then real life started happening. My employer wasn't paying me, the friends I was frequently spending time with turned out to be pretty awful people, and I was losing my fire. Worst yet, I was starting to have suicidal thoughts that were more than a fleeting thought once in a blue moon. Previous work experience in the ICU, Emergency Room, and Operation Room lead me to have an understanding of what methods ""work"" or are ""more efficient"". WHAT THE FUDGE TARA - YOU NEED TO GET YOUR MENTAL HEALTH IN CHECK. I am grateful that I am/was well enough to recognize that and to action getting help. 

4 am in tears, I called my dad. He booked me a flight back home (Freezing Cold Canada, eh) in fricking November. Come one, could we not have had this crisis in the summer time, brain?? 

So here I am. Two therapy sessions in and she wants to see me tomorrow (she made an expedited appointment) to do a depression screening. I am anxious to do that. I am receptive to it because - well, hello mental wellness for myself, my family, my friends, etc. But I also want to do this as clear minded and unaffected as possible so here goes my 90 day attempt at AF. I mean, I know I CAN do it. I'm just struggling because of being lonely, sad, scared, depressed, feeling like a failure, etc etc. But this how you start falling into the dangerous relm of using alcohol as a coping mechanism rather than a treat or one off - if you choose that route. The more I think about it, and the more I live my days, I am more receptive to the fact that AF might be the safest path for my life. Maybe not a never - but not until I really decide I want it. Because I don't want it. I don't want the tears and terrible thoughts that become uncontrollable with more wine (my trigger is most definitely wine). I don't want the hangovers that impede me from visiting my Goddaughter and best friend. I don't want the beer belly or the inability to work out in the morning because I couldn't stop at ""one or two"". I don't want the empty wallet, slurring speech, stumbling, how the heck did I get homes. I am ready to be in control again. Of my drinking and mental health. 

To make this a conversation post... Has anyone here dealt with mental health issues at the same time as navigating your AF journey? I recall around day 10-14 feeling very introverted and lonely AF so I am slightly concerned if this will be magnified or if this was just the ""clear"" mind acknowledging the legitimate depression I may have been battling all along....

Thanks everyone. And **congrats** to you on your journey no matter where you are, day one like me, day 27 and struggling, day 182 or even just thinking about starting. <3",5

In the dusk I could see a man walking ahead of me along the trail by the river. He paused at the top of a small hill to catch his breath. 

""Hey I you mind looking back every minute or so to make sure I haven't keeled over,"" he asked. He looked to be about 75. ""I don't want to have another heart attack tonight.""

I said I'd walk with him so we continued on slowly. After some quizzing he revealed he has had four prior heart attacks.

""I'm on my way to the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting at the church,"" he said. ""I'll soon get my coin for five years sober.""

So I asked him about his drinking career, disclosing I had a few sweaty nights getting dry myself just earlier that week. 

""I was a whiskey drinker,"" he said. ""I could drink a 60oz of that stuff in about four hours. 

""The night I had my first heart attack I had drank two half-gallons of moonshine.""

He told he stopped when the doctor told him if he had one more drink be would die. The delirium he underwent then was nightmarish. 

""In the hospital those first nights I was vibrating about this high off the bed,"" he said, gesturing to knee height. ""Visions of bears, wolves and snakes attacking me...I punched a nurse because I thought she was some wild animal.""

I think this grizzled old survivor appeared in my path thanks to some providence. He's a lesson about just how bad things can get, yet how miraculously we can find out way out again.

I'm tired of this.

I have naltrexone. I was prescribed it on Jan 29, 2019. There were originally 30 pills in the bottle. There are now 6 pills. That means in 279 days, I've been sober 24. Most of those were in the first few weeks of getting the pills. Some were in the following weeks after lying to my doctor about my drinking being better. I felt bad, I'd try again for a few days.

This is going to kill me. I know it. I just don't feel like I can stop it.

Starting today, I'm going to try again. I'm doing it differently this time.

* I've called around town for a therapist. Like everyone, I've got shit I need to deal with.
* I've started working out. Hopefully it will help.
* I've made a new reddit account for posting my fitness and drinking progress. People don't care, but I think it'll help.

So I have had an on/off relationship with the bottle since my mid 20s.  I just turned 37 and at this point I know if I don’t truly stop this will end BAD.  Like ... life ending BAD.   I “quit” in the past but it wasn’t really quitting I guess ... more of a non-drinking phase.   It truly feels like a demon on my back that likes to tantalize me with the idea that having a drink will make the pain go away.   And that’s true... for the first 20 minutes of drinking ... and then a bottle and a half of Ketel later I am on the floor trying to sabotage my entire life and feeling that I deserve to be unhappy.   I convinced myself for years that I don’t have the willpower to truly quit ...so a drink would always be in my near or distant future.  Plus, when I would go a nice long stint sober ... I would reward myself in the worst way ... WITH A DRINK!  


I’ve tried so many things to rid myself of the demon but time and time again the demon has prevailed... And I’m scared.   

I am on Day 2 and this can no longer be a contest, this can no longer be a bet against myself, I need to end this affair once and for all ... and so I am asking the successfully sober people here for help.  What works for you?   I want to not drink with you today, tomorrow and for the rest of my life...",7

That they no longer feel comfortable being around me and won't for a long time to come. I can't blame them, I wouldn't blame anyone for cutting contact with someone that toxic and harmful. The only thing I can do now is work to be the person I always should have been. There's an AA meeting tomorrow I'm going to go to. Hopefully that will be a good starting point.

On a more positive note, I came forward about my drinking problems to one of my closest friends and she didn't leave me. A part of me wonders if it would be different if she had actually seen me at that point, but I know that's not a helpful thing to think about. I'm just happy to have someone I know be supporting me with this.

I have so many regrets for the things I did and the people I hurt, part of me is screaming that I'm just not worth it. But I know if I give in to that voice, I'll never be able to fix this problem. If I give in and let myself wallow in depression like I used to, I'll have learned nothing from this. I need to be better for the people who care about me. I have a long road to overcome 24 years of depression and anxiety that I never learned to cope with which led to my drinking problem, but I'll make it there one day.

I drank Thursday night on Halloween. I didn’t even go to a party or a bar or a restaurant, I got a pint of whiskey and drank that at home. By myself. Like I used to in my bad days. I didn’t even consider beer or wine or anything else but whiskey. 

Drinking Thursday night led to me drinking Friday night. Friday night drinking led to drinking all day Saturday and I drank a fifth of whiskey. 

Sunday was full of pain and regret and the hangover/withdrawal has carried on into today. I’m anxious, my stomach is upset, I have a headache, I couldn’t sleep. I knew it was going to be like this, but it was like I couldn’t stop myself. Or I was convinced that it wouldn’t be too bad this time since I had almost 6 months under my belt. Neither of which are true. I could’ve stopped myself and it is just as bad. Kindling is the worst. Now my badge is back at 1 day. But, at least it’s a day in the right direction again. 

I read somewhere on here earlier today when I was gathering the courage to reset my badge, that if you’re not working on your recovery, your relapse is working on you. Boy does that ring true for me right now. Time to start working on recovery again.

I didn’t berate him because five years ago this could so easily have been me and I did have a problem with alcohol, I’m not sure if he does or doesn’t but he’s an adult and needs to work it out. Unlucky? I’m just not judging. But my kids ended up having a conversation which was kinda great (obviously would rather they had no awareness of the issue but it is what it is, I’m trying to deal with it). He (9M), is dad an alcoholic? She (13F), no, mums the alcoholic. He, but mum doesn’t drink. She, exactly! I was telling my sister (50F) this and she said, you’re not an alcoholic, you don’t drink anymore. I said, exactly! How come the kids get it and she doesn’t? The plus side is I have had great conversations with the kids about what an alcoholic is and isn’t and having beaten myself up for years about being a bad mum finally feel I have in a small way been able to provide some small positives to them in terms of drinking and future life choices (especially for 13yr old who is more aware and also at an age where her friends are experimenting).

I feel like a constant failure, like I’m constantly letting my wife down. Constantly not working to my full potential

Maybe a little graphic, but I feel the need to share. I spent today at work feeling awful because of 2 days and 40 or so bud lights. Terrible IBS flare up, went to the men’s room 13 times total. Tremors. Blood Pressure 160-170/110 all day. Anxiety so bad I took 2 and 1/4 mgs of Xanax just to function (I am prescribed and take .25mg for people speaking/agoraphobia as needed sometimes .50) Accomplished basically nothing with my door closed to my office all day like a recluse. This isn’t life and this sure isn’t living.

But a little after 1pm something made me stop to look at the pictures of my three beautiful kids on Halloween. My beautiful wife I don’t deserve. Happiness. Smiles. Life.

And I guess it kind of hit me. I’m 36 years old and it’s either get busy living or get busy dying the slow miserable death that alcohol is surely bringing my way. I have so much to be sober for and i realize more and more that alcoholism is the most selfish of acts when I have so many that depend on me

My first time going sober was May 2018 and broke my streak after a wedding. Well, fast forward a year and a half later, and I'm back. I went to my best friend's wedding Saturday. Everything was wonderful and fun, until I got in my lyft. I completely blacked out and after getting out of my lyft I fell onto my face and left all my personal belongings in the middle of the street as I crawled back into my building. I only remember tiny bits and pieces. I feel lucky I didn't get raped or killed, or seriously seriously injured myself. When I woke up yesterday and looked in the mirror, I knew I really needed a life change. Thank God my boyfriend found my belongings outside. I live in the inner city and I'm truly blessed nothing was stolen and that I made it safely in my home.   


I had a severe panic attack, it's been about a year of experiencing such a bad one, and called an uncle who also experiences panic attacks and has been sober 26 years. He encouraged me to try AA, and an hour later I walked into my first meeting, scared shitless sobbing my eyes out with a cut up face. I took today off work as a mental health day, I dread being questioned about my face and my injury. I'm so ashamed and feel so ugly. I feel so lucky my boyfriend is still with me, as he has seen my black out episodes many times, and some of the things I have done while blacked out have been out of control. 

&#x200B;

I'm scared, anxious and depressed out of my mind but all I know is I am someone who should not drink. I don't know what I'll do at my next concert, birthday party, holiday, etc. but for now I am avoiding being around alcohol at all, and am going to my second AA meeting tonight, and I'm just as nervous as I was yesterday. All I am doing at the moment is praying to the universe that I can be safe, healthy, and happy and choose not to drink. I am lucky to be alive today. That's all. Just wanted to post because I'm feeling anxious at the moment and reading this subreddit has helped before. SO hello, nice to meet everyone and thanks for reading.",6

Why did I join stop drinking? It probably appealed to my narcissistic side, it always comes out when I'm drunk or hungover, I exaggerate, lie, crave attention... grandiose statements are away of scratching that unattractive itch.

So off I went - I found it difficult during Sober October - doing is harder than saying - I came here every day, I did daily checkins for a while, I reflected on my drinking, on my self, I did a lot of things I was proud of with my spare time and money, and I learned strategies for dealing with sober living: dodge the cravings, have a story to sidestep awkward questions, have a kombucha or a 0% beer in the fridge for emergencies, sit quietly and forgive yourself when your mind darkens, reach for junk food, late nights and endless video games if you really want to do wallow - not a bottle.

I listened to This Naked Mind on Audiobook every day - as per your recommendations - I installed Reddit on my phone just to check StopDrinking at 5pm for reminders and guidance, or snippets of wisdom.

Well 1st of November rolls around... all my drinking buddys turn up at *my* apartment, the congratulations ripple round for Sober October, and then the Irish Coffees start first thing, then onto the beers, then onto Spirits... all before 3pm or 4pm

I didn't drink. 

I enjoyed the whole day - all the stuff we normally do. Sports, games, wandering around the city, food, chatting nonsense. It was all still great, better even.

Everything I've learned, everything I've read here, This Naked Mind, the better life I've experienced, well turns out it all added and had a profound affect on me. I thought I was heavy drinker, taking a break for a bit of attention - but I was an alcoholic, and I'm trying to quit for good.

I really truly didn't want to drink. I can see the negatives of drinking, and I *want* the positives of sobriety for the first time.

I'm trying not to think about the times ""where I'll definitely end up drinking"" anymore - I've found something that works for me - wake up each day and decide not to drink.

Thanks to everyone here. I didn't always comment or upvote, but every day /r/StopDrinking supported me, and changed me.

For those of you that are new-ish, let me give you a bit of background. I post here every time my Badge Count trips 100 day increments.  

Why? Because forever is a loooong time. So when I first managed to stay quit for more than a day or two, I lasted 60 days before a relapse. When I came out of the relapse, I just wanted to break my record...and I did.  

At that point, I said to myself, ""I will ask myself, after 100 days, if it's a good time to start back up."" And now I do it after every 100 days. I can do 100 days...but ""forever"" seems like a real long time.  

So here we are, I just tripped 2400 days, and the question gets asked again.  

And the answer is still ""No.""  

For those of you struggling in the early stages, believe me, you are not alone. EVERYONE struggles in the early stages. This is *not* easy, if it was, anyone could do it. Fact is, it's monumentally difficult, but it's worth it.  

I encourage you to do whatever it takes to keep a glass out of your hand. Read stuff. Listen to podcasts. Watch YouTube videos. Jump into the chatroom. Call your local AA hotline. Join a recovery community.  

**Do** stuff. If you aren't working on your recovery, then your relapse is working on you.  

2400 days might seem like a lot to many of you, but it really isn't. I still get those wee pangs when I am at a concert and walk past the beer stand, or if I am walking past a patio on a hot day and I see the waitress walking some frosty mugs to a table.  

I am still an alcoholic, and that will never change. The big difference is that I am much stronger now, and able to resist the impulse to drink with less effort. This strength comes with time and effort.  

You can't expect to walk into a gym as a pale, bloated blob with no muscle tone, and expect to get in bodybuilder shape in a month. I know this for a fact, because I'm a pale bloated blob.  

Yeah, this takes time, but slowly, as my life transformed, I realized that I didn't need booze any more. Instead of self-loathing and remorse, I was building self-respect and confidence in myself.  

But I am still an alcoholic. I see people with months, or years of recovery, give it another try. There might be some that managed to pull it off, and control their intake, but I haven't met any. What I have met is dozens of people who tried to drink again, and ran it into the ground.  

So today, on day 2400, I ask myself, ""Is today a good day to start drinking again? Do I want to take that chance of wrecking everything I have built, all for the sake of a few hours of intoxication?""  

Today the answer is no, and I pledge to this community that supported me, that I will not drink for another 100 days. On Day 2500, I will ask myself the question again.  

By the way, 100 days passes much quicker than you might think. Give it a try.

Thankfully I have not gone completely off the bandwagon since January but I have relapsed twice and I’m scared of going back to the person I was before starting this journey. I’m a woman in my 20s working a corporate job and surrounded by a pretty strong social drinking culture.

I went to AA for a couple of months but I just couldn’t relate. There was no denying there was a pretty big age gap.

The reason I relapsed I think (other than my mind wanting alcohol) is because I felt like I didn’t fit in or that people didn’t want to spend time with me because I didn’t drink. I don’t think they did it on purpose but it definitely triggered me to drink again. 

I miss being sober and being able to do what I want whenever I want (going to the gym, getting errands done early in the morning, having extra time...). I want to do this again but I don’t know how... The things I did before won’t cut it anymore.

I posted day 2 on day 3 which was wednesday. Thursday I was going to update but my wife was home and I wanted to spend time with her sober. 

Friday I went to a concert in downtown nashville. Saw all the drunks and realized at one point that was me and was relieved I wasnt. 

Saturday I coached soccer.. had a blast playing goalie.. built a robot. (Picture coming soon.) Hung out with my father.. did top golf. He doesnt know I'm doing 30 days so I ordered a Heineken 0.0. Sunday I was about ready to crack. Not going to lie. But as luck would have it. The credit card machine was down and I dont believe in cash. So I put the beer back and did postmates instead and made some money. 

Here it is monday. Which should be day 7 I believe and I started a new book that I think everyone should try.. the book is called everything is fucked. Funny book, and I just started it, but it gave some insight to something I do and why I drink. In the book it talks about there is the feeling brain and the thinking brain.  The thinking brain thinks it's in control when really it is the passenger.. we rationalize our feelings. The feeling brain is the driver and continues to search out for positive feelings. The rush of sugar in a beer makes me feel good and I rationalize the drinking in the morning as addicted. But the truth is I would be better off having a juice for the same effect. Hope that makes sense.

For the first time I went public with my goal to not drink-hoping it would help with accountability. Well that all went to shit this Saturday. I embarrassed myself and most importantly I embarrassed my daughter. I said something rude to her boyfriend which of course I didn’t remember. He witnessed me acting a fool vomiting on myself and the whole bit. I woke up the next day absolutely mortified, hating myself just wanting to die. I feel like a complete failure. I feel like a loser and a shitty person. I always feel this way after a night of awful drinking. And it’s always the same, I will stop drinking for sometime and then BAM its like I forget these horrible feelings and ignore the horrible reality of my drinking problem. 2 weeks ago I vowed to not drink alcohol for a year-made it only 2 weeks and now I am back to square one. I am so tired of this vicious cycle. I need help and I don’t know where to get it. I know I can never drink, I know I am an alcoholic, I know that alcohol will continue to erode and ruin my life, but it seems that even though I know these things I keep coming back to it. How many rock bottoms does it take? Any suggestions on what I can do to to stay on track?",5

2019-11-04 12:53:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/drl9mb/ready_for_a_change/,Ready for a change,"I am a 35 year old married father of 2. I have been a functioning alcoholic for over 10 years.  I never drank in high school because I didnt hang out with other kids who drank but started to binge drink in college as many college kids do. After I graduated and moved out on my own I started buying bottles of liquor on a regular basis and experimenting with what I liked. I worked in boiler room type sales office where drinking beers during lunch, in the office during the afternoon, and going out for cocktails several nights per week were common occurrences. One night I had so much to drink that I got home and left my car running in the garage. My wife demanded a change and I did slow down but only temporarily. 

After my first son was born, the going out after work for drinks slowed down but the rest didn't. I switched from drinking at a bar to drinking at home. I eventually left the sales job so they day drinking quit but I kept drinking in the evening and during the day on the weekends. I used to buy top end liquor but soon found that I was going through it too fast and it was getting expensive so I started buying the cheaper stuff. After several fights with my wife about my ""alcohol breath"" I started to drink only vodka thinking that would help me hide it better.  For the last several years I have now been in an never ending battle for making sure that I have enough to drink every night. A 1.75L of vodka will only last me 3 or 4 nights which does not include any other drinks I have when out with friends, watching sports, family functions etc. My wife knows that I drink too much but she doesn't know how much. I have developed a system of buying bottles of vodka and hiding them all while continuously refilling the bottle she knows about so she thinks I only go through a bottle every couple weeks. 

I provide for my wife and kids but as they are getting older I am concerned about the example I am setting for them.  Do they wonder why I always have a short glass filled with clear liquid and a couple ice cubes?  Do they smell my breath the way my wife does?  I am concerned with my health as well. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and despite having my medication increased repeatedly it has not gone down. I have not been honest with my doctor about my drinking. 

On Saturday night I was at a party and everyone was drinking light beer. After a couple I felt it wasnt getting me drunk fast enough so I started drinking vodka. I quickly got drunk and wanted to go home. On the way home I had to stop twice to throw up outside the door. I live only a short distance from the party and I know drinking and driving is unacceptable but that didn't stop me. On Sunday after the party I woke up and decided it was time for a change. Yesterday was the first day I didn't have a drink in months...maybe a year...I cant remember the last day I didn't drink to excess. I barely slept last night because of the amount of night sweats I was having but woke up with a clear head this morning and started Googling about AA. I stumbled on this subreddit and was brought to tears several times reading what others have shared.  This is the most honest I have ever been with myself about my drinking habits. The idea of never drinking again is very difficult to deal with. I have an active social life where drinking in moderation is very acceptable but no one in my family or circle of friends is aware of how much I drink alone. I fear that cutting back isn't an option because I have a hard time controlling myself after just one drink. 

The issues I wrote about above are only a small sampling of the bad decisions I have made, fights with my wife about drinking and daily denial I go through.  I am not sure where to go from here but I am hoping this is a good place to start.",11

Maybe talking about it with people who experience the same thing might be much more comforting and constructive.

I was a really bad drinker after a lot of personal problems from 2014, especially bad around 2016 - 2017, peaking around Winter 2017. I very rarely drank in 2018. When I did, I went fucking mad on the stuff. I stopped for good after a particularly embarrassing bender around May 2018. Since then, it was very irregular, like 4 months off it, start again for 2-3 days and then 4 months off again. The last time before this week was March 2019.

I thought I really kicked it this time, I really did. Since August my personal life has taken some real shit turns (for reasons I dont really want to go into right now) and it just felt like I was getting kicked down, kicked when down and then every chance something might come along to pick me up I would be kicked down even harder. 

Last Thursday, I reached breaking point. It honestly felt like an out of body experience. I went and bought some beer, then went and drank around in bars after finishing those beers. In typical fashion, blacked out drunk. Woke up the next morning with zero recollection of how I got home, vomit on the floor. Typical behaviour when I get like this.

Decided that, fuck it, few more wont hurt. I end up in a pub, drinking again. This continues long into Friday night. Random conversations with strangers, acting like a fucking moron in public. I'm so embarrassed this time because I really thought I was over it all.

Everytime I drink I get really bad anxiety. Like really crippling anxiety. I know its ridiculous, because normal me honestly wouldn't hurt a fly, but I'm always afraid I've committed some life-altering crime after a blackout. I spend the next few days trawling through local police reports, news reports to make sure nothing has happened. Continuously trying to map my steps on Google maps to piece the nights together. I've been doing this every single time I drank for 6-7 years, and it used to be a lot more regular. I know it's ridiculous, because nothing has ever happened and nothing ever will happen, but the anxiety and guilt I feel keep telling me to be afraid of some unknown consequences. I really thought I had turned a corner, but now I feel just like I've always felt, it was a nice few months when I didnt have to worry about this crap. 

I was so proud of where I'd gotten to, now I feel as low as ever. I cant be the only one who has extreme anxiety like this, can I? I guess by putting this out there I'm trying to come to terms with this horrible, irrational anxiety. Hopefully in the future this wont happen again, and I can leave this horrible feeling in the past forever.",10

2019-11-04 10:56:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/drjimf/aok_monday_work_it/,AoK Monday: Work It!,"Hi everyone!

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK which have touched us this past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about secondhand or through the media. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

The AoK I’ve been working on in my own life this past week is at my job. I’ve been focusing (when possible - I’m still human, it doesn’t always work that way) on how I can be of service to others. I’m focusing on how I can help my customers take care of what they need to get taken care of, and I’m working on maintaining an attitude that this is what I’m choosing to do. I’m choosing to show up for work and be of service how I can. I’m not trapped doing this, this is my choice. I can choose how I show up.

I saw a news article about a [sanitation worker who formed a friendship with an elderly woman on his route after he saw her fall and helped her back to her house.](https://fox4kc.com/2019/10/16/thats-me-metro-sanitation-worker-shocked-to-see-his-simple-kind-act-viewed-by-thousands/) (And in a weird twist of modern life, the first indication he had that anyone else knew about it was when he saw it reported on the local news.) 

He’s a sanitation worker. He drives a garbage truck and loads it. That is necessary work, and it helps everyone in his community live a healthy and happy life. It’s already fairly anonymous and under-appreciated work, and probably not always entirely pleasant. But he’s showing up for work in such a way that he was able to see how he could be of service to this woman. His AoK wasn’t just a one time gesture, he’s continuing to show up for her and have awareness of her needs and compassion for her as a person. That’s pretty inspiring, and a good example for me of how I want to live my life.

So that’s it for me this week. How’s everyone else doing, any AoK that you’d like to share?",6

Thoughts on my relapse.","I had a meeting with my therapist this last Thursday in addition to an outpatient group meeting. I was so ashamed to have to tell everyone that I lapsed when I could have called someone or gone to a meeting. 

But my therapist helped me feel better about resetting my counter, that it doesn't negate the 44/45 days that I already had under my belt. She put it like this: ""You've been in recovery for 45 days, sober for 1"".

Yes, the counter is reset, but I still did 45 days of active recovery, and I went straight back to not drinking right away instead of continuing to drink.

If anything I learned something new about myself, that it is not good to hold onto cash. My husband and I share bank accounts and he has never held it over my head or ""policed"" our bank account, but it doesn't stop him from checking the account online if he needs to for some other purchase. So for that reason, any alcohol I've bought before recovery was usually with cash.

Last Tuesday I got handed some unexpected cash (someone owed me something but I forgot about it) and paired with a night alone and without a plan, I chose to buy and drink a bottle.

It's been a few days, and I've managed to stop beating myself up about it. Of course, my husband, support group, and the outpatient group were very encouraging and didn't shame me, and instead helped me to form better plans for sobriety when faced with this temptation again.

So far, the voluntary outpatient group has been the best thing for my sobriety after so many false starts this was still my longest streak. For anyone here, thank you for reading and IWNDWYT!",6

Alcohol, and my aggressive, selfish behavior while under its influence has destroyed each of my romantic relationships, and is on the verge of destroying the best one I've had.

I spent this weekend blacked out and lashing out at everyone and everything in my way. I was behaving psychotically, completely out of control in every way. Screaming at and menacing almost everyone I came on contact with, particularly my girlfriend that sober me absolutely adores. 

I can't do this anymore. I won't ruin my life. The temptation to drink is overwhelming, especially since my friends and I often have a fun time while doing so. I know they would support my decision to stop, so now is the time.

I am 23, and was a fairly heavy drinker since I was 18 (so, throughout university). I loved drinking for the usual reasons, and definitely had this idea that people who drank were fun and those who didn't were boring. Over the course of this five years, I experienced the usual problems and frictions that come from being on your own for the first time, living with roommates and the stress of university and needless to say my increasing alcohol use did not help at all. I am the kind of drinker who drinks to get drunk and, once drunk, is annoying, loud, sloppy and argumentative. Sometimes I would be mean for no reason at all.

 I would always do things when drunk and think ""that's not me..."". At times, near the end of it, I felt like I was truly not in control. I was always struggling. I was functioning at school and work, but I would have a constant back in forth in my head all the time about should i - shouldn't i have a drink? I would make a FIRM DECISION not to drink and then talk myself into just one glass with dinner, which usually turned into three or four glasses, ignoring my homework and watching netflix until I fell asleep. My ""cool, party lifestyle"" really just made me boring and hard to be around.   


Last year, it came to a breaking point - my behaviors had cost me at least one valuable friendship and were causing problems in my relationship. I felt lost. I felt like I wasn't in control. I had tried to impose rules on myself or quit so many times and had never made it longer than a few weeks. My boyfriend offered to do three months without alcohol with me. We saw each other every weekend, which was so helpful because we spend every weekend together, so I wouldn't feel left out. 

After three months, i thought about drinking again, but thanks to this sub I ultimately decided to make it a year. About five months in I decided I should just never drink again. So here we are, one year later, and I am a proud non-drinker. 

This was the first decision I made that was truly reflective of self-love. The beautiful thing is that this simple decision has expanded to many other good decisions. I have a good sleep schedule, I put more work into my friendships, I feel way more stable and confident, and most importantly, I feel like I AM in control now! When I want to do something, I no longer feel like it is likely to not go my way - Since I am in control, I know that if I work hard I can make it happen. Just knowing that I made and stuck to one of the hardest decisions of my life so far has given me an inner confidence that I did not have before, which has allowed me to be kinder to myself and to others in turn. 

I still have a long way to go, but I now know I can get there eventually.

I managed to bring it down to just on the weekends and then just every other weekend, but every time I drank I could never just stop at a glass or two. It would always turn in to a bottle or two a night of vodka. 

I justified it to myself by saying I had it under control and that I was only doing it twice a month. I swore up and down even to myself I didn’t “need” to drink. That was also ignoring the fact that every other weekend started to spill out in to the week and that I was buying more and more each Friday to allow for that.

Last week for the first time I felt anxious at the prospect of not spending the weekend drunk. I felt that I “had” to be drunk to feel better and so this weekend I gave in and once again two bottles down Saturday night. 

I had a fine time Saturday but now sobered up I realize that is not what “under control” looks like. Under control is not having a borderline panic attack over the prospect of having to go to an event with friends not utterly plastered. 

So I finally admitted today to my wife and my father that I am an alcoholic. And I made a promise to stop. Not to cut back, not to handle it better, to stop entirely. 

I’m not the type of person who handles social gatherings too well, so I don’t know if I’ll be going to any AA meetings, but I guess I still want to try to get this off my chest somehow.

My life is very comfortable, my loved ones are near and far but for the most part, happy, I'm not rich by American standards but on a general human scale I'm incredibly blessed. My music is flowing, work is messy but totally doable, everything looks so shiny and clean, but... 

Internally, I'm a bit of a wreck.

Unmanaged grief, anxious attachments, familiar patterns of approach, engagement and rejection are playing out over and over. I force myself to relive my worst moments, again and again in the reactions and overreactions I have to things that happen now. Inventing problems, worshipping fear, pretending I don't actually have control of my health, thoughts and choices due to things and people that are way off in the distance. The past is always breathing down my neck. The past does not exist. 

Sure, there are still problems and challenges, the main one being the level of alcohol intake in my household, but it isn't like I can sit here and tell you about any current poor-me big scary life situations, at least, not right now. I have been through so many, but I survived them all. And yet I discount this survival, treating myself like such a weaker person than I am. 

I didn't think I was drinking to blur my sensitivities but then, for what other purpose? It completely obliterates my sleep cycle, ruins my gut, damages my head and my self-worth, puts me and others in danger, causes horrible lung problems due to nighttime acid reflux, and is 180 degrees opposite my constant efforts to lose weight, save money, and create art and music every chance I get. 

I deserve better. 

So, this is me writing to whoever is reading but mostly to myself, on a beautiful, clear headed Monday morning. 

I'm setting some goals today. Ignoring the chattering, grumpy self-doubt for a change and just going for it. Considering we have 8 weeks until 2020, I'm going to :

Avoid alcohol completely, going past the one month mark, my previous record

Track my calories every meal of every day, motivating me to make better choices

Take time for myself every day, for a walk, a workout or meditation

Throw energy into recording in my home studio every chance, without so much thought and hesitation

Celebrate and be grateful for my ability to choose any of these things 

The hardest one... Appreciate myself for the strong, good person that I am every day. I have overcome a ton - whole albums worth of songs, some of them really good ones - and I'm damn sure not gonna self-destruct and sabotage what I worked so hard to build up and protect all those years. 

This is the part where I make some solid plans, then light them on fire and push them out into the river.

Control what you can, and the rest will follow. Here on day 5, I feel more in control of all these things again, and it is so, so very good. 

It is time to let go and let myself live in peace. Wish myself luck. IWNDWYT.",17

Finally got the wake up call and admitted to myself I truly am an alcoholic. I always put blinders on, used everyday excuse I could think of to explain why I drank. For the last 10 years I have ruined every relationship I’ve ever had because of my drinking. And because of my drinking, I just lost the relationship that meant the most to me in the entire world over the weekend. I lost my high paying IT job back on May of this year because I showed up two hours late and still drunk/hungover. Alcohol has been nothing but a detriment to me, and I’ve put it in front of everyone. My daughter, my family, my friends, my responsibilities.  

In June of this year I got blackout drunk, drove to the bar with a few friends, and woke up in handcuffs. My second DUI. My license is suspended for 3 years, I’m facing a minimum of 10 days in jail, and of course all the fees associated with it and I haven’t been able to find a job since I was fired. I used this time as a “woe is me” time and instead of taking it seriously, I spent all summer feeling bad for myself and drinking to the point of being sick for days.  

Fast forward to this weekend. I had been sober for about 2.5 weeks, not too much temptation to drink, and my girlfriend had been wonderfully supportive. Friday night we had plans to hangout. She had a bunch of personal things happen and I didn’t hear from her all night. I started to get upset and earlier that day I had a moment of weakness. I walked to my local 7-11, bought two 32 ounce beers and brought them home. I almost felt like I was on auto pilot watching my body do this and I didn’t know why after 2.5 weeks of almost no temptation. So what do I decide to do? I slam both beers, walk to my neighbors who always parties and take 4 shots back to back. Needless to say, I was drunk and became an incredible asshole. She called me at 11:30p saying she was sorry and explained what happened. Instead of being understanding, I said some of the meanest things I’ve ever said to her. It absolutely broke her heart. I called her first thing Saturday morning to apologize because the person who I am when I drink is not a good person. However, and rightfully so, she didn’t deserve this and said she needed a break for some time and that I need to figure my problems out and take my sobriety seriously. And she is right. I was weak and heartbroken, so what do I do? Go drink almost a 1/5th if liquor with my neighbor.  

I spent all day yesterday sick as can be and heart hurting more than it has ever. I’ve had wake up call after wake up call, but this is finally the straw that broke the camels back. In the past I’ve tried to tell myself I’ll go sober permanently and it’s always scared me and seemed so daunting. Now I realize this is something that everyday, I will need to wake up and take it one day at a time. Sorry for the wall of text, but I had to share my feelings with a group that can understand and is here for support. So thank you all for reading. Today is day 1. And each day will be a new day from here on out. IWNDWYT. And I’ll be hoping and praying that as I change who I am, that I can regain the love I lost this weekend. She’s an amazing woman, and I want to be the best man I can for her, my daughter, and everyone around me.",18

I've been a long time lurker here and appreciate your posts. I'm 19 months sober and absolutely couldn't have done it without my 12 step and online communities. So thank you!

My dilemma: my boyfriend -- now my husband -- has been my drinking buddy since the beginning of our relationship. We were daily drinkers, with him drinking a six-pack+ a day and me killing a half-bottle to a bottle of wine. We both knew we drank too much and experimented with abstinence for a month at a time, or for the holidays, but it never stuck.

Toward the end of my drinking, I felt like I was spiraling out of control, might destroy my relationships, and feared that in a state of drunkenness, I might do something drastic. (I have bipolar disorder, was self-medicating, and unbearably depressed.) After hitting bottom, I got sober -- six months before our wedding. My husband said he was impressed by my commitment and cut back, but still drinks heavily; he drinks less than he did but still gets drunk at most social events, even after promising to take it easy.

We've since moved overseas for his job, to a country largely known for its amazing wine, and our marriage feels like it's imploding. My husband still drinks nearly every day after work, we have no car, and I feel isolated - not being able to speak the language, without my support network, trapped in a tiny flat - able to smell the booze on him. My husband says he's proud of me and admits in certain moments that he probably has a problem, but misses drinking together and has no real desire to get sober. He's also dealing with debilitating depression, and I'm incredibly worried about him.

Finally, in a moment of desperation last night, I agreed to give moderate drinking one more try, with the agreement being that if we couldn't handle it, we'd get sober together. But I woke up this morning and thought: I've come so far. Do I want to return to that madness? I've been down this road before, and it didn't end well. Do I want to start all over again? I am far from perfect. And I love my husband. But I'm at the end of my rope. Have any of you had similar experiences? Wtf do I do?",84

Easier to ignore the lure. You know, as most of us do.
I thought after a year I had this beat. Bam. Never thought of it hardly anymore. 
That old ""A.V (addict voice) "" was just biding its motherfuckin time.
I've some mental issues that make things hard, and then this week I got a bombshell dropped - my 10 year old is depressed and suicidal too. (Yay genetics ) . Needless to say I spiralled a bit and when he went off to his Dads- I almost went for the bottle. I spent two days in bed crying, sleeping and craving. It HURT FROM MY SOUL. I just needed that ONE DRINK. Just to calm everything down.  Just one. SURELY I could have just one?
I haven't had a craving attack like this since the first week I quit. I stand here though , streak intact, monday morning. 
I dont know that I can resist that again. 
Dont get complacent guys - AV is just hiding up in there shadows - waiting to spit poison in your ear.

Stress and anxiety come from almost every angle and without the go to anesthetic I have no choice but to take it all on.

I’m not going to make it seem like I have some profound wisdom to conquer alcoholism after only two weeks.  What I can say is that I’m still committed to this and I still know that being sober is better than the slow death spiral I was in while I was drinking. As many people have reminded me on here in their post and in replies to mine, it is a one-day-at-a-time thing.

Friday is going to be my last day at my job, I’ve been there for over three years. It’s extremely stressful, but I’m comfortable there and have dozens of amazing regulars that have no idea I’m leaving. I’m nervous to tell them because then I have to explain what I’m doing next. 

Five years ago I graduated and I’m working on (finally) getting my license from the state so I can start an actual career. I wasted my time after I graduated drinking and moving across the country, so now I’m playing catch up with remembering important information I learned in school instead of just taking my state exams off the bat when I knew it all. 

Money is going to be tight, studying is hard, I’m stressed to the max. It’s a big change and it feels overwhelming. 

Can anyone tell me how to deal with these things like a normal person? These last four hundred and seventeen days I have changed a ton, but not any huge life things because I didn’t want to stress myself into relapse.

I feel like I need to kick ass this week, but I’m anxious, scared, and kinda worried I’ll drink if it gets much worse.

First-time poster but been lurking here a while on my main account (Using a new one for Privacy reasons). I hit the lowest point I have ever been at this following weekend both mentally and physically and it has finally caused me to say no more. 

I live in the UK and our drinking culture is really not the best in the world. It's almost ingrained into society as a whole especially in the northern parts. I started drinking at the age of 13/14 every now and again but by the time I got to the age of 18 I was binging it every weekend to excess. I am what people would call a binge drinker as I have never got the urge to drink at home but as soon as Friday night would hit I would get plastered beyond all recognition through till Sunday. I've smacked the back of my head that many times off a pavement it almost became a weekly event and I'm surprised I'm still alive. I am 23 so have been doing that without fail for five years.

On top of this, I started using cocaine habitually with my drinking so I could drink throughout the weekend and keep myself relatively sober and just keep going. This lead to a breakdown of my mental health in 2017 with me trying to take my own life. I blamed this on the cocaine use and got myself some CBT to try and curb that all together. Suffice to say didn't work for me. I could put all the methods I learned into practice while sober but as soon as a few pints went down my neck I was straight on the blower.

Thus comes to this last month. Every weekend I have been caning it more than usual and starting to get nasty with the people around me who even mention it. Going through a gram of coke whenever I've been drinking as well. This cultivated to this last weekend where I went out after work on Friday and did not go to sleep or stop drinking until 7 the next night. Would have probably have stayed going longer into Sunday If I didn't have a breakdown in the middle of the boozer where it all just suddenly came crashing down on me that the root of all my problems after all this time was the drink. The Depression, anxiety the drug use the full lot all has its roots with my drinking habits.

I shook throughout the whole night while it all left my system. Woke up on Sunday morning and for the first time in a long time didn't go straight back out to the local. I reassessed all the issues I've ever had in my life and now realise for the past 5 years of them they have all been because of booze. Feel like a mug for not seeing that sooner but I guess now's as good a time as any.

So here starts my journey. I have never really drunk mid-week so the real test is going to be Friday and the weekend. I'm a season ticket holder for Leeds United and will be going to the match this Saturday so that is going to be one of the hardest challenges being around the lads and getting asked constantly why I'm not drinking but I'm going to try and make it an in and out sort of deal where I turn up for the match and then quickly get myself back home after the game.

Wish me luck everybody for the first time in five years I will have a completely sober week",11

I've learned to reassure bartenders that yes, I want the non-alcoholic  mocktail.

My friends no longer press drinks onto me, even if I offer to stand a round for them. I go home remembering the nights, no longer waking up from blackouts.

But sometimes it is very difficult to be ""fixed"". Over the past 4 years, I've learned very quickly people don't know how to handle when you fall apart. So you have to stand up by yourself and make the change.

I've made the change but still I don't feel I can tell many people who really understand. It's still a fight to stand up straight and walk forwards instead of collapsing in. If you've never had your entire world fall apart, watched everyone walk away or fade out because they don't know how to deal with your pain -- it's hard to explain. Even this post is deliberately vague because it feels too much to even say this.

Today I just quickly logged on Instagram to look up a recipe and scrolled through some pics. Moms dressing up their kids cute and doing lots of fun things Halloween. Friends hanging out and having good times. People at parties and gatherings. All of theses pictures bring up some many insecurities in me and that’s part of the reason I drink.

I look at these pictures and feel like everyone else is a better mom then me, better friend, hangs out with people all the time and just in general has a much better life. I feel inadequate. I have always felt this way. Before kids I drank lots of the time to make these feelings go away. Now I’m sober and it’s bringing up lots of feelings.

I was recovering from some cracked ribs last week and ended up binge drinking (again) and while I’m fine now I made a lot of regrettable decisions that evening that caused me to evaluate why I drink. I drink because I get manic or stressed, and it only seems to help when I have a buzz on... but when I can’t stop drinking I become a different, awful person. It was part of the catalyst for my divorce along with depression, general incompatibility and compulsive spending issues. I’m now facing the prospect of needing to find income and not burn through money... and I want to stop hating myself everyday. So Friday I made a pledge to myself and for the first time told others around me that I am done drinking to hold myself accountable for my actions. 

Now, even just 3 days later, I feel like I have a better head on my shoulders and a plan to pull out of the slump. Stop drinking, get to the gym tomorrow, then when I have about a week of that down quit smoking.. and in the meantime sell stuff I own to keep my head above water while I’m looking for a job. Because I was starting to drink more frequently it was almost impossible to make it to that third day where my head is clear enough to plan anything and follow through with it. I downloaded the I am sober app and am using it to pledge to myself that I will not drink today, and track my moods.

Like obviously the “moderating” isn’t going how i’d intended it to. yet here I am, again, trying to figure out how to fit alcohol into my life. 
After making it a year at the end of june I decided to drink at my husband’s 40th birthday. At first, I drank in moderation, only on social occasions and never at home alone. I had some truly enjoyable experiences and felt I could safely return to social drinking. I didn’t obsess about alcohol like before. I felt I finally had the best of both worlds. Then I started having a drink if we went out to dinner, and we started going out a lot more. Then, a couple of months ago I decided a few glasses of wine with dinner on a Tuesday would be just fine. You know the story... I’m not quite back to where I was before but clearly headed that way.
For the past couple weeks, i’ve been drinking at home nearly every night. Each day I say it’ll be the last day for awhile but the next day i’m like just one more day. Nothing crazy... Most nights it’s  2-3 drinks and no hangover, no anxiety or guilt the next day... and some nights are a little more and the next day is hell: overrun with guilt, anxiety and feeling out of control. Today was one of the latter variety. 

I didn’t drink today, so that’s good. However my husband and I are going on a long weekend away this week. i would really like to enjoy a few (i’m always super careful in social situations) while we’re away. And while I want to stay sober until then, the wine witch will pop up as early as tomorrow saying “you’re not quitting completely so why not have a couple tonight?” And it might be a couple, or it might be more. 
Im just not ready to accept that other people can partake in the enjoyment but NOT ME. No... something is WRONG with me.",1

I’ve dried out a few times. A few days here, a week there, a month or two. Was never ready to face the Big Sober. The permanent sober. The one where I have to tell my old friends I can’t drink anymore. The one where the rest of my life is clear and I feel it all.

Heres my post:

Today marks 5 years sober. That’s 1825 days sans alcohol for me. It is without a doubt the best decision I’ve made. Gone are the days of crushing anxiety, lies, concerning behavioral patterns, low productivity, bad decisions etc... Aside from the health (both mental and physical) benefits I’ve received, I want to break down a staggering fact- A normal week of drinking for me would cost an average of 75$, and that’s being modest. 

Perspective

75 x 52 x 5 = $19,500

Now that doesn’t mean direct savings - Spending patterns have shifted but it is wild to think that my addiction became a significant monthly expense.

I attempted quitting multiple times. 

I convinced myself I could drink responsibly and lost that privilege.

I was afraid I wouldn’t be “me”

But who was “me”?

I always felt like I had a heavy cloak on when drinking, covering and masking any issues that plagued me at the time. The me you guys interact with now is the real me :)... unless I’m at work and then I’m mad professional. 

This post is merely to share with my friends, family and a few of you random followers. I’m not one to normally post on this personal matter and please don’t take this as a PSA (YOU DO YOU), but today I’m gonna celebrate this milestone and today I will not drink.",22

For the past couple of weeks I'd been letting myself have sugar because it seemed to quell the alcohol cravings. Unfortunately both have just gotten worse I think as a result of my new habit.

Historically, I've never been one for sugar outside the odd ice cream cone. I have a family history of diabetes and am sensitive to sugar myself. My diet is mostly vegetables, rice, beans, meat with a small amount of dairy. I don't even eat a lot of fruit with the exception perhaps of bananas. 

However, when I detoxed my sugar cravings just went through the roof. It was pretty unbelievable. The other day, I devoured a pack of those stupid Haribo gummy bears, fell asleep, woke up with a racing heart and a massive headache. So yeah. No more buying candy. 

Here's what I've found that's working for me so far:

* I've introduced way more fat into my diet. By that I mean avocado, fish, dark chicken, I even got myself some Earth Balance. I'm finding salted avocado to be particularly helpful. 
* Salty things are also working. I'm eating salted popcorn (made from scratch in the pan) and seaweed.  
* More protein is helping, too. Hummus and celery is my lunchtime craze. 
* Cold fizzy waters. Spindrift is made with a bit of fruit juice but I've found a few others that have no sugar completely 
* Tea. Good Earth's sweet and spicy line in particular. The sweetness come from the herbs, from what I can tell. 

Anyway, I just wanted to throw that out there because I see a lot of sugar craving discussions and I feel like a lot of advice centers on fruit. Well, I don't really like fruit all that much so here's what I'm doing and it seems to help. :)

Also if anyone has any other suggestions, I will try them. :D

And it hit me AS it was happening that this very moment was a transition and then I felt like I couldn’t sit in that chair for another fucking second because this beautiful thing I had been a part of (this show) was now over and all of the sudden I wanted a drink so fucking bad; everyone else was having one, and I was almost crying but I didn’t want to have a drink with all these people who loved my work and the only reason I was sitting AMONGST them, and had been hired by them to be an actor in their play was *because I quit drinking* almost two years ago now; I know this without a doubt in my soul, and the juxtaposition of these things, the intersection of it all, this transition, made me wanna crawl right out of my skin. When I feel like that I know a bit of a breakdown is coming.   


The epiphany: I need to learn how to fully inhabit the transitions. Those in between one thing and another spaces that happen in life. Really live in them without needing to numb myself out of them with vodka because I'm scared deep down that there won't be a ""next thing"" but fuck if I’m not fucking sobbing right now, now that I’m home. I want a martini so bad and it makes me sad af that if I was being honest, maybe that fact, the fact that I couldn’t have one, was making me sadder than the fact that this show is now over and I am once again, adrift in this in-between life. That was a lot, but it just came so hard and fast to me that I felt like maybe I should share it here. Thanks for listening.",5

I lost my dad November 5, 2018 to cancer and struggled with ways to cope. So I partied a lot more and got out of the house to avoid the void felt at home. This summer while I did have a lot of fun memories with friends, I partied every weekend and did not know my limits- and in many cases don’t remember a lot of my nights. I went to raves, warehouse parties, day parties and everything else associated with the house music scene. I woke up many Sunday’s disgusted with myself, sick as a dog, and kept telling myself no more. The temptations of others and social settings overcame what I was feeling deep down. I hated who I became when I drank. Depending on what I drank I found my moods changed drastically. I turned 30 in September and my last straw was Friday night. I went to a sporting event and had two large drinks. My friend drove us home. I ended up blacking out and came home angry, was nasty to family members and woke up in the middle of the night wired and unable to fall back asleep. I had to wake up at 5 the next day to catch a flight to see my favorite team play in another city and I felt the worst physically I’ve ever felt. This was a trip I planned months ago as part of a bucket list item. I had a massive headache the majority of the day Saturday and found it difficult to enjoy the game.  I’ve made the decision to give this up for good. The reason I am posting here is because I have mentioned wanting to do this for the past month or so but I have felt like I haven’t had the support with my friends or they just do not understand mentally where I am at.

Every weekend all I can think about is how badly I want a drink. It's especially bad today. I've turned my life around in those 10 months. I have a job that I love, and I've just decided to go back to school. My house is amazing, and I'm able to foster animals which was a huge goal of mine. 

But I just feel so fucking overwhelmed. My house is ALWAYS a mess. With 3 dogs (one of them a puppy) there is no stopping that. I'm working less hours than I was a month ago, but somehow I feel like I have less time to care of what I need to at home. My boyfriend still drinks on a daily basis, and because our schedules are so mismatched I almost never get to see him anyways. I used to have this beautiful garden, but it got overgrown and I stopped taking care of it. Now my backyard is a mess. I also have a 1/2 finished chicken coop that I can't ever find the time to work on. 

I get angry and yell at my dog/foster dogs all the time. I keep losing my shit because I just look around and see unfinished projects with no time to finish them (that includes training my fosters). I thought I was past this. I thought I was better. But these past few weeks I've just felt this giant beer bottle sized hole in my life and I cant move past it. Everything feels wrong.

It was one of the parties where the event IS drinking.. music is too loud to talk but too weird to dance, everyone is huddled around the counter where the booze is, the main entertainment is fancy shots. But we didn't drink, got hyped up on coca cola, and had a pretty good time. We got home super late (3am for a gal with a self imposed 10pm bedtime) and decided to take a page out of our old drunk book and got McDonald's, stayed up even later and just hung out. Going to bed, I had the familiar anxiety expecting a shitty Sunday to follow a big night out like that.

But guess what! I woke up tired, but felt fine. I felt no boozey shame or guilt that would interfere with having the chillest sleepy Sunday. I wasn't hungover yesterday either, so all the chores were done. I played Zelda, watched dumb tv, even did yoga, laundry, and cooked my lunch for the week. 

This right here is the difference.. having fun doesn't have to subtract from the next day. Without the booze, I can make a conscious choice to call it early and rest up for a productive day, or stay up late and decide to take it easy on myself the next day. Why not! I feel free as hell. It's like a super power. Hope you guys are having a great day too, and if not, know that great days are in your future. IWNDWYT :)",50

Help.","I ruined my almost two months of sobriety- over something that tasted disgusting and that I immediately threw up to get everything out of my stomach .

This community has helped me so much, esp reading posts like this so I wouldn't have to go through it. And what I did was make myself just give up, and try to drink again to see how it would be. I didn't even experienced it, it was an immediate decision without riding the wave like I usually would. I would usually text my husbandto tell him I was having a craving. I've honestly only had a couple real cravings in the past 50 days. But I ruined it, and honestly my husband is incredibly disappointed in me and I don't know if I should fall into a depression, which is not self-inflicted, it's just where I go sometimes. But I really thought that maybe he would be more encouraging that I am going to be just fine and make it past my previous mark. 

After telling him immediately, texting him because he was on his way home, I told him how I felt like I was disgusting and that it was an impulse decision that I could have just waited out but I didn't. He said, ,""You are not disgusting. I'm just heartbroken that you've decided that that's more important than everything else. After all that you put your family through. After all that you've put yourself through. And it wasn't bad enough for you to stick it out. I am just so afraid now"". 

More of what he's been saying, ""You made a mistake but the problem is that that mistake can ruin our entire lives. I don't understand why you would choose that and I have the right to be upset at you about it. Yet again if it was just us and me a different story but there is a four-year-old child involved and it makes it everything much more intense and scary. I think maybe a good start would be for you to understand that you are the one who screwed up...but your family is still here to support you and you shouldn't turn them away or snap at your husband or blame me for anything.""

I didn't blame him for anything. Last night after it happened I didn't know what to do or what to think because I was in shock. But my husband stayed in his room and didn't see me or speak to me all night. We've barely spoken today. That's why I felt like I have not been treated correctly. Maybe he's treating me fine? Maybe it's just that I know if it were him, who has 670 days, I know exactly how I would react. I'd be frightened that it wasn't just a one time thing, but I would cradle him with love and support, and have faith in him.

I’ve  been drinking pretty consistently for about a year now. A six pack of an IPA a day for the first 7 months and then it was a six pack plus a bottle of champagne and then it was a six pack and two bottles of champagne. 

For my birthday I decided to just do two bottle of champagne because I really wanted to stop but needed that last buzz and figured two bottles is nothing compared to a six pack and two bottles.

I finished them pretty fast, probably within an hr all while in front of my husband and kids but they had no idea which is pretty normal. I’ve become a pro at drinking in front of them without them knowing. While my husband put our 5 year old down, I took our 3 year old and wrapped him up in my arms and fell asleep in our bed and we proceeded to pass out.

30 minutes later I woke up to feeling like I was on a merry go round. I got up and stumbled to the bathroom and started vomiting all over the floor, walls, and outside the toilet. My son was still in bed fast asleep. My husband heard me and came running in to see me trying to clean it up by basically just pushing it around the bathroom. He thought I had got sick from the awful dish I made for dinner but said that when I looked at him, I wasn’t there and that’s when he realized I was wasted. He cleaned me up, the bathroom up and then took my son and went and slept with him in the guest bedroom. 

The next morning he fell into my arms crying saying he hates what I have become. What if our son had woke up and seen mommy in vomit in the bathroom? Hearing my husband cry and seeing his blood shot eyes and tired face broke me.

They say you have to hit rock bottom before you want to change and that night was my rock bottom. I’m lucky that it wasn’t a rock bottom that hurt my children or others (physically). I’m lucky it didn’t destroy my marriage and make me lose my kids. Im lucky I realized how close I was to having my rock bottom be way more horrific than what I was dealing with.

That was 14 days ago and now I’m 13 days sober. Today is a hard day and I was really wanting “just one” because the kids were driving me crazy and my husband, and family, and bills, and...life...but I kept busy and ignored it.

2019-11-03 18:02:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dr8buk/day_3_still_here_and_thankful/,Day 3. Still here and thankful,"My dad went into cardiac arrest yesterday.  Died and with two minutes of chest compressions was revived.  He’s in ICU with blood clot in lung. This morning we had option to take him of ventilator(and die) or give him life saving meds that had high risk of bleeding to death.  So far the medication seems to have positive effect.  

My point:  I stayed sober.  I was with him last night. Got a few hours of sleep. Was back at hospital all day and was able to help make a clear headed decision with my family about his life.  I was there for my son ... my dad is his best friend. My son is 9. (we all had to say our “goodbyes” before the started the medication just in case).  Alcohol would have only caused more anxiety and emotions than I already had.   

I’m actually too mentally exhausted to drink anyways. And if I had to leave in the middle of the night to rush to hospital tonight... I won’t be drunk.  

I could have drank for so many reasons this weekend. But I didn’t. And I’m so thankful for that.

It is too bad to rob myself of enjoying them, because work is hard and I get to do that the rest of the week. 

The plan is to keep trying to be present, distract and go to bed early. 

I’m always remember of Douglas Adam’s book hitchhikers guide to the galaxy:￼


In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn't cope with, and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 2:55, when you know that you've had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o'clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul.

I developed alcohol abuse problems in the last few to help cope with my depression, anxiety, self-esteem issues, and shame over both past events   and absolutely nothing. I've always been drawn to intoxicants, I never understood why.   


I and my doctors thinks a lot of of these issues are related to how my brain functions because I have ADHD. Many people with ADHD tend to be very introspective and sensitive, which feeds anxiety. We also tend to be impulsive, which leads to behaviors that embarrass us (no matter how mild), which leads to anxiety. ADHD and depression exacerbate each other. People with ADHD have issues regulating dopamine  levels, which we then often  end up using toxic drugs like alcohol to  treat, even if we don't realize this is why. Many of us have been faced with no other option but to self-medicate.   
 

I am trying to learn  how to abstain completely, and understanding the physiological causes of  the feelings I have that create urges, and how those causes relate to triggers that activate urges, has been immensely helpful. I'm currently medicated for ADHD which is personally helpful, but I worry that if (when) I no longer have access to adequate healthcare I'll just slip back into the cycles of destructive consumption that have led to my alcohol abuse issues. I decided to abstain for the foreseeable future on November 1, so that I'd have a clear beginning date that I intentionally chose. This appeals to the part of me that needs control and order to feel like I am doing well, yet another aspect of my personality that is due to how difficult order can be with ADHD scatters my attention so thin work is impossible at times. 

If anyone  wants to talk about having ADHD and addiction and/or what has worked for you I would love to have these conversations.  I'm not really sure where to go to find an active ""community"" that wants to talk about this, so thought I'd give reddit a shot. Thank you!",3

In general I don't think I can call myself an alcoholic, I don't find myself feeling dependent or craving alcohol and I really only drink socially. But I've found I can't really limit myself when I do drink, so long as there is alcohol in front of me, I am drinking. Any sort of external physical limitation is usually enough to get me to stop, be it money or just running out of available alcohol, but if I have a way to drink, I will. This is one of the reasons I don't buy alcohol for myself, I have this sort of sense where I don't know if I'll be able to be responsible with any alcohol I have access to. I suppose that should have been a warning sign that something was off with how I used alcohol, but I figured that since I was able to abide by those physical limitations, I was fine.

When I look back over the past year, I can notice this pattern of irresponsibility forming. I was always the first one in my friend group to be drunk on a night out. I wouldn't pace myself to the group, I would simply inhale whatever was in front of me. I would jump at any opportunity to get alcohol, it was never a question of whether I would be there when we went out drinking. So far it's just stayed at ""having a good time with friends"" but my behavior during those ""good times"" has deteriorated and my drinking during those nights out got less and less responsible. This culminated in a couple of nights ago where I got so drunk I threw up and ruined my friend's bathroom. Then, after being sent home in an uber, I wasn't able to get back in my own apartment and sat in my own vomit outside in the middle of the night until my friends came and got me inside. I'm pretty sure I've lost those friends for good and I can't blame them (it wasn't even the first time I needed help getting home, just the most recent and most severe). I let myself get to a point where I simply couldn't function because I didn't want to acknowledge that the way I was using alcohol was irresponsible and toxic. I just wish I could have recognized my issue and dealt with it before the people I care about got hurt.

I don't think alcohol is my main problem, there are other deeper issues at play that I should address. But I can see the ways I approach drinking as a manifestation of those problems in an extremely unhealthy way. I can even remember thinking a couple of times in the past few months how I ""really want to be drunk right now"" so I could avoid those issues and the stress of every day life. I think a part of me hopes that if I can take responsibility for myself in this one capacity, I can start working on those underlying issues as well.

The somewhat ironic part to all of this is that I don't even like alcohol. I hate it in fact. I hate the taste, I hate the smell, I hate how fucking expensive it can be, I hate how it makes me feel when I wake up, how I am overcome with shame and regret in the mornings and can barely function for a day.

In general I don't think I can call myself an alcoholic, I don't find myself feeling dependent or craving alcohol and I really only drink socially. But I've found I can't really limit myself when I do drink, so long as there is alcohol in front of me, I am drinking. Any sort of external physical limitation is usually enough to get me to stop, be it money or just running out of available alcohol, but if I have a way to drink, I will. This is one of the reasons I don't buy alcohol for myself, I have this sort of sense where I don't know if I'll be able to be responsible with any alcohol I have access to. I suppose that should have been a warning sign that something was off with how I used alcohol, but I figured that since I was able to abide by those physical limitations, I was fine. 

When I look back over the past year, I can notice this pattern of irresponsibility forming. I was always the first one in my friend group to be drunk on a night out. I wouldn't pace myself to the group, I would simply inhale whatever was in front of me. I would jump at any opportunity to get alcohol, it was never a question of whether I would be there when we went out drinking. So far it's just stayed at ""having a good time with friends"" but my behavior during those ""good times"" has deteriorated and my drinking during those nights out got less and less responsible. This culminated in a couple of nights ago where I got so drunk I threw up and ruined my friend's bathroom. Then, after being sent home in an uber, I wasn't able to get back in my own apartment and sat in my own vomit outside in the middle of the night until my friends came and got me inside. I'm pretty sure I've lost those friends for good and I can't blame them. I let myself get to a point where I simply couldn't function because I didn't want to acknowledge that the way I was using alcohol was irresponsible and toxic. I just wish I could have recognized my issue and dealt with it before the people I care about got hurt.

I don't think alcohol is my main problem, there are other deeper issues at play that I should address. But I can see the ways I approach drinking as a manifestation of those problems in an extremely unhealthy way. I can even remember thinking a couple of times in the past few months how I ""really want to be drunk right now"" so I could avoid those issues and the stress of every day life. I think a part of me hopes that if I can take responsibility for myself in this one capacity, I can start working on those underlying issues as well.

The somewhat ironic part to all of this is that I don't even like alcohol. I hate it in fact. I hate the taste, I hate the smell, I hate how fucking expensive it can be, I hate how it makes me feel when I wake up, how I am overcome with shame and regret in the mornings and can barely function for a day. Hell, I even hate being drunk. How I can never remember things well, how irresponsible and immature I act, how out of control I feel. I've always hated alcohol, but I convinced myself to drink because I thought that was just a part of being sociable in your mid twenties.

I have a family member that passed away two weeks ago, who was a longtime alcoholic.

We suspected that he had a number of other un-diagnosed mental problems, but there was little doubt that drinking exacerbated his condition. He was a loner. He drifted around from place to place until he got tired of the sights and the people. And he drank. 

I always had a misplaced, romantic image of his lifestyle as this free-wheeling, unattached loner. Before I sobered up, there was something weirdly appealing about how he could go belly up to a bar as soon as it opened, drink in a park, sleep in a tent somewhere - whatever he felt like. I fantasized about that kind of oblivion that you could disappear into for days at a time. I still do. I used to think I could turn out like him if my drinking really got away from me - we weren't all that different.

But it isn't romantic.

He was found in a park, lying against a tree, nothing and nobody with him. For my part, I guess, he gave me a glimpse of where that road goes and helped me realize I had time to divert. Thanks, Uncle. Rest in peace.",11

This second year was actually very easy to get through. For me it was just the first 1-3 months and then after that your triggers are few and far between. 

Anyway, here's the video: [https://youtu.be/7V4DUd3aYOE](https://youtu.be/7V4DUd3aYOE)

If this is against some rules, let me know. I will also post here some of the tips from the video: 

**Mindset:**

Most important aspect to achieving anything, and especially achieving sobriety, is having the right mindset for it. Our societies are crafted for it to be completely socially acceptable to drink alcohol. Lunch time martinis and after work pints are completely acceptable behaviours. 

You can’t just kind of want this. You have to *really* want it. If you just kind of want it, you’ll quit when you get in front of temptation. 

So if you have any doubt or hesitation about what you’re doing, people will sense this weakness and attack and peer pressure you. They will convince you of how good it is. Tell you you’re not an alcoholic and it won’t kill you to have one. You need to be resolute in your sobriety. There is no drinking. You are going to the club. You’re going to talk to people. You’re dealing with problems and stress in your life? You’re going to be sad. You’re going to be scared. But no matter what… you’re not going to drink that pain away. 

**Tips:**

**Set a date:** Have a date. A counter for how long it’s been. You need to have a date for the day you got sober. The more days you have between day 1, the easier it is to say no. Plus you need a supportive community who you respect and will keep you accountable. This community, stop drinking, is the best one that I've found. 

Peer pressure is strong enough to make you want to drink. So you better believe peer pressure is strong enough to keep you from drinking. So set up a counter for you to look at and be proud of. 

**30 day challenge**  

Don’t say you’re quitting forever, set a date for yourself. My first attempts were simply 30 day challenges. When I finally gave up for this year, I set a 90 day challenge. Then after 90 days I didnt feel like drinking, so I went for 6 months. Then 1 year. You have to small chunk it as going for 1 year right off the bat seems like an insurmountable obstacle. Rig the game so you win. One day sober. 7 days sober. 30 days sober. 2 months. 3 months. This will help with cravings as well. If you have a horrible craving. Just say okay, I can drink in 15 days when my 30 days is up. Then you’ll be able to look forward to that and by the time the day comes around, that craving is long gone.  

**Don’t wait to start:** There will never be a time when you just have a spare 30 days where nothing’s going on. There’s always going to be birthdays and weddings and random holidays happening. Just accept you aren’t drinking through those. 

**Carbonated water :** A lot of the times, my cravings involve I want a nice, cold, refreshing pint. Delicious. However, I have a lot of carbonated water on hand at all times. Sometimes just that bubbly is enough to get you through the cravings. Sometimes it’s not enough though and I’ll have a lemonade or an iced tea. I give myself leeway on my diet when I have a craving for some rye and coke or something. I let myself have a coke, or a sugary drink and that usually gets me through the cravings. 

**Do other things with friends** 

A lot of the reasons people drink is because their friends drink. One of my best friends drinks a lot, so we go to the gym together instead. You can go bowling, you can do anything where they can drink and you can sip on your water. 

This is how I've been sober now for **2 YEARS!** I changed my mindset towards it and followed these steps. But there's one thing to keep in mind: 

Don’t beat yourself up if you fail. I used to go a month without drinking, drink for a week, stop for a month, etc. and for a long time. Sometimes, I also just cracked. To reach this 2 years sober probably took 5 years of effort. I’d go for a bit, then crack. I found things really started clicking when I started setting 30 and 60 day challenges. But if you fail, it’s not done forever. Reacclimate and kill it on the next go around. There is no forever failure. I posted a little while ago the amount of times I needed to reset my badge. 

If you fail, pick yourself up and try again. You can overcome this.",50
2019-11-03 12:15:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dr3f44/the_flight_simulator_a_metaphor/,The flight simulator: A metaphor,"I've never been much of a gamer, I haven't really played any games since I was a kid, but recently while bored and trying to distract from urges to drink, I found an online flight simulator game. I quickly found the game to be very similar to the balancing act required to maintain sobriety. Unlike games that I played as a kid, the controls were extremely sensitive and unforgiving of wild or impulsive moves; I have to plan things out and use a steady hand to adjust course, or else I end up in a tail spin. I've found a lot of sobriety is the same way: I have to create distance between my impulse to act and the action itself, leaving room for careful attention to the question of 'why do I want to drink? Have I considered the consequences? Will it actually help anything?' And this has helped me a lot. I think its really important, especially early in sobriety, to engage in some sort of activity that forces you to pay careful attention to something in a way that is still fun and non-stressful. Hope you're having a good weekend. Hang in there. IWNDWYT",1

I'm sure all of you have said that at one point, but I mean at least in the medical sense, I don't think I'm an alcoholic.  But it has become an every day habit to have at the very least ONE drink and sometimes it's two or four and sometimes the ONE drink is in a very very big glass, you know how it goes.  I manage a bar, so it's normal for everyone to have a shifty (we get one free shift beer) after they're off for the day.  I have my special spot on the patio and my coworkers make jokes about how they're going to put a plaque in that spot with my name on it.  I have my shifty and I sit in my corner of the patio with my headphones in, listening to podcasts and playing blackjack on my phone.  I mean, if I'm being completely honest, I think podcasts are my kryptonite more so than alcohol.  Alcohol is something to do.  Listening to a podcast while staring into space is so boring, but you add in the booze and the gambling and it makes all three much more fun, you get me?  And when the bar starts to fill up, I take off and I make another drink at home and do the same thing on my own patio.  Usually just one more drink, but sometimes two, and then I go inside and make dinner and watch TV until I go to bed.  This has been my habit for the past almost three years.  I don't know how it started.    

I think I'm finally ready to do something about it.  I've been thinking about it for months.  I'm not sure what the last straw was because I don't do dumb things when I'm drinking, other than lose a few million dollars of fake money gambling.  I don't actually enjoy the feeling of being drunk.  I love the looseness after a couple of drinks, but I don't like the fog after four. I've never had a DUI, I've never hit rock bottom, I don't embarrass myself because even when I do get drunk, there's no one else around me.  But it's still like this heavy chain around my neck, like I think about what I have to drink at home and how much there is and if I need to stop at the liquor store or the gas station and get more before I get home. I have a friend who lives a few hours away from me, she and her boyfriend don't drink - her because she quit a long time ago, him because he got a DUI last month, so when I visit, I take a cooler and I fill it with tequila and ice and coconut water and every so often I take my water bottle out there and fill it up and boom!  I can drink while we go hiking and no one knows!  But, I mean, of course they know.

In the last few years, I've gained probably 30-40 lbs of soft flabby mush around my midsection.  I never go out any more.  I spend Sundays laying around in bed or on the couch recovering because my week was just so hard and I worked so much and I'm just so tired, but really, I'm just depressed. I took booze in a water bottle to my kids school play because it was two hours long and seemed more fun that way. Everything is just so boring when you're not drinking.  Like, what do people even do to fill the hours?  I'm going to find out.  There has got to be more. 

I've been trying since last Sunday, exactly one week.  No drinks Sun-Wed, felt good, got a lot done.  Thursday I was at the bar because I was the judge of our Halloween costume contest.  I had one hard seltzer.  I didn't even really want it, I don't know why I drank it.  I carried it around with me most of the night and I didn't order another when it was gone.  I tried to not make myself feel too guilty about it because I am proud of my progress and I'm feeling positive.  

Friday my coworkers had a party.  I felt like I had to at least make an appearance.  I picked up two of my friends from a different bar on my way and they were blasted already, absolutely reeking.  When we got there, everyone was smashed.  It was only 10 pm, but there were people puking in the driveway and falling down the stairs.  Is it always this way, is everyone always this drunk, or am I seeing things through my new sober glasses?  I got my friends beers and introduced them around and sipped on the Kombucha I'd brought with me.  A few guys tried to get me to do shots with them, but I shook my head no.  I hung out by the fire and talked to people and smoked cigarettes.  One guy kept pestering me about why I wasn't drinking, but I just shrugged and tried to change the subject. It wasn't terrible.  It was kind of fun watching everyone else act foolish. 

I didn't drink, not even one!  I went home before midnight and woke up for work the next morning before my alarm went off.  At 11 when the first of the party hosts rolled in, their skin was gray and they told me they hadn't slept.  At 12 when the next came in he said he'd been puking all morning and was still feeling queasy. At 2, another one showed up, telling me about the fight he'd gotten into with another coworker and how sick he feels about it, like he ruined a friendship.  Guys, I never felt so elated over leaving a party early, over not drinking, over going to bed early, over other people's misery!  Haha, not that I'm happy they felt awful, but god DAMN, I was riding high on my horse. 

That's the end of my long ass story, but here's a bonus tidbit for those of you still reading - After I left the party, when those fights were going on, I guess one of their friends pulled out his GUN and then gun WENT OFF (on accident supposedly) in their back yard.  Everyone was understandably freaking out and he was trying to calm them down, like relaxxxx, I'm taking the bullets out, here ya go... and he was so drunk that he DROPPED SOME OF THEM INTO THE FIRE PIT! And then those were going off and everyone was screaming and running around and someone grabbed the guy in a headlock and wrestled him down and oh my god I'm so happy I left early! Cheers to day 3!",17
2019-11-03 12:05:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dr3a2d/bye_bye_betty_3_days_sober/,Bye Bye Betty - 3 days sober,"**lengthy post**

I've toyed with the idea of adopting a non-alcohol-dependent lifestyle for years, but recently reached a revelation. Does anyone have a ""funny drunk"" alter-ego? Jennifer Lawrence refers to hers as ""Gail."" I have a friend who goes by ""Veronica,"" who is especially entertaining when random men she doesn't remember start texting her by that name, particularly if her kids field them. Mine is ""Betty"", and she's bad news. Betty has never gotten caught, but it's time I intervened to keep it that way. As of last weekend, Betty is no longer a cute and funny way to excuse my drunken antics, but a very serious problem. It's time to shut Betty down and face this awful thing. 

After a horribly drunken night last weekend, I was facing all of my shortcomings head on, feeling so overwhelmed with the gravity of the financial burden I've hand-crafted for my own personal self-sabotage, I could barely function. This was certainly not the first time Betty has gotten the best of me, but it was the worst (tied with the time I woke up with Saturday Night Palsy that lasted 8 weeks.) I'd gone out with a friend I rarely get together with. I started easy, ate enough food for a good base, but then shots seemed like a good idea and I spiraled from there. In the morning I woke up safely in my bed, but with vomit in my hair, dirty clothes from stumbling around town in the rain, large deep bruises and a sore shoulder (feels like it was pressed out of the socket) from what I gather to have been a very nasty fall (still not healed after a week), broken sunglasses, a crushed phone screen, no vehicle, and texts from some guy by the name of Fabio. These crazy details have always made for hilarious stories. My friends have a blast when Betty comes out to play. But when I stand outside of myself and hear my stories for what they are, I feel a lot of regret and shame. 

I spent the $85 hour-long Uber back to my car reviewing how I'd racked up close to $100 in bar tabs, which gave me a little time to reflect on how I'd ended up there. Not there in the back of an early-2000s gold Toyota Camry driven by a silent man with no facial expression wearing earbuds, with a fly buzzing around my head while I struggled to make my broken phone work, but how I'd ended up the kind of person who can barely keep it together. I have a bachelor's degree. I hold a healthcare license and have a full-time position at a highly reputable practice in my community. But I am always apologizing for my alcoholic-induced shortcomings to friends, family and work, and never able to figure out why I can't do thinks like most people...pay my bills, keep a boyfriend, maintain meaningful friendships, etc. Monday at work, I could smell the putrid toxins seeping through my pores, worried about my patients noticing. No amount of soap and water was helping. My kidneys throbbed. I was ravenous and dehydrated, with cold sweats. It was the longest 12 hours of my life. Mind you, I'd already had Sunday to recover, but it was far from enough. I could feel my body undergoing the withdrawal and detox process for about 4 days.

So I chose not to buy any alcohol last week, and I was successful. Mostly because I literally could not afford it. My account was overdrawn and my credit cards are maxed out, but still 🤷‍♀️. Halloween came around, and I had 3 drinks (they were free 🤦‍♀️.) I was in a family setting with some people I didn't know well, so I took it easy. Had I any money, I would have left early or maybe never even have gone, made a stop and binged when I got home. When I woke up the next morning with actual energy, I was so grateful and it finally hit me...I can not continue the way I have been. 

Next, I came across a Facebook post asking you to respond if you planned to participate in No(booze)vember... so I did. My plan was to take November off from drinking. I thought,  ""I can use a reset, but don't have to quit completely, right?"" I've finally, fiiinally, FINALLY realized that I'm wrong. I must quit, and must quit now. But I am entirely incapable of doing it alone. 

Saturday, I visited my best friend for her daughter's 5th birthday. She's struggled with alcoholism for as long as I have. She let me know she would need to step out for an AA meeting, so I joined her. Her Mom, who I've known most of my life, was celebrating her 11 year anniversary on the very day I began my sobriety. Because I was in attendance, the meeting became a ""first meeting"" where all members shared their experience that led them to recovery. I had never felt connected to a group of strangers before, but this morning I'm suddenly feeling like I've started a journey ""home."" It feels so good to feel optimism again; to feel hope as a stronger emotion than dread. 

I come to you all with the hope that I will adopt a sense of belonging in a community I have no idea how to be a part of, but desperately need to be. Thank you if you made it to the end :)",16
2019-11-03 12:02:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dr38bo/long_post_sorry/,Long post sorry,"I got really drunk at a work party on Friday. I went to a colleague's house beforehand and I brought a bottle of wine to share but when I got there, she didn't want any. I had a bit of a false sense of security because I had been drinking the weekend before and nothing bad had happened and I hadn't gotten too drunk. Queue me finishing the bottle before we left. I remember arriving and a friend bought me a small beer and then I had a glass of prosecco. After that I don't remember exactly what drinks I had but I guess wine...oh and bought a £35 bottle of prosecco at the end of the night and only drank one glass of it. I remember talking to various colleagues but not what I said and not in what order. I remember one colleague holding on to me and sort of comforting me, though I don't remember if I was particularly upset or what. I'm told another friend was feeding me water at the end of the night and made me go and be sick. Came home with another colleague, who was apparently as drunk as I was, perhaps that is some comfort. 

I have had the usual post drinking anxiety all weekend and I am dreading work tomorrow. What sort of makes me feel worse is that actually I've done a lot worse at work events before. It makes me feel like a piece of s**t that I get comfort that I wasn't as much of a s***show as I have been before, but crappy all the same. 

I've had maybe three attempts at giving up drinking in the past couple of years. Since my last relapse I have found it difficult to stop again, and more often than not I have ended up drinking alone, and often on work nights, which I didn't do before. 

I started seeing a therapist earlier this year and have talked to him about drinking but always in the context that i don't have a 'problem'. I lied in my last session and said I'd stayed sober even though I was hungover. 

The barriers to stopping have been that it feels like far too monumental to admit I have a problem. The thought of my friends knowing ...I just can't bear it. And without telling other people, I don't think I will ever succeed. 

And even if I get over this, even if work tomorrow is not as bad as I think, even if we can laugh it off, these things make me feel so...disgusted and ashamed. Like a part of me is lost each time it happens. 

It feels unbearable and messy and I am struggling with how to cope.

It started with one bottle, then quickly started having 3 per date, sometimes 4: We'd get drunk and fuck every Friday, sometimes mix with benzos but it was ok because it was only during those dates.

Last year I found a higher-paying job in a big city, working a company where I'd have more than 2 hours of lunch time and everyone was earning well so it wasn't unusual to go to restaurants and drink half a liter of beer or wine before going to work. This quickly became the norm, I've been going to restaurants almost every day and order at least a beer. The days I don't eat at a restaurant, I may go to the supermarket and buy 2 or 3 beers for dinner.

On Saturdays I drink a bottle of wine to be able to rest (I'm too stressed from the week), and on Sundays I drink because another bottle of wine it's poker night.

I noticed that I've been drinking at least an alcoholic drink everyday, even if not much, and feel something inside telling me to buy alcohol in certain situations (going to the supermarket, restaurants, etc). I just went to the supermarket and had to exert some self-control in order not to buy anything alcoholic... and I'm starting to get concerned that I may be becoming an alcoholic. My grandparent was one, and I've been addicted to benzodiazepines in the past too, but at the same time I don't seem to have the signs of an alcoholic. I don't get wasted when I shouldn't, etc.

I love waking up sober it has been 2 months since I had my last drink. I have been attending AA regularly which has been helping me quite a bit and also reading all the posts here. It is so wonderful to know that I am never alone. 

One thing that has been happening to me is that I have been dreaming lots I never used to dream and I know that is because of my drinking but now the dreams are about drinking I woke up this morning thinking that I was drunk and it took me a few moments to realize that it was all a dream. Has anyone else gone through things like this? It's not fun dreaming about getting smashed but I'd rather dream about it then actually go out and do it.

I thought about this in the moment: If I were drunk right now, I would be causing a huge scene for no reason.

Party like a ten-year-old :),"In November of 2015 I stopped drinking alcohol. I had quit for months at a time before, but I decided to make it permanent. 🎉 My reasons were practical. I found I drank more over time, that I was emotionally dependent, that it stopped me from doing things. It was making me fat and mentally cloudy. While I continue to be a fan of selected microbrew non-alcohol beer, I cannot fathom why anyone would add alcohol to it. 

If you are ""dry-curious"" I suggest not waiting for the new year to begin. Kick off 2020 with success behind you. I found occasional AA sessions to he helpful, if only to admit I had a problem. A key insight for me was remembering that as a young boy I could have piles of fun without alcohol. I adopted the expression, PLaTYO, Party Like a Ten Year Old.

But here is the best reason. I genuinely believe that alcohol suppresses the brain's natural ability to produce joy and creativity. There was a dark streak when I first quit, but then my brain insisted on experiencing joy. It fired 🔥 up my dormant creative circuits and I began drawing and painting. Alcohol is like fireworks in the brain, blasting the circuits. Sobriety is a steady beautiful joy. I would not trade back.

Peace and love.",326

- breaking up with someone often takes several tries. Break up, get back together, remember the horror of being together, leave, repeat until you're permanently DONE!

-leaving a horrible job takes time. Talk to the boss, adjust your thinking about the job, keep going, feel like trash everyday while working, decide you can do better, fix the resume, get the hell out of there for good!

-setting boundaries with family members can be hard. Beg to be seen/heard/respected, cave in due to guilt, allow the same old patterns to rise again. Lay out your terms again, demand what you deserve, decide to walk away permanently if family refuses to consider your feelings.

Rarely can we undo something that we've practiced for years by snapping a finger. It takes time. Unlearning a negative habit is just as difficult as incorporating a positive one. 

If it's day one again, no big deal! Give yourself a hug and do your best to incorporate a new healthy habit in order to replace the negative routine of problem drinking.

3 weeks ago I posted on here when I was possibly at my lowest ebb. I had fucked myself up so bad getting blackout drug and high that anything could have happened to me but I'm happy to say I am now 3 weeks sober from alcohol and cocaine!

I had the pink cloud for 2 weeks where everything was wonderful, I had it all together and was probably the most productive I've ever been in a long time. Then the third week hit! I slammed right back down and had two days of feeling miserable and my body ached - I don't think my body and brain know what to do when I'm not getting fucked up but I'm confident that will pass soon :)

In regards to temptation - so far I've survived work dinners, halloween parties, (my job requires me to organise alot of nights out and events for employees and in turn attend them where there's always an open bar or it's expensed), I've also been in bars nursing a non alco beer and had a perfectly good time with no complaints. That's not to say it hasn't been hard. I've had days where I've wanted a drink or a nice glass of wine but I am well aware of where that is gonna lead... so I just had ice cream or some candy instead lol.

I've filled my days with organising my house, watching shows on netflix (shoutout to this sub actually for recommending Bojack Horseman S6 which is a terrifyingly accurate portrait of addiction), playing video games and playing drums. I check this sub everyday and you're all a seriously supportive group of people and that keeps me going.

EDIT: I also forgot to include that last night I was woken up at 2.30am by a pair of girls drunkenly arguing across the street from my house and they could barely stand and it reminded me of how much of a volatile asshole drunk I used to be and I went right back to bed after they left and slept soundly.

First stretch was four days, then five. Did amazing things I’ve never done before — like drink only Coke at a work event where I’d normally have had a bunch of drinks, or gone out “for drinks” with girlfriends but only ordered a club soda....
All that felt fantastic. And yet, this weekend there was a bottle of liquor in the house and I allowed myself to think heck what’s the harm in having “just one.”  
Well, of course one turned into 2 (2 may not sound like a lot but you don’t know how strong I make my drinks!) and I’m right back to feeling like shit again. Shitty sleep, guilt, headache. All for nothing. 
It’s just more evidence of how powerful this addiction is and that for me, the only acceptable path forward is no drinks at all. I know it’s a process and I’m trying not to beat myself up too bad over this setback. Just trying to learn from it so I can get better.

It was the first time I had seen them in over six months and I was a little nervous.  This would be the first time seeing them since I decided to get sober. 

He and I used the drink heavily as teens and into our twenties.  Hard boozing multiple days a week.  Where he slowed down with drinking around 27 I put the pedal to the floor and increased. In fact it was after I completely embarrassed myself at his party six months ago when I truly realized I had a serious problem. 

They were late coming over and I got weirdly self conscious.  For some reason I thought he was going to not show because I told him on the phone earlier in the week that I was “on the wagon” and he should bring what he wants to drink. Like the only reason we were friends was to drink heavy together. 

They eventually came and it was a great time.  In fact he only had one beer and said that he too was shutting it down with alcohol. He’s eliminating things in his life that hold back his productivity.  It was really good to hear and made me more comfortable.  It wasn’t awkward and I wasn’t sour to be not drinking. 

In the old drinking days I would have probably spent over $50 on alcohol, had at least a few beers before he came over, been obsessing while he was here about having the next drink and probably been shit faced before they left.  

I wouldn’t have had the good conversation, wouldn’t have remembered what was said and what they’re up to in life these days, I would have embarrassed myself, would have made others feel uncomfortable, would have woken up hungover and ashamed. 

I won’t lie and say having a single drink didn’t cross my mind.  I had 2 seltzer and a coffee instead. And before they came I said to my wife “ just so you know I’m not drinking tonight” to hold myself accountable to someone else.  

Even having 78 days clean it was still a bit of a challenge. I had to fight negative thoughts and deal with a few small urges. At no point did I feel out of control or obsessed with the thought of drinking because I started the day with a plan.  It seems to work better that way. 

This morning I’m awake and refreshed. I’m looking forward to the possibilities of the day and not dreading fighting off the hangover and the negative emotions that go along with that.  Last night was another positive reinforcer that there’s no place for alcohol in my life and that I can still be social and enjoy my time without it.",95

He also has type 2 diabetes. We're both overweight and need to get healthy.

We were both already heavy drinkers before we met. I (36) was coming out of a physically and mentally abusive relationship and he was an amazing friend to me. Eventually we started dating and it turned into a very loving relationship. He inspired and motivated me to get a better job and fight for myself in life. I fell in love with him because he was motivated, strong willed, very sweet and kind, was very gentle and never hurt me. Eventually we moved to a better place with better jobs. Now we've lost a little weight and cut back a bit on the drinking. We were drinking hard liquor every other night to the point where I was getting sick and blacked out every couple of weeks... Now I have wine or beer on the weekends and he has 3 to 8 beers a night. It's less but it's not great. We decided to get married, buy a house, and have a baby with the idea of getting healthier alongside it. I finally felt like I was on the path to a healthy life. Now we have a beautiful three month old boy that has changed me completely and continues to inspire me to be the best version of myself. Shortly after getting pregnant though, I came to realize that SO wasn't as motivated. 

Of his own volition, SO promised me he would quit drinking with me while I was pregnant but he never did. He would just not drink around me and try to clean up so he didn't make me want to drink. That was the first time that I felt like he was a different person than the man I married. It was not like him to not follow through and it couldn't have been a scarier time to realize this. He went maybe a week without a drink and he was a total mess during. Very depressed and it was clear that it was hard for him. We fought many times about his failure to quit and he didn't seem remorseful, concerned, or even aware of how big of a problem it was and is. He was just defensive and angry that I was upset. I had to focus on my pregnancy so I just let the drinking go but I knew things were probably going to get worse. Part of me had hoped that once the baby arrived he would have no choice but to stop drinking.. but I couldn't have been more wrong.

When we first had the baby, SO would get pissed off when the baby would wake him up. Even though we had discussed at great length what it would take to raise a child before we decided to have one, he was still somehow surprised that he was going to be losing sleep. When it was his turn to get our son, he would occasionally call the baby ""a fucker"" and act grumpy and turn all the bedroom lights on so I would have to wake up, too. He always handled the baby gently but he would complain and groan about it almost every time. I hated his night time bitching so much that I just kicked him out of the bedroom and into the guest room. Now I take care of the baby every night, and have for the past three months. It is my belief that SO wouldn't be so bitchy when woken up if he didn't have to have a few beers every night before bed. 

I wish I had the magic words to get him to quit with me. I don't want my son to grow up in a house where drinking is so important. I don't want to raise him to be an overweight, alcoholic and I MUST lead by example. SO refuses to see how dire the situation is.

Now that I'm no longer pregnant, I'm feeling pressure from my SO to drink again. Part of me likes that I have the option now but I feel shitty and guilty every time I do, even if it's just a couple glasses of wine. I want to stop. I'm crying while I write this because I just feel so hopeless... but drinking is honestly some of the only times me and my SO get along. He actually gets happy when I drink with him and encourages me to drink in little ways. As in, he asks me if he can make me a drink etc. I just bought wine last night because I like how much more he seems to like me and our son when I drink with him. We've been fighting so much about baby responsibilities lately that I just wanted us to be okay with each other for one night. I know it's not right, but I feel so weak right now.

I've tried many times to convince my SO to stop drinking and eating poorly with me but he doesn't seem to really want to. He'll say he does but rarely makes an actions towards improvement. Sometimes he slows down but then it will pick back up again. He's said before that I'm the reason that he drinks because I've been so stressed out about the baby. He says my mood swings are unbearable at times. He's also said that drinking is the only fun thing he gets to do anymore. I've seen him acting really weird when sober, too... like he hates life. A few weeks ago I saw him sitting with our son on his lap and he was just staring off at the wall, completely disassociated from his son that he had barely seen that week. He says it's because he's been trying out different antidepressants and some make him weird. He's also told me hates babies but later recanted it. When I try to talk to him about how scary these things are to me he treats me like I'm instigating fights because I just like conflict.

We are not healthy and need to take better care of ourselves... we're both on antidepressants and have back issues and I just know in my heart that if we stopped drinking and started eating better we'd feel a million times better. We've started eating more grilled chicken at home but he hates most vegetables and fish so I feel like finding healthy food he likes is exhausting. We've gotten so much better together but I just can't get us to completely drop alcohol. I don't want to leave him but I've mentioned divorce because I feel like this relationship is making me stay sick.

His family doesn't help anything, either. They are all heavy drinkers and it's a big part of their family bonding. They are very active in our lives though they live out of state. Part of me wants to tell his mom and I feel like she would stop drinking around him but I fear SO will see that as a huge betrayal of trust. I think this because SO has sleep apnea which he refuses to do a sleep study for and I told him once that I was going to ask his parents for help since he wouldn't do anything about it and he got SO ANGRY. He said it was a betrayal of trust and he couldn't believe that I would do that.

I feel like the underlying problem for all of our issues is alcohol but I don't know how to convince him of it. I feel like this is all on me... He's helped me with so much in my life that I feel like this is my time to save him. I absolutely must find a way because he IS a good man. He's gotten better with our son lately and has been playing with him and seems to genuinely enjoy it now. He's never gotten fall-down drunk, never drives drunk or gets abusive when drunk. He still has a shot to be better imo. But I'm really, really f-in tired most of the time just from caring for our son. I feel defeated and desperate to save the health and happiness of my family.




***UPDATE: Thank you all for excellent support. I cannot express how badly I needed it and I'm very grateful for all of the comments. I wanted to mention two things... 1. I can't believe I forgot to mention it but SO and I DID quit smoking together so I know we are capable of getting better as a team. I know smoking isn't the same as alcohol but it gives me hope. 2. I had a great conversation with SO after reading a lot of these comments. I told him I'm done drinking and he thinks it's smart and supports me. I told him about going to AA meetings and he says he'll watch our son while I attend. (He does NOT drink when watching the baby alone... I know this as a fact). He supports the purchase of a treadmill so we can get healthy and even said he'd try to eat veggies again that he didn't like before in case he might like the way I cook them.  I still understand that he may never stop drinking. I understand that if he ever puts our son in danger, I'm out of there immediately. But he's a smart man and he knows he needs help. If me leading by example doesn't work after a significant amount of time and he stays the same, I will reevaluate and most likely have to leave him behind. But PROGRESS is happening either way, I'm not f-ng stopping this motivation train and I couldn't have done it without the ""tribe"" assist. I'm so thankful.",11

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long  time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious  decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be  hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet  only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the  right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next  24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a  pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you  do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek  advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in  your own thread.

This post goes up at:

US—Night/Early Morning

Europe—Morning

Asia and Australia—Evening/Night

No drinking here today! Have been a little low lately but grateful as ever for every additional day of freedom from alcohol.

I do have a poem for you:

**The Half-Finished Heaven**

*Tomas Tranströmer*

Despondency breaks off its course.Anguish breaks off its course.The vulture breaks off its flight.

The eager light streams out,even the ghosts take a draught.

And our paintings see daylight,our red beasts of the ice-age studios.

Everything begins to look around.We walk in the sun in hundreds.

Each man is a half-open doorleading to a room for everyone.

The endless ground under us.

The water is shining among the trees.

The lake is a window into the earth.

May your day be peaceful and luminous, friends. <3",76

Basically I’ve gone back and forth with accepting  a new job (accepted job, told current company I was leaving then subsequently didn’t take job.... X2).  Was left feeling like I couldn’t trust myself to do something when I said I would and had a lot of built up tension and emotion overall. 

Before sobriety I would have dealt with that by starting out by buying a six pack, drinking 5-6 beers then going out to a bar to meet friends. The thing is while they would go home and go to bed I would go and get more beer and drink by myself in my room. Sad.. then I would sleep all day and be a piece of shit.

Today there was part of me that wanted to go to a bar drink myself into oblivion or go to corner store and do the same in my room. I know exactly would have come with that (regret, shame, promise to stay sober next time, a waste of a weekend, missed opportunities, being hungover well into next week), but I wanted to drink anyways.


One of my favorite hobbies is going bike camping. I’m fortunate to live in an area where I can do that year round at nearby campgrounds. I haven’t gone much this year and today said ok instead of drinking I’m going to burn off steam by biking to a campsite about 30 miles away. I haven’t been biking a lot lately and after about 5 miles I was feeling super tired and actually turned around to go back home. 

I thought shit I’m doing exactly what I was doing with the job. So turned back around and went for it. It was definitely a challenging ride at certain points but overall I burned away the urge to drink and also have some good time to think about what I’m going to do next jobwise.

Instead of being absolutely smashed in my room I’m in a tent, clear headed and happy, reading posts on here and feeling grateful to be sober and part of this community. Thanks for reading. IWNDWYT!!",47

I made my first post here a few hours ago. It's 1am where I am. Usually by now I'd be convincing myself that if I have one more drink, I'll be ready to hit the hay. Of course, on most nights, I'd still be up at 3am, and I'd have had several ""last ones"". I quit smoking about two years ago, and one thing that helped me kick that addiction was reminding myself, whenever I felt a craving, instead of thinking about how bad I wanted a smoke, I'd think about how excited I was to be done smoking. I've been trying to keep the same mindset in tackling this problem, and I'm feeling positive going into Day 3. 

I'm a little concerned about Monday, though, and I could use some advice from someone who's been there. I'm a Bar Manager. I'll be taking inventory of beer/wine/spirits on Monday morning, and functionally, I'm going to have pretty easy access to booze throughout the week. Part of my job is taking meetings with beverage reps, almost all of whom come bearing drinks. I create and maintain drinks for my company's menus. I'm planning on doing as much as I can to limit my exposure to drinking. I can train/empower bartenders to start crafting cocktails (I can even link employee incentives to it.) I can have bev reps bring me actual numbers on their local drink sales at similar bars/restaurants (hell, that will probably be more successful anyway.) I feel pretty confident in managing my cravings when I have access to the back bar (famous last words, I know, but I'll come to you guys and my IRL friends and colleagues when I need support.) 

Thing is, I'm still going to have to taste things from time to time. Even if I'm not primarily crafting our seasonal cocktail menus, I still would like to have final say on what we're serving. I've ordered a couple of beverage spittoons already, I just worry that I'll feel prepared to spit alcohol out if I'm tasting it. I like my job. I don't like how I am when I drink, but I don't want to leave the industry. Is there anyone who has been in a similar situation that can offer advice?

**tl:dr: I'm a bar manager. I like my job. I don't want to drink anymore. Any advice on how to work in the bar industry and maintain sobriety?**",2

Last Saturday night I basically od'ed drinking and made it because I was able to contact a friend in my building before I lost my ability to stand without vomiting. Tonight makes day 6 sober and I think this is one of the best decisions I'll ever make for my life. The scabs on my forehead from my head meeting the trashcan have healed nicely and I haven't had anything to drink other than water and tea since. At first, coming off last weekend I was sickly and hated what I had done (I still do don't get me wrong). Last Sunday as I lay in my room wishing I wasn't alive my best friend on campus texted me asking me for alcohol. At the time I obviously felt like hell because of drinking and I knew that she doesn't drink so I knew something was off but I was unfortunately not in a position to leave my room and check on her. I declined to give her alcohol and threw the rest of what I had out so it couldn't poison anyone else. She wouldn't tell me what was up so I let it go.

(**last chance to turn back, don't read this next bit if you're struggling right now please**, this is something that I need to get out and it really isn't pretty. Keep your head up, guys)

>!Yesterday everything fell into perspective though. Yesterday she described to me how drinking too much alcohol and simultaneously overdosing on acetaminophen can cause your liver to fail and... well I don't want to keep going but I think it's pretty obvious where this story goes. When she told me that I kind of shut down. At that moment I became grateful for my poor decision to drink alone Saturday night because it meant that Sunday when she asked me I was already in a mindset to say no and even if I wasn't I only had a tiny bit left. I hate to think about what may have happened if I hadn't drunk alone Saturday night. !<

I guess I'm grateful that I'm an alcoholic. At the same time, I will never drink again but I can't lie I felt pretty alone last night when I wasn't invited to any Halloween parties. I guess I have to take feeling alone almost constantly for now until I can better control my impulses though and for that reason, I am grateful that I was not invited to any parties this weekend. Anyway, this whole post is kind of a wild ride and I hope it inspires someone tonight to try again. Alcohol doesn't have to rule our lives. I know it only has power over me when I allow it to. I used to think I could just have one drink in the evening to wind down but it never worked out to one drink. I know that now, I have no power after that first drink so you know I'm gonna do my damnedest to not ever have ""just one drink"" ever again. If it has to be no drinks or half a bottle then yeah I think I'm gonna stick to my teas from now on. 

Keep your heads up, guys. Please don't allow alcohol to rule your lives and please please please get help or talk to someone if you need to. You don't have to fight this alone.",3

Pro tip: The Stumptown nitro cold brew poured into a glass looks like a Guinness. I also got some cans of Yerba Mate (hipster iced tea) and a couple of bottles of Tost sparkling just to have for the upcoming holidays etc. Then I went to Trader Joe’s and got some cold brew in small bottles and a bottle of vanilla almond spiced chai from the refrigerated section, and a couple cans of their cold brew lattes from the coffee section. THEN (can you tell I had some time to kill today?) I went to Stop and Shop and got a bunch of different flavors of individual powder packets for water, a bottle of diet cherry 7-up, chocolate milk for husband, and (hangs head, lowers voice) two more cans of cold brew. Bonus: when I got home an amazon package was waiting and inside was a 4-pack of Death Wish cold brew! I swear I drink a lot of water, too!

I have been running, lifting weights, reading books and eating more healthy. I have lost 15 pounds since July and I am 10 pounds away from normal weight now. That feels amazing! Vanity is a good motivator even though I am a dude.

I am no longer in a payday loan cycle. I actually have money now, which is great. Next year I plan on saving money and traveling a bit. In December I will be starting a better job with 20% pay increase. Still blue collar, but those few extra hundreds per month do add up to more financial freedom.

It seems like when you start living a better life, the good things add up surprisingly quick. If I can do it, anyone can!

I’m willing to give up alcohol completely as well if it will help him succeed. Furthermore, can I talk about alcohol around him?

I am not young and can’t use that as an excuse. I’m a married mother of 3 (15 years is the youngest). 
I passed out in a liquor store parking lot. I climbed out my bedroom window when my kids locked me in my room to try to keep me from drinking. I was in the hospital more than 6 times for alcohol poisoning. I attempted to kill myself while drinking and had to be removed from my home in cuffs and placed on a psych hold. I have no recollection of doing so, but I drove drunk many times. I threatened my family with violence and told them I hated them. I drank and didn’t eat for days on end. I lost 4 jobs in less than a year. I tried quitting more than 10 times in that time frame. My withdrawals where so severe I had hallucinations. 
I could keep the nightmare stories up.  What I’m getting at, is that the only time that it’s too late for you to quit is if you’re dead. I don’t think anyone in my life believed I’d make it this far, including myself. 
I hope to maintain my sobriety for always. But I try not to think about too far away. I’m so thankful to fall asleep at night without being altered.",20

After tracking all my goals, and failing when I was drinking, I now have the data gathered to show myself, I can do better, this month. Smoking cigarettes are what I used to get through the sober days, but as those days without alcohol got easier, I feel my cigarette addiction is the next to go.

No Vice November is all about getting rid of the things that are holding us back from being our best and happiest selves. Trade vices for virtues. Exercise, eating healthy, positive entertainment, learning new skills. Going beast mode on taking care of ourselves, growing into the people we want to be, committing to greatness through discipline.

## What are Vice and Virtues?

Although we can, we shouldn’t just understand “**virtue**” as some floating metaphysical form. Instead, virtue should be understood as any positive sentiment that leads to the happiness of ourselves and others (the “good” qualities a person can possess so to speak).

Likewise, “**vice**” is simply the absence of virtue, that which does not lead to happiness (that which we generally consider “bad” qualities).

For Aristotle a virtue was a mean between two vices, for Smith and Hume virtue was just the aspect of our emotion/sentiments/feelings that compelled us to act positively, to Aquinas it was an attribute bestowed upon us by God.

Are virtue and vice physic or metaphysic? Are they natural or divine? That isn’t the question to answer here. Instead we’ll explore what different thinkers have thought (leaving the final call up to you).

There are countless ways to discuss this, but all theories lead back to the same concept. **Virtues are those honorable qualities that we respect in ourselves and others, the ones with positive ends (and Vices are the absence of these qualities)**.

I did, but part of my motivation was the DUI and facing losing my spouse,  my job not being able to drive... and eventually the first house I ever bought... just months before my arrest. 
But it took a while to sink in. I had a court ordered breathalyzer installed in my car and I was becoming pretty adept at the math of how much I could drink with my stomach empty of course to make sure I got a buzz... and then forcing food down so I could pass in the morning and start my car for work. 
My husband was none too happy that the DUI didn't seem to phase me. That alcohol was my priority. But that wasn't what made me stop either. It was during a court ordered alcohol treatment class when i was introduced to This naked mind. That book woke me up. 
Ironically, days later after 9 years together my spouse informed me he and his kids would have to move out because he didn't b want to be second to the bottle. 
Of course,  i convinced him to stay by making that same promise so many of us have. that I was done drinking forever.  I meant it... but the trust was lost and that's a shaky place.
We kinda started to move in a good direction until five days ago my company that I've been with 12  years lost a lawsuit and our accounts were frozen. I felt like my marriage and my job were disappearing anyway and I just needed to be numb. I felt so alone. 
I bought that half pint and drank it in secret. I lapsed... not as much as I thought I would when I entered that store. But I lapsed. 
I refused to make it a relapse. 
He asked me if I'd been drinking and I admitted it. 71 days of success with only several ounces on one occasion... and I told him I needed to focus on all that success... get back at success and move forward. That, he could not do. Only focus on my broken promise. 

Now, my family is leaving,  my company might close and shit... I'm trying to remember any other reasons to stay sober. Like...I don't currently care if it does kill me because I hurt so bad. 

I'm still sober for the moment.  But I'm scared and alone.

I had it down to a science where I could still wake up at 6 a.m. every weekday and go to work.  But then a few things started happening...  1.  started going to neighborhood bars and people were telling me how drunk I was the night before... and I couldn't remember going there.   2.  some days I got bad tremors.  Other days, I was so dehydrated I had problems swallowing.  

My doc put me on Naltrexone, which blocks the pleasure from alcohol.  You drink and its just going through a motion... definitely muffled cravings.   He also had me take Chlordiazeoxid (Librium generic), which helped settle withdrawal symptoms.  I wasn't quite ready to quit, however, so I kept starting/stopping as there was always some event, birthday, wedding, etc. where I drank.  I began not taking the Naltrex and only too the Lib for day after comfort.  After refilling the prescription several times, my Doc had me come back in an re-evaluate.

We decided on a new formula... keep going with the Naltrexone, plus Acamprosate Calcium (which restores the chemical imbalance in brain from drinking, and Gabapentin - an anti-seizure drug which has also been found to lower booze cravings.  We also agreed I'd enroll in my hospital group's outpatient therapy.  Interestingly, they refused to admit me, claiming that based on my history, it would be too dangerous and that I would need to do inpatient detox, etc (20+ days).  I was able to stop in the previous year a few times for a week or more with not medical scares, so I pressed on with DIY.

Since taking the new mix, I've had no cravings.  I did go through the typical withdrawls... flu-like symptoms, sweats, fatigue, but each day I've gotten a bit stronger.  Have been catching up on shows/films and cooking healthy dinners.  Going to bed early and waking up not hungover or dehydrated.  Been going on walks instead of happy hours... will be joining a Yoga place or something similar to replace bad habits.  Last Thur my office had a Halloween party with free booze and I was content swigging water with my peers.  

While it's only been just over a week, I've gone from 50 drinks a week to none.  And I've started down a path that I kept putting off for months/years.  Usually, at this time on a Sat. afternoon, I'd be heading down to a local beach bar for the start of many cocktails.  But there's no craving inside.  Just as happy to go for a walk.  I'm not sure how I'll do once I'm off the medication, but this window into sobriety has shown me that one can do without.  I wanted to share in case my treatment plan might work for others.",158

For many years I've been able to keep a steady job and a stable financial situation, but I would often binge drink on weekends and special occasions. No major incidents - no DUIs, no fights, no risky sex. ""Under control"" would be the term I used to myself. 

Following a difficult breakup last year that I still feel like I'm recovering from, and a new toxic work environment starting 7 months ago, I've been starting to feel like things aren't so much under control anymore. Things were bad this summer, I stopped smoking marijuana and my alcohol intake sky rocketed. Coming into work hungover 2-3 times per week, something I rarely did before. I drank by myself mostly, or at the bar, and rarely in a social context. For the first time in my 35 years on this earth, I've started taking cocaine with my friends or certain social situations (4-5x now). I had a quick affair with my ex and it included some risky sexual behavior. I just returned from a 8-day vacation that was basically an 8 day binge. I think my family and friends are becoming concerned.   


I need to stop, at least for a while, before things get worse.  I stopped once a few years ago for two months. It wasn't that difficult actually, it just felt so boring and I started again after a few weeks. I'm going to try to do all of November and see if I even can, and then re-evaluate. I'm almost done The Naked Mind and it's been a lot to think about.

I asked if they would be up for a date today and they said maybe (part of me thought this was a flirtatious tactic, leave them wanting more as they say). I got pretty excited about the meet up and was really looking forward to spending some time with the person but today they ended up being busy and were wiped out by the time they got back so the meetup didn't happen.

Now I feel like a complete dumb ass, like why did I get excited over such a stupidly small thing? Why do I feel so crushed?   
I feel like absolute garbage and have been moping around most of the afternoon - I literally don't fell like doing anything that I know would help, I know one thing I want to do that I know wouldn't help and that is drink.

Drinking has gone from a major issue in my life to an obsessive thought to something a I crave once in a while to something I rarely even think about. Too much positive going on to focus backwards. 

I’m quite proud as this was very hard. Those first 30 days showed me just how much I’d come to depend on alcohol in my life. 

Life still has its challenges. In the last two months I’ve had a massive water leak in my house, my appendix ruptured and I went septic, just after recovering from that I got full on influenza, and just yesterday found out I also have pneumonia. It’s depressing for a guy who was In the best shape of his life following months of hard work sober. But it’s ok. Because sometimes life sucks and all we can do is embrace the suck. 

Perspective is everything in this my friends. Choose sobriety. It can’t be viewed as a burden you have to carry. That’s hella hard and doomed to fail. You have to choose it as a new path. 

Banish the myth of moderation. It’s a fallacy. A lie. A last stand of our addiction and it’s siren song has led far too many of us to resume drowning ourselves.

I'm struggling to find the motivation to stop drinking, because:

I don't get hangovers

I don't black out or forget things

I don't get argumentative or say anything I regret

I don't feel healthier when I stop. I have health problems that started before I ever touched alcohol and they make me feel unwell every day, I don't sense any improvement when I've stopped for a month. 

 I know alcohol is terrible for my health, but the thing is that I don't feel the consequences of that. I've been sick most of my life and alcohol takes the edge off my symptoms. I can pretend I'm normal and that I'm just dizzy and exhausted because I'm drunk and not because of my health condition that will likely be with me for life. 

Health is my motivation to stop, but I struggle to hold onto the motivation because I expect to feel a bit better or sense some benefits within a few weeks like most other people seem to, but I just feel like absolute crap and don't experience that. It's always disappointing and I feel like an idiot for expecting my stupid body would respond like anyone elses and feel like I must lack intelligence to keep dreaming that my health could improve. Then I restart drinking and smoking. 

How do you motivate yourself when you're in this position? I'm struggling to relate to a lot of posts where people go from having their life in tatters BECAUSE of alcohol and now they're traveling the world and feeling amazing BECAUSE they stopped drinking alcohol. Knowing I had all my issues that lower my quality of life before I ever touched a drop, quitting for me has just resulted in feeling the same level of bad but with minimal escapes to look forward to. Advice appreciated...",2

All in all, it was way easier to not drink than I'd anticipated. I pretty much forgot about it and didn't even want to after the first few minutes, which was a lovely surprise. What I didn't at all anticipate was how hard it would be to just *be* around so many people. It wasn't even that they were drunk. I guess I'm just not as social as I thought. I was exhausted and pretty much just totally over it by the end of the night. 

The uncontested highlight of the evening was definitely when my husband's uncle launched into the elevator pitch for his YouTube channel and then decided to take the opportunity to do an impromptu, a capella performance of his latest song. Holy shit, you guys, so funny. It was all I could do just to avoid eye contact with my dad so I didn't burst out into hysterical laughter. 

So fucking glad I was sober. It would've been a real shame if I'd been too drunk to remember Uncle Ken's absolutely transcendent performance lol.

Can you share someone the  long lasting repercussions (physical and psychological) of alcohol abuse you experienced after quitting and staying sober?

It’s been more than 200 days since I quit. I don’t have any acute cravings, but I still sometimes have a mild headache and anxiety in the evenings (around the time I used to get hammered after work). I also have very minor neuropathy symptoms that seem to remit. I also experience boredom quite often.

I know it takes a lot of time and work to improve, but right now I just need some peer support.

2019-11-02 15:20:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dqoz8i/some_things_ive_noticed/,Some things I’ve noticed.,"Hi! I’ve strung a few days together now, which took me a really long damn time to buckle down and commit to. A few short days ago I hated myself. I felt so worthless and unredeemable. Unhappy. Like my life didn’t matter even though I have a damn good life. I never did anything other then what I was required to do, chores, work, and then for my “me” time I would just drink. I was fat, sorry and hopeless. 

Now I have 30 something days sober. 

So far, this is what I’ve noticed:

- I have the ability to do what I say I will do. I don’t know where this came from. But the more I do it, the easier it is for me to do it. This leads to me feeling happy about my choices. 

- I do art- every day. I practice drawing, painting, I go to my art class once a week. I go to bed when I’m tired, I eat when I’m hungry. I exercise as much as I can. I listen to music a lot too. I’m spending so much time exploring these hobbies that I feel, fulfilled? Happy? I almost don’t recognize these emotions. But I love them. 

- when I was sober before back in May, I had about 6 months and I decided to sign up for a triathlon. Well, training didn’t go that well once I started drinking. But I did just enough to get me to a point of feeling like I was able to do it. When I got out into open water to do the swim, I was (literally) shocked by the cold water. There were 2 buoys I had to swim around and then come back to where I started. I swam and swam until my muscles burned. I couldn’t get any air. And somehow I was not making any headway. None at all. I would swim for a couple minutes, hard with my head down. Then I would look up and the first buoy was in the same spot it was before. So I tried again. Looking up, buoy was in the same spot. I tried to think of something, anything that would make it easier but there was nothing. If I swam any less then I was, I would just be pulled farther away from the buoy. I continued like that for 40 minutes. Every few minutes the next wave of swimmers would set out. And then they would pass me. And I would just sit there, swimming, or totally out of gas with only 2 options. Quit or keep swimming. Finally after 40 minutes, I quit looking for the buoy, and started making headway somehow. I eventually got around that buoy and the next, and completed the first leg of the tri. I came in second to last on the swim, and got through the rest of the event. 

I couldn’t help but notice the similarities between those moments trying to pass the buoy and my sobriety. A few short stretches of sobriety, but ultimately I didn’t make much headway. Those short stints probably prevented further damage to my life, but didn’t really bring me any spiritual headway. It wasn’t until now that I am not looking at “how many days” I have, that I feel I’m making headway.

I can tell because my art is back, my zest for life is back, my hope is back. I haven’t really experienced that before in sobriety. 

I’ve also stopped looking for something to make it easier for myself. All I can do is keep swimming or quit. So I keep swimming. 

Thanks for reading.

Over the years, I’ve gotten better at organizing my life to avoid using prescription stimulants as much as possible. Consistent use of caffeine, better organizational tools, accountability at work, habits for noting responsibilities, use of noise canceling earphones have all helped. But some tasks (namely coding) are still almost entirely out of my reach without a controlled-release Adderall. But I find even these meds used consistently rather than occasionally leave me either completely mentally exhausted or still buzzing at the end of the day.  Both can be triggers for drinking (though I’m fairly stable on that nowadays).

I’m a man in my early forties, that’s been a polydrug and alcohol abuser for 20+ years. A high functional one that is. I have a career, earn good money and actually mostly eat healthy and work out regularly. This also means very few people are actually aware of my double-life, so to speak. My main issue is alcohol, but that also often leads into drugs. Stimulants, uppers, downers, some psychedelics, etc. However, always stayed clear of opiates and things like meth. I mostly like to go to sleep when a binge day/night is over. 

I can also go weeks without touching anything, but then suddenly go on four day benders. 

I guess things have “worked out” rather well, so far, on the surface at least. Lately, however, I’ve been hit with pretty severe anxiety and depression related to my abuse. In combination with some health anxiety. Long story short; I need to quit. And I will. 

What I’m wondering is though, is what health damage has been done (incl. possible irreversible ones), and what types of conditions (ie. heart) and diseases have I most likely increased the chance of getting? I’m asking this because I realize I should probably do a “complete screening” with a doctor asap, and do some regular follow up.  

Here is the main issue though. In my country, if you show up and tell them you have a alcohol and substance problem, they will do things like take your drivers license away, immediately. If you’re unlucky, it’ll take you years to get it back. It doesn’t matter if you’ve never DUI, and I honestly haven’t. Also, the records of your abuse will be in the system forever, and you can actually be less eligible for receiving organ transplants in the future.

So I’ll probably have to go abroad, and preferably to a private clinic, which isn’t that big of an issue, as I’m in Europe. 

Any thoughts, experiences or ideas are appreciated!",1

2019-11-02 13:13:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dqn5ha/something_switched_for_me/,Something switched for me,"I have been thinking about becoming a non drinker for a long time and I’ve even quit for a few weeks here and there. This time feels different though.

I’m a wine drinker, sometimes beer, but I really love my wine. I had my first drink at 12 and my relationship with alcohol slowly evolved from there. I’m my 20’s it was just a given that I would be hungover on the weekends, I didn’t drink everyday but when I did it was to get drunk and the hangovers that followed usually put me in bed until 4pm. As I entered my 30’s I stopped binge drinking and started just drinking wine, every night. I was an adult now after all and drinking wine at night seemed like a very adult thing to do. I didn’t get debilitating hangovers like I used to but I always woke up anxious, with a headache and just feeling off. I started by drinking half a bottle of wine and now I won’t drink less than a bottle. I’m 38 now and I just feel like enough is enough but I so desperately wanted to figure out a way to moderate. I had convinced myself so many times it would be possible and maybe it was for a couple of nights but I always fell back into that pattern until I was drinking a bottle a night again. This has gone on for way too long and even though I desperately wanted to stop I could never find the will or resolve to stop for more than a day or two.

A few weeks ago I decided that I was going to stop again and this time something happened that changed my entire perspective. We had an issue at work and I really had to think through a solution. It is something that we have been thinking about for months and there were many different opinions about it. I had stopped drinking on a Saturday and on Thursday I got up early (feeling refreshed) and I went into the office early (which usually never happens) and I was able to think through the issue. Really think through it. I was so energized by how I was able to reasonably think through the problem! I constructed an email and listed the points and it was such a great solution!! Everyone involved felt like what I was proposing made so much sense and we were all so happy to resolve the issue and come up with a plan. It brought me so much happiness. I almost forgot that feeling could exist. That would have NEVER happened if I had been drinking! I can’t believe how much better my cognitive function is when I don’t drink and it took that specific example for me to really realize it. Just the previous week I couldn’t even think through the problem for a few minutes without feeling overwhelmed or annoyed. That event was so impactful for me.

I have to admit, my brain was still resisting the idea of stopping and a week later I gave myself one final test and had wine with friend on a Saturday. I told myself I would have one glass with her and then dump the bottle after she left. Not only did I drink the whole bottle but she didn’t drink all of hers so I finished that too. The next day was awful. I was a total sloth and my kids paid the price for it. I was disengaged and grumpy. My brain was fuzzy again. I don’t drink again after that and slowly I have started to come out of it again. Making an impact at work, felling happy. Connecting with those I care about.

I just don’t want it again. I want to be that person who can think and solve problems, who has energy to play and explore, live life and be happy!!! It has only been a couple of weeks so I don’t want to get ahead of myself but this time feels so different. Saying no isn’t hard like it has been in the past. It’s just a choice I’m making because it’s what I want. I think of the Thursday I solved the problem vs the Sunday after I drank with my friend. Those two days make up my choice because they are such good examples of what it’s like when I don’t drink vs when I do. I choose the Thursday, hands down.

Since I stopped drinking I’ve noticed myself starting to choke up at every trashy emotional tv show you can think off and I LOVE it. My emotions are regulated cos I’m no longer numb because of alcohol or all over the place because of being hungover!

Such a silly little thing but it means a weird amount to me.

At 24 years old, I very rarely drink heavily anymore as my anxiety is so frightful the next day after a bender, it's just not worth it. 

However, even nowadays, anything after a couple of beers, I'm still prone to do some self destructive and totally stupid things. 

I'm not joking about 50% of the time I moderately drink I do silly things, smashing phone, drunk texts, showing off unnecessarily. Yet, I am capable of having a nice little buzz, and calling it a night after a couple of beers, but this is kind of rare, and I feel like it's a real rare accomplishment if I wake up without the wave of guilt and fear. 

I don't really like the taste of alcohol, and have taken to drinking G&T's because the hangover is completely lessened. 

Am I overthinking all of this stuff? Am I product of my generation (obsessed with self improvement, analysing every little silly thing) 

Should I continue to drink moderately? Or just be black and white, and completely quit.

Watching people walk out of the bottle shop on a Saturday evening, off to parties, dinners, socials in general, and I'm shocked how much I find this to be confronting. I associate so much socialising as an adult to be connected to booze. 

It's sad. I don't know whether these people are sharing a bottle of wine with friends, cooking with it, or getting blackout drunk alone for the evening. 

Yet I still concoct an assumption that their lives are more fulfilled than mine.

Had a health scare a few days ago and have been tapering my heavy drinking. There's no ifs ands or buts about it. This needs to stop.

Don't have a primary care provider, but am seeking one out on Monday. Who knows how soon I'll be able to be seen, though.

Don't really want to go to the ER as we are already drowning in Medical (and other) debts... but I'm not stupid enough to kill myself over money, or lack thereof.

For now I'm hydrating like hell and keeping a close eye on my symptoms and general well being.

I've had minor success stopping for weeks at a time in the past, and my deteriorating health now has me determined to break this and never return.

Can't say I won't miss it. A nice warm buzz is a lovely feeling, but the amount of alcohol it took to get me there was obscene.

I know I have high blood pressure and very likely have some damage to my liver. Time to get healthy and hopefully try and reverse some of these ill effects.

Wish me luck folks. IWNDWYT",2

Six people shared 4 bottles of wine because my 17-year-old cousin and I were not drinking.

And it SUCKED.

I didn't drink, but I reeeally wanted to join the festivities. 

When anyone questioned me, I just said I didn't feel like drinking.

I said I had to drive home and didn't want to risk it.

I said the last time I drank, I got really sick and didn't feel like going through that again. 

I said I wasn't craving alcohol.

BUT THOSE WERE ALL LIES.

I know I should be glad I didn't drink because I don't want to be hungover tomorrow morning. I don't want to have to tell my sponsor that I drank. I don't want to disappoint my boyfriend, who has been nothing but supportive of me the last eight weeks. And I certainly don't want to ruin a 56-day sober streak.

But I'm not happy, not in the SLIGHTEST.

And it breaks my heart to think I'll never be able to drink again because it used to be so much fun. Even though it cost me money, and messed with my sanity, and strained my relationships.

And this is why I'm venting about my crappy feelings HERE because I know I'm not alone in my self-pity. And I know this subreddit is full of good people who will help me out and make me feel better. And validate my feelings. And remind me that I have to take it ONE. DAY. AT. A. TIME.

And for that I am already grateful.

Isn’t it odd that my greatest weakness is such a major contributor to my strength and happiness. That may sound counterintuitive, and maybe it’s what I call a “shadow gratitude,” but without my challenges with alcohol, I would not be in the place I am. 

I was in some dark places because of alcohol, which I used to escape even heavier darkness. Becoming sober and committed to a life of recovery, I have chosen to go into that darkness, and by doing that, I am actually recognizing the strength I’ve had to have to get where I am in my life. And I’m closer to happiness than I’ve ever been.

I tried an outpatient treatment but wasn't able to identify with the others in the treatment group, or the psychologist, mostly because I felt that their problems (predominantly heroin users) were so much more significant than mine. I entered the program voluntarily, while no one else there (even the fellow alcoholic) hadn't. After one incident where another person in the group attacked me for expressing that I was uncomfortable (which, in my opinion, was a big step for me), I left the IOP. It's important to know that I never achieved sobriety for more than a week while I was in the program. At this time, I was also attending AA meetings. I never felt super supported at these meetings - again, I struggled to identify with the people in the meetings. I still have yet to go more than two weeks without drinking.

I joined private therapy last fall. I stopped going this September. I have depression and anxiety, in addition to my issues with alcohol. I would like to pursue a healthier life but I'm honestly stuck in how to do it. The last two months, I've been drinking again daily. Please, any advice would be helpful. It's just really hard to occupy the hours that I am at home without drinking and to get home from grad school at night without stopping at the liquor store and to pass an entire weekend without ordering a delivery from a liquor store.

A lot of get togethers with friends and family have always included alcohol and I was so worried about feeling left out if I wasn’t drinking.  I realized that a lot of what I enjoyed about these get together was the ambiance and not so much the alcohol. I listened to Annie Grace’s This Naked Mind and did a lot of self analysis and realized I didn’t need the alcohol to enjoy those events. After realizing it was the environment I enjoyed and not the being wasted, it was a lot easier. I did start to miss the feeling of having beer or bloody marys at brunch or pina colada’s on vacation so I started to drink non-alcohol versions of all of these things and I felt like I wasn’t missing out at all. 

&#x200B;

I spent all boating season drinking n/a beer in my usual coozie and no one even knew I wasn’t drinking (not that I cared if they knew, I just didn’t want them to change their habits if I was around.) I went on a cruise and had a beverage package, you bet your ass I drank my fair share of virgin frozen drinks, n/a beers, and had fun talking with the bartenders about what kinds of mocktails they could make me. I even ended up at Senor Frog’s at one point and they were totally cool making me one of their big frozen drinks in the “fun cup” without alcohol in it.  My local brunch place has perfected a virgin bloody mary for me and will even serve me an O’Douls in a frosty mug to go along with it.

I know this isn’t new news or anything that most people haven’t done, but I just wanted to share that it really helped me feel like I wasn’t missing out on times with my friends and family or doing other fun things.

I've quit my job, will terminate my visa, and return to my home country.  They're both first world countries so I'll be okay :) 

I've had a drinking problem for the last 10 years.  I'd have stretches of what I'd call the most productive periods of my life- surprise they would occur when I was sober.  I moved to a new country two and a half years ago.  I took a job with a very corporate company that sponsored my visa.  Part of this job would be travel to another city weekly.  For nine months it was fly up on Sunday and fly back Friday night.  I've been back in that boat again for the last two and am done.  

For me I 100% drink to deal with stress and feel in control- when I've got tools to feel like I have agency I know I can maintain sobriety.  Unfortunately in my current job one of the ways to survive is internal networking.  The only way to do that is with lots of travel and lots of drinking after work.  Since I'm customer facing all day the only time to catch up with my colleagues would be after work.  Drinking culture is not so ""cultured"" here and is just to get drunk.  A lot of my career success has stemmed from these outings and I recently got promoted.  To be fair most of the damage I've done drinking alone, but whenever I attempt to quit these are the moments where I slip up. 

Had a doctor visit and she looked at my liver numbers and we had a discussion about whether it was worth it.  I tried quitting drinking while employed at current job and had one six week streak, but then back into my old ways.  During the six weeks I went out three or four times and each time I felt like it was a net loss for my networking- singled out for not drinking and given a bunch of shit.  In general the career potential is fantastic where I'm at- people on sales side are making millions.  The culture is shit- back stabbing, gossip, people singled out, bullying and unprofessional behavior.  

So I faced the flight up and back this week knowing it's almost over.  I'm looking forward to the future again with all its problems.  I'm looking forward to not feeling like I have to spend every waking moment on my career that's keeping me in the country.  I'm looking forward to making plans with friends that won't be drinking- also having friends (and KEEPING plans) because I'm no longer owned by a corporation.

1. My mom died last year - I lasted a couple more months sober to get through the funeral and initial grief stage
2. My SO was very recently arrested for iioc - they say it is a misunderstanding but the following came out:

Internet / porn addiction, IRL affairs, basically my whole life has been a lie with this relationship. They say they did not have an issue with minors and I am half supportive of that but reserve full judgement until the police confirm the truth through investigations 

I am drinking, not too hard, but enough that I feel embarrassed and that I know I am using alcohol right now to numb my pain.

I want my strength back and I don’t know how.

We have kids and it’s messy.... we split a few years back and s/he was so convincing that s/he loved me and could be all I wanted them to be - I need us both to be in real therapy before I call time on this, for the sake of my innocent children

It is tough right now and I just needed to get this out somewhere because I can’t tell anyone in real life

However, I am dealing with my first major craving. It sucks","Edit: 2 weeks, not 3. I was counting until my movie in date next week and not today.

Hello all! Since I've quit drinking I've felt better, had more energy and sleep, lost weight, my skin has cleared and I honestly love it. 

Just this week I had been asked if I lost weight. I said yes, and then she complemented that my skin looks clearer. It made me feel really good. In fact, stepping on the scale every morning feels good because I know that my drinking has stopped so the calories I was counting is accurate.

I don't wake up in the morning feeling like shit. I can enjoy my weekend and not be sick in the morning or half the weekend. 

I haven't had a major craving either. Just small ones here and there where I think ""oh it'd be nice to have a small drink"" and I am able to say ""no fuck you small voice. I am going to enjoy this non-alcoholic sugary drink"" and I'd be okay and glad that I did not have a real drink. 

However, today, right now is a real battle. I just found a new place to live and I am taking care of all the logistics. I also have to go buy furniture as I don't have any right now. And I have to move the stuff I do have into a new house next weekend. At least this will be probably the easiest move I've ever done. 

But all of this STRESSES ME THE FUCK OUT. I think this is why it is my first big craving. I haven't been stressed since I quit. I would love to just be able to give a little bit less of a fuck and have a little more apathy right now. Alcohol will do that. But I know if I do that then I'll just end up drinking again tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after, etc. Until I gain the weight back. I feel sick every morning. I have to abandon my morning run because I got the alcohol poops and I may poop myself before getting back home. 

These are the bad things that happen when I drink: I feel guilty about drinking, I spill my drink, I stay up too late, I am tired and hung over the next morning, I will gain the 8 Lbs back, I will probably be more stressed out regardless of how drunk I am. 

These are the good things that will happen if I do not drink: I won't feel guilty and instead proud I didn't drink, I can get through this move without prolonged procrastination, I can get up early tomorrow and run and then go look at furniture, I can start packing, I can accomplish everything I set my mind to because I am healthy and not hung over. 

If I don't drink today, then I can do more. 
I won't drink today.

If you are still reading this, thank you for letting me me vent and just let all this out. I feel better already.

Next steps for me is to get a delicious mock-tail and start dinner. Then I'll relax with my boyfriend and watch a movie. 

Side note: I was able not to drink last night at a Halloween party even though it was offered to me. They weren't pushy, but I made it through. If I can get through last night, even the small amount of time I stayed I can get through today.",3

I just hate feeling alone with this.","I'm too afraid to tell anyone in my life about this and I'm really grateful this sub exists.  I have a week if I make it through today.  This is the longest I've gone since last spring when I broke about a month of sobriety for my birthday.  I told myself it would be just this one time to celebrate, but I continued drinking almost daily until last week.  What sucks is that my birthday night was a lot of fun, I got drunk with friends and wasn't even that hungover the next day.  It's been the following months after that have completely drained me physically and emotionally.  

Waking up in the middle of the night, heart racing, sweating, and wide awake, feeling like I've forgotten how to sleep.  Tossing and turning because my body feels so uncomfortable no matter what position I'm in.  The dread knowing that I have to wake up in a few hours for work and I've already called in sick too many times to make up another excuse to hide a hangover, having to face the day hungover and not being able to tell anyone how terrible I feel, knowing I did this to myself.  The urgency I have to leave places as soon as possible to be able to drink at home, usually alone.  The hiding, sneaking, and stealing that makes me feel like a terrible and weak person.  The dissonance of waking up and telling myself I don't want to drink anymore to finding myself at a liquor store a few hours later.  The lie of moderation that I tell myself and the trying to piece together how much was too much when I can't even remember how much I drank while cleaning my apartment.  It makes me feel crazy and out of control.  The anxiety of buying alcohol, of which 7/11 to go to so I don't seem like I have a problem to the cashiers who recognize me, of how much to buy because I don't want that uncomfortable feeling if I don't have enough, but if I buy more than enough then I know my only day off of the week will be spent nursing a hangover that will convince me I'm dying.  My one day off a week spent lying in bed with crippling anxiety, eating too much, and feeling sorry for myself.

When I started drinking, I felt like I had found an amazing solution to dealing with my anxiety.  I've been in hospitals and outpatient programs for an eating disorder and anxiety for so much of my life and I'm so mad I didn't see how insidious my alcohol use was.  It snuck up on me and when I realized it, I felt like it was too late.  It was such a part of my life, of my stress relief, of what I originally saw as self-care.  It's self-harm and as much as I see it, I hate it and I'm so mad at myself.  I wish could use another ""fuck it"" day, but I also know that won't take me anywhere I want to go.  My excuse jar is empty but I still wish I could drink from it.

Then as I chose to cut alcohol out I realized that it was maybe not so much the sugar as the drinking/sugar combination (wine and chocolate anyone else's downfall?) So the last two nights I had some candy for Halloween because it sounded good and I was in a ""fuck it!"" kind of mood. This morning I woke up with the same ""oh shit, what weird things did I say last night?"" feeling that I used to get when I got drunk. I haven't had alcohol in a month and a half and all I did last night was chat with my sister in law and write.

The closest guess I have is that sugar gives me just enough of a ""hangover"" feeling (my hangovers were pretty mild and usually cured by a bunch of water and a bit of extra sleep) that it triggers those memories and those auto-responses. Does anyone else have anything like this?

Anyway, back off the sugar wagon again because I don't want to feel like that, even a little bit. Being sober rules.",5

I keep having a strong desire for wine. There’s none in the house. I know it will pass. It’s faded twice and then come back again this evening. I will not get a golden feeling from drink. I do not drink. By choosing not to drink I will do right by me and my family. I will feel fresh and great in the morning. I will feel pride rather than shame. Who I am does matter.

I'm something of a lurker these days, but during the two years of trying and failing to stay sober I was here, often in and out.

About a year ago I finally got and stayed sober and it's been worth it. Not going into that story today, but life is far better. I assure you.

So the party! I reconnected with a friend after a year (alcohol and being a terrible person pretty much ended the friendship) and she invited me to a nerdy Halloween party she was DJing at. I'm a nerd and I wanted to go. It was at a small venue and I knew alcohol was going to be there but I feel very confident in my desire not to drink.

I don't have delusions about what liquor is. I know EXACTLY what inviting it into my life will bring and I have worked too hard to gain trust, self love, and all the other boons sobriety has given me. That pain is some shit I don't want anymore.

So I went and had a good time! Her set was amazing, I chatted up with some people, including the owner of the company who does the events. She was super passionate and only wants to make something as niche as a nerd party as good as possible. I love seeing that! She even asked what could be improved and I could tell her in a totally coherent fashion. 

The only thing I want to do now is get the courage to dance, but I feel like these events are no longer a closed off faction of my life. 

As a bonus, I had the luxury of seeing the old me as a reminder. There was a girl who was laid out over the bathroom sink. She was absolutely trashed and no one was with her. I VIVIDLY remember being the chick hugging the toilet and I don't miss it. 

But yeah! A good time! I did wake up with a terrible headache which had me in minor panic but maybe that was from the noise? Because I damn sure did not drink! It was straight cola all night!

Either way, unexpected milestone achieved!",5

This week was really hard and gave me quite some headaches but when I got home I didn't even want to drink.
I just wanted to take a shower and fall asleep on the couch.

One thing I fear is Christmas Markets. Where I live those are all about mulled wine and ""Feuerzangenbowle"" which is basically pure hard liquor but served hot.

There are certain times of the day when I'm tempted to drink more, but they are very hard to avoid because it is part of my normal life.

1.  Mon - Fri, 5-7 pm: I get triggered to drink after a long day if I come home and feel lonely or like I need a release. 

2. Sat - Sun, 12-6 pm: I get triggered to drink when I'm bored, on the weekends, or when watching sports.


One problem is that I've never developed emotional outlets and don't have many friends. I love going to a coffeeshop but can only drink so much coffee. I've been to meetings years ago, but am afraid of going back to avoid questions of ""where have you been?""

If you told me when I got sober in May of 2014 that 5.5 years later I'd be working as a cheesemonger in a shop with 250 cheeses, about 50 different kinds of charcuterie, and boatloads of wine, I'd have laughed. Or been mortified. If you'd told me that I'd help people do wine and cheese pairings, or help at an event that was a beer and cheese tasting, or work in a place where I'm literally offered drinks every day, I'd have told you that was impossible.

But life has changed. I spent 4.5 years teaching yoga full-time and then last year, my whole life got turned on its head. I woke up one day unable to walk. Then my joints swelled so bad I couldn't bend my elbows, knees, fingers, or back. After 2 months of tests, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I started on immunosuppressants and a biologic, but was crippled for a good four months before things calmed down. Or so I thought. I was tired all of the time and thought it was just the meds (essentially low-dose chemo), but then I started having trouble breathing when I laid down. I blacked out in the house a bunch of times one day and my partner took me to the ER. Turns out the inflammation from the RA damaged the conduction system of my heart and the electrical signal stopped making it from the top chamber to the bottom. So at 33 years old, I suddenly needed a pacemaker. Had I not gone to the hospital that day, I would have died in my sleep.

I was despondent. I felt like my whole life had been taken away from me. I hadn't been able to work for almost a year, I'd lost the ability to strength train or practice yoga with any regularity, and I felt hopeless. And then I finally found a treatment for my RA that worked. With a fully functional heart and a body that could move, I decided there was no more time to waste. I have 11 years worth of battery life before I need a new pacemaker, and I was going to LIVE.

I love talking about food with people and have made cheese and charcuterie for years. [So I got a job at the cheese shop](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4OWp-BjcwV/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) as a monger and fell in love with it almost immediately. Teaching people about something I find so fascinating refueled me. I got back to my regular yoga practice--less vigorous, but still present. With the help of two very dear people, I finally got back to strength training, [started mace swinging](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4EO0E6DKnh/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and kettlebell training and now after 2 months, I'm hitting personal bests that I couldn't reach \*before\* I had RA. [On Tuesday, I did a 210# squat,](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4OAxIGjTH_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) smooth and pain-free.

But everything is temporary and there are no guarantees. I still have flares, and sometimes I still walk with a cane for a few days at a time. So I do my weight lifting seated and work presses, curls, extensions...etc. I pivot again and again and again. This disease has taught me to adapt more than anything else ever has. [I am grateful for every day my heart beats](https://www.instagram.com/p/B27e7rSjttV/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and every day I can simply get out of bed and be on my feet for an 8 hour shift. And alcohol has no place in that life. There is nothing it can offer me that will improve my situation--all it would do is take my memory, my autonomy, my strength, and my freedom. And I am not willing to give any of that away.

I will live every day. I will not be a hostage to this disease, no matter what it throws my way. And I'll be present and sober for every second. 

Thank you, SD. I'm fairly quiet on here, but I'm always reading, and I'm always grateful for the vulnerability and strength you are all so willing to offer. It has kept me going through some dark moments, and I'm so glad that this community exists. You are all tops, no matter where you are on the path.",291

We arrived at their house and I made it through a home bar taking up a 2’x3’ space on a hallway counter, around the corner from anyone seeing. I made it through sleeping off the red eye in sister-in-law’s room with her own personal liquor stash topping the dresser and box of beer next to it. 

That night I made it through an open bar at rehearsal dinner, including an aunt offering me red wine while I caught a whiff of hers. 

Next day made it through open bar at the wedding, with a server walking around pouring champagne for the toast. 

Next morning made it through a boozy family brunch where the waitress messed up, brought an extra mimosa, and set it down in front of me (as the only person out of a dozen without a drink order.)

Made it through spending the afternoon hanging out at in-law’s house with hubs, sister-in-law, and new groom all with a drink in their hand. Made it through some mild family squabbling. Made it through groom finding out a friend committed suicide, getting shitfaced, being a hot mess and then breaking down crying before we all went to bed.

I’m 23 days without a drink and for the first Friday since quitting I’ve not even considered walking to the store for beer.

Friday nights was always beer night. So was Saturday and usually Sunday and sometimes Monday. But Friday. Friday was ALWAYS an excuse to drink. Even if I was unwell with a cold and felt really crap, I’d still drink loads of beer.

I was eating dinner with my son earlier and it dawned on me - this is the best I’ve felt in years. And it will only get better I hope.

If there is anyone on the fence about quitting and is reading this, I’ve given it a try and there’s no going back now - everything is DEFINITELY better without alcohol. Your problems will still be there, sure. But I handle life’s issues far more easily now. There’s so much more to life than consuming pointless alcohol because when you think about it, drinking booze IS pointless. It has to end somewhere and afterwards we usually feel like crap.

So yeah, life’s better without it. Just thought I’d share this as I haven’t checked in here for a long time.

My skin is clear and feels hydrated. When I was drinking I was red, dry and itchy with rough patches.

I can sleep normally! Waking up and not feeling like death is also a plus.

The only thing I don’t recommend from all this. Taking a shot of apple cider vinegar. The sensation was similar to a shot of whiskey. So if you’re giving up alcohol and going hard at being healthy I don’t recommend that bit.

I have a thing with pubic spaces, big groups, lots of noise and commotion. It has set me into a very very dark place for the last year (trauma related).

I took my daughter to the very noisy and busy mall to trick or treat, then walked through town a bit, then we went out to eat with my family (which I was not expecting. Busy restaurants give me panic attacks). Even ran into an old friends husband, the friend related to the trauma. My sister was supposed to come over after, but I told her she couldn't have any alcohol so she went home to drink with my aunt.

And then I came home. Laid my overly tired girl down to bed, and ate ice cream watching Grey's anatomy. It took me hours to relax enough to try to sleep, but I did it sober. I got through the easiest of the shitty holidays at this time of year. Now I work all weekend so will have another 3 sober days, easy.

I've been feeling sad and also a bit angry about not being able to drink like a ""normal"" person. I don't know.

I've mentioned on a previous post that im at uni and everyone always wants to go out drinking all the time. that was about 2 weeks ago, and I think my drinking has gotten worse. I've missed a lot of lectures, I havent done any actual uni work since my first week at the end of september, I've lost friends because of my alcohol consumption and I'm going broke from spending all my money on alcohol. I'm starting to think that yeah, this is actually a big problem. nobody else seems to see I have a problem, everyone thinks drinking heavily is just part of uni but my alcohol consumption is a lot worse than some of my friends and family realise. and even if I did tell them that I think I have an alcohol problem, they'd probably just say that I'm just drinking a lot because im at uni.

I dont want to drink any more, I want to actually do my degree because it's something I'm really passionate about but it's so hard to quit drinking in this kind of environment. 

on a positive note, I recently got rid of a shit ton of free drinks vouchers that I got at a freshers fair - I gave them to one of my flatmates, and I also have no more alcohol in my room. 

my main question is how the hell do you stop drinking? my entire facebook/Instagram/snapchat is full of people from my uni, college and high school going out drinking and having a good time. I do have fun sometimes when I go out drinking but honestly I barely even go out. most of my drinking is done in my room and then maybe I'll make last minute decisions to go out with a friend.

 I dont know where to start!! how do I stop!!!

TLDR: my alcohol problem is affecting a lot of my life but everyone thinks its normal because I'm at uni. I dont know how to stop drinking.",1

One year later, I celebrated with ordering not one but two of my favorite dessert for delivery.

To save on packaging, I said in the special instructions that it was just for one person so they can put the things in one container if it works out and why.

When it was delivered, it looks like everyone that was working that night signed it saying how big of a deal 1 year sober is. It was just so much love, I kept it and put it on my dresser mirror so I can always look at it and have support. (I don’t have a family anymore since being sober and all my friends at the time were alcoholics so once I stopped drinking, I either had to leave them or they left me cuz I couldn’t ‘hang’ anymore)

I was just looking at the note this morning whilst getting ready for my run (which I never would be preparing for a year ago).

I’m just really excited for another year.

Clients can be brutal and I can be brutal on myself.

There is a serious lack of joy and I am fighting to get it back without any substance. I have had it before. I have been sober for a year. I can do it but it hurts right now.

I want to be sober, happy, and able to help others again. I tried so hard to give kids a happy halloween and make their parents happy too yesterday night. I fell asleep midway through and my wife finished up the night. I only slept a few hours Wednesday. I have been told I have a big heart and I want to share it... but it is somewhat selfish. I do not believe in true altruism and do this partially because I want my joy back. So I try these things to make it better. If I can give others joy maybe I will be joyful again.

Can anyone help me make sense of all of this? I know it is like a stream of consciousness and did not do much editing... I do not know what I need. I am hurting and only a few weeks back into sobriety.

Some old fears came out and I was completely in my head whole day. 

Yesterday I wanted to get totally fucked, go into oblivion. I spoke to my wife , we were laughing it off and I was telling her how much I would want to get drunk/ use drugs. We even roleplayed me being drunk and it was to mock it. We then watched documentaries about addiction and it really helped.

Today the feeling still persist, I am having real struggle to explain to myself why doing drugs or drinking is a bad idea. I was even thinking that maybe I could just take drugs that I am not addicted to instead of drinking; give myself a reward for staying sober so long. 

Weather outside is cold, I am out of shape and unmotivated to do anything. Nothing brings instant joy. I am fantasising about getting super high on something. It's strange that it happens on day 17 , I thought worse is behind me.

Look motherfucker, are you kidding me? Are you thinking of drinking again? A little bit won’t matter? Yeah. You said that to yourself, and it worked before. You were functioning. This year something changed. You started bending for whole weekends, and had a withdrawal that lasted a day. That sucked. You should have stopped then, and said you were going to. 

Then your gf’s parents got to town, and you decided that a five day bender would be a good idea. You didn’t even do it for a reason. It wasn’t a craving. You just weren’t at her place.  It wasn’t a desire. You had homework that you complain that your gf keeps you from when you’re always together....but the thing to do was to go to your own apartment, and drink. A lot. Because you could. What the fuck, dude. 3 liquor bottles, multiple bottles of wine, and 5 days later, the withdrawal started. All things considered it was “mild” but you terrified yourself reading what it could become. Thankfully, the community was your rock during this period. At the same time, you got a shitload of work done on your paper, and you are finally enjoying food again..even through these shit symptoms there has been good.

Are you going to undo that? I sit here, on day three, every time I try to sleep I have a nightmare and sweats. I want to sleep because our body needs it, and I can’t. I’m worried sick about exams and whether or not I’ll still have symptoms next month. All of this happened...and you’re thinking of a beer? Probably for all the same reasons as before...”why not?” It’s a fun thing to do. It’s not. This fucking sucks dude. I do not want us to go through this again. Please do not do this to me. You know from speaking to everyone that this can be much worse. Someone from the chat told us: you don’t need to dig to China to know what the bottom is. I’m hoping our number of days sober keep rising. Don’t drink dude.

Sincerely,

Your very sleep deprived self who went through a day of anxiety, shakes, and sweats, and now this inability to sleep. It could be worse. Remember that. And currently, this is the worst and best I’ve felt in my life. To continue with the latter is to not pick up a drink.",5

Another successful day! Made it to my bed without a drink and am so very thankful. I was at my girlfriends for a Halloween dinner with her parents. Nothing crazy going on there, wine was present, but that’s never been an issue for me especially around her parents however..

On my way home from her place I started to get that ‘urge/craving’ that “ if I just stop and get just a couple shooters to get buzzed on and watch Netflix then that will be a great end to the evening.”  I started to have that bargaining with myself that usually doesn’t end up good. 

You have to understand something I have found very difficult in getting sober and that’s that there is a liquor store that literally shares the same parking lot with my apartment. It’s that close so very convenient for me to get liquor without even a minute of thinking about it handling my craving because it takes 30 seconds to walk there. Pretty damn tough. 

As I’m pulling in the parking lot I realize it’s 9:55pm and the store closes at 10pm. Perfect timing to grab something right?!? I said a prayer to my lord as I parked and went straight into my apartment. Before I knew it the urge had left me and it is now 10:30pm and the store is closed.  This was a big victory for me. I know it may not sound like much to some, but I was very proud. Another one in the books!

My question is, does giving up alcohol spur hair growth, or should I seek out another reason for this (apparent) regrowth of my hair?",6
